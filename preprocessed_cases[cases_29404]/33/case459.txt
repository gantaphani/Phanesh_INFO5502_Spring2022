this employment discrimination case,brought by dena palmer against a prospective employer,pioneer inn associates,involves the intersection of evidentiary and ethical issues.it returns to us after the nevada supreme court resolved our certified question regarding the scope of acceptable ex parte contacts between an attorney and an employee of a represented party.we take up three issues on appeal whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment for pioneer with respect to two of palmer three claims on the ground that she did not satisfy the test for prima facie discrimination set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d whether,in light of the nevada supreme court answer to our certified question,the district court erred in excluding an affidavit from one of pioneer employees as a sanction for ex parte contact between palmer attorney and the employee and whether the district court abused its discretion in barring testimony at trial about the two dismissed claims.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and its exclusion of the employee affidavit and remand for trial.
factual and procedural background 
this factual background is taken from the affidavits and other evidence presented in connection with the summary judgment motion.because we do not reach any issue regarding trial evidence,it is unnecessary to address the evidence presented at trial.with respect to the appeal from a grant of summary judgment in pioneer favor,we review the facts in the light most favorable to palmer,the nonmoving party.they are as follows on january,palmer contacted greg zamora,pioneer food and beverage director,and inquired about job openings at pioneer.she was six months pregnant at the time.he told her that job openings existed and that she should file an application with pioneer personnel director,julie gonzalez.on january,palmer filed an application and had a screening interview with gonzalez.on her application,palmer indicated that she was interested in coffee shop or deli server positions,and that she was available to work monday through friday from to,and also would be working from to on those days at the olive garden restaurant.the next day,she called zamora,who told that her that her application had been approved and that a deli position might be open.she agreed to accept this position.zamora contacted her the following day and told her that he would like her to work six days a week as a floater waitress in all three pioneer restaurants,an offer that palmer accepted.zamora told her to start orientation the following tuesday.on sunday,january,palmer quit her job at the olive garden.
before her orientation at pioneer was to begin,zamora contacted palmer again,this time to tell her that he needed a supervisor and believed she was qualified for the position.they met to discuss the position,and zamora introduced her to several other employees.he asked her to begin work on monday,february.when she arrived that afternoon,he introduced her to the other employees but informed her that his supervisor,guy archer,had overturned palmer hiring due to her pregnancy.zamora assured her that he would talk to archer on her behalf.palmer testified that when she next spoke with zamora,approximately a week and a half later,he told her that archer was just not going to allow him to have me work there being pregnant and that he would definitely not allow me to be a waitress because i was pregnant.
soon thereafter,palmer notified pioneer of her intent to file suit.palmer received a right to sue letter from the equal employment opportunity commission,and filed suit in july,charging unlawful termination under title vii of the civil rights act of and related state law violations.
pioneer moved to disqualify palmer counsel on the basis of ex parte contacts with four pioneer employees.three of those contacts are not at issue in this appeal.the remaining contact involved communication between palmer attorney and george kapetanakis,an executive sous chef at pioneer.in april,kapetanakis had contacted palmer attorney after speaking with one of palmer friends.kapetanakis then signed an affidavit stating during the month of january,i witnesses sic greg zamora interviewing palmer i inquired of zamora whether he intended to hire her at which time zamora told me that he had already hired her.the district court found that kapetanakis was a supervisor with responsibility for interviewing and hiring cooks,dishwashers,and sous chefs.the court concluded that b ecause his job responsibilities included hiring employees,kapetanakis was in a position to make statements concerning the hiring policies of pioneer.palmer pioneer hotel casino,d,palmer i.the court accordingly held that counsel contact with kapetanakis constituted ex parte contact with a represented party and sanctioned palmer attorney by fining him and excluding the kapetanakis affidavit.
pioneer moved for summary judgment on all claims.the court concluded that because palmer did not present evidence that the day shift waitress and supervisor positions remained open after she was rejected,and because pioneer presented evidence that it did not continue to advertise for those positions,palmer failed to satisfy the fourth prong of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie test for discrimination.the court granted summary judgment on those two claims.the remaining claim,which related to the deli server position,went to trial.on a motion in limine by pioneer,the district court barred testimony regarding the supervisor and day shift waitress positions,but allowed testimony and about the content of the meetings and conversations in which the jobs were discussed.the jury found for pioneer,and this appeal followed.

we review de novo the grant of summary judgment in favor of pioneer.weiner san diego county,cir.palmer presented sufficient direct evidence to survive summary judgment on all three of her employment claims.see godwin hunt wesson,cir direct evidence is evidence which,if believed,proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption.alteration in original quoting davis chevron,cir.palmer claimed that she was offered positions as a deli worker,a waitress,and a supervisor.she then stated that zamora told her that guy archer has overturned hiring you because you pregnant,and later told me that guy archer was just not going to allow him to have me work there being pregnant and that he would definitely not allow me to be a waitress because i was pregnant.viewing the testimony in her affidavit in the light most favorable to palmer as the nonmoving party,her testimony provides direct evidence sufficient to raise a material question of disputed fact as to whether pioneer discriminated against her.the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment on the day shift waitress and supervisor positions.
we next consider the district court sanctioning of palmer attorney for ex parte communication with kapetanakis.although we review the imposition of discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion,fair hous.of marin combs,cir,cert.denied,d,here the sanctions issue stems from resolution of a legal issue that we necessarily review de novo,see el pollo loco,hashim,cir.
the court excluded kapetanakis affidavit and assessed fees and costs against the attorney in the amount of.the district court reached its decision by reference to aba model rule,adopted as nevada supreme court rule which states 
in representing a client,a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.
the commentary to model rule explained that,in an organizational context,a party included a person who had managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.model rules of prof l conduct,cmt.
the district court determined that b ecause his job responsibilities included hiring employees,kapetanakis was in a position to make statements concerning the hiring policies of pioneer.palmer i,d at.the court therefore concluded that palmer attorney was prohibited from having ex parte contact with kapetanakis because kapetanakis statement fell under the admission exception to the hearsay rule and his ability to make binding admissions on the part of pioneer placed him squarely within category three of the comment test.id.
at the outset of this appeal,we were faced with the district court interpretation of the third prong of comment statements that may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.because neither the ninth circuit nor the nevada supreme court had published an opinion applying or explaining this comment,we certified the issue to the nevada supreme court.the nevada supreme court accepted our certification request and recast our question as follows 
what test does nevada use in applying supreme court rule to an employee of a represented organization 
palmer pioneer inn,per curiam palmer ii.
in,after the district court decision and after our certification order,model rule and its commentary were amended.the rule itself was changed only minimally.under the old rule,contact was permitted by consent of the other lawyer or as authorized by law.in practice,contact was also authorized via court order,and the amendment incorporated this concept through addition of the phrase or court order at the end of the rule.the new rule reads 
in representing a client,a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.
model rules of prof l conduct emphasis added.
unlike the rule,the comment was revised substantially,and now reads in relevant part 
in the case of a represented organization,this rule prohibits communications with a constituent of the organization,who supervises,directs or regularly consults with the organization lawyer concerning the matter or has authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter or whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability.
in its opinion on the certified question,the nevada supreme court noted that,according to the reporter explanation of changes in the ethics commission report,the admission clause was deleted because it had been misapplied to situations when an employee statement could be admissible against the organizational employer,when in fact the clause had been intended only to encompass those few jurisdictions with a law of evidence providing that statements by certain employees of an organization were not only admissible against the organization but could not thereafter be controverted by the organization.palmer ii,at.the reporter explanation therefore suggests that the rule was intended to apply more narrowly than the original comment suggested.it was precisely this admission aspect of the comment that guided the district court decision.
ultimately,however,the nevada supreme court did not embrace either the former or the revised comment the revisions to the comment thus do not control this case after all and,as the nevada supreme court observed,the former comment was never binding on nevada lawyers,and so retroactivity is not a concern.id.
after confirming that t he primary purpose of rule is to protect the relationship from intrusion by opposing counsel,id.at,the nevada supreme court explained that 
t he rule protections undisputedly extend to organizational parties,who must act through their directors and employees.accordingly,at least some of the organization agents must be viewed as the equivalent of a party for the rule to have any effect.a conflict between policies arises,however.on one hand,the rule protective purposes are best served by defining this pool of agents broadly.on the other hand,defining the pool more narrowly fosters the use of informal discovery methods the question then becomes how to apply the rule in a way that best balances the competing policies.
id.at footnotes omitted.
in light of that mandate,the court reviewed the various tests for determining which employees fell within the scope of the rule and rejected,among others,the admission test relied upon by the district court below.id.at.the opinion provides a thoughtful and extensive survey of the various tests and the competing policy considerations.the court ultimately adopted the agent test,as laid out by the washington supreme court in wright group health hospital 
t he best interpretation of party in litigation involving corporations is only those employees who have the legal authority to bind the corporation in a legal evidentiary sense,those employees who have speaking authority for the corporation it is not the purpose of the rule to protect a corporate party from the revelation of prejudicial facts.rather,the rule function is to preclude the interviewing of those corporate employees who have the authority to bind the corporation.
e mployees should be considered parties for the purposes of the disciplinary rule if,under applicable state law,they have managing authority sufficient to give them the right to speak for,and bind,the corporation.
palmer ii,at quoting wright,citations omitted.the nevada supreme court also clarified that 
an employee for whom counsel has not been retained does not become a represented party simply because his or her conduct may be imputed to the organization while any confidential communications between such an employee and the organization counsel would be protected by the privilege,the facts within that employee knowledge are generally not protected from revelation through ex parte interviews by opposing counsel.
the nevada supreme court enunciation of the applicable test for contact with a represented party dramatically changes the landscape of our case.understandably,the district court analysis was based on a comment to model rule.we now know,however,that nevada rejects both the old and the new comments.under the test enunciated by the nevada supreme court,palmer counsel was barred from ex parte communication with kapetanakis only if kapetanakis had managing authority sufficient to give him the right to speak for,and bind,pioneer under nevada law.
pioneer has not alleged sufficient facts to show that kapetanakis had speaking authority for pioneer such that his statements would bind the organization in the context of this case.as the district court concluded,there is no indication,either explicit or implicit,that pioneer had authorized kapetanakis to make statements concerning the hiring of individuals by other pioneer employees,and there is no allegation that kapetanakis played any part in the employment decision affecting plaintiff
