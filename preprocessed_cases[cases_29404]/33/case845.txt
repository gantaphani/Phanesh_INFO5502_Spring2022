in these consolidated appeals we consider whether counsel who associate to concurrently represent clients owe each other a fiduciary duty,or only owe a duty of loyalty to the clients.in a related matter,we consider whether such counsel can be considered to have entered into a joint venture,allowing one to seek indemnity from the other under the uniform partnership act.the trial court answered each of these questions in the negative,and granted summary judgment motions for the defendants in each action.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in michael and robert stephens hired attorney daniel beck to represent them in a lawsuit against general motors,to recover for serious injuries the stephenses sustained when the truck they were riding in rolled over and burst into flames.with the stephenses consent,beck associated texas attorney mcbee into the case,because mcbee had experience prosecuting what was known as gas tank cases against general motors.again with agreement of the clients,mcbee and beck associated attorney ronald wecht and his law firm,walkup,melodia,kelly escheverria collectively wecht,as local trial counsel.by separate written agreements,it was agreed that mcbee would advance all costs,and beck contingent fee would be split percent for mcbee and percent for beck.wecht was to receive percent of the contingent fee,to be shared pro rata from the shares of mcbee and beck.
despite attempts at pretrial settlement,no settlement was reached,and the case proceeded to jury trial in april.during the course of the trial,general motors offered to settle the case for million.on the night before closing arguments,the stephenses met with wecht and mcbee and told them they wanted to settle the case.mcbee was to contact general motors and discuss settlement,but never did so.in late june of,the jury returned a defense verdict.
in the months leading up to trial,the relationship between beck and the other attorneys,particularly mcbee,eroded.mcbee accused beck of undermining settlement negotiations,and beck accused mcbee of alienating him from his clients.by the time of trial beck was an observer,not a participant.
after trial,the stephenses brought a legal malpractice action against mcbee and wecht for failing to carry out their settlement instructions.in addition,they claimed that wecht was vicariously liable for mcbee misconduct based upon joint venture principles.the stephenses brought no action against beck.mcbee settled with the stephenses for a confidential sum.as a condition of settlement,beck was paid out of this sum,in exchange for a release of his claims against mcbee.thereafter,wecht admitted that mcbee was negligent in his handling of the stephenses case.although wecht denied that a joint venture existed,his malpractice insurance carrier,american equity insurance company american equity paid million to settle the stephenses claims against wecht.
in december,beck filed a complaint against wecht for breach of fiduciary duty to recover the fee he would have received had mcbee and wecht followed the stephenses instructions and settled the case against general motors for million.in july,wecht filed a for indemnity,breach of fiduciary duty,comparative fault and breach of contract.thereafter,american equity intervened and sued beck in subrogation,seeking contribution from beck toward the settlement amount it paid on wecht behalf.each party successfully moved for summary judgment of the other claims.both parties timely appealed from the orders granting summary judgment,and we have consolidated the appeals for oral argument and decision.
standard of review 
in reviewing a trial court order granting summary judgment,we are limited to the facts shown in the supporting and opposing affidavits and declarations,as well as those in admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice may be taken.because of strong public policy favoring a trial on the merits,we are bound by the same principles governing the trial court determination on summary judgment.we therefore strictly construe the moving party papers and liberally construe the opposing party papers.all doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion.aarts productions,crocker national bank d.code civ,subd.b.while we review a summary judgment ruling under the same general principles applicable to the trial court,we do so de novo,independently determining whether,under the facts as presented,there exists a triable issue of material fact.buss superior court cal th,d,saldana systems d.upon our independent review,we may affirm a summary judgment for reasons different from the trial court reasons for granting it.bunnell department of corrections th,d.
in moving for summary judgment,the defendant has the initial burden of showing that,as to each cause of action alleged in the complaint,the plaintiff can not establish one or more of the elements of the cause of action.code civ,subd.o.if such a showing is made,the burden shifts to the plaintiff,who must respond by presenting admissible evidence in the form of specific facts that create a triable issue of material fact as to the attacked element.ibid.summary judgment is warranted if no triable issue is established,subd.c.
beck appeal no.
wecht moved for summary judgment on beck complaint for breach of fiduciary duty,in which beck sought to recover the contingent fee he claimed to have lost as a result of wecht inappropriate handling of the stephenses action.the trial court granted summary judgment,finding that,as a matter of law,wecht owed beck no fiduciary duty.we agree.
two cases have squarely addressed the question of the duties owed by one attorney to another attorney jointly representing the same client.the trial court initially relied on the first of these cases,pollack lytle d.pollack,and overruled wecht demurrer to beck claim of breach of fiduciary duty on the ground that such a cause of action could be stated.subsequently,the second case,joseph saunders,weissburg aronson th,d saunders was published.saunders held that no such duty could exist between cocounsel.relying on saunders,the trial court granted wecht motion for summary judgment.we consider each case,and conclude that saunders rests upon sounder policy considerations than does pollack.accordingly,we agree with the trial court conclusion that beck presented no triable issue of any material fact,and properly granted summary judgment in favor of wecht.
pollack lytle 
in pollack,attorney pollack sued attorney lytle for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,breach of contract,legal malpractice and declaratory relief arising out of their joint representation of a client in a medical malpractice action.pollack alleged in his complaint that he and the client had agreed that he would be paid percent of any recovery obtained by the client.relying on lytle false representations,pollack associated lytle as trial counsel,and agreed that he would receive of pollack percent contingent fee.unbeknownst to pollack,lytle did not properly prepare the case for trial.because of lytle continued misrepresentations,pollack advised the client to reject a pretrial settlement offer.the case went to trial,and due to lytle improper handling of the case,the jury returned a defense verdict in the medical malpractice action.adding insult to injury,lytle convinced the client to sue pollack for legal malpractice.pollack,supra,d at.
the court of appeal,over a strongly worded dissent,reversed the trial court order sustaining lytle demurrer,holding that simple agency principles governed the relationship of associate counsel.pollack,supra,d at.although it acknowledged the growing body of law which holds,as a matter of public policy,that a successor attorney owes no duty to his predecessor citations id.at,the majority found the policy rationale of these cases inapplicable to cases involving associate,or concurrent counsel.it reasoned the roles of successor and associate attorneys are decidedly different.in the fulfillment of his duty of undivided loyalty to the client,a successor attorney must view the client situation as of the moment when he is engaged.hence public policy requires that he not be subjected to any possible conflict of interest which may deter him from determining the best interests of the client by the possibility that he may be held liable for his acts by his predecessor.citation.in contrast,an associate attorney acting as the agent of the principal attorney replaces no one,but acts at the behest of his principal.admittedly,he remains bound to act in the best interests of the client,but this creates no unavoidable conflict for he can make a full disclosure to the principal who,acting in the client best interest,will prompt the principal attorney to act in protection of those interests.however,should the principal attorney choose to ignore the client interests,the remains free to terminate the agency relationship and withdraw as associate counsel.ibid.
justice johnson dissented from the majority on the ground that no rational distinction could be made between the duties running to successor attorneys and those running to cocounsel.he wrote there is a substantial body of law concerning the liability of attorneys who sue each other in connection with common clients.a fiduciary relationship has not heretofore been recognized,and,regardless of legal theory asserted,there has emerged a recurring theme a client right to the undivided loyalty of his or her attorneys must be protected,even when the result of such rule is the denial of an attorney cause of action against another attorney.pollack,supra,d at.dis.opn.of johnson.
as justice johnson observed,in terms of mason public policy rationale,i see no logical distinction that should be based on litigants status as cocounsel as opposed to successor counsel t he mason court relied heavily on the premise that the practice of law remains a profession rather than a business,and that the client interests must be protected from even the possibility of less than total devotion to his interests by the attorney of his choice.pollack,supra,d at,fn.omitted dis.opn.of johnson,citing mason levy van bourg d.mason.thus,in his opinion,in balancing the interests of attorneys in protecting their fees and the public policy of protecting clients rights to receive the undivided loyalty of all counsel who represent them,the wiser course is to reject the recognition of a fiduciary duty between cocounsel.pollack,supra,at.
saunders weissburg aronson 
in saunders,attorneys saunders and weissburg jointly represented a large group of hospitals on a contingency basis in their litigation against medicare.the case settled and saunders received his contractually agreed upon contingency fee.thereafter,saunders sued weissburg,claiming that he had made misrepresentations to saunders and the group hospitals in order to sway them to accept a detrimental settlement,resulting in a higher recovery by individual hospitals not subject to the contingency fee agreement between saunders and weissburg.thus,claiming that weissburg breached certain duties owed to cocounsel pursuant to a joint venture agreement between them,saunders sought to obtain from weissburg the contingency fee he would had received if the group hospitals had not settled for less than they should have.the trial court granted summary judgment for weissburg.saunders,supra,th at,d.
in affirming the judgment,the court of appeal looked to the rationale expressed in mason,supra,a case rejecting the existence of a duty owed by a successor attorney to a predecessor,and to the dissent in pollack,supra.in mason,the defendants were substituted in as attorneys of record in place of the plaintiff in two pending lawsuits.by contract,the plaintiff was to receive a percentage of the contingency fee the client had agreed to pay.despite offers of settlement,the defendants failed to settle the cases or to prosecute them diligently,resulting in a loss to plaintiff of the agreed upon percentage of any contingency fee.the plaintiff sued the defendants,claiming that they had an obligation to use reasonable diligence to bring the client cases to settlement or trial.mason,supra,d at.
the court in mason declined to impose such an obligation.it explained it is fundamental to the relationship that an attorney have an undivided loyalty to his clients.citation.this loyalty should not be diluted by a duty owed to some other person,such as an earlier attorney.while,as a practical matter,both the client and the former attorney stand to benefit from any recovery in the client action,their interests are not identical if the law were to recognize duties,such as are suggested here,between successive attorneys representing the same client,a multitude of litigation could be spawned with an attendant adverse impact on relationships.every lawyer could blame his problems in a lawsuit on his predecessors.every lawyer referring a case to another lawyer would be in a position to claim that the negligence of the second lawyer caused a meritorious claim to be lost or settled for an insufficient amount.public confidence in the legal system may be eroded by the spectacle of lawyers squabbling over the of a concluded lawsuit,even when the client has indicated no dissatisfaction with the outcome.fn.omitted.considerations of public policy support the conclusion that an attorney duty of undivided loyalty to his client should not be diluted by imposing upon him obligations to the client former attorney,or at least obligations greater than the client himself owed to the former attorney.mason,supra,d at.
following the reasoning in mason,and rejecting the majority view in pollack,the court in saunders concluded that recognizing a duty on the part of cocounsel would be inconsistent with counsel duty to exercise independent judgment on behalf of the client.saunders,supra,th at,d.it rejected saunders assertion that weissburg faced no conflict because his duty to the clients was identical to saunders duty to them.noting the clients apparent satisfaction with weissburg representation,and saunders dissatisfaction with same,the court held that the recognition of a duty on the part of weissburg to cocounsel was in potential conflict with his duty of loyalty to the clients.and,it observed that the spectacle of lawyers squabbling over the of a concluded lawsuit envisioned by the mason court mason,supra,d at.had,in fact,come to pass saunders,supra,th at,d.
we,too,are convinced that the policy reasons expressed in mason are valid in the cocounsel context presented here.as happened in saunders,cocounsel beck dissatisfaction with the handling of the stephenses case by wecht and mcbee points up the myriad conflicts that may arise among attorneys representing the same clients,and the resulting inability to consider only the clients best interests.to avoid any detriment to the jointly represented client,it is imperative that no collateral duties arise to interfere with the duty of undivided loyalty and total devotion owed to the client.saunders,supra,th at,d.thus,the trial court correctly granted summary judgment for wecht,because,as a matter of law,he owed no fiduciary duty to beck.
american equity appeal no.
standing in the shoes of its insured,american equity brought a claim in intervention against beck,seeking contribution from beck under the uniform partnership act of,et american equity claimed that under joint venture principles beck was liable to it for a share of the settlement it had paid to the stephenses on wecht behalf.the trial court granted summary judgment for beck on the ground that,just as wecht owed beck no fiduciary duty as cocounsel,beck owed wecht no such duty.therefore,it held that american equity claim for contribution under statutory partnership principles failed as a matter of law.
american equity seeks to characterize the relationship of beck,wecht and mcbee as arising out of a joint venture.thus,it claims it is entitled to recover from beck wecht pro rata share of the joint venture losses.we are not persuaded for several reasons.first,it is beyond dispute that joint venturers are in a fiduciary relationship to one another,with corresponding fiduciary duties.as discussed above in connection with beck appeal,sound policy reasons
