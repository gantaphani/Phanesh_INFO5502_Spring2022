legal aid services of oregon laso,oregon law center olc,individual laso and olc attorneys and board members,and organizations representing laso clients and private donors collectively plaintiffs,present a attack on the restrictions and pir.first,they contend that the supreme court decision in legal serv.velazquez,d velazquez iii superseded lash iii,and that under velazquez iii,the restrictions must be struck down as facially violative of the first amendment.next,they contend that,even if lash iii remains good law,lsc has applied the pir to them in a manner that cuts off alternative avenues for engaging in protected speech.

background and proceedings 
lsc and the restrictions 
in congress enacted the legal services corporation act the act,stat.codified as amended at,establishing lsc as an independent nonprofit corporation.lsc mission is to distribute congressionally appropriated funds to qualifying organizations for the purpose of providing financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.a.
congress has restricted the activities of lsc grantees since the grant program inception,and the scope of those restrictions has expanded over time.the act,for example,provided that lsc funds could not be used to provide legal assistance in school desegregation cases,cases in which a client seeks to procure an abortion or compel an institution to provide an abortion,military desertion cases,any case,and collateral attacks on criminal convictions.id.b.further,every year between and,congress included an appropriations rider in its annual spending bill purport ing to eliminate legislative lobbying and administrative advocacy among lsc grantees.at.
in,responding to concerns that lsc had strayed from its core mission of fund ing basic legal services for poor individuals,id.at,congress imposed new restrictions on the activities of lsc grantees.see omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat,the act,reenacted in the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of,stat.the act enacted,and subsequent lsc regulations implemented,restrictions on attempts to influence legislation administrative rulemaking processes,et initiation of,and participation in,class action lawsuits,id.et claiming,collecting or retaining attorneys fees available under any federal or state law,id.et and soliciting clients,id.et the restrictions apply to all of the activities of an lsc grantee,including those paid for by funds.
ii.pir and the lash litigation 
in,in response to a federal district court injunction declaring several of the act restrictions facially unconstitutional insofar as they applied to lsc grantees nonfederally funded activities,see legal aid soc y of haw.legal serv,lash i,lsc promulgated the pir to clarify the circumstances under which a grantee could affiliate with an organization that engages in restricted activities see.the pir provides that 
a a n lsc grant recipient must have objective integrity and independence from any organization that engages in restricted activities.
a recipient will be found to have objective integrity and independence from such an organization if 
the other organization is a legally separate entity 
the other organization receives no transfer of lsc funds,and lsc funds do not subsidize restricted activities and 
the recipient is physically and financially separate from the other organization.mere bookkeeping separation of lsc funds from other funds is not sufficient.whether sufficient physical and financial separation exists will be determined on a basis and will be based on the totality of the facts.the presence or absence of any one or more factors will not be determinative.factors relevant to this determination shall include but will not be limited to 
i the existence of separate personnel 
ii the existence of separate accounting and timekeeping records 
iii the degree of separation from facilities in which restricted activities occur,and the extent of such restricted activities and 
iv the extent to which signs and other forms of identification which distinguish the recipient from the organization are present.
b each recipient governing body must certify to lsc within days of the effective date of this part that the recipient is in compliance with the requirements of this section.thereafter,the recipient governing body must certify such compliance to lsc on an annual basis.
lsc drafted the pir to mirror the program integrity regulations associated with federal grants provided under title x of the public health service act regulations that withstood first amendment scrutiny in rust sullivan,d.see velazquez ii,at citing.the restrictions at issue in rust prohibited title x grantees from providing counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning,or engaging in any lobbying effort or legal action aimed at encouraging abortion.see rust,at.a grantee affiliate could engage in restricted activities,but only if the grantee and affiliate ensured legal,physical,and financial separation.see id.at.
the rust court rejected the title x grantees and doctors who worked for those grantees claim that the restrictions amounted to an unconstitutional condition.to prevail on such a claim,the court explained,a recipient of a federal subsidy must show that it has been effectively prohibit ed from engaging in protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program.id.at.because grantees were free to engage in restricted activities through a legally separate affiliate,the court determined that they had failed to establish an unconstitutional condition.the court also concluded that the challenged restrictions did not amount to impermissible viewpoint discrimination,because congress had not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint it merely chose to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.id.at.
after the issuance of the pir,the lash i district court dissolved its injunction and entered summary judgment in favor of lsc.legal aid soc y of haw.legal serv.
we affirmed the judgment of the district court,concluding that the restrictions and pir satisfy the standards set forth in rust.see lash iii,at.because the pir did not force lsc grantees to give up prohibited activities,but rather allowed them to engage in those activities so long as they were carried out through separate and independent entities,we concluded that,under rust,the restrictions were constitutional on their face.see id.at.we rejected the lash iii plaintiffs contention that the practical burdens associated with channeling restricted activities through separate affiliates amounted to an impermissible burden on the exercise of their free speech rights,but left open the possibility that they could challenge lsc application of the pir in a subsequent action.id.at.
iii.velazquez 
in,legal aid organizations in new york,together with individual legal aid attorneys,clients,and donors,brought an action challenging several of the act funding restrictions see velazquez legal serv.velazquez i.the velazquez plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction declaring,in relevant part,that the challenged restrictions were facially violative of the first amendment.id.at.the district court denied the preliminary injunction motion,reasoning that the pir was in all relevant respects identical to the program integrity regulations upheld in rust thus,that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim.id.at.
the second circuit affirmed in part,and reversed in part.it agreed with the district court that,as a facial matter,the pir provided lsc grantees with adequate alternative channels for engaging in protected expression,and thus there was no unconstitutional conditions violation.see velazquez ii,at.the court concluded,however,that one of the challenged exception ran afoul of the first amendment.see id.at.the exception provided that an lsc grantee could represent an eligible client seeking specific relief from a welfare agency,but only if the grantee refrained from challenging the validity of the underlying statutes and regulations.id.at.because it permitted funding for legal actions that accepted the validity of existing welfare laws,but denied it with respect to those that challenged the status quo,the velazquez ii court concluded that the exception was viewpoint discrimination subject to strict first amendment scrutiny.id.at.
the supreme court granted the lsc certiorari petition,but declined to review the second circuit judgment insofar as it upheld the other substantive restrictions,d mem.denying the velazquez plaintiffs petition for certiorari.the supreme a decision that we discuss at length with the second circuit that the exception was unconstitutional.velazquez iii,at.
the litigation then returned to the district court where the velazquez plaintiffs pursued both an challenge to the pir,and a facial challenge to the class action,attorneys fees,and solicitation restrictions.velazquez legal serv,d velazquez iv.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs facial challenge,but granted their application for a preliminary injunction on the challenge to the pir,concluding that lsc enforcement of the pir unduly burden ed the plaintiffs ability to use funds to engage in restricted activities.id.at.
the second circuit affirmed in part,reversed in part,and vacated the district court injunction.brooklyn legal serv.legal serv,cir velazquez v.the court agreed that the velazquez plaintiffs facial challenge to the substantive restrictions failed to state a claim,id.summarily adopting the reasoning and conclusions of the district court with respect to plaintiffs facial challenge,but concluded that the district court erred in applying an undue burden standard to the challenge to the pir,see id.at.the proper standard,the court concluded,was whether grantees had demonstrated as a factual matter that the pir ha d not left them adequate alternative channels for protected expression.id.
iv.laso and olc 
laso is a nonprofit legal aid organization and lsc grantee.it derives roughly percent of its million annual operating budget from lsc grants,and the remainder of its funding comes from other federal,state,and private sources.olc is an independent legal aid organization that does not receive funding from lsc thus,it is not subject to the restrictions.the organizations share a common board of directors.
since,when laso olc,the two organizations have coordinated their respective delivery of legal services,with olc providing many of the services that laso can not offer pursuant to the restrictions.in addition to their common board,the two organizations coordinate their efforts by maintaining separate but adjoining office space certain cases holding regular joint planning meetings maintaining a single litigation support unit to aid both olc and laso attorneys dividing the use of physical resources like libraries,computer services,and phone systems and coordinating training,priority setting,and information sharing regarding administration,finance,personnel,and other policies.
in may,laso submitted a new configuration proposal the proposal to lsc.under the proposal,laso and olc would merge into a single,nonprofit corporation with two financially separate divisions.the new organization would operate under the leadership of a single executive director,and the two divisions would share personnel in a variety of job categories.
lsc office of legal affairs issued a written opinion rejecting the proposal.the opinion explained that i n order to maintain program integrity from olc,laso must be a legally separate entity and must have greater physical and financial separation than set forth in the proposal.according to the declaration of mark freedman,lsc assistant general counsel,laso did not contact lsc to discuss the proposal prior to submitting it,nor did it explore alternatives with lsc after receiving notice that the proposal had been rejected.freedman also stated that the pir would permit a limited number of individual laso attorneys to work for olc,provided the organizations otherwise complied with the pir in terms of legal,physical and financial separation overall.
proceedings in this case 
in september,plaintiffs filed this action raising,in relevant part,facial and first amendment claims,and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief the united states intervened to defend the constitutionality of the restrictions and pir.
lsc and the united states both filed motions to dismiss all of plaintiffs claims.the magistrate judge,in his findings and recommendations,recommended granting the motions as to all claims,except for plaintiffs first amendment challenge to the pir.the district adopted the recommendations in their entirety.ultimately,in its amended order,the district court granted the motions to dismiss as to all of plaintiffs claims,except for the challenge to the pir 
the parties then engaged in a lengthy and contentious discovery process,with several disputed motions to compel.the district court denied plaintiffs requests for production of documents relating to lsc interpretation and enforcement of the substantive restrictions,but permitted a great deal of discovery regarding lsc enforcement of the pir.
in december,lsc and the united states filed motions for summary judgment on plaintiffs remaining challenge,and the individual laso attorneys filed a for partial summary judgment.the court granted defendant and intervenor motions and denied the laso attorneys motion.see legal aid serv.of or.legal serv,d.
plaintiffs then filed a motion for new trial or,in the alternative,to the opinion and judgment.in their motion,plaintiffs stated that they read the order as granting summary judgment in favor of lsc on both their challenge to the pir,and their challenge to the restrictions they believed were legally distinct claims.the problem with the judgment,in plaintiffs view,was that district court prior amended order had dismissed all of plaintiffs claims except for the challenge to the pir.had they known that the challenge to the restrictions was still at issue,plaintiffs contended,they would have presented additional arguments and evidence.
after holding two hearings on the matter,the magistrate judge denied plaintiffs motion.he explained that plaintiffs inability to present additional arguments and evidence related to their challenge to the restrictions could have impacted the ultimate decision,because the only issue before the court after the dismissal of plaintiffs facial challenge to the restrictions was whether the pir permitted plaintiffs to access alternative channels for expressing protected speech.
plaintiffs timely appealed,seeking review of the district court dismissal of their facial challenge to the restrictions,entry of summary judgment on their challenge,denial of their motion for a new trial,and denial of several motions to compel relating to lsc enforcement of the restrictions.

discussion 
plaintiffs facial challenge to the restrictions 
plaintiffs contend that lash iii is irreconcilable with the supreme court subsequent decision in velazquez iii thus,that we must reconsider the facial constitutionality of the restrictions under the rubric set forth in velazquez iii.see miller gammie,cir en banc explaining that a panel of this court is not bound by circuit precedent where the subsequent decision of a higher court undercut s the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.upon careful review of justice kennedy opinion for the majority in velazquez iii,we agree with the district court that lash iii continues to control.
in striking down the exception,the velazquez iii court distinguished rust,explaining that funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government use s private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.at.quoting rosenberger rector visitors of of,d.where it endeavors to fund certain modes of private expression,however,congress antecedent funding decision can not be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the government own interest.id.at.because lsc grant program subsidized private expression through the medium of free legal services,the court concluded that rust was not controlling.justice kennedy also observed that the exception distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys,id.at,thereby prohibit ing speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power,id.at.
according to plaintiffs,velazquez iii announced a new first amendment doctrine applicable in unconstitutional conditions essence a distortion test eroding the foundation on which lash iii rested.they contend that in velazquez iii,as in this case,congress chose to subsidize private expression through a particular medium,and then distorted the functioning of that medium by restricting the procedural tools and legal strategies that grantee attorneys were permitted to utilize in the course of their advocacy.plaintiffs argue,for example,that laso attorneys inability to seek statutory attorneys fees deprives them and their clients of a potent tool for inducing settlement,thereby altering the normal functioning of the legal system.under velazquez iii,plaintiffs contend,this sort of distortion violates the first amendment.
defendant and intervenor,for their part,contend that plaintiffs read velazquez iii far too broadly.see,intervenor reply br.at contending that velazquez iii merely stands for the unremarkable proposition that the government may not impose restrictions where it seeks to fund private speech.because the restrictions do not discriminate against a particular viewpoint,they argue,velazquez iii is inapposite,and justice kennedy discussion of the exception distortionary effects does not disturb the holding in lash iii.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs distortion theory relies on a mistaken reading of velazquez iii.the velazquez iii court analyzed the grantee plaintiffs unconstitutional conditions claim through the lens of the court limited public forum cases see at.as this suit involves a subsidy,the court limited forum cases may not be controlling in a strict sense,yet they do provide some instruction.see also mezibov allen,cir stating that velazquez iii involved a government funding program that the court deemed a limited public forum for first amendment purposes marijuana policy project united states,stating that velazquez iii rests on limited public forum doctrine.in a limited public forum,the court has held,the government may not regulat e speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.rosenberger,at.content discrimination,however,is permissible in a limited public forum so long as it is reasonable in light of the forum purpose.see id.at.quoting cornelius,at.
because lsc grant program operates much like a limited public forum,the velazquez iii court explained,it is subject to the first amendment principles that govern such forums.see at.accordingly,the court held that restrictions on the activities of lsc grantees may not target a particular viewpoint or motivating ideology,and they can not be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the government own interest.id.at.
justice kennedy discussion of how the exception distorts the legal system is thus ancillary to the court holding.the reference to distortion is best understood as underscoring the analytical connection linking lsc grant program to the government properties and programs that the court has recognized as limited public fora for the purposes of the first as elaborating a novel first amendment doctrine.see id.at.explaining that r estricting lsc attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the court limited public forum cases emphasis added.
with this understanding of velazquez iii in mind,we return to the restrictions.in prohibiting grantees from soliciting clients,lobbying,seeking attorneys fees,and participating in class actions,congress did not discriminate against any particular viewpoint or motivating ideology,much less did it aim to suppress ideas inimical to the government own interest.id.at.the restrictions simply limit specific procedural tools and strategies that grantee attorneys may utilize in the course of carrying out their legal advocacy.as such,they are permissible under velazquez iii 
in sum,we conclude that velazquez iii did not establish a new first amendment test that hinges on whether restrictions on a given government subsidy distort an existing medium of expression.rather,the court applied familiar principles,drawn from the limited public forum doctrine,to strike down a restriction on private expression.because the restrictions do not discriminate against a particular viewpoint,they are constitutional under velazquez iii.lash iii thus remains controlling precedent,and the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs facial challenge to the restrictions 
ii.challenge 
plaintiffs contend that the pir,as lsc has interpreted and applied it,effectively prevents them from expressing protected speech through alternative channels.because they have not demonstrated as a factual matter that the pir has not left them adequate alternative channels for protected expression,velazquez v,at,the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of lsc.we first address laso and its clients claims,and then turn to the individual laso attorneys claims 
laso and its clients 
in lash iii we held that,as a facial matter,the pir provides lsc grantees and their employees and clients with adequate alternative channels for engaging in restricted speech.we acknowledged,however,that a grantee could challenge subsequent applications of the pir in a separate action.see lash iii,at noting that even if the lash plaintiffs presented a factual situation that suggested the restrictions were unconstitutional in only limited circumstances the court would not strike down the restrictions as unconstitutional in the context of a facial challenge.
an first amendment challenge contends that a given statute or regulation is unconstitutional as it has been applied to a litigant particular speech activity.see members of city council of city of taxpayers for vincent,d.the underlying constitutional standard,however,is no different then in a facial challenge.see velazquez v,at facial and challenges differ in the extent to which the invalidity of a statute need be demonstrated i nvariant,however,is the substantive rule of law to be used.accordingly,we apply the constitutional standard set forth in lash iii,namely,whether lsc enforcement of the pir has effectively cut off alternative channels through which plaintiffs can express restricted speech.see lash iii,at.
between and,laso and olc coordinated their efforts to deliver legal services to indigent clients,but maintained legal,physical,and financial separation from each other.during that period,lsc did not assert or imply that laso affiliation with olc violated the pir.lsc rejection of the proposal in only concrete application of the pir in the record before thus the focal point of our analysis.
lsc determines whether a grantee is sufficiently independent from a affiliate on a basis,taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances.a.mere bookkeeping separation of lsc funds from other funds is not sufficient.id.other factors,such as having separate personnel,separate accounting and timekeeping records,separate facilities,and distinguishing forms of identification are relevant but not dispositive.id.all grantees must annually certify to lsc that their program complies with the pir,b,and a grantee uncertain about whether its relationship with a restricted affiliate satisfies the pir may submit to lsc all the relevant program integrity information and request a review by lsc of any existing or contemplated relationship with an organization that engages in restricted activities.
plaintiffs do not dispute that by eschewing formal legal separation,the proposal violated the pir on its face.although lsc generally applies a,approach to pir enforcement,it informs grantees that they may transfer funds to another organization which engages in restricted activity if,and only if,the other organization is a legally separate entity.lsc instructions for certification of program integrity at.we upheld the validity of the pir legal separation requirement in lash iii,and thus,lsc rejection of the proposal on that basis can not itself establish an first amendment violation.at w e do not find it significant that the lsc regulations require that an unrestricted affiliate organization be a legally separate entity.quoting a.
plaintiffs contend that they can not risk testing the pir limits,because doing so could lead to immediate termination of federal funding they depend on for basic operations.plaintiffs professed fear is not sufficient to establish an violation of their first amendment rights.first,we note that congress has provided that lsc grant funding shall not be suspended unless the grantee,contractor,or person or entity receiving financial assistance has been given reasonable notice and opportunity to show cause why such action should not be taken,and that grantees are entitled to a hearing before an independent hearing examiner,id.thus,plaintiffs concerns about immediate termination of funding without prior notice appear to be unwarranted.
further,plaintiffs have not explained why the prospect of funding termination prevents them from submitting an amended configuration proposal one that,at the very least,conforms to the pir legal and physical separation requirements to lsc.lsc officials testified that they engage in an iterative process with grantees to ensure pir compliance,and plaintiffs have offered no evidence suggesting that this characterization of lsc general approach is inaccurate.while submitting an amended proposal or proposals may impose some level of practical burden on laso and its staff,lash iii makes clear that a grantee must show more than a burden on the exercise of protected speech to establish an first amendment grantee must show that workable alternative channels do not exist.
plaintiffs point to enforcement actions that lsc has taken against other grantees to bolster their challenge.they contend that a prudent grantee will pay close attention to pir compliance audits and investigative reports that lsc periodically conducts and makes available to the public,and entered several audits and reports of this kind into the record.the district court disregarded the evidence of lsc application of the pir to grantees other than laso,concluding that it was not relevant in the context of an first amendment challenge.
we have held that a n first amendment challenge does not implicate the enforcement of the challenged law against third parties.foti city of menlo park,cir.that general principle clearly applies here.that a grantee may glean insight into lsc enforcement policies by examining publicly available audits and lsc inspector general reports is not controversial.plaintiffs,however,go a step further.they contend that lsc audits of other,unrelated grantees are tantamount to actual enforcement actions against laso,its staff attorneys,and its clients.accepting this premise would require the court to assume that lsc would treat laso in the same manner that it has treated other the myriad practical differences among grantees and lsc approach to determining pir then speculate about whether that treatment would violate the first amendment.such an approach is inconsistent with the limited scope of an constitutional challenge.
in sum,the record reflects that lsc employs a flexible,process for determining whether a grantee maintains objective integrity and independence.laso has not been subjected to an lsc audit,nor,according to the record,has it been threatened with an audit,despite its close affiliation with olc.lsc rejection of the proposal,standing alone,is not sufficient to establish an first amendment violation,and plaintiffs have not identified any other concrete application of the pir that has had the effect of prohibiting laso,or the clients the organization serves,from expressing restricted speech through alternative channels.
laso attorneys 
the individual laso attorneys separately contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on their challenge to the pir.
their argument runs as follows lsc,in an official guidance document and in audits of other grantees,has stated that if more than ten percent of a larger grantee attorneys work for a particular unrestricted affiliate,the grantee is likely not in compliance with the pir.therefore,at least some laso attorneys that wish to do so they offer affidavits from individual laso attorneys suggesting that more than ten percent of laso attorneys do in fact wish to work for olc,are effectively barred from exercising protected speech rights.the district court denied the attorneys motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that they had failed to show any specific instance where lsc had denied an individual laso attorney request to work parttime or on his or her own time for an unrestricted organization 
we agree that the individual laso attorneys have failed to show that lsc enforcement of the pir effectively cuts off alternative channels for engaging in protected speech.
a lsc guidance memorandum states the following 
there is no per se bar against a recipient employing staff who are also employed by an organization which engages in restricted activity.generally speaking,however,the more staff shared,or the greater the responsibilities of the staff who are employed by both organizations,the more danger that program integrity will be compromised.sharing an executive director,for example,inappropriately tends to blur the organizational lines between the entities.likewise,sharing a substantial number or proportion of recipient staff calls the recipient separateness into question.
in a footnote,the memo explains that f or larger organizations,of the recipients staff should serve as a guide.however,for recipients with smaller staffs,the program director should use his or her best judgment to determine whether staff constitute a substantial proportion of the recipient legal workforce.
the above statements outline lsc general methodology for determining whether a grantee and an unrestricted affiliate are sufficiently separate.the rough percent rule that the laso attorneys rely on does not suggest that only percent of laso staff may engage in restricted activity,or on their own time,but rather that,under normal circumstances,no more than percent of laso legal staff may work at the same unrestricted organization.that the pir prevents at least some laso attorneys from working for olc does not establish that it effectively cuts off alternative channels for engaging in protected speech.as we recognized in lash iii,laso attorneys are free to pursue a variety of alternative avenues for expressing restricted speech,including working for an unrestricted organization,or alternatively,continuing to work for an lsc grantee organization and engaging in restricted activities on their own time.see lash iii,at.
the district court thus did not err in denying the individual laso attorneys motion for partial summary judgment.
iii.motion for new trial and related discovery issues 
plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for a new trial and their motions to compel the production of documents relating to lsc enforcement of the restrictions.we disagree.
the basic premise underlying both plaintiffs motion for a new trial and their motions to compel the restrictions and the pir can be challenged in separate flawed.as we have explained,under lash iii,the restrictions are constitutional so long as lsc enforcement of the pir provides grantees with alternative channels through which they can direct restricted speech.velazquez iii did not disturb the holding in lash iii thus,the district court properly focused the litigation below on the manner in which lsc has interpreted and applied the pir.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,the judgment of the district court is 
in,congress established the legal services corporation lsc for the purpose of distributing grants to enable qualifying legal service organizations to provide free legal assistance to the poor in proceedings.in the years since,congress has attached a number of restrictions to the ways in which recipients of lsc grants can provide legal services.see,b.in,congress attached another set of restrictions to the lsc grants.see omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat,the act,reenacted in the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat.
in this case,plaintiffs mounted a facial challenge to four of the lsc restrictions.specifically,plaintiffs challenged the lsc restrictions on attempt s to influence legislation administrative processes initiation of,and participation in,class action lawsuits claiming,collecting or retaining attorneys fees available under any federal or state law and soliciting clients.plaintiffs argued that these four restrictions violate their first amendment rights to free speech and association because the restrictions distort plaintiffs ability to provide legal services to their clients.
the district court rejected plaintiffs distortion argument.in so doing,the district court erred.first,determining whether the four restrictions distort legal services attorneys ability to effectively represent their clients is key to determining whether the restrictions are unreasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants,and,thus,violate the first amendment.second,the four restrictions do distort the legal system by imposing serious and fundamental limits on legal services providers ability to effectively represent their clients such that the restrictions are unreasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants.
distortion renders the restrictions unreasonable 
velazquez iii 
in velazquez iii,the supreme court held that the lsc restriction,which prohibited legal services attorneys from challenging existing welfare laws,was unconstitutional.legal servs.velazquez velazquez iii,d.as the majority in this case observes,in velazquez iii,the supreme court did not establish a new first amendment test,but rather analyzed the restriction through the lens of the court limited public forum cases.see majority opinion at.under the limited public forum analysis,a restriction on speech must be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and can not discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint.rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,whether a lsc restriction violates the first amendment depends on whether the restriction is reasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants to provide free legal services to the poor,and viewpoint neutral.
applying the limited public forum analysis,the velazquez iii court held that the restriction was unconstitutional.id.at.the reasons identified by the court for reaching this conclusion included the court determinations that the restriction distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys,and that congress may not subsidize legal services in a way that seriously and fundamentally restricting the advocacy of attorneys.id.at.
the majority contends that velazquez iii was decided on viewpoint discrimination grounds.see majority opinion at.this reading of velazquez iii is mistaken.instead,velazquez iii struck down the restriction on reasonableness grounds.that velazquez iii was decided on reasonableness grounds is illustrated by two aspects of the opinion.first,the velazquez iii majority repeatedly discussed the restriction in the context of the purpose of the lsc grants this is significant because analysis of the lsc grants purpose goes to whether a restriction is reasonable,not to whether it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.second,the velazquez iii majority never stated that it was deciding the case on viewpoint discrimination grounds and did not dispute the dissent contention that the majority did not challenge whether the restriction was viewpoint neutral.see velazquez iii,at.scalia,dissenting noting that the majority did not claim the restriction discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.this is significant because if the velazquez iii majority intended to overturn the restriction on viewpoint grounds,one would expect the majority to respond to the dissent assertion to the contrary.
thus,the velazquez iii majority discussion of how the restriction distorts the legal system can properly be understood to refer to the reasonableness of the restriction in light of the purpose of the lsc grants rather than whether the restriction was viewpoint neutral.because the restriction distort ed the legal system by altering the traditional role of attorneys,it was unreasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants.and,because the restriction was unreasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants,it violated the first amendment under the limited public forum analysis.
plaintiffs distortion arguments were not properly considered 
before the district court,plaintiffs argued that the four restrictions violate the first amendment because they distort legal services attorneys ability to effectively represent their clients.plaintiffs,however,did not frame their distortion arguments as reasonableness arguments within the limited public forum analysis.nonetheless,whether the four restrictions distort legal services attorneys ability to effectively represent their clients is key to determining whether the restrictions are unreasonable within the limited public forum analysis.for this reason,the district court should have considered plaintiffs distortion arguments as part of the reasonableness inquiry.
the district court,however,did not address the question whether the four restrictions distort the process of legal representation such that the restrictions are unreasonable in light of the purpose of the lsc grants.because of this failure,the district court incorrectly analyzed whether the four restrictions violate the first amendment.
ii.the restrictions distort legal service attorneys ability to effectively represent their clients 
the district court failure to properly consider whether the four restrictions distort legal services attorneys ability to effectively represent their clients was a critical err
