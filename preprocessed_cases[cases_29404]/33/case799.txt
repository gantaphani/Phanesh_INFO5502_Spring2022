this petition for writ of mandate arises out of the court denial of petitioner ranch,llc ranch motion to compel deposition testimony and to produce documents brought against real party in interest chicago title insurance company chicago title.ranch sued chicago title for its bad faith in failing to pay ranch claim it filed for damages it allegedly suffered as a result of undisclosed exceptions in a title insurance policy chicago title issued as part of ranch purchase of acres of undeveloped land in the jamul area of san diego county.ranch sought documents from chicago title claims file and also to depose claims handlers and their supervisors concerning chicago title handling of and refusal to pay ranch claim.chicago title asserted the privilege and attorney work product privilege as to certain documents contained in the claims files and to certain questions posed by ranch at depositions of chicago title employees.specifically,chicago title asserted that ranch was not entitled to confidential communications between its claims adjusters,who were also attorneys,and chicago title concerning ranch claim.
the motion to compel production of documents was referred to a referee,the honorable anthony joseph,retired judge of the superior court of san diego county.the motion to compel answers to deposition questions was denied without prejudice pending the outcome of the document production dispute.judge joseph recommended that the court uphold chicago title assertion of the privilege as to all but two documents in dispute and as to all deposition questions in dispute.the court adopted the referee recommendation and it became the order of the court,resulting in a denial of both the motion to compel documents and the motion to compel answers to deposition questions.
ranch asserts that the court erred in denying its motion to compel because the dominant purpose of the claims handler review of ranch claim was the investigation and administration of the claim and,therefore,even though the claims handlers were also attorneys,no privilege attached to their communications and no privilege attaches to items in a claims file in first party bad faith actions.we conclude that the court erred in failing to review each deposition question and withheld document to determine which constituted chicago title factual investigation of ranch claim and which constituted privileged communications or protected work product.the matter is remanded for a new hearing consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural 
factual background 
in december,ranch opened an escrow with bishop escrow,bishop escrow,for the purchase for the price of million,of approximately acres of undeveloped land in the area of jamul,california,commonly known as honey springs ranch the property.ranch purchased the property with the intent to develop it with residences for resale.jerry argovitz was the principal officer of ranch.
in january california title company california title,acting as the agent of chicago title,issued a preliminary title report for the property,which was delivered to bishop escrow and in turn to ranch the report stated that california title was prepared to issue a title insurance policy for the property that would insure against losses relating to defects or encumbrances to title,except for identified encumbrances and exceptions.the escrow closed in may without any amendments to the preliminary title report.
in july chicago title issued a title insurance policy in favor of ranch.the title insurance policy listed additional exceptions to coverage that were not identified in the preliminary title report and that had not been disclosed to ranch in any other manner.the encumbrances included a recorded contract with water districts for deferred water charges with a total of approximately owing,as well as easements for road purposes,utility easements,and boundary discrepancies.according to ranch,these new exceptions created serious financial and practical barriers to developing the property as it intended,resulting in lost profit damages of million.
after receiving the title insurance policy,ranch presented a claim to chicago title requesting that it either eliminate the exceptions to title or compensate ranch for its damages.according to ranch,it tried unsuccessfully for months to receive a response to its claim.
procedural background 
the complaint 
in september,ranch filed an action against chicago title for breach of the insurance contract and bad faith handling of its claim.chicago title initially denied ranch allegations,but then admitted that it was liable for the damages caused by the unauthorized exceptions to coverage and admitted liability for both breach of contract and bad faith handling of ranch claim however,ranch asserts that the damages offered by chicago title were only a small portion of the damages it suffered.ranch thereafter amended its complaint to seek punitive damages as a result of chicago title conduct,alleging that chicago title actions in refusing to timely accept its claim were fraudulent,malicious and oppressive.
ranch also named bishop escrow as a defendant,asserting that it breached its duties related to the escrow on the purchase by delivering the faulty preliminary title report.
document request 
ranch served two sets of requests for production of documents on chicago title,seeking all documents related to title insurance policy,the preliminary title report,claim on the policy,and chicago title investigation and handling of ranch claim.chicago title objected to the production of certain documents on the ground they were protected by the or attorney work product privileges and produced a privilege log identifying the documents it was not producing.the majority of the documents on the privilege log were identified as correspondence among claims handlers,correspondence between claims handlers and individuals and entities involved in the issuance of ranch title policy memos to the file by claims adjusters concerning the claim and transmittal of information concerning ranch claim by claims adjusters to their superiors.
deposition questions 
ranch deposed claims personnel at chicago title.debra look,chicago title employee who was primarily responsible for ranch claim,testified that her job description was claims handler.she also testified that she was a licensed attorney.she testified that her job duties were to investigate the claims,determine if there was coverage,and then either deny the claim or make the appropriate payment if there was coverage.at her deposition,counsel for chicago title interposed objections to several questions posed to look on the basis of the or attorney work product privilege,and instructed her not to answer those questions.for example,counsel objected on the basis of the or attorney work product privilege to the following questions 
did you ever make any request of california title yourself that they provide you with complete copies of everything they had pertaining to the ranch claim 
what was the gist of your conversation with bishop escrow officer for bishop escrow on the subject of ranch claim

jeff dondanville,also a licensed attorney,was the regional claims manager in charge of the claims handlers or claims attorneys as he referred to them at chicago title,including those reviewing ranch claim.he testified that his duties were to hire and advise and retain claims attorneys and other persons to handle claims for the company,manage the claims department,and he was involved in determining the policy and procedures of how the claims department operates.he confirmed that the primary function of the claims handlers was to investigate claims that come in,analyze them,and administer them,in terms of dealing with the insured or the claimant.chicago title objected to the following deposition questions of dondanville,and instructed him not to answer on the basis of or attorney work product privilege 
do you recall whether the ranch claim was reported to you as a claim with a potential loss and expense total exceeding 
do you recall whether the ranch claim was deemed by the claims department at chicago title to be one with a potential loss and expense total exceeding at any time

w as the failure of chicago title to accept liability on the claim based on any specific policy provision or condition or exclusion 
motion to compel 
in december,ranch brought a motion to compel production of the documents withheld by chicago title and to compel answers to the deposition questions quoted above.ranch asserted that the documents withheld by chicago title and the deposition questions objected to were properly the subject of discovery because the dominant purpose of chicago title claims handlers was the investigation and settlement of claims,and chicago title could not shield their activities from discovery by hiring attorneys to perform those functions.
chicago title opposed the motion,arguing that the information was protected by the and attorney work product privileges because its claims handlers were licensed attorneys who were acting as attorney advisors and legal advocates for chicago title,not merely as claims adjusters.in support of its opposition,chicago title submitted the declaration of john hilbert,and associate counsel for chicago title.hilbert stated that chicago title handlers were employed by chicago title for the primary purpose of investigating claims and making coverage recommendations under applicable title policies.he also stated that they were relied upon by chicago title for their legal expertise and training,and their ability to interpret title policies,determine coverage,as well as to assess and provide legal advice as to coverage issues.
referral to referee 
the court ordered the dispute over the document requests referred to a discovery referee for resolution.the court also denied ranch motion to compel answers to deposition questions without prejudice pending the outcome of the document production dispute.the parties stipulated to the appointment of judge joseph to act as the referee on the dispute.
in february judge joseph issued his recommendation concerning the discovery dispute,following his review of the disputed documents.judge joseph found that the attorneys employed by chicago title were not engaged in activity beyond claims review and analysis and that assertion of the privilege may interfere with a clear understanding of the circumstances of this matter.judge joseph also found that the requested information was relevant,despite chicago title admission of liability,because of allegations that its actions were willful,malicious and oppressive and justified an award of punitive damages.nevertheless,judge joseph found that the and attorney work product privileges were appropriate and must be upheld.however,judge joseph did find that two documents out of the disputed were not privileged and should be produced to ranch.
court decision 
in april the court adopted judge joseph recommendation,finding that insofar as the document demands and requests to compel answers to deposition questions present issues of the attorney client privilege applying to attorneys acting as claims reviewers,the attorney client privilege precludes discovery 
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court determination of a motion to compel discovery can not be overturned in the absence of an abuse of discretion.dickerson superior court d.if the privilege does not appear as a matter of law,the appellate court may not disturb the lower court findings if there is any substantial evidence to support them.chadbourne,superior court cal d.the appellate court may not weigh the evidence,resolve conflicts in the evidence,or resolve conflicts in the inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.if there is substantial evidence in favor of the finding,no matter how slight it may appear in comparison with the contradictory evidence,the finding must be affirmed.witkin,cal.procedure ed,appeal.
ii.applicable authority 
the privilege is codified in evidence code section,which provides in part t he client,whether or not a party,has a privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between client and lawyer.
t he fundamental purpose behind the privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics surrounding individual legal matters.citation.t he public policy fostered by the privilege seeks to insure the right of every person to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,and skilled in its practice,so the former may have adequate advice and a proper defense.citation.mitchell superior court cal d,mitchell.
t he privilege is absolute and disclosure may not be ordered,without regard to relevance,necessity or any particular circumstances peculiar to the case.gordon superior court th,d.although exercise of the privilege may occasionally result in the suppression of relevant evidence,the legislature of this state has determined that these concerns are outweighed by the importance of preserving confidentiality in the relationship the privilege is given on grounds of public policy in the belief that the benefits derived therefrom justify the risk that unjust decisions may sometimes result from the suppression of relevant evidence.citations.mitchell,supra,cal d at.
the privilege does not protect independent facts related to a communication that a communication took place,and the time,date and participants in the communication.state farm fire casualty superior court th,d.further,the privilege does not protect disclosure of underlying facts which may be referenced within a qualifying communication id.at,d,and it does not extend to individuals who are no more than witnesses to the matter at issue in the litigation.martin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.knowledge which is not otherwise privileged does not become so merely by being communicated to an attorney while the privilege fully covers communications as such,it does not extend to subject matter otherwise unprivileged merely because that subject matter has been communicated to the attorney.greyhound superior court cal d.t ransmission alone,even where the parties intend the matter to be confidential,can not create the privilege if none,in fact,exists.suezaki superior court cal d.documents that are independently prepared by a party do not become privileged communications merely because they are turned over to counsel.wellpoint health networks,superior court th,d wellpoint.
the privilege only protects confidential communications between a client and his or her attorney during the course of an relationship.in this regard,evidence code section defines such a confidential communication as information transmitted between a client and his lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted,and includes a legal opinion formed and advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.
attorney work product privilege 
the work product doctrine was recognized in hickman taylor,which established a qualified privilege for certain materials prepared by an attorney acting for his client in anticipation of litigation historically,a lawyer is an officer of the court and is bound to work for the advancement of justice while faithfully protecting the rightful interests of his clients.in performing his various duties,however,it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy,free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.proper preparation of a client case demands that he assemble information,sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts,prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.that is the historical and the necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their clients interests.this work is reflected,of course,in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,mental impressions,personal beliefs,and countless other tangible and intangible though roughly termed by the circuit court of appeals in this case as the work product of the lawyer.were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand,much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten.an attorney thoughts,heretofore inviolate,would not be his own.inefficiency,unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.the effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing.and the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.id.at.
an attorney work product has been described as the product of the attorney effort,research,and thought in the preparation of his client case.it includes the results of his own work,and the work of those employed by him or for him by his client,in investigating both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the case,the information thus assembled,and the legal theories and plan of strategy developed by the as reflected in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,and any other writings reflecting the attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories,and in countless other tangible and intangible ways.bp alaska exploration,superior court d,fn,italics omitted.
the attorney work product rule reflects the policy of the state to preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of those cases and to prevent attorneys from taking undue advantage of their adversary industry and efforts.code civ,subd.a.the doctrine protects the mental processes of the attorney,providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client case.hobbs municipal court d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision c absolutely bars the use of statutory discovery procedures to obtain an attorney core work product,defined as a ny writing reflecting an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories.izazaga superior court cal d,fn.by contrast,there is only a conditional or qualified protection for general work product,which bars discovery of other aspects of an attorney work product unless denial of discovery would unfairly prejudice a party or result in an injustice.code civ,subd.b state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at,d bp alaska exploration,superior court,supra,d at.the determination of good cause contemplates a balancing of the need for disclosure against the purpose served by the work product doctrine.national steel products superior court d.
c.the dominant purpose test 
in certain instances it is difficult to determine if the privilege or work product privilege attaches to a communication,particularly where there may be more than one purpose for that communication where it is clear that the communication has but a single purpose,there is little difficulty in concluding that the privilege should be applied or withheld accordingly.if it appears that the communication is to serve a dual purpose,one for transmittal to an attorney in the course of professional employment and one not related to that purpose,the question presented to the trial court is as to which purpose predominates.citation.travelers ins.companies superior court d,italics added.this dominant purpose test not only looks to the dominant purpose for the communication,but also to the dominant purpose of the attorney work.aetna casualty surety superior court d.aetna wellpoint,supra,th at,d.thus,the privilege would not apply without qualification where the attorney was merely acting as a negotiator for the client citation,or merely gave business advice citation,or was merely acting as a trustee for the client citation.aetna,supra,d at.
for example,in montebello rose agricultural labor relations bd.d.montebello rose,an attorney was hired by management to negotiate with a union.in an unfair labor practices proceeding before the agricultural labor relations board,the board reviewed,in camera,communications between the attorney and management.id.at.utilizing the dominant purpose test,the board concluded that those documents related to his role as labor negotiator were not privileged,separated them from documents related to legal advice,and allowed them into evidence.id.at.in doing so,the board noted that to give protection to the attorney negotiation communications would unfairly reward those organizations able to hire attorneys as their negotiators because their communications concerning pending negotiations would be protected,whereas the communications of organizations with lay negotiators would not receive protection.id.at.the court of appeal upheld the board decision,reasoning that s ince management labor negotiations could have been conducted by a nonattorney,it is that communications with the attorney relating to the conduct of those negotiations were not privileged unless the dominant purpose of the particular communication was to secure or render legal service or advice.ibid.
in watt industries,superior court d.watt,the court of appeal held an attorney notes were not protected by the attorney work product rule where counsel merely acted as business agent for his client.there,the attorney conveyed to plaintiff seller the clients intention to reside in a condominium they were purchasing from plaintiff.at a deposition in an action filed by the seller the attorney refused to produce notes of that conversation with the seller.id.at.the court of appeal directed the superior court to compel production.the court noted the work product rule applied to documents related to legal work performed for a client and not to notes memorializing acts performed as a mere agent.in doing so,the court of appeal noted that t o apply the privilege in such a situation would have the effect of placing a premium upon use of attorneys as business agents,nonattorneys or clients acting for themselves having no such right to protect their notes.id.at.
in wellpoint,supra,th,d,a discrimination action was brought by a terminated employee.in defense of the action,the employer asserted that it had hired an attorney to conduct a prelitigation investigation of the discrimination claims as soon as the employee alerted it.id.at,d.after the employee initiated a lawsuit against the employer,the employee served a subpoena on the employer attorney demanding production of all documents pertaining to the attorney prelitigation investigation.the employer and its attorney refused production,citing the privilege and the work product doctrine.thereafter,the trial court issued a blanket ruling that the privilege and the attorney work product doctrine did not apply,requiring production of all the documents demanded.id.at,d.in doing so,the trial court found that the attorney was operating in a nonattorney capacity in conducting the investigation.id.at,d.
the employer filed a petition for writ of mandate.wellpoint,supra,th at,d.in response to the petition the employee again asserted that the and attorney work product privileges were inapplicable because an attorney retained to investigate employee claims of discrimination is not acting as an attorney but as a fact finder id.at,d.the court of appeal agreed in principle with the employee,but nevertheless granted the employer petition because the trial court had ordered blanket production instead of reviewing the documents individually to determine which were not privileged.the court of appeal rejected the idea that the montebello rose and watt decisions supported such a blanket exception to the privilege reliance on these cases to support a blanket rule excluding attorney investigations of employer discrimination from and work product protection is misplaced.both cases involved analyses of individual documents containing communications or purported work product to determine whether the dominant purpose behind each was or was not the furtherance of the relationship.the courts in both cases recognized that even though an attorney is hired to conduct business affairs,he or she may be called on to give legal advice during the course of the representation,and documents related to those communications should be protected notwithstanding the original purpose of employing the attorney.the trial court should have based its ruling on the subject matter of each document.id.at,d.
in chicago title ins.superior court d.chicago title,the plaintiff chicago title brought an action for fraud involving alleged check kiting.the plaintiff alleged the defendant bank knew of the scheme but did nothing to stop it and in fact assisted the fraud.id.at.the bank,on the other hand,claimed that chicago title not only knew of the fraudulent scheme,but itself was a willing participant.id.at.during discovery,the bank deposed chicago title counsel.it sought to ask him about conversations he had with other chicago title employees.chicago title objected on the ground of privilege and instructed him not to answer.id.at.on a motion to compel,the trial court found that the privilege had been waived because the questions concerned the state of chicago title knowledge of the fraud.ibid.the court of appeal denied chicago title petition for writ of mandate seeking to set aside the trial court discovery order.in doing so,the court first noted that the counsel performed functions which are not typically those of either outside counsel or house corporate counsel.for instance,chicago title attorneys were involved with quality control of escrow accounts.as part of this procedure counsel monitored the checks coming into and disbursed from the accounts.it is settled that the privilege is inapplicable where the attorney merely acts as a negotiator for the client,gives business advice or otherwise acts as a business agent.id.at.in finding that the assertion of the privilege was inappropriate in that case,the court of appeal held that counsel actions as an attorney for chicago title were so intertwined with activities which were wholly business or commercial that a clean distinction between the two roles became impossible to make.this merging of business and legal activities jeopardizes the assertion of the privilege,since the attorney and the client in effect have become indistinguishable.id.at.
aetna,supra,d,a case relied upon by chicago title on this appeal,also discussed the dominant purpose test.there,the plaintiff owned a home that was destroyed in a mudslide.the homeowner filed a claim with his insurer under a homeowner policy.the insurer retained outside counsel to investigate the homeowner claim and make a coverage determination under the policy.id.at.the insurance company filed a declaratory relief action seeking a determination that the claim was not covered and the homeowner responded with an action claiming bad faith denial of insurance coverage.id.at.
during that litigation,the homeowner sought production of outside counsel files regarding their investigation of the homeowner claim and sought the depositions of outside counsel involved in that investigation.aetna,supra,d at.the insurer objected to the depositions and production of much of outside counsel files on the basis of the and attorney work product privileges and brought a motion to quash the subpoenas or for a protective order.ibid.the trial court rejected aetna objections,allowing the discovery to proceed,and aetna brought a petition for writ of mandate to overturn the trial court decision.ibid.
the court of appeal rejected the homeowner argument that the and attorney work product privileges did not apply because aetna outside counsel was hired to act as some form of outside claims adjuster,rather than to render legal advice.aetna,supra,d at.in doing so,the court of appeal distinguished montebello,watt and other cases on the basis that in those cases the client dominant purpose in retaining the attorney was something other than the request for a legal opinion or advice.however,as the homeowner states in his own brief,in the case before us aetna retained the attorney to investigate the homeowner claim and make a coverage determination under the policy.this is a classic example of a client seeking legal advice from an attorney.the attorney was given a legal document the insurance policy and was asked to interpret the policy and to investigate the events that resulted in damage to determine whether aetna was legally bound to provide coverage for such damage.aetna,at.
the court of appeal went on to temper this conclusion,however,stating that even assuming that aetna retained the attorneys for a purpose other than the rendition of legal advice,this does not mean ipso facto that all communications between aetna and the attorney would not be protected by the privilege.aetna,supra,d at.relying on montebello,supra,d,the court of appeal stated that the trial court error was in granting the homeowner blanket access to outside counsel files and testimony instead of conducting an in camera review to determine which items were privileged and which were not in the instant case it appears that the judge did not conduct an in camera examination of the written or verbal communications which the homeowner seeks to discover.instead,despite aetna prima facie showing via declarations that at least some of the communications were privileged,the judge,without inspecting those communications,refused to issue an order limiting the homeowner access to the attorney files or the testimony of the attorneys.aetna,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
one treatise has interpreted these cases as holding that the and attorney work product privileges may not be available where attorneys are hired solely to investigate or adjust a claim,or to negotiate a contract,rather than to provide legal advice.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.the treatise goes on to conclude,citing aetna and wellpoint,that w here an attorney is hired both to investigate and to advise the client,the court may have to review the attorney files in camera to determine which documents reflect investigative work and which reflect the rendering of legal advice.id.at.moreover,the treatise advises that t his can be a particular problem for legal counsel who are often asked to investigate or handle a matter without knowing whether legal advice is required.if sensitive information is likely to be encountered,it may be a good idea to consider hiring outside counsel to do the investigation.that way,counsel will be free to maintain separate files,and can evaluate the case and advise the client without fear that those files will be discoverable by the opposing party.id.at.
waiver by placing subject matter at issue 
the or attorney work product privilege may be impliedly waived by placing the contents of the privileged communications at issue in the case.mitchell,supra,cal d at,wellpoint,supra,th at,d.where privileged information goes to the heart of the claim,fundamental fairness requires that it be disclosed for the litigation to proceed.steiny california electric supply th,d.the scope of an implied waiver must be narrowly defined and the information required to be disclosed must fit strictly within the confines of the waiver.transamerica title ins.superior court d.the party opposing the privilege bears the burden of showing that there has been an implied waiver,wellpoint,supra,th at,d.
the court in merritt superior court d.was the first in california to recognize the theory of an implied waiver of the privilege under the common law.the apparent rationale for this implied nonstatutory waiver has been explained as follows t he evidence code does not create any exception to the privilege for the situation in which a client tenders an issue such as his lawyer conduct or state of mind.but the code does not bar the courts from creating by decisional law new exceptions to various privileges.chicago title,supra,d at,fn,quoting jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook ed,original italics.applying this reasoning,the court in merritt held that the plaintiff had impliedly waived the privilege since he had specifically put the state of mind of his attorney at issue by alleging that the defendant attorney had confused his attorney and impeded his attorney ability to settle his claim.merritt superior court,supra,d at.the california supreme court recognized this theory of an implied waiver in mitchell,supra,cal d,and established that the person or entity seeking to discover privileged information can show waiver by demonstrating that the client has put the otherwise privileged communication directly at issue and that disclosure is essential for a fair adjudication of the action.id.at,holding that under the facts of that case no implied waiver occurred.
the doctrine of implied waiver was illustrated in wellpoint,supra,th,d discussed,ante,where the court of appeal held that the employer would waive the privilege to the extent it relied upon the attorney investigation as a defense to the employee claims.id.at,d.as the court stated there if a defendant employer hopes to prevail by showing that it investigated an employee complaint and took action appropriate to the findings of the investigation,then it will have to put the adequacy of the investigation directly at issue,and can not stand on the privilege or work product doctrine to preclude a thorough examination of its adequacy.the defendant can not have it both ways.if it chooses this course,it does so with the understanding that the privilege and the work product doctrine are thereby waived.id.at,d.the court of appeal nevertheless issued the employer writ of mandate to overturn the trial court discovery order as the trial court never reached the question of waiver and,because the pleadings were not final based upon a successful demurrer,it was unclear whether the employer would continue to maintain its proper investigation defense.id.at,d.
discovery of claims files in insurance bad faith actions 
the importance of claims files as evidence in insurance bad faith actions has long been emphasized in bad faith cases,the jury is entitled to know exactly what information was in the insurer claims file aside from privileged information how else could they have properly determined whether the insurer acted fairly and in good faith in its handling of the claim croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,quoting richardson employers liab.assur.corp d,overruled on other grounds in gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,fn.the claims file is a unique,contemporaneously prepared history of the company handling of the claim in an action for bad faith the need for the information in the file is not only substantial but overwhelming.reavis metropolitan property liability ins.

iii.analysis 
in this insurance bad faith action we are presented with the issue of what,if any,claims investigation material is protected by the or attorney work product privileges where the claims adjusters also happen to be licensed attorneys.in answering this question we must balance ranch need for discovery of claims investigation materials with chicago title rights to protect and attorney work product protected information.we decline to accept either ranch position that all material or communications developed by the attorney adjusters in conducting the investigation of ranch claim are open to discovery,or chicago title position that all of the withheld material is privileged.rather,we conclude that evidence reflecting the factual investigation of ranch claim is subject to discovery.only those communications reflecting the requesting of,or rendering of,legal advice are protected by the privilege,and only the attorney legal impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories are subject to the attorney work product privilege.as the court did not engage in an analysis of each deposition question or document request utilizing the correct standard to determine what was the dominant purpose of those communications,we grant ranch petition and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in reaching this conclusion,we first observe that the claims adjuster primarily responsible for ranch claim admitted that her position at chicago title for the most part was that of a claims adjuster investigating the claims,analyzing them,and determining whether payment should be made this is work that in the insurance industry ordinarily could be done by an individual not licensed to practice law.cloaking such an adjuster factual investigation in privilege would shield from discovery information that otherwise would not be entitled to any protection if communicated by an adjuster who was not an attorney but performed the same duties.to apply the privilege in such a situation would have the effect of placing a premium upon use of attorneys as adjusters,nonattorneys or clients acting for themselves having no such right to protect their communications.watt,supra,d at.
we also recognize what chicago title claims is the unique and complicated nature of title insurance,requiring,according to chicago title,the hiring of attorneys to perform claims handling roles.chicago title claims that its relies on their legal expertise and training,and their ability to interpret title policies,determine coverage,as well as to assess and provide legal advice as to coverage issues.however,this entitles to protection only those communications that constitute the actual rendering of,or request for,legal advice,not those communications reflecting the adjusters factual investigation of ranch claim.
chicago title points to aetna,supra,d.in support of its claim that an attorney investigation of an insured claim and determination of coverage itself constitutes the provision of legal advice.this argument is unpersuasive.first,in aetna,the insurance company retained outside counsel to determine coverage,it did not utilize clai
