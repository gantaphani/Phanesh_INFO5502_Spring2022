jeffrey scott scott,the defendant below,appeals from a superior court order denying his motion for relief.scott was convicted of felony murder as a offense of murder,one count of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony pdwdcf,and one count of endangering the welfare of a child.scott claims that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective.we disagree and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on july,scott and his girlfriend,edna crown had an argument in their apartment concerning edna alleged affair with her nephew.also present in the apartment were edna daughter,doris,and kelly oster and oster two children,ellen and ester ages five and three,respectively.during the argument,scott pushed edna down the apartment front steps.after edna returned to the apartment,scott stabbed her eleven times with a kitchen knife.edna died as a result of her injuries.kelly and ester oster were also injured during the incident 
when the police arrived at the crime scene,scott admitted to the police that he had stabbed edna.he later made a similar statement while receiving treatment at the hospital for injuries he sustained during the incident.during a subsequent police interview,scott made additional incriminating statements,and while leaving the courthouse after a hearing,scott also made further incriminating statements that were overheard by police officers.
scott was charged with murder two counts of assault in the three counts of pdwdcf and three counts of endangering the welfare of a child at trial,his counsel presented a defense of extreme emotional distress,and introduced expert witness testimony in support thereof.a jury convicted scott of murder one count of pdwdcf,and one count of endangering the welfare of a child,but found him not guilty of the other charges.scott directly appealed his convictions to this court,which affirmed them 
scott then moved the superior court for relief,under superior court criminal rule,advancing eleven arguments as to why his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective the superior court referred scott motion to a commissioner for proposed findings and recommendations.the commissioner recommended,in his report,that scott motion be denied as without merit and as procedurally barred the superior court adopted the commissioner report and recommendations and denied scott motion for relief scott then appealed to this court.
on appeal,scott raised a new ineffective assistance claim based on this court recent opinion in cooke state the state responded that because this claim was not raised in the trial court,the record was inadequate for appellate review.on may,this court remanded scott appeal to the superior court for consideration of scott claim based on cooke on remand,the superior court held that scott claims were without merit and denied his motion this appeal followed.
this court reviews a trial court denial of a motion for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel for abuse of discretion questions of law are reviewed de novo while questions of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard 
to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient,that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and counsel deficient performance caused the defendant actual prejudice counsel performance enjoys a strong presumption of reasonableness to succeed on the prejudice prong,the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.that test requires that the defendant make specific and concrete allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them 
none of scott claims meets the required showing for either of the strickland prongs scott makes conclusory assertions that his defense counsel acted unreasonably,but provides no support for those assertions,or explains why his counsel performance was deficient.nor does scott explain how he was prejudiced by his counsel alleged deficiencies.this court has previously held that failure to articulate,with particularity,the nature of the claimed prejudice is fatal to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel accordingly,the superior court properly denied scott motion for relief.
scott ineffective assistance of counsel claims 
on appeal,scott raises twelve claims of ineffective assistance of counsel each of these claims is addressed below.
scott first claim 
scott first claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the admission of kelly and ester oster medical records documenting their injuries and treatment,when neither witness testified at trial.although the jury found scott not guilty of the assault charges involving kelly and ester oster,scott argues that his counsel failure to object prejudiced him,because the medical records contradicted his defense of extreme emotional distress.that contradiction,scott contends,caused the jury to convict him of having a reckless disregard for human life,murder 
scott claim fails for two reasons.first,the trial court properly admitted kelly and ester oster medical records into evidence as hearsay exceptions under delaware uniform rules of evidence dre and therefore,scott counsel would not have successfully prevented the admission of these documents,regardless of whether the osters testified.moreover,scott was acquitted of the two assault charges involving kelly and ester oster.his murder conviction rests on a totally separate injuries he inflicted on edna crown,resulting in her death.because scott can not show actual prejudice,the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by denying scott claim.
scott second claim 
next,scott claims that the police obtained a nighttime search warrant based on a false police affidavit,and that his counsel was ineffective for not moving to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the defective warrant.specifically,scott claims that the police knew that kelly oster did not reside at the searched apartment,even though the police affidavit stated otherwise 
this claim can not succeed either.under franks delaware,suppression is an appropriate remedy only if the false statement was knowingly and intentionally included in the affidavit,and the false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause here,the superior court accepted the commissioner conclusion that the search warrant established probable cause regardless of whether kelly oster was a resident.scott has not shown that the affidavit misstatement regarding oster residency was necessary to the finding of probable cause.
equally important,scott counsel did,in fact,move to suppress the evidence based on a lack of exigent circumstances for a nighttime search warrant.the trial court denied counsel motion,and this court affirmed on direct appeal because scott can not succeed on either the deficient performance or the actual prejudice component of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by denying that claim.
scott third claim 
scott next claims that his counsel was ineffective for not moving to suppress his statements to the police when they handcuffed him.he urges that the statements would have been suppressed because he was neither told that he was under arrest nor advised of his miranda rights.
this claim also lacks merit.miranda warnings are required when a defendant is subject to custodial interrogation scott,however,made his statements voluntarily and spontaneously as he was being taken into custody by the police because there was no interrogation by the police,miranda is inapplicable.scott counsel,therefore,did not perform deficiently by not moving to suppress scott spontaneous statements,and the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by denying scott third claim.
scott fourth claim 
scott fourth claim is that his counsel was ineffective for failing to insist on a voir dire examination of a juror after the juror informed the court that she was taking pain medication.scott argues that because most prescription pain relievers contain narcotics,the juror was impaired and preoccupied with her pain during the trial and,therefore,could not be fair and impartial.
this claim also fails.the juror was questioned about her medical issue,and told the trial judge that it would not interfere with performing her duty as a juror the judge,defense counsel,and counsel for the state were sufficiently satisfied to allow the juror to continue to serve.because scott contention that his counsel performed deficiently or that he was actually prejudiced lacks merit,the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by denying scott claim.
scott fifth claim 
scott fifth claim is that counsel performance was ineffective for failing to move to suppress all of scott statements to the police on the ground that,due to his history of intoxication and drug use,he was unable to understand the miranda warnings given to him.
as discussed above,scott statements to the police at the time of his arrest were voluntary and spontaneous,and not a result of police interrogation.therefore,miranda does not apply to these statements.nor can scott argue that,because of his prior drug and alcohol use,he was incapable of understanding the miranda warnings given to him during a later taped interview with the police,because he did invoke his right to remain silent and the trial court granted defense counsel motion to suppress those taped interview statements.scott counsel did not perform deficiently,and the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by rejecting this claim.
scott sixth claim 
scott sixth claim is that both his trial and appellate counsel erred by failing to object to the admission of his statements to the emergency medical technician emt,on the ground that those statements were inadmissible hearsay.
scott counsel did not err,because under dre d,those statements were not hearsay.rather,they were admissions by scott for which reason scott trial and appellate counsel had no basis to object to their admission into evidence.because scott can not succeed either on his claim that his counsel performed deficiently or that he suffered prejudice,the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting that claim.
scott seventh claim 
next,scott argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective for not appealing the trial judge ruling that limited scope of the of the state psychiatric expert witness,weiss,who testified adversely to scott defense of extreme emotional distress scott contends that his counsel should have been allowed to weiss about testimony weiss gave in a previous unrelated pennsylvania case.in that case,weiss testified that an accurate psychiatric evaluation can be made only if there is a trusting relationship between the therapist and the patient.scott argues that because he and weiss did not have a trusting relationship,weiss could not have evaluated him accurately,and counsel should have been allowed to develop that fact in.
scott counsel did not err by not raising this argument on appeal.in jones barnes,the united states supreme court held that although a defendant has the final authority to make certain fundamental decisions such as whether to plead guilty or to take an appeal,the defendant does not have a constitutional right to compel his counsel to raise issues that counsel,in exercising his own independent and professional strategic judgment,decides not to present scott counsel stated in his affidavit that he did not argue this issue because he did not believe that there was any chance that this court would reverse based on the circumstances of the ruling.moreover,scott trial counsel did,in fact,weiss on the underlying issue of whether an accurate evaluation required a patient to trust the psychiatrist.weiss response was that in scott case,that trust was not required.
scott appellate counsel did not perform deficiently by choosing not to raise this particular argument on direct appeal,nor has scott demonstrated actual prejudice.the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion by denying scott claim.
scott eighth claim 
scott eighth claim is that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a hearsay objection to a police officer testimony about statements he overheard scott make while leaving the courthouse.
scott eighth claim fails for the same reason as his sixth.under dre d,scott statements are treated as a party admission,and are not hearsay because there was no basis for raising a hearsay objection,scott counsel did not perform deficiently by not objecting.the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in denying this claim.
scott ninth claim 
scott next contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecution closing statement in which the prosecution inappropriately bolstered its witnesses credibility by using facts that were not based upon evidence presented at trial.scott also argues that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this alleged prosecutorial misconduct on direct appeal.
this claim can not succeed for two reasons.first,scott made only general allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.merely including excerpts of the trial transcript,without more,does not identify with particularity the specific portion s of the state closing argument that allegedly contain facts that were not based upon evidence presented at trial.that imprecision made it impossible for the trial court to assess the merits of this claim moreover,a review of the excerpted trial transcript discloses nothing objectionable.in the prosecution closing argument,the prosecutor merely summarized each witness testimony.
even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor closing argument was improper,scott has not identified any resulting prejudice that he suffered the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this claim.
scott tenth claim 
scott tenth claim is that his appellate counsel was ineffective by failing to raise all of the arguments scott wished to have presented.as support,scott makes general and conclusory allegations that his counsel did not discuss the appeal with him,but fails to identify any specific point that his counsel should have raised on appeal.
scott claim can not succeed for the reasons discussed in connection with his seventh claim.under jones and evitts,counsel need not advance every argument the defendant wishes to raise,regardless of merit scott counsel did not act unreasonably by exercising his professional judgment in deciding what issues to raise on direct appeal.furthermore and contrary to scott assertion,scott counsel did,in fact,discuss with scott the arguments that scott wanted to have presented,and explained why he counsel would not make those arguments.because scott can not succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting that claim.
scott eleventh claim 
scott penultimate claim is that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal the trial court denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal.scott contends that the state evidence relating to kelly and ester oster injuries so overwhelmed the jury that it could not properly consider his defense of extreme emotional distress,thereby prejudicing him.essentially,scott argues that the trial court erred in admitting the medical and police reports relating to kelly and ester oster injuries.
scott claim fails for several reasons.first,as noted in our discussion of scott first claim,the jury acquitted scott of both the murder charge and the two assault charges.therefore,scott can not argue that he was actually prejudiced by the evidence of the osters injuries,because he was acquitted of those charges.second,the evidence is sufficient to support the jury verdict of murder.in appellate counsel own words,the evidence uncontroverted ly and overwhelming ly demonstrates that scott attacked edna crown and stabbed her to death.scott can not show that he was actually prejudiced by the admission of the evidence relating to the osters injuries.third,scott trial counsel did,in fact,move to reduce the murder charge to murder on the basis of insufficient evidenc
