introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants jerome zamos and odion okojie collectively zamos appeal from an order dismissing their malicious prosecution action against defendants and respondents james stroud,van do,stroud do we refer to these three defendants collectively as stroud,carl taylor taylor,and nancy peterson peterson we refer to all of these defendants collectively as defendants after the trial court granted defendants motion to strike under code of civil procedure section the motion.we hold that zamos failed to meet their burden to demonstrate a reasonable probability that their malicious prosecution claim would succeed against taylor and peterson.we also hold that zamos met their burden with respect to stroud because we conclude that an attorney may be liable for malicious prosecution if the attorney continues to prosecute a lawsuit after discovery of facts showing that the lawsuit has no merit.in so determining,and in following the restatement second of torts and california authorities,we disagree with recent court of appeal decisions holding that a malicious prosecution action can be based only on the filing of a lawsuit.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal as to taylor and peterson,but reverse the dismissal as to stroud.
background 
the instant case for malicious prosecution is based upon a lawsuit the fraud lawsuit brought by patricia brookes brookes who is named as a defendant in this case but is not a party to this zamos.zamos had represented brookes in another lawsuit the foreclosure lawsuit arising from the foreclosure on her house.jerome zamos and odion okojie practiced law together.jerome zamos was the attorney who primarily represented brookes in the foreclosure lawsuit,although okojie made some appearances in that case.
after a jury trial of the foreclosure lawsuit,when it appeared that the jury was deadlocked,brookes settled the lawsuit against some of the defendants in that case in exchange for paid by those settling defendants as damages for emotional distress.out of that,zamos received as a contingency fee,and brookes received.as part of the settlement,brookes expressly released all claims to her house.the terms of the settlement agreement were stated on the record before the court at two separate hearings.brookes appeared by telephone at the first hearing,held on october,and appeared personally at the second hearing,held on october.
almost two years later,in,brookes sued zamos for fraud,among other claims,based upon certain alleged representations zamos made to induce her to settle the foreclosure lawsuit.brookes alleged that jerome zamos told her that he would continue to represent her to judgment against the defendants in the foreclosure lawsuit,he would substitute into and represent brookes in a malpractice lawsuit brookes filed against her former attorneys the malpractice lawsuit,he would have her house returned to her,and he would withdraw from representing her in the foreclosure lawsuit if brookes did not accept the settlement.brookes also alleged,among other things,that zamos never intended to keep his first three promises and that zamos withdrew from representing her against the defendants,never substituted into the malpractice lawsuit,and never tried to have her house returned to her.
stroud represented brookes in the fraud lawsuit.in october,shortly after brookes fraud lawsuit was served on odion okojie,zamos sent to stroud reporter transcripts of three hearings in the foreclosure lawsuit,which transcripts zamos contended proved that brookes fraud claim had no merit.the first two hearings reflected in the transcripts were those held on october,and october,and the transcripts show that brookes was told and agreed that she was releasing all claims to her house and that zamos would not substitute into the malpractice lawsuit.the third hearing,held on january,was a hearing on zamos motion to be relieved as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit.during that hearing,jerome zamos explained that he had submitted all of the paperwork necessary for entry of default against the defendants,and the trial court explained to brookes that zamos would be relieved as counsel and that brookes would be responsible for bringing the default to judgment.when the trial court asked brookes whether there was a problem with relieving zamos as counsel,brookes responded,no,not really.the transcript even shows that brookes contended that zamos was never her attorney of record,and she complained that zamos forced her to come into court for the hearing she asked the court,why could he just send me whatever to be relieved of counsel a short time later,brookes told the court,i do care if you sign him off or not.he never been on.
after stroud and brookes refused to dismiss the fraud lawsuit against zamos despite these transcripts,zamos moved for summary judgment.in opposition to zamos motion for summary judgment,stroud submitted a declaration signed by brookes in which brookes stated,among other things,that she agreed to settle the foreclosure lawsuit in reliance upon zamos promises to continue representing her against the defendants,represent her in the malpractice lawsuit,and have her house returned to her.the trial court questioned whether brookes could establish that she was damaged as a result of zamos alleged fraud,but the court nonetheless denied zamos motion,although it did so reluctantly,finding that brookes declaration raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether zamos made the alleged promises.
brookes fraud lawsuit proceeded to trial before a judge who had not been the judge in any of the other proceedings in that case.before the trial began,the trial judge informed the parties that he had read the transcripts of the three hearings discussed above in preparation for ruling on several motions.based on the judge understanding of brookes anticipated testimony,he warned stroud several times that he needed to advise brookes of her fifth amendment rights and that he would notify the district attorney office if brookes testimony at trial contradicted those transcripts because such testimony would be perjurious.
taylor and peterson testified at the trial.apparently although the record is not entirely clear,brookes was unable to testify due to health reasons,and zamos had to put on the defense before the plaintiff was completed.when brookes failed to appear after all other witnesses had completed their testimony,stroud asked for a continuance to allow her an additional opportunity to appear.the trial court denied stroud request and granted zamos motion for a nonsuit.in granting the motion,the court found that,even if brookes testified in accordance with the offers of proof that had been made,no reasonable jury would ever provide a judgment for brookes.in addition,the court found that,based upon the transcripts of the hearings regarding the settlement of the foreclosure lawsuit,brookes settlement of that lawsuit acts as a bar probably in the form of estoppel to brookes fraud lawsuit.
following entry of judgment in the fraud lawsuit,zamos filed the instant malicious prosecution action against brookes,stroud,taylor,and peterson.zamos alleged on information and belief that taylor encouraged brookes to file the fraud lawsuit against zamos and engaged stroud to represent brookes,and that peterson urged brookes to file the fraud lawsuit and gave false testimony to assist brookes in prosecuting the lawsuit.zamos also alleged that defendants prosecuted the fraud lawsuit to extort an unwarranted settlement by zamos.
stroud,taylor,and peterson filed a joint motion in which they argued that zamos could not show a reasonable probability of success on the malicious prosecution claim.stroud asserted that zamos can not show that the fraud lawsuit was brought without probable cause because stroud decision to file the action was based upon brookes statements regarding zamos alleged promises corroboration by peterson and,to a lesser degree,by taylor and the timing of zamos alleged promises,zamos receipt of the contingency fee from the settlement,and zamos motion to be relieved as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit.taylor and peterson asserted that zamos can not hold them liable for malicious prosecution because their sole involvement with the fraud lawsuit was as witnesses,and thus they are protected by the litigation privilege.
in opposition to the motion,zamos presented evidence that shortly after the fraud lawsuit was filed stroud received the transcripts that zamos contended gave notice to stroud that the fraud lawsuit had no merit.zamos also presented evidence that taylor sought counsel to represent brookes in the fraud lawsuit and gave assistance to stroud during peterson deposition.taylor graduated from law school,although apparently he is not a licensed attorney.zamos contended that this evidence shows that taylor was actively involved in maliciously prosecuting the fraud lawsuit.finally,zamos presented evidence that peterson was not present or within hearing distance when jerome zamos spoke with brookes about the settlement agreement in the foreclosure lawsuit,and therefore peterson is liable for malicious prosecution because her assertion that she heard zamos make the alleged promises at issue in the fraud lawsuit was demonstrably false.
the trial court granted the motion as to all of the moving parties.as to stroud,the court found that stroud had probable cause to bring the lawsuit based upon brookes representations that were corroborated by taylor and peterson.the court held that taylor and peterson were immune from liability under the common law witness immunity doctrine set forth in briscoe lahue,d and silberg anderson cal d.the court awarded in attorney fees to taylor and in attorney fees to peterson.zamos timely appealed from the trial court order dismissing the entire action against stroud,taylor,and peterson and awarding attorney fees.
discussion 
a.the burdens on motions 
code of civil procedure section,the statute,provides in relevant part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.code civ,subd.b.under this statute,the party moving to strike a cause of action here,defendants has the initial burden to show that the cause of action aris es from an act in furtherance of the moving party right of petition or free speech.equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon mattel,luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d mattel.once that burden is met,the burden shifts to the opposing party here,zamos to demonstrate the probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.code civ,subd.b equilon,supra,cal th at,d.the opposing party demonstrates a probability of prevailing by present ing evidence establishing a prima facie case which,if believed by the trier of fact,will result in a judgment for the plaintiff.mattel,supra,th at,d.
the parties in this appeal concede that zamos malicious prosecution action arises from acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech.we note that this a malicious prosecution claim can be subject to an pending before the california supreme court in jarrow formulas,lamarche,review granted june.thus,the issue in this case is whether zamos presented evidence in opposition to defendants motion that,if believed by the trier of fact,was sufficient to support a judgment in zamos favor.the process the court uses in determining the merits of an motion is similar to the process used in approaching summary judgment motions mattel,supra,th at,d,and whether zamos has established a prima facie case is a question of law.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant,subd.b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.
prima facie liability for malicious prosecution 
it is well established that one who initiates a lawsuit without probable cause and with malice is liable for malicious prosecution bertero national general cal d,mattel,supra,th at,d.thus,the party who brings the lawsuit in this case,brookes can be liable if the lawsuit was brought with malice and without probable cause.but the attorneys who represent such a party in this case,stroud also can be liable if,based upon the facts known to the attorneys,the attorneys had no probable cause to prosecute the,no reasonable attorney would have thought the lawsuit was tenable.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,sheldon appel.finally,one who is actively involved or instrumental in instigating the lawsuit jacques interiors petrak d.or who aids and abets a malicious prosecution that someone else has commenced lujan gordon d.can be liable for malicious prosecution.see also pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d,fn,bear stearns.
liability for continuing to prosecute lawsuit after discovering lack of merit 
stroud contends on appeal that the trial court properly granted the motion as to stroud in accordance with a recent decision by division seven of this appellate district.stroud asserts that under,goldstein th,d,the determination of probable cause must be made based upon the facts known to the attorney at the time the attorney filed the underlying lawsuit.under,if those facts are sufficient to constitute a cause of action,the attorney can not be liable for malicious prosecution,even if the attorney subsequently discovers that those facts are not true but continues to prosecute the lawsuit.id.at,d see also morrison rudolph th,d division three of the fourth appellate district relies on to hold that the determination of whether a lawyer had probable cause to prosecute a lawsuit is limited to facts known to the lawyer at the time lawsuit was filed.
respectfully,we disagree with our colleagues in division seven.instead,in conformity with supreme court dictum and the restatement second of torts,we hold that an attorney may be liable for malicious prosecution if the attorney continues to prosecute a lawsuit after discovery of facts that establish that the lawsuit has no merit.see also dobbs,the law of torts,fn.although a lawyer is not liable for filing a lawsuit that subsequently is shown to have no merit,o nce investigation shows facts that eliminate reasonable grounds for suit,however,the lawyer must not continue the litigation harper,et,the law of torts ed,not only to instigate criminal proceedings but continuing to prosecute such proceedings maliciously after learning of their groundless nature will result in liability,although they had been begun in good faith and with probable cause and,fn.noting that conditions necessary to support an action for malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding generally are the same as those necessary to support an action for malicious prosecution of a criminal proceeding,although there may be a slight difference in the treatment of probable cause.
in reaching its contrary conclusion,the court relied upon another decision from division seven,vanzant daimlerchrysler th,d vanzant.in vanzant,plaintiff vanzant had been sued by defendant daimlerchrysler for trademark infringement in the underlying action.although daimlerchrysler had obtained a judgment against vanzant in that action,the judgment was reversed and judgment ultimately was entered in vanzant favor.vanzant then sued daimlerchrysler and its attorneys for malicious prosecution,arguing that even though the original judgment in daimlerchrysler favor in the underlying action established that the defendants had probable cause to initiate the action,the defendants lacked probable cause to continue to prosecute the action on remand after the judgment was reversed.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court dismissal of vanzant malicious prosecution complaint,holding that there can be no liability for malicious prosecution for the continuation of a properly initiated existing proceeding.id.at,d.
the vanzant court relied upon three cases for its gulf insurance group cal d,coleman,merlet rizzo th,d merlet,and adams superior court th,d adams.those three cases merely stand for the proposition that a malicious prosecution claim can not be based upon allegedly frivolous procedural acts such as bringing frivolous motions or applications,or filing a frivolous appeal taken in a lawsuit for which there is probable cause.for example,in coleman,there was no suggestion that the underlying lawsuit itself was brought or prosecuted without probable cause.rather,the plaintiff alleged only that the appeal taken by the defendant was frivolous.coleman,supra,cal d at.the supreme court held that the plaintiff could not bring a malicious prosecution claim based upon the filing of a frivolous appeal because an appeal can not be considered a separate action seeking affirmative relief id.at.in merlet,division two of the first appellate district held that a malicious prosecution claim can not be asserted against a party and the party attorneys for filing an improper application for issuance of a writ of sale in an otherwise meritorious lawsuit,because the application is not an independent proceeding.merlet,supra,th at,d.and in adams,the sixth appellate district held that bringing motions in pending lawsuits can not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim because motions are not independent proceedings.adams,supra,th at,d.none of these cases addresses a situation in which an attorney continues a lawsuit after the attorney discovers that the lawsuit has no merit.
the court in vanzant acknowledged that its holding is contrary to the position set forth in the restatement second of torts,section section,that o ne who takes an active part in the initiation,continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another is subject to liability.rest d torts,italics added.but the court stated that it was aware of no california case adopting the restatement position.vanzant,supra,th at,fn,d.in fact,the california supreme court has cited section with approval,albeit in dictum,and has stated that a person who is injured by groundless litigation may seek compensation from any person who procures or is actively instrumental in putting the litigation in motion or participates after the institution of the action.bear stearns,supra,cal d at,fn,italics added,citing section as well as jacques interiors petrak,supra,d at,lujan gordon,supra,d at,and witkin,summary of cal.law torts,at.in addition,the court of appeal in curtis county of los angeles d.arabian,in the context of determining whether code of civil procedure section allows a governmental entity to recover defense costs from a party who continued to prosecute a civil action after learning that it had no merit,relied on section and comment c to section,among other authorities,in concluding that an aggrieved party may bring a malicious prosecution action against one who continues to prosecute a civil action for an improper purpose after learning that there was no probable cause for the action.id.at.
the court in acknowledged the above language in bear stearns,supra,cal d at,fn,and the two cases the supreme court cited to support it,jacques interiors petrak,supra,d at.and lujan gordon,supra,d at,supra,th at,d.but the court fails to distinguish adequately case the supreme court cited in support of the statement in bear stearns regarding liability for participating in a meritless lawsuit after its the ground that the underlying action in that case was initiated without probable cause.
first,in reversing a demurrer brought by a defendant in a malicious prosecution action,the lujan court specifically said,this case raises the issue whether an action for malicious prosecution may be maintained against a person who had no part in the commencement of the action,but who participated in it at a later time.lujan gordon,supra,d at.the court determined that such an action could be maintained against a law firm that participated in a lawsuit only after it had been filed.thus,contrary to,the lujan court held that the determination of whether a lawyer had probable cause to prosecute a lawsuit is not limited to facts known at the time lawsuit was filed.
second,at the same time the court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the attorney defendants,it reversed the summary judgment in favor of the client on the ground that there were triable issues of fact regarding whether the client had probable cause to bring the underlying action,supra,th at,d.thus,if it is determined that the client had no probable cause to initiate the lawsuit,the factual situation would be comparable to the factual situation in lujan gordon,supra,d at,in which the underlying lawsuit was brought without probable cause but a party who obtained knowledge of the lack of probable cause only after the initiation of the lawsuit was subject to liability for malicious prosecution.lujan therefore stands for the proposition that it is not only knowledge of lack of probable cause at the initiation of the action that gives rise to liability,but that liability can also attach if the party obtains such knowledge at any time during the prosecution of the action.
this proposition is not,as the court suggests,contrary to t he rule in california that,if probable cause exists at the outset of the action,the party acting with probable cause is insulated from liability for malicious prosecution,supra,th at,d,citing hufstedler,kaus ettinger superior court th,d hufstedler.the issue in hufstedler was whether the extent of the knowledge at the time the underlying lawsuit was filed is always relevant to the determination of probable cause.hufstedler,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal held that,if it is shown in a malicious prosecution action that the underlying lawsuit was tenable,had probable cause,the nature and extent of the attorney knowledge at the time the underlying action was filed is irrelevant.id.at,d.this holding does not conflict with our holding that an attorney who files a lawsuit and thereafter discovers that the lawsuit does not have probable cause is liable for malicious prosecution for continuing to prosecute the lawsuit following that discovery.
it makes little sense to hold attorneys accountable for their knowledge when they file a lawsuit,but not for their knowledge the next day.there is no logic in immunizing attorneys from liability for malicious prosecution simply because the attorneys think there is probable cause when they file the lawsuits,if shortly thereafter they discover the lawsuits have no merit but they continue to prosecute them.holding attorneys liable for damages incurred after they learn that lawsuits have no merit is in keeping with the supreme court explanation as to why malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding is actionable because it harms the individual against whom the claim is made,and also because it threatens the efficient administration of justice.the individual is harmed because he is compelled to defend against a fabricated claim which not only subjects him to the panoply of psychological pressures most civil defendants suffer,but also to the additional stress of attempting to resist a suit commenced out of spite or ill will,often magnified by slanderous allegations in the pleadings.bertero national general cal d.
holding attorneys liable for the damages a party incurs as a result of the attorneys prosecuting civil claims after they learn the claims have no merit also will encourage voluntary dismissals of meritless claims at the earliest stage possible.because an attorney will be liable only for the damages incurred from the time the attorney reasonably should have caused the dismissal of the lawsuit after learning it has no merit,an attorney can avoid liability by promptly causing the dismissal of,or withdrawing as attorney in,the lawsuit.this will assist in the efficient administration of justice and reduce the harm to individuals targeted by meritless claims.moreover,by advising a client to dismiss a meritless case,the attorney will serve the client best interests in that the client will avoid the cost of fruitless litigation,and the client exposure to liability for malicious prosecution will be limited.
we recognize that malicious prosecution is a disfavored cause of action.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.but the supreme court has warned that t his convenient phrase should not be employed to defeat a legitimate cause of action w e should not be led so astray by the notion of a disfavored action as to defeat the established rights of the plaintiff by indirection for example,by inventing new limitations on the substantive right,which are without support in principle or authority crowley katleman cal th,d.for well over a hundred years,aggrieved parties have had a right to bring a malicious prosecution action against another party for continuing to prosecute a lawsuit after learning there is no probable cause for that lawsuit.see,bicknell dorion pick.wetmore mellinger iowa,wenger phillips.this right has been recognized in case law in numerous jurisdictions see,korn epstein,smith lucia,wroten lenske,wilson hayes iowa,badell beeks idaho,nelson miller,laney glidden,so,and,as stated above,in the restatement and treatises see,rest d torts,dobbs,supra,fn.harper,et,supra,fn.accordingly,our holding here does not create a new tort remedy for misconduct see medical center superior court cal th,d,warning of the danger of creating new tort remedies,but instead recognizes established rights of the plaintiffs and avoids placing new limits on those rights.
we stress that our holding is limited to cases in which the facts known to the attorney show that the case has no merit and there are no facts obtainable that would support the claim.thus,we do not believe that our application of the malicious prosecution law will adversely affect an attorney obligation to diligently represent the interests of a client see kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d an attorney must represent his or her clients zealously within the bounds of law,because an attorney already is required by the rules of professional conduct not to assert a position in litigation without probable cause and for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any person rules conduct,rule a,or present a claim in litigation that is not warranted under existing law rules conduct,rule b.
zamos case against stroud 
in light of our holding that attorneys can be liable if they continue to prosecute claims after they discover they have no merit,in the present case we must determine whether zamos presented evidence in opposition to stroud motion sufficient to show that stroud had information at some point during the prosecution of the fraud lawsuit that established that brookes fraud claim lacked probable cause.whether the facts known to stroud constituted probable cause to prosecute the fraud lawsuit is a question of law.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.the court must make an objective determination of the reasonableness of stroud conduct,to determine whether,on the basis of the facts known to stroud,the institution and prosecution of the fraud lawsuit was legally tenable.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.the test applied to determine whether a claim is tenable is whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.id.at.
in the present case,as discussed above,stroud presented evidence in support of the motion to show that the facts available to stroud at the time the lawsuit was filed were sufficient to support a cause of action for fraud.but in opposition to the motion,zamos presented evidence that stroud was given transcripts shortly after the fraud lawsuit was filed that,zamos contends,show that stroud knew or should have known that the fraud lawsuit had no merit.
the transcript of october,settlement hearing in the foreclosure lawsuit establishes that brookes could not have relied upon zamos alleged promise to represent brookes in the malpractice lawsuit against her former attorneys.that transcript shows that before brookes agreed to the settlement,brookes and zamos stated on the record that brookes had changed her mind regarding zamos representation in the malpractice lawsuit and that zamos was not going to represent brookes in that lawsuit.
that same transcript also confirms that brookes fraud claim could not properly have been based upon another of zamos alleged,that zamos would have brookes house returned to her.the october,transcript shows that brookes was told repeatedly that she would be giving up all claims to her house if she agreed to the settlement.therefore,brookes could not have justifiably relied upon zamos alleged promise to continue prosecuting the claim for her house in light of the october,transcript,then,stroud did not have probable cause to continue to prosecute the fraud claim based upon those two alleged promises.see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,at elements of fraud are misrepresentation,knowledge of falsity,intent to defraud,justifiable reliance,and resulting damage.
although the transcript from the january,hearing on zamos motion to withdraw as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit may not conclusively prove that brookes did not rely upon the remaining alleged,that zamos would represent brookes to judgment against the suggests that she did not so rely.the january,transcript shows that brookes did not object to zamos withdrawing as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit.her lack of objection suggests that she did not rely upon zamos alleged promise to represent her to judgment against the defendants when she agreed to the settlement of the foreclosure lawsuit against the other defendants.even if this transcript is not sufficient evidence by itself to establish that there was no probable cause to prosecute the fraud lawsuit based upon this alleged promise to represent brookes against the defendants,zamos presented additional evidence in opposition to the motion that shows that stroud had no evidence to support the damage element of brookes fraud claim.
zamos submitted the transcript from the hearing on zamos motion for summary judgment in the fraud lawsuit.the hearing was held almost two years after the fraud lawsuit was filed trial of the lawsuit took place more than two years after the summary judgment motion was denied.during the summary judgment hearing in the fraud lawsuit,the trial court correctly noted that,to establish that she was damaged as a result of her reliance on zamos alleged promises that supposedly induced her to settle the foreclosure lawsuit,brookes would have to show that she should have obtained a better result if she had not agreed to the,if she had at that time continued to prosecute the foreclosure lawsuit.see,viner sweet cal th,d,to establish damages as a result of wrongdoing related to a lawsuit,plaintiff must show that absent the wrongdoing,plaintiff should have obtained a better settlement or a better result at trial orrick herrington sutcliffe,llp superior court th,d same marshak ballesteros th,d same mattco forge,arthur young th,d same.the trial court asked stroud to point to the evidence that shows that brookes would have obtained a better result without the settlement.although stroud pointed out that brookes house was valued at more than,he could not point to any evidence to show that brookes would have won the foreclosure lawsuit.instead,stroud could state only,well,you know,it is not clear that she would have won,but it is not clear that she could not have won.this is insufficient to give rise to an actionable claim.see in re easterbrook d.the mere possibility or even probability that damage will result from wrongful conduct does not render it actionable ventura county humane society holloway d.it is law that damages may not be based upon sheer speculation or surmise.moreover,at no time did stroud suggest the possibility that any evidence could be obtained to establish damages.
in sum,zamos produced evidence in opposition to the motion in the instant case that demonstrates that within a few months after the fraud lawsuit was filed stroud had information to show that brookes fraud claim had no merit with regard to two of the three alleged promises,and two years into li
