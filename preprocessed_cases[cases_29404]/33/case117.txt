the federal public defender office for the western district of new york defender appeals from an interlocutory order denying its motion to withdraw as counsel for tejbir oberoi.during the course of its representation of oberoi,the defender learned that a and current client of the office would testify against oberoi and duly notified the court.
after appointing new counsel for taofik kaid,the witness,and obtaining his consent to the defender use in cross examination of secrets and confidences that kaid had shared with the defender,the court declined to relieve the defender.based largely on united states leslie,cir and united states lussier,cir,the district court concluded that kaid consent cured any potential conflict and declined to make any inquiry of oberoi despite the defender assertion that the office still had a conflict.
in both leslie and lussier,the issue of disqualification and the nature of the conflict were raised before trial defense counsel perceived no conflict and,at least tacitly,consented to continue to represent the defendant and the defendant first objected to the perceived conflict on appeal.an interlocutory appeal from an order refusing to disqualify defense counsel that sincerely and reasonably believes prior representation of a witness will prevent it from effectively representing its current client presents fundamentally different questions.due to these differences,on february,we issued an order vacating the district court order and directing the district court to appoint substitute counsel for oberoi.this opinion sets forth our reasoning.
background 
the defender represented kaid in a narcotics prosecution from january until november,when the district court appointed new counsel for kaid.on february,the district court appointed the defender as counsel for oberoi after granting a motion to withdraw from oberoi retained counsel.the charges against oberoi,which involved fraud in submitting claims from his dental practice to various insurers,are unrelated to those against kaid.
on september,the defender moved to adjourn the trial then scheduled for november.the motion was based,in part,on the defender recently acquired knowledge of a potential conflict of interest.specifically,one of the patients listed in the indictment against oberoi was kaid.because the indictment used codes for the patients,the conflict had not been immediately apparent.
on october,the prosecutor in oberoi requested a curcio hearing,which addresses the willingness of a defendant to waive a potential conflict of interest,see united states curcio,cir,and the prosecutor in kaid requested that new counsel be appointed for kaid.the government also disclosed that kaid would testify against oberoi.on october,the parties appeared on the oberoi case.the government changed its position slightly,indicating that it would not call kaid but that it still wanted to present evidence on the counts involving kaid.the defender suggested that the court should sever and dismiss the counts involving kaid because the defense might need to call him if the government continued to prosecute the relevant counts.the court appointed patrick brown as standby counsel for oberoi and robert convissar as standby counsel for kaid.
on the scheduled date for oberoi curcio hearing,november,the government again indicated it did not intend to call kaid as a witness but also argued that if kaid had new counsel and waived the privilege,the defender could kaid and there would be no conflict.the court instructed the defender to talk with oberoi to determine his position on waiver before the court began the curcio hearing.after the defender said that oberoi might not waive the conflict,the court adjourned the proceeding until november,to give oberoi additional time to think about his choice.
the district court also began a curcio hearing in the kaid case on the fifth of november.because kaid told the court that he did not intend to waive his privilege,the hearing quickly ended.the next day,kaid repeated that he did not intend to waive his privilege,causing the court to relieve the defender and appoint convissar as kaid counsel.
at oberoi adjourned curcio hearing on november,the government informed the court that the question of whether kaid would waive his privilege was still open.the court directed that kaid and convissar appear the following morning and told the defender and brown that they were welcome to appear.
the next day the court called the kaid case.the defender and oberoi were present in the gallery.kaid apparently had changed his mind regarding waiver of the privilege.the court asked kaid whether he understood that under the rules of ethics,the defender would not be able to kaid in the oberoi matter concerning anything kaid had revealed to the defender during the period of their relationship.after kaid indicated his understanding,the court asked,i s it your intent to waive this right or give up this right that you have,and allow the defender to use any information that he may have obtained from you during any of you in his representation of oberoi kaid responded,t hat correct,sir.the court asked further questions to make sure that kaid understood what he was waiving,culminating with so you permit the defender to,in open court,ask any questions,even if it reveals confidential information between you and him kaid responded,y es.
the court then instructed the defender,be ready to go to trial on the date that set.any more obstacles we have to overcome the defender answered that the court must still determine whether oberoi waived the conflict because oberoi ha d a right to a defense attorney who is not going to be witnesses that are former clients.he has a right to a duty of undivided loyalty.the defender also argued that kaid waiver did not affect oberoi rights.the court disagreed but allowed the defender to brief the issue.
kaid later entered into a plea agreement with the government in which the government promised not to oppose a sentence at the lowest point in the applicable guidelines range but reserved the right to change its position based on newly acquired information.
on november,the defender filed a written motion for withdrawal and disqualification.one week later,the district court heard oral argument and issued an oral order denying the motion and refusing to hold a curcio hearing.at the time of the motion,hearing,and decision,the prosecution against oberoi had been pending slightly more than three years.the court found that because of kaid waiver,the defender had neither an actual nor a potential conflict of interest.relying on leslie,at,the court also found no need for a curcio hearing.on the same date,the defender filed a notice of appeal.on december,the court denied oberoi motion for a stay pending appeal.on december,we stayed the district court order and all further proceedings in the oberoi prosecution.
the defender argues on appeal that an actual conflict of interest remains because the defender will not be able to kaid without using confidences and secrets to his detriment in violation of ethical rules and the defender still has split or divided loyalties to kaid and oberoi.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
because the district court order conclusively determined the issue of the defender continued representation of oberoi and can not be effectively reviewed on final appeal,we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.whiting lacara,cir.
