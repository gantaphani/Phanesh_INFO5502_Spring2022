plaintiffs appellants,mary jane jones,jacob shepherd,and bill shepherd,and attorney appellant jeffrey blum appeal from the following orders the denial of plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment that the kentucky state police ksp deadly force policy is unconstitutional the order dismissing the action against wellman,former ksp police commissioner the imposition of sanctions against plaintiffs attorney jeffrey blum the dismissal,with prejudice,of plaintiffs claims against defendants reffett,provence,reichenbach,and silvers officers.
we decline to consider the constitutionality of the ksp deadly force policy,because the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek declaratory judgment,and because this issue was not raised before the district court.we also conclude that the district court properly dismissed the action against wellman,because the pleadings did not place wellman on notice that he was being sued as an individual.similarly,we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed sanctions against blum for using this case to conduct discovery in an unrelated case.moreover,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the claims against the officers,because the plaintiffs failed to obtain counsel.accordingly,we affirm the district court orders.
factual and procedural background 
on august,gary shepherd was shot and killed during a standoff with several members of the ksp special response team.on august,mary jane jones,decedent girlfriend,filed several claims on behalf of jacob shepherd,the couple son,including the loss of parental consortium,and a claim filed under.ann.permitting the child of a person killed by the careless,wanton,or malicious use of a deadly weapon,not in,to sue the party that committed the killing and any party that aided in the killing.jones also filed a personal injury claim,which she withdrew voluntarily.bill wayne shepherd,the decedent brother,and representative of the decedent estate,also filed a action against the defendants.the defendants are members of the kentucky state police department.
on august,billy wellman,the former ksp police commissioner,filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action on the grounds of absolute immunity.the district court granted this motion in wellman favor on the grounds that the pleadings did not provide wellman with notice that he was being sued in his individual capacity.
on june,the plaintiffs filed a partial summary judgment motion seeking a declaratory judgment that the ksp deadly force policy is unconstitutional.this argument was first raised in the second amended complaint.the district court did not permit the plaintiffs to file the second amended complaint because this additional amendment would have resulted in undue prejudice and delay.the district court denied plaintiffs partial motion for summary judgment because the constitutionality of the deadly force policy was not argued in the pleadings accepted by the court.plaintiffs are appealing the denial of their motion for partial summary judgment.
on january,blum subpoenaed several witnesses,and requested juror questionnaires to investigate allegations of jury tampering in ford provence ford i,an unrelated case in which blum represented another plaintiff against the kentucky state police department.the officers filed a motion for a protective order and sanctions to prevent the plaintiffs from using the instant case to conduct discovery for an unrelated case.the district court construed this motion as a motion for excess costs and attorneys fees under.on june,after giving blum an opportunity to explain why he should not be sanctioned,the district court granted the officers motion for sanctions because blum had improperly used the instant litigation in order to conduct discovery in an unrelated case.on july,blum was granted leave to withdraw as plaintiffs counsel.plaintiffs are appealing the sanctions order.
when a status conference was held on march,the plaintiffs had not obtained counsel.the district court ordered the plaintiffs to obtain counsel no later than days following the entry of the order setting monetary sanctions against blum.that order was entered on august.the plaintiffs did not secure counsel within days of that order,nor did they timely respond to the officers motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.on january,the district court granted the officers motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.plaintiffs are appealing this order.
on january,the officers filed a motion pursuant to.b to amend the judgment to dismissal with prejudice,because the statute of limitations had run on the plaintiffs complaints.plaintiffs did not respond to this motion,and the district court granted the motion in favor of the officers.plaintiffs appeal the amended order.
plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment 
the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the district court declare the ksp deadly force policy unconstitutional.the district court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such declaratory relief.plaintiffs now ask this court to declare the policy unconstitutional.they allege that the issue is properly before us because both parties consented to litigate the constitutionality of the policy,even though the issue was not raised in the pleadings.the defendants maintain that they did not consent to litigate whether the deadly force policy was constitutional.
a federal appellate court generally does not consider an issue that was not considered below.singleton wulff,d.this rule is one of prudence and does not limit our jurisdiction we retain considerable discretion to decide questions not raised initially in the district court.see united states hayes,cir.the federal rules of civil procedure provide that when issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.b.the record in this case does not support plaintiffs allegation that the defendants impliedly consented to litigate the constitutionality of the deadly force policy.therefore,the federal rules of civil procedure do not require us to consider this issue,and we decline to exercise our discretion to do so.
the dismissal of the action against wellman 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see hammons norfolk,cir.however,in the civil rights context,we scrutinize the dismissal of complaints with special care.see forest united states postal service,cir.we construe the complaint liberally in the plaintiff favor and accept as true all factual allegations and permissible inferences therein.see gazette city of pontiac,cir.
in will michigan of state police,d,the supreme court held that the eleventh amendment bars suits against a state and against state employees sued in their official capacities,unless the state has waived its immunity,or unless congress has overridden the state immunity under section of the fourteenth amendment.as a result,we require plaintiffs to set forth clearly in their pleading that they are suing the state defendants in their individual capacity for damages,not simply their capacity as state officials.wells brown,cir.
where no explicit statement appears in the pleadings,this circuit uses a course of proceedings test to determine whether the defendants have received notice of the plaintiff intent to hold them personally liable.see moore city of harriman,cir en banc when a plaintiff fails to affirmatively plead capacity in the complaint,we then look to the course of proceedings to determine whether wells concern about notice has been satisfied.under this test,we consider the nature of the plaintiff claims,requests for compensatory or punitive damages,and the nature of any defenses raised in response to the complaint,particularly claims for qualified immunity,to determine whether the defendant had actual knowledge of the potential for individual liability.id.at.we also consider whether subsequent pleadings put the defendant on notice of the capacity in which he or she is being sued.id.
in moore,the court noted t
