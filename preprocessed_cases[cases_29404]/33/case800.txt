facts and procedural history 
defendant campbell was charged by felony complaint with rape by force,subd.a and unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor,subd.c.defendant was arraigned on the felony complaint on november,and was represented by the alternative public defender office.subsequently,defendant retained attorney lempert to represent him through the preliminary examination,and attorney lempert substituted in as attorney of record for defendant on april.attorney lempert represented defendant at the preliminary examination on january.at the conclusion of the preliminary examination,defendant was held to answer on four felony counts,and he was ordered to appear in department of the superior court on january.
on january,defendant was arraigned on the information.attorney richard wingerden,specially appearing for attorney lempert,requested the matter be referred to the public defender for representation of defendant.the trial court inquired whether counsel had previously made a general appearance in the matter.in response,counsel indicated that a general appearance had been made in the lower court.the trial court concluded that counsel was still attorney of record and advised counsel to file a motion to be relieved if that was his intention.defendant entered a plea of not guilty and waived his speedy trial rights.
on january,attorney lempert filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record,claiming that he was retained to represent defendant through the preliminary examination,but not for trial,and that defendant was indigent and could not afford to retain his services through trial.
the trial court held a hearing on the motion to withdraw on february.at the hearing,the people expressly took no position on whether attorney lempert should be relieved.the people also said they were not concerned with when the case went to trial.an attorney from the alternative public defender office also reviewed the file and said that it was a very serious case,that it would take a minimum of to days before an attorney in the office would be available to try the case,and that attorney lempert would be able to handle the matter more expeditiously.
the trial court asked defendant if he preferred to have attorney lempert continue to represent him,and defendant stated,no,sir.the trial court also asked defendant if he wanted the court to appoint counsel,and defendant replied,for the time being,yes.the people also said that a three or four month continuance was not going to be a problem.
the trial court then stated well,as i think all counsel are aware,number one,we now have only one court and there is no such thing,in my opinion,regardless of what language is used,if there is a special appearance it is a general appearance for all purposes.and,therefore,i do not recognize an attorney right to automatically withdraw from the case at the time of arraignment because he has made some sort of financial arrangement with a client to represent him through the preliminary hearing which,as we all know,in most situations,although this may be an exception,does require a tremendous amount of work.and i been attempting to discourage this practice by taking the position that a motion to withdraw has to be filed.and that exactly what occurred in this case.in terms of whether there is prejudice to the defendant,apparently there is not because he is,he wants not to be represented by lempert at this point.given what he has had to say,and he has been present hearing that the case is going to be set off into the future.
the trial court then questioned defendant again whether he wanted to waive time,and defendant stated that he did.defendant also stated to be completely honest,i do understand what going on right now.he told me that i paid him for only so much and that all that been done already.so i figured he was going to leave already.and i do understand why i here.i do understand this whole hearing at all.
the trial court then explained to defendant that the issue before the court was whether the court required attorney lempert to continue representing defendant or whether the court relieved him and appointed another attorney.defendant responded what i still confused is there any question mean,i do understand how you can say anything about him still being my attorney when we had an agreement ahead of time.how did this become a legal thing like that that what i understand.he did what he was supposed to do.so what i mean,what would happen if i said i do want him to still represent me,but yet i have paid him for that in reply,the trial court stated that it would consider what defendant wanted.the trial court asked defendant if he wanted attorney lempert to continue to represent him and whether he was interested in a speedy trial.defendant responded affirmatively.
at this point,attorney lempert argued that he had completed an enormous amount of work in the case,that he had fulfilled the terms of his contract with his client,that it bordered on involuntary servitude if the court were to mandate continued representation,and that he could not afford to represent defendant through trial without compensation.attorney lempert also offered to stay in the case if the court would pay him.
the trial court replied that was not my thought.my thought was,even if i felt there was reason to relieve you for financial reasons,i was then going to appoint you and direct you to represent the defendant at no cost.so i did not have that in mind.i think involuntary servitude may be a little bit strong in terms of your assessment of my position.
the trial court then denied attorney lempert motion to withdraw as attorney of record.the court concluded i am going to deny the motion to withdraw,although a basis for withdrawing can be financial reasons as we all know.nevertheless,it still a discretionary call on the part of the court.and in my opinion the defendant is better represented by you at this point,and that it would prove to his disadvantage if i relieve you at this time.defendant continued on a status,and the court scheduled the case on the master trial calendar for march.
on february,attorney lempert filed a motion for reconsideration,asserting that the denial of the motion to withdraw was an abuse of discretion and that there had been an irremediable breakdown in the relationship.the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration after hearing on february,and the matter remained set on the master trial calendar for march.
on february,attorney lempert filed a petition for writ of mandate prohibition in this court challenging the denial of his motion to withdraw as attorney of record.on february,this court issued a temporary stay,requested preliminary opposition,and ordered the superior court to provide reporter transcripts from the hearings.however,no opposition was filed,and,after further review,this court issued a palma notice palma industrial fasteners,cal d,advising the parties that this court was considering issuing a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance and allowing a final opportunity to submit any opposition.
in response to the palma notice,the superior court filed an opposition in which it asserted its discretionary authority to require and rule on a motion to withdraw where an attorney retained for a preliminary examination seeks to withdraw from the case at the time of arraignment on the information however,the superior court did not take a position on whether its decision in this case was an abuse of discretion.the people submitted a letter to this court indicating that the people did not take any position on the matter,apart from a general interest in having the matter expeditiously resolved.this court also received a brief of amicus curiae from the public defender of santa clara county.amicus curiae takes the position that the trial court has the authority to require retained counsel who appears at the arraignment on the information to file a motion to withdraw and that the trial court correctly exercised its discretion to deny petitioner motion to withdraw on the merits.
discussion 
it is undisputed that the defendant has retained counsel to represent him only through the preliminary examination and not through trial,and defendant admittedly is unable to pay counsel for further representation.consistent with the agreement between retained counsel and defendant,counsel sought to withdraw from the representation at the arraignment on the information.the issues that we decide are whether respondent court properly required counsel to file a formal motion to withdraw at this stage of the proceedings and whether respondent court abused its discretion by denying the motion.
since this matter concerns a specific phase of a felony prosecution,we briefly highlight some of the basic pretrial steps in order to place the matter in the appropriate context.
a felony prosecution that is commenced by the filing of a complaint has two distinct pretrial phases in the first phase,formerly conducted in the municipal court,the prosecution commences with the filing of the felony complaint.the defendant is brought before a magistrate and is informed of the right to counsel.if the defendant desires counsel and is unable to employ counsel,counsel is appointed.ibid.the defendant then appears before the magistrate for arraignment,and,if the defendant pleads not guilty,the magistrate sets the case for a preliminary examination.if the magistrate finds sufficient cause to believe the defendant is guilty,then the defendant is held to answer,and the district attorney files an information in the superior court.
the second pretrial phase begins with the filing of the information in the superior court.the information is considered the first pleading filed by the people in a felony case in the superior court.after the filing of the information,the defendant is arraigned on the information before a superior court judge.in the interim,counsel who represented the defendant at the preliminary examination continues to represent the defendant until the date set for arraignment on the information unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.if the defendant appears for arraignment on the information without counsel,the defendant is informed of the right to counsel.if the defendant desires counsel and is unable to employ counsel,the court must appoint counsel to represent the defendant.ibid.
notwithstanding the court comment we now have only one court,under the statutory scheme just laid out,that single court has two divisions corresponding to the former municipal and superior courts.the voluntary unification of the municipal and superior courts was not intended to fundamentally alter preexisting criminal procedure rather,the objective of the statutory revisions implementing trial court unification was to preserve existing rights and procedures despite unification,with no disparity of treatment between a party appearing in municipal court and a similarly situated party appearing in superior court as a result of unification of the municipal and superior courts in a county.cal.law revision com.in order to distinguish between criminal causes that were within the original trial jurisdiction of superior and municipal courts,the criminal procedure statutes were revised to accommodate the possibility of unification by replacing references to matters within the original jurisdiction of the superior court with references to felonies,and by replacing references to matters within the original jurisdiction of the municipal court with references to misdemeanors and infractions.id.at,fn.omitted.although the statutory references have changed,the historical division within the trial court remains.
we find that the present case is analogous to alexander superior court th,d alexander.in alexander,the defendant sought to have counsel who represented the defendant in the municipal court appointed to represent the defendant in the superior court.the first issue faced by the alexander court was whether a superior court refusal to appoint the attorney who represented the defendant in the municipal court constituted a refusal to appoint the attorney or a removal of the attorney.id.at,d.
the alexander court concluded that the refusal of the superior court to continue the appointment of an attorney assigned to represent the defendant in the municipal court and who represented the defendant at the preliminary examination constituted a refusal to appoint counsel and not the removal of counsel.alexander,supra,th at,d.as stated by the court in alexander this conclusion is not only consistent with the relevant supreme court authority,it is also consistent with the provisions of section,relating to continuity in representation by counsel at the preliminary examination.that section provides for continuity in representation by counsel at the preliminary examination until the date set for the defendant arraignment in superior court.this conclusion is also consistent with the actual practice of criminal law in this state.an attorney who has been retained to represent a defendant in municipal court does not consider himself or herself retained to represent the defendant in superior court.citations.the representation of a defendant who has been held to answer after a preliminary examination continues up to the date of arraignment in superior court.citations.thereafter,the issue of representation begins anew.ibid.
similarly,in people chavez cal d,chavez,the defendant wanted the attorney who represented him at his preliminary examination in municipal court to continue the representation in the superior court.however,the superior court summarily refused to appoint the same counsel based on a policy of appointing its own counsel in every case.the supreme court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request for the continued appointment of counsel without affording defendant an opportunity to explain what circumstances,if any,might warrant such continued appointment.id.at.the supreme court also noted that the municipal court appointment of defense counsel was apparently still in effect up until the time of defendant arraignment on the information.id.at,fn,citing.
both alexander and chavez demonstrate a practice,prior to the unification of the municipal and superior courts,in which the attorney who represented the defendant at the preliminary examination was not necessarily considered to have continued the representation in the superior court when defendant was arraigned on the information.rather,the issue of representation has been treated as beginning anew with the appearance of the defendant in the superior court on the date set for arraignment on the information.this treatment also is reflected in the statutory scheme,particularly in section,as well as in the statutory requirement that the defendant in a felony proceeding be advised of the right to counsel both when defendant is brought before the magistrate and when the defendant is arraigned in the superior court on the information.see people crayton cal th,d.
