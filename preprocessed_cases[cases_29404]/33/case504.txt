john roe standing 
we review the question of standing de novo.sac fox nation of pierce,cir,cert denied,d.the constitutional requirements for standing are an injury in fact,a causal connection between the injury and the challenged act,and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.vermont agency of natural res.united states ex.rel.stevens,d.the alleged injury must be concrete and particularized and imminent or actual,as opposed to conjectural or hypothetical.id.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations and internal quotations omitted alteration in original.
john roe faces imminent injury he has graduated and will sit for the bar exam in july.since he has disclosed his past treatment for alcohol,drug,or narcotic use in his application,john roe will be subject to board investigation,which he believes violates the ada and constitution.the fact that john roe could fail the bar exam does not defeat standing because john roe has alleged more than some day intentions.id.at internal quotations.a plaintiff is required only to allege concrete plans,he is not required to successfully execute those plans.see buchwald of new mexico sch.of,cir plaintiff required to make an adequate showing that she will to medical school to have standing citation and internal quotations omitted.
bryant yellen,d,cited with approval by clinton city of new york,d,supports this conclusion.in bryant,the district court held that privately owned farmland in imperial valley in california was not subject to a provision in the boulder canyon project act,which limited water deliveries from reclamation projects to acres under single ownership.id.at.certain imperial valley residents sought to intervene and appeal the decision.id.at.they asserted standing on the basis that they desired to purchase farmland in imperial valley that might become available if the acre limitation was held to be applicable.id.however,the residents could not with certainty establish that they would be able to purchase excess lands if the provision were held applicable.id.at.it was uncertain whether owners of excess land would sell,whether the residents had sufficient financial resources to purchase the land,and whether the residents would be outbid by other potential purchasers.id.at.these uncertainties notwithstanding,the residents had standing because it was likely that the residents would purchase the excess lands if the acre limitation was applicable.id.at.the facts in this case are far more compelling.having invested three years of time and resources to complete law school,john roe will sit for the bar exam.furthermore,it is likely that john roe will pass the bar exam.over of university of denver college of law students who have taken the colorado bar exam for the first time in recent years have passed.colorado supreme court board of law examiners web page,rates by law school february bar examination,at http last visited june,colorado supreme court board of law examiners web page,rates by law school july bar examination,at http last visited june.
ii.redressibility
