alan faigin sued fremont reorganizing corporation frc alleging that he was jointly employed by both frc and fremont general corporation fremont general as counsel.faigin alleges several counts against frc relating to the termination of his employment.frc filed a against faigin alleging that he wrongfully informed the insurance commissioner commissioner,as liquidator of a related company,fremont indemnity company fremont indemnity,that his former clients were planning to auction certain artworks that he claimed were owned by fremont indemnity.the commissioner then commenced an adversary action against fremont general and frc in the liquidation proceeding.
faigin filed a special motion to strike the under the statute code civ,the trial court concluded that each count alleged in the arose from protected activity under the statute,that frc had failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims,and that the litigation privilege applied.the court therefore granted the motion,striking the in its entirety.frc appeals the order granting the special motion to strike and an order awarding faigin attorney fees as the prevailing on the motion.
we conclude that each count alleged in the arises from protected activity under the statute and that frc has not shown that faigin conduct was illegal as a matter of law under the rule from flatley mauro cal th flatley so as to make the statute inapplicable.we also conclude that frc established a probability of prevailing on its counts for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty and that the litigation privilege is inapplicable in an action by a former client against an attorney arising from breach of professional duties.frc,however,failed to establish a probability of prevailing on two other counts.we therefore will affirm in part and reverse in part the order granting the special motion to strike and will reverse the order awarding attorney fees with directions to the trial court to determine whether faigin partial success entitles him to a fee award and,if so,the amount of the award.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
frc,formerly known as fremont investment loan,was a bank until it ceased doing business in july and changed its name to fremont reorganizing corporation.frc and fremont indemnity are subsidiaries of fremont general.
faigin began to work as in house counsel for fremont general in approximately.as counsel,he provided legal services to fremont general and its subsidiaries,including frc and fremont indemnity.
the commissioner commenced an involuntary liquidation proceeding against fremont indemnity in june.fremont indemnity was declared insolvent and the commissioner was appointed its liquidator in june,and faigin ceased acting as counsel for fremont indemnity at that time.the court issued an order in july prohibiting fremont indemnity,its officers,directors,agents,and employees from disposing of or transferring the assets of fremont indemnity.the order also directed fremont indemnity,its officers,directors,agents,and employees to deliver immediately to the commissioner all assets and records of fremont indemnity in their custody or control and to disclose to the commissioner the whereabouts of all assets and records not in their custody or control.in addition,the order directed all of fremont indemnity affiliates to cooperate with the commissioner in the performance of his duties and to turn over to the commissioner all records of fremont indemnity assets.
faigin and fremont general entered into a written employment agreement in april appointing him as general counsel for fremont general.however,it hired donald royer to replace faigin as its general counsel in november.royer assumed faigin former duties,while faigin continued to work as counsel.faigin notified fremont general in november that these changes to his job duties entitled him to certain accelerated compensation payments.
fremont general notified faigin on march,that his employment was terminated for cause effective that day.faigin informed the commissioner the following day that frc and fremont general were planning to auction certain artworks that purportedly belonged to fremont indemnity.as a result,the commissioner commenced an adversary action against frc,freemont general,and others in may in the liquidation proceeding.fremont general filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in june.
frc,fremont general,another fremont entity,and the commissioner entered into a settlement agreement in april providing for payment to the commissioner of the proceeds from the sale of the artworks and payment of an additional million by frc to fremont indemnity.
faigin filed a complaint against frc on january,and filed a first amended complaint on january.he alleges that he was jointly employed by fremont general and frc pursuant to a written employment agreement.he alleges that the agreement provided for certain payments if there was a significant change in his job duties and that such a change occurred in late when he was replaced as general counsel.he also alleges that his employment was wrongfully terminated in march because of his requests for payments allegedly due to him under the agreement.
faigin alleges counts against frc for breach of the employment agreement,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,and labor code violations,among other counts 
frc filed a against faigin in april alleging that faigin was employed by fremont general alone.frc alleges that faigin also provided legal services to frc and other subsidiaries of fremont general and that frc and fremont general both were his clients,but that frc was not his joint employer.frc also alleges,on march,faigin,in breach of his legal,fiduciary and ethical obligations,advised the california insurance commissioner,acting in his capacity as the liquidator of fremont indemnity company,that faigin former clients were in the process of auctioning certain artworks that faigin falsely asserted were owned by fremont indemnity.frc alleges that the commissioner commenced an adversary action against fremont general,frc,and others in may as a result of faigin statements made to the commissioner.
frc alleges that because faigin acted as counsel for frc and fremont general he owed both entities,as his former clients,a duty to preserve their confidences and other fiduciary duties.frc alleges that faigin breached those duties by informing the commissioner that frc and fremont general were planning to auction artworks purportedly belonging to fremont indemnity.frc also alleges that the interests of frc and faigin other clients were in conflict with respect to faigin statements made to the commissioner and that it had never consented to faigin dual representation of frc and fremont general,or any of fremont general subsidiaries,as required by rule c of the rules of professional conduct rule c.frc alleges further that if it is liable to faigin on his complaint in this action,it is entitled to equitable indemnity from faigin because he breached his fiduciary duties owed to frc as his former client by making the statements to the commissioner,resulting in damages to frc.frc alleges counts against faigin for breach of confidence breach of fiduciary duty violation of rule c and equitable indemnity.
special motion to strike 
faigin filed a special motion to strike the in may.he argued that frc allegations in its regarding his statements to the commissioner were inaccurate in many respects,but stated,for purposes of this motion only faigin assumes frc allegations about that conversation to be true.he argued that each count alleged in the arose from his statements made to the commissioner in connection with the liquidation proceeding and therefore arose from protected activity under the statute.he also argued that the litigation privilege and official proceeding privilege precluded his liability on each count,and that frc could not establish a probability of prevailing on its counts for violation of rule c and equitable indemnity for other reasons.faigin filed his own declaration in support of the motion and requested judicial notice of several documents.
frc argued in opposition to the special motion to strike that faigin violated his duty under business and professions code section,subdivision e and rules and of the rules of professional conduct to maintain his client confidences,and that his conduct therefore was illegal.frc argued that an illegal act can not be protected activity under the statute as a matter of law,citing flatley,supra,cal th,and that its therefore did not arise from protected activity.frc also argued that faigin conduct was not protected by either the litigation privilege or the official proceeding privilege and that its counts for breach of rule c and equitable indemnity were legally sufficient.
frc filed a declaration by royer in opposition to the special motion to strike.royer declared that a letter from the commissioner stated that faigin had informed the commissioner on march,that fremont general was in the process of auctioning certain artworks that faigin asserted were owned by fremont indemnity corporation.royer also declared,at no time did i,or anyone else on behalf of fremont general corporation or frc,authorize faigin to divulge any information to any third party,including the california insurance commissioner,about the ownership of this artwork or the fact that it was being auctioned.
faigin asserted in reply,among other arguments,that his statements to the commissioner were neither illegal within the meaning of flatley,supra,cal th,nor improper.he filed his own supplemental declaration stating that he became aware of freemont indemnity possession and ownership of the artworks from nonconfidential sources,including his personal observation of the artworks on display in fremont indemnity offices and a newspaper article.he also filed an evidentiary objection asserting that the statement in the royer declaration regarding the information in the letter from the commissioner was inadmissible hearsay.
at the hearing on the special motion to strike,frc argued that the trial court should disregard faigin arguments and evidence presented for the first time in reply and should allow frc time to file a supplemental opposition to the motion.the court denied the request and took the matter under submission.in a minute order filed on june,the court sustained faigin evidentiary objection to the royer declaration,granted his request for judicial notice,and granted the special motion to strike.the order stated that each count alleged in the arose from protected speech and that frc has failed to demonstrate that it has a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits given the objectionable portion of royer declaration and given the absolute litigation privilege under civil code section b.
motion for attorney fees 
faigin filed a motion for attorney fees as the prevailing on a special motion to strike under section,subdivision c,seeking in fees.frc opposed the motion,challenging only the amount to be awarded.the trial court granted the motion in an order filed on july,awarding in fees.
frc timely appealed the order granting the special motion to strike and the order awarding attorney fees.
contentions 
frc contends faigin statements to the commissioner violated his duties of confidentiality and loyalty as an attorney and therefore were illegal and are entitled to no protection under the statute the statute does not apply to an action by a former client against an attorney for breach of professional duties the litigation privilege can not protect an attorney from liability to a former client for breach of professional duties the trial court erred by considering arguments and evidence presented for the first time in faigin reply brief while denying frc leave to file a supplemental opposition and if the order granting the special motion to strike is reversed,the order awarding attorney fees also must be reversed.
discussion 
special motion to strike 
a special motion to strike is a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a party constitutional right of petition or free speech.rusheen cohen cal th.the purpose of the statute is to encourage participation in matters of public significance and prevent meritless litigation designed to chill the exercise of first amendment rights,subd.a.the legislature has declared that the statute must be construed broadly to that end.ibid.
a cause of action is subject to a special motion to strike if the defendant shows that the cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue and the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th.on appeal,we independently review both of these determinations.hall time warner,th.
an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue is defined by statute to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.if the defendant shows that the cause of action arises from a statement described in clause or of section,subdivision e,the defendant is not required to separately demonstrate that the statement was made in connection with a public issue.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,briggs.
a cause of action is one arising from protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision b only if the defendant act on which the cause of action is based was an act in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.city of cotati cashman cal th.whether the arising from requirement is satisfied depends on the gravamen or principal thrust of the claim.episcopal church cases cal th,quoting martinez metabolife,th.a cause of action does not arise from protected activity for purposes of the statute if the protected activity is merely incidental to the cause of action.martinez,supra,at.in deciding whether the arising from requirement is satisfied,the court shall consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.
a cause of action that arises from protected activity is subject to dismissal unless the plaintiff establishes a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b.a plaintiff establishes a probability of prevailing on the claim by showing that the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a prima facie showing of facts that,if proved at trial,would support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.taus loftus cal th.the court can not weigh the evidence,but must determine as a matter of law whether the evidence is sufficient to support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.ibid.the court must consider not only facts supported by direct evidence,but also facts that reasonably can be inferred from the evidence.oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th,oasis west.the defendant can defeat the plaintiff evidentiary showing by presenting evidence that establishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff can not prevail.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th.the defendant can not defeat the plaintiff evidentiary showing,however,by presenting evidence that merely contradicts that evidence but does not establish as a matter of law that the plaintiff can not prevail.oasis west,supra,at.
each count arises from protected activity 
a.the counts for breach of confidence,breach of fiduciary duty and equitable indemnity arise from protected activity 
the counts for breach of confidence,breach of fiduciary duty,and equitable indemnity all are based on faigin statements made to the commissioner that frc and fremont general were planning to auction artwork that purportedly belonged to fremont indemnity.frc alleges that by making those statements faigin breached his duty of confidence and other fiduciary duties owed to frc and fremont general as former clients,and that frc is entitled to equitable indemnity as a result.it seems clear that the gravamen or principal thrust of each of these counts is that faigin breached his professional duties owed to his former clients by making the statements to the commissioner.
faigin statements concerned the assets of an insolvent insurer,fremont indemnity.faigin made those statements to the commissioner as the liquidator in the liquidation proceeding,who was charged with marshaling the insolvent insurer assets.a statement is in connection with an issue under consideration by a court in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of clause of section,subdivision e if it relates to a substantive issue in the proceeding and is directed to a person having some interest in the proceeding.neville chudacoff th.faigin statements made to the commissioner satisfy this standard and therefore each of these three counts arises from protected activity under the statute.the authorities cited by frc do not persuade us to the contrary,as we discuss below.
b.the count for violation of rule c arises from protected activity 
rule c prohibits an attorney from simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests without obtaining their informed written consent.frc alleges in its count for violation of rule c that faigin acted as counsel for frc at the direction of fremont general.frc alleges that it never consented to faigin dual representation of frc and fremont general,or any of fremont general subsidiaries.frc also alleges that w ith respect to faigin advising the california insurance commissioner that his former clients were in the process of auctioning artworks that faigin falsely asserted were owned by fremont indemnity company,the interests of frc and faigin other clients were in conflict.frc alleges further that the commissioner commenced the adversary action against it as a result of faigin statements to the commissioner and that frc suffered damages as a result.
we regard this count as an attempt to cast the same conduct on which the other counts are based,faigin statements to the commissioner,as a violation of rule c.although frc alleges that faigin violated rule c by simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests,it alleges that it was damaged as a result of faigin statements to the commissioner and that the interests of faigin former clients were in conflict with respect to those statements.as we view it,the gravamen of this count is that faigin violated rule c by simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests without their informed written consent and by informing the commissioner that his former clients were in the process of auctioning artworks purportedly belonging to fremont indemnity.faigin statements to the commissioner were made in connection with an issue under consideration by a court in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of clause of section,subdivision e,as we have stated.we therefore conclude that the count for violation of rule c arises from protected activity under the statute.
faigin conduct was not illegal as a matter of law 
frc contends faigin statements to the commissioner violated his duties of confidentiality and loyalty owed to frc as a former client,so his conduct was illegal and can not be protected activity under the statute under the rule from flatley,supra,cal th.the california supreme court in flatley held that the statute does not protect speech or petitioning activity that is conclusively shown or conceded to be illegal as a matter of law and therefore not a valid exercise of the constitutional right of petition or free speech.id.at.flatley stated,because not all speech or petition activity is constitutionally protected,not all speech or petition activity is protected by section.citation.id.at.flatley also stated,a defendant whose assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition,can not use the statute to strike the plaintiff complaint.id.at.
the rule from flatley,supra,cal th,concerns the first step of the inquiry under the statute.a defendant moving to strike the plaintiff complaint under the statute can not show that the plaintiff cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant protected speech or petition rights if the evidence conclusively establishes as matter of law,or the defendant concedes,the illegality of the defendant conduct on which the cause of action is based.id.at.if there is a factual dispute as to the illegality of the defendant conduct,however,the court can not conclude that the conduct was illegal as a matter of law and must proceed to the second step to determine whether the defendant has established a probability of prevailing.id.at.
the parties dispute the meaning of the term illegal as used in flatley,supra,cal th.the illegal conduct in flatley was criminal extortion.id.at.flatley held that extortion was not a constitutionally protected form of speech and that the statute therefore did not apply.id.at.the prior authorities cited in flatley,supra,cal th at page,holding that illegal conduct was not protected activity under the statute also involved criminal conduct.lam ngo th,criminal violence and other criminal acts paul for council hanyecz th,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn.criminal laundering of political campaign money see also cohen brown th,criminal extortion novartis vaccines diagnostics,stop huntington animal cruelty usa,th,conspiracy to commit acts of harassment and vandalism,including criminal acts.
several court of appeal opinions have rejected attempts to apply the rule from flatley,supra,cal th,to noncriminal conduct.mendoza adp screening selection services,th,held that the rule from flatley applies only to conduct that is criminally illegal,rather than merely in violation of a statute.cabral martins th,held that litigation conduct by attorneys allegedly in violation of statutes authorizing treble damages for assisting in the evasion of child support obligations was not illegal within the meaning of the rule from flatley.cabral stated that even if the attorneys conduct violated the statutes,the conduct was neither inherently criminal nor otherwise outside the scope of normal,routine legal services,and this is not the kind of illegality involved in flatley maura,supra,cal th,and paul for council hanyecz,supra,th.id.at,fn.omitted.intelligator th,followed cabral in holding that an attorney admitted failure to redact certain information from credit reports filed with the court in a dissolution action,in violation of rule of the california rules of court,was not the type of criminal activity involved in flatley and paul for council and therefore was not subject to the rule from flatley.similarly,price operating engineers local union th,followed mendoza in holding that defamatory speech was not illegal within the meaning of flatley.see also cross cooper th.
consistent with these authorities,we hold that the rule from flatley,supra,cal th,is limited to criminal conduct.conduct in violation of an attorney duties of confidentiality and loyalty to a former client can not be illegal as a matter of law id.at,within the meaning of flatley,so the statute is not inapplicable on this basis.
cases finding the anti slapp statute inapplicable in actions by clients against their own attorneys for breach of professional duties are distinguishable 
frc contends the is an action by a client against an attorney for breach of professional duties and the statute categorically does not apply to such an action.frc overstates the rule,and the cases finding the statute inapplicable in actions against attorneys for breach of professional duties are distinguishable.
several cases have held that the statute was inapplicable in actions by clients against their own attorneys because the gravamen or principal thrust of the particular causes of action did not concern a statement made in connection with litigation,but instead concerned some other conduct allegedly constituting a breach of professional duty.prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th,simultaneous representation of clients with conflicting interests hylton frank rogozienski,th,inducing the plaintiff to agree to an unconscionable attorney fee united states fire ins.sheppard,mullin,richter hampton llp th,acceptance of representation adverse to the plaintiff freeman schack th,same see also benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,stating that the action arose from the acceptance of representation adverse to the plaintiff rather than the litigation conduct that followed.thus,those courts concluded that any statements made in connection with the litigation were merely incidental to the causes of action.united states fire,supra,th at freeman,supra,th at see prediwave,supra,th at implying the same benasra,supra,th at same.these cases are distinguishable because the gravamen of frc counts for breach of confidence,breach of fiduciary duty,and equitable indemnity is that faigin violated his professional duties owed to his former clients by making the statements to the commissioner,rather than by some other conduct.faigin statements made to the commissioner are not merely incidental to these causes of action.see mindys cosmetics,dakar cir,distinguishing this same line of cases on similar grounds.
the same is true of the count for violation of rule c.although frc alleges that faigin violated rule c by simultaneously representing clients with conflicting interests,the alleged violation is based on faigin statements to the commissioner,and the alleged injury arises exclusively from that event we conclude that this count is based on faigin statements to the commissioner and that those statements are not merely incidental to the cause of action.
kolar donahue,mcintosh hammerton th kolar stated more broadly than the cases cited above that the statute does not apply to a cause of action by a client against the client own attorney based on conduct undertaken on behalf of the client.id.at.kolar explained that a garden variety malpractice cause of action does not have a chilling effect on advocacy or any other petitioning activity see,subd.a,but instead encourages competent and zealous representation.kolar,supra,at.kolar also stated that the client in a malpractice suit is not suing because the attorney petitioned on his or her behalf,but because the attorney did not competently represent the client interests while doing so.ibid.kolar concluded that a malpractice cause of action ordinarily does not arise from petitioning activity undertaken on behalf of the client,but instead arises from the attorney failure to competently represent the client in engaging in that activity.id.at.similarly,prediwave,supra,th at page,concluded in an alternative holding that the statute does not apply to a client causes of action against the client own attorney arising from activities undertaken for that client.robles chalilpoyil th,reached essentially the same conclusion.
kolar,supra,th,and the other cases holding that the statute does not apply to a cause of action by a client against the client own attorney based on conduct undertaken on behalf of the client are distinguishable.frc does not allege that faigin breached his professional duties in the course of representing frc as a client in litigation.faigin did not represent frc in connection with the liquidation proceeding at the time of his statements to the commissioner,and he was not acting on behalf of frc in making those statements.instead,frc alleges that faigin breached his professional duties owed to frc as a former client by informing the commissioner that frc was going to auction artworks purportedly belonging to an insolvent insurer.the concerns expressed in kolar and other cases regarding an attorney representation of a client in litigation therefore are inapposite here.
accordingly,frc has not shown that the statute is inapplicable on these grounds.
frc established a probability of prevailing on its counts for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty 
a.the litigation privilege is inapplicable 
a plaintiff can not establish a probability of prevailing if the litigation privilege precludes the defendant liability on the claim.flatley,supra,cal th at seltzer barnes th.contrary to the trial court,however,we conclude that the litigation privilege is inapplicable.
the litigation privilege precludes liability arising from a publication or broadcast made in a judicial proceeding or other official proceeding the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that has some connection or logical relation to the action.citation.the privilege is not limited to statements made during a trial or other proceedings,but may extend to steps taken prior thereto,or afterwards.citation.action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,action apartment.
the purposes of section,subdivision b,are to afford litigants and witnesses free access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions,to encourage open channels of communication and zealous advocacy,to promote complete and truthful testimony,to give finality to judgments,and to avoid unending litigation.citation.to effectuate these purposes,the litigation privilege is absolute and applies regardless of malice.citation.moreover,i n furtherance of the public policy purposes it is designed to serve,the privilege prescribed by section,subdivision b has been given broad application.citation.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at.
a prelitigation communication is privileged only if it relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.action apartment,supra,cal th at.good faith in this context refers to a good faith intention to file a lawsuit rather than a good faith belief in the truth of the communication.ibid.the requirement of good faith contemplation and serious consideration provides some assurance that the communication has some connection or logical relation to a contemplated action and is made to achieve the objects of the litigation.ibid.
the litigation privilege does not apply to malicious prosecution actions.albertson raboff cal d.albertson explained,t he policy of encouraging free access to the courts that underlies the absolute privilege applicable in defamation actions is outweighed by the policy of affording redress for individual wrongs when the requirements of favorable termination,lack of probable cause,and malice are satisfied.accord,action apartment,supra,cal th at.
in mattco forge,arthur young th,we held that the litigation privilege did not apply to an action against the plaintiff own expert witness in prior litigation for professional malpractice,breach of contract,and other counts.id.at.we distinguished cases holding that the litigation privilege protected a expert witness from suit by an opposing party and cases involving neutral experts.id.at.we stated that applying the privilege to protect an expert witness from suit by the party who hired the expert would not promote free access to the courts or encourage witnesses to testify truthfully.id.at.we noted,by analogy,that if the litigation privilege protected an attorney from any action by a former client,no malpractice suit could be brought.id.at.we held that applying the litigation privilege to protect an expert witness from suit by the party who hired the expert would not further the policies underlying the privilege and that the privilege therefore was inapplicable.ibid.
kolar,supra,th,similarly held that the litigation privilege did not apply to a legal malpractice action against the plaintiff own attorney in prior litig
