an heir hunter locates a missing or lost heir.as consideration for information concerning the inheritance,the heir executes an assignment giving the heir hunter a percentage of the inheritance.she also signs,but later revokes,a general power of attorney in favor of the attorney who represents the heir hunter.she also refuses to sign a letter authorizing the attorney to represent her even though the heir hunter agreed to pay the attorney fees.
we hold that under these circumstances,the heir hunter assignment is valid.we also conclude that the general power of attorney in favor of the attorney contravenes public policy and is void.
dorothy ann gunning appeals an order denying a petition to invalidate an assignment of her interest in the estate of edward henry wright to an heir hunter,or alternatively,to limit the heir hunter compensation,subds.g,h,estate of mcpherson d.we affirm.
on july,edward henry wright died intestate.wright,a widower,had no children but three siblings survived him.wright brother resided in florida,and a sister resided in north carolina.
on august,attorney david turpin filed a petition for letters of administration as the nominee of wright brother and sister.turpin requested that the probate court fix a bond,the estimated value of the estate.
in the petition for letters of administration,turpin stated that the address of the decedent second sister,dorothy ann gunning,was unknown to her siblings.turpin requested that the probate court authorize him to employ an heir hunter,francis see,at an hourly rate to locate gunning.turpin stated that gunning lived at times in petaluma,california,las vegas,or reno,nevada,and manchester,new hampshire.the probate court approved the petition and the employment of see at a hourly rate,not to exceed.
the petition for letters of administration,the estimated value of the estate,and the statement that gunning whereabouts were unknown,did not escape the interest of heir hunters.david franklin,a licensed private investigator specializing in heir hunting,soon learned of the petition for letters and the missing heir.franklin employees searched telephone listings and public records in california,nevada,and new hampshire for information regarding gunning,without success.
on august,franklin referred the search to joseph caudill,a licensed private investigator and heir hunter in colorado.caudill searched computer data bases for telephone listings,voter records,real property records,driving records,and social security death records.from this search,he found addresses for gunning in reno,nevada.by telephone,caudill spoke with landlords and neighbors at these addresses and obtained gunning social security number.
caudill located gunning employer in reno by using her social security number.he then arranged for jonathan lowden,an employee of a california licensed private investigator,to travel to reno to find gunning.lowden visited gunning employer in reno and learned that she had worked there recently.as lowden spoke with persons outside a casino that gunning frequented,she walked across the street.
according to gunning,lowden identified himself and informed her that she had inherited money but had to sign the papers to learn of the inheritance.otherwise,he warned that she might never find out where her inheritance came from and might lose a great sum of money 
lowden declared that he informed gunning that he could not disclose the provenance of the estate funds unless she signed an assignment in favor of heir hunter caudill.lowden declared that he also advised gunning that it was quite possible that she could learn of the inheritance some other way.according to lowden,gunning responded,in essence what the hell.let do it.
on september,gunning executed an agreement and assignment giving caudill percent of her inheritance in consideration of the information given her and for research done regarding the inheritance.gunning also executed a limited power of attorney in favor of caudill to order and receive any and all documentation relating to her identity or the identity of her parents.
in addition,lowden presented gunning with a general power of attorney in favor of a san francisco attorney,john boessenecker.the power of attorney authorized boessenecker to exercise or perform any act,power,duty,right or obligation whatsoever that gunning now has or may hereafter acquire it specifically included the right to order and receive documents concerning gunning identity or that of her parents,and the power to perform financial transactions and to accept and endorse bank drafts.
lowden later gave gunning an agreement authorizing boessenecker to represent her.in part,the agreement provided i gunning am informed that,insofar as there is no conflict of interest,and none arises,you boessenecker are willing to represent me for the purpose of establishing and protecting my right to inherit from the estate and in obtaining distribution in the event a dispute arises over my relationship to the decedent,my right to inherit,ownership or title to property in the decedent estate,or over any other matter involving he estate,i authorize you to act appear on my behalf in settling said dispute or adverse claims,providing that such action shall be without cost or any fees or expenses to me.the agreement provided that caudill would pay all attorney fees and that gunning was not to be obligated for any attorney fees.
although gunning executed the general power of attorney in favor of boessenecker,she refused to execute the agreement authorizing him to represent her in the probate,thereby revoking the power of attorney.indeed,gunning thereafter employed a reno law firm to represent her.boessenecker wrote gunning and confirmed that he would not be representing her any further and will not be taking any further action on her behalf.
wright heirs soon learned that his estate was worth approximately million.gunning then sought an order from the probate court invalidating her assignment to caudill,or alternatively,limiting his compensation,subds.c,c.among other things,she asserted that she was years old,was down on her luck,had only five dollars to her name,was unemployed and was staying temporarily at a friend apartment when lowden asked her to execute the agreement and assignment and powers of attorney.she insisted that she had contacted family members over the years and was not a missing or lost heir.gunning argued that the assignment was induced by fraud and moreover,neither caudill nor lowden possessed a california private investigator license.bus,subd.a.
the probate court concluded that the assignment was not induced by fraud,undue influence,or duress.the court characterized the assignment as a legitimate business transaction,authorized by statute.it rejected gunning arguments and refused to invalidate the assignment or to reduce caudill compensation.
gunning appeals and challenges the agreement and assignment to caudill on public policy and statutory grounds.
discussion 
gunning argues that the agreement and assignment is void because caudill engaged in the unlawful practice of law and the solicitation of clients for an attorney.estate of butler cal d,contacting heirs,securing their authorization to appear for them,and employing counsel to represent them is commercial exploitation of the legal profession and contrary to public policy witkin,cal.procedure ed.attorneys,w hen the heir hunting business involves solicitation of contracts with heirs to furnish counsel and prosecute their claims,it constitutes illegal practice of law.she points out that it is unlawful to solicit business for an attorney or to practice ambulance chasing.bus,subd.a unlawful for person to act as a runner or capper or to solicit business for an attorney estate of butler,supra,cal d,rules of conduct,rule prohibiting solicitation of clients with whom attorney has no family or prior professional relationship.
