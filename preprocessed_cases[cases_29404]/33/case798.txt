this appeal is taken from an order denying the motion of appellant hartford casualty insurance company hartford to disqualify the law firm of wilkins,drolshagen czeshinski llp the firm from representing respondent claude jessen,doing business as ethylene jessen,in this action against appellant.respondent counsel of record,james wilkins,a partner in the firm,was once an attorney with mccormick,barstow,sheppard,wayte carruth mccormick,where he had represented appellant in numerous matters.
the trial court found that prior orders denying motions by appellant to disqualify wilkins and the firm from representing the plaintiffs in two earlier federal court actions against appellant operated to collaterally estop appellant from disqualifying wilkins and the firm in this action.because we find in the unpublished portion of this opinion that this ruling was erroneous,we will reverse and remand,with directions to the trial court to rehear the motion on its merits and to apply the correct legal substantial relationship we address in the published portion of this opinion.flatt superior court cal th,d,flatt ahmanson salomon brothers,d.ahmanson.
jessen is a named insured under a commercial general liability policy issued by hartford.jessen was sued in fresno county superior court by ethylene control,for a variety of alleged business torts.jessen tendered the defense of the action to hartford,but hartford denied coverage.jessen then sued hartford for breach of the insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
hartford moved to disqualify wilkins and the firm on the ground that wilkins had personally represented hartford in no less than twenty matters while employed as an associate attorney with mccormick and thus his representation of jessen in this action violated his duty of loyalty to hartford.in its moving papers,hartford presented evidence of the nature and extent of wilkins prior representation of hartford when wilkins was with mccormick.wilkins,in opposition to the motion,provided the court with two orders of the united states district court for the eastern district of california,issued in separate actions against hartford by plaintiffs who were represented by wilkins.hartford had made unsuccessful attempts in the actions to disqualify wilkins and the firm from representing the plaintiffs.
relying upon the orders entered in the two federal actions,the trial court here denied hartford motion to disqualify wilkins and the firm.applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the trial court found that t he issue of wilkins disqualification from representing clients with adverse interests to that of his former client,hartford,has been litigated twice in the united states district court.a determination has been made on the merits that no grounds for disqualification exist.
wilkins was an insurance coverage attorney with mccormick from to.between and approximately wilkins worked on no less than matters for which mccormick was counsel for hartford.according to wilkins,much of his representation of hartford involved rendering coverage opinions,which consisted of an analysis of the facts and circumstances relevant to a claim as documented in the specific claim file.although this work may have included contacts with hartford directly,any such communications were limited to the facts of the particular claim and did not include analysis,review or consideration of hartford claim handling procedures and practices.in addition to preparing and signing coverage opinions,wilkins was counsel of record for hartford in six bad faith actions,three declaratory actions and one declaratory subrogation action.
according to hartford,in the course of providing it with representation in the various matters,wilkins would have personally determined,and advised hartford about,whether hartford had a duty to defend and whether the relevant policy provided coverage for the claim,evaluated the existence of any defenses available to hartford and whether hartford was estopped from asserting or waiving any of its available defenses,determined whether hartford should reserve its rights and whether further investigation was required before a decision on the claim was made,evaluated any settlement offers and whether to make a settlement offer,and analyzed the provisions of the hartford policies that addressed such topics as what constitutes an accident,a personal injury as opposed to an injury to property,an advertising injury,and an intentional act.
according to wilkins,his representation of hartford was limited.he stated hartford was not a significant client of mccormick.wilkins also said he never learned of,obtained or otherwise became aware of confidential information during his prior representation of hartford which could in any way be used adversely to hartford in this proceeding.he denied undertaking any work in the development,implementation or application of any claims handling practices,strategies or procedures hartford may have had or put in place during the relevant time frame.he stated that none of the matters for which he provided legal representation to hartford required analysis or review of hartford claim handling practices or procedures,and that while at mccormick,he was not involved in any discussions regarding hartford own internal policies,procedures,practices or customs.
a motion to disqualify counsel brings the client right to the attorney of his or her choice into conflict with the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil change systems metro,tracinda th,d.the paramount concern is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.comden superior court cal d,see also river west,nickel d.river west.we review the trial court decision under the familiar abuse of discretion standard.speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d.
a trial court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the court inherent power to control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.code civ,subd.a.an attorney is required to avoid the representation of adverse interests and can not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.rules conduct,rule e.
for the most part,rule e has been invoked in two the attorney successively represents clients with potential or actual adverse interests and where the attorney simultaneously represents clients with potential or actual adverse interests.see flatt,supra,cal th at,d.according to flatt,when the facts involve successive representation,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations in order to obtain the disqualification of the target attorney.id.at,d.when the facts involve simultaneous representation,the rule of disqualification,in all but a few instances,is a per se or automatic one.flatt at,d.
the present situation involves successive representation the trial court was therefore called upon to apply the substantial relationship test in ruling upon hartford motion 
the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.where the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated,access to confidential information by the attorney in the course of the first representation relevant,by definition,to the second representation is presumed and disqualification of the attorney representation of the second client is mandatory flatt,supra,cal th at,d.
this standard,with its conclusive presumption of knowledge of confidential information,is justified as a rule of necessity because 
it is not within the power of the former client to prove what is in the mind of the attorney.nor should the attorney have to engage in a subtle evaluation of the extent to which he acquired relevant information in the first representation and of the actual use of that knowledge and information in the subsequent representation.citations.the conclusive presumption also avoids the ironic result of disclosing the former client confidences and secrets through an inquiry into the actual state of the lawyer knowledge and it makes clear the legal profession intent to preserve the public trust over its own.citations.ahmanson,supra,d at.
we expressed the same thoughts in river west,supra,d at.
i n the usual case when the substantial relationship of the matters is established,the inquiry ends and the disqualification should be ordered.if it were otherwise,a weighing process would be inevitable.the rights of the former client would be lined up against those of the new client,perhaps to the detriment of both.the purpose of the substantial relationship test is to avoid such an inquiry.see also rosenfeld construction superior court d.
this court,in river west,described the substantial relationship test as requiring the former client to show no more than that the matters embraced within the pending suit wherein his former attorney appears on behalf of his adversary are substantially related to the matters or cause of action wherein the attorney previously represented him,the former client.if the former client succeeds in doing so,the court will assume that during the course of the former representation confidences were disclosed to the attorney bearing on the subject matter of the representation and it will not inquire into their nature and extent.river west,supra,d at,emphasis added.the court felt that imposing this low threshold of proof upon the aggrieved client was the best method of enforcing the lawyer duty of absolute fidelity and of implementing the spirit of rule e.id.at.
the river west court referred to the supreme court opinion in people ex rel.deukmejian brown cal d,deukmejian.river west nickel,supra,d at.in deukmejian,a third party had filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging a specific state statute.the attorney general,through his deputies,met once with representatives of the state agencies named as respondents and outlined their options with respect to the petition.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.this single conference was the only communication between the attorney general and the agencies,and the record did not show that any confidential information actually had been disclosed to the attorney general.id.at.thereafter,the attorney general withdrew from representation of the agencies,told them to obtain independent counsel,and initiated his own mandate proceeding against the agencies.id.at.on these facts,the supreme court held that the attorney general was forbidden from proceeding with his mandamus petition because of his prior relationship with the state agencies.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
the court in ahmanson,supra,d at,added an element to the substantial relationship test,in part because the ahmanson court found inherent in the substantial relationship approach the problem of just what meaning to give those two words.
the word substantial,like other nonquantifiable denominators of measurement,is subject to a variety of interpretations.use of the word relationship implies a connection,but offers no guidance as to what is being connected subject matters,facts,or issues.ahmanson,supra,d at.
this and other perceived difficulties,including the potential for abuse in order to harass or pressure the client or to delay the case,prompted the ahmanson court to put a pragmatic definition on the words substantial relationship by focus ing upon the nature of the former representation.ahmanson,supra,d at.thus,
the attorney possession of confidential information will be presumed only when a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation,and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney citations.under this formulation of the test,the courts focus less on the meaning of the words substantial and relationship and look instead at the practical consequences of the attorney representation of the former client.the courts ask whether confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney by virtue of the nature of the former representation.ahmanson,supra,d at,emphasis added.
explaining further,the court found reason to differentiate for disqualification purposes between lawyers who become heavily involved in the facts of a particular matter and those who enter briefly on the periphery for a limited and specific purpose related solely to legal questions.ahmanson,supra,d at.the ahmanson court felt that its formula protected the confidences of the former client when the attorney has been in a position to learn them but did not require disqualification when there is no realistic chance that confidences were disclosed.id.at.
four years after river west,we reaffirmed the principle that the proper standard for assessing disqualification in successive representation cases is the substantial relationship test.rosenfeld construction superior court,supra,d at.rosenfeld concerned representation which had occurred some time before the then pending litigation,in a different lawsuit with different parties.d at.under these circumstances and citing extensively to ahmanson,we concluded that whether a substantial relationship existed between the former and the current representations should be determined by reference to the similarity between the compared cases and the nature and extent of the attorney involvement with those cases.rosenfeld,at.see also fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d.
the substantial relationship test has been repeatedly intoned and applied by the courts of appeal in a variety of circumstances.see,city national bank adams,supra,th at,d fox searchlight pictures,paladino,supra,th at,d morrison knudsen hancock,rothert bunshoft th,d adams th,d frazier superior court th,d civil service commission superior court d.dill superior court d.klein superior court d.
we agree that the question whether an attorney should be disqualified in a successive representation case turns on two variables the relationship between the legal problem involved in the former representation and the legal problem involved in the current representation,and the relationship between the attorney and the former client with respect to the legal problem involved in the former representation.we emphasize,however,the significance of the latter factor in the application of the ahmanson formula.if the relationship between the attorney and the former client is shown to have been is,where the lawyer was personally involved in providing legal advice and services to the former it must be presumed that confidential information has passed to the attorney and there can not be any delving into the specifics of the communications between the attorney and the former client in an effort to show that the attorney did or did not receive confidential information during the course of that relationship.as a result,disqualification will depend upon the strength of the similarities between the legal problem involved in the former representation and the legal problem involved in the current representation.this is so because a direct relationship is inherently one during which confidential information would normally have been imparted to the attorney by virtue of the nature of that sort of former representation,and therefore it will b
