this case is before the court on appeal from an order granting a motion to vacate a conviction of murder and a sentence of death under florida rule of criminal procedure.because the order concerns postconviction relief from a capital conviction for which a sentence of death was imposed,this court has jurisdiction of the appeal under article v,section b,florida constitution.for the reasons expressed below,we affirm the trial court order granting the defendant a new penalty phase but reverse that portion of the order granting him a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
