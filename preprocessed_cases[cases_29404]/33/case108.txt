background 
the following history of the rule genesis is drawn from the reports of the office of the inspector general for fiduciary appointments and the commission on fiduciary appointments,see office of the inspector general for fiduciary appointments,fiduciary appointments in new york a report to chief judge judith kaye and chief administrative judge jonathan lippman,special inspector general report report of the commission on fiduciary appointments commission report,as well as the affidavit of defendant jonathan lippman,chief administrative judge of the state of new york.kraham has not disputed the factual accuracy of any of these materials.
new york courts appoint fiduciaries to assist courts and litigants in a number of capacities,including as guardians for incapacitated persons,receivers for properties involved in foreclosure proceedings,and guardians ad litem for children involved in litigation.in general,fiduciary appointees are private attorneys who are compensated from the assets of the individuals or businesses they have been assigned to represent or manage,and many fiduciary positions are highly remunerative.because judges historically have had unregulated discretion to make these appointments,the process has been susceptible to example,by judges choosing appointees based on political has long been a subject of public attention and controversy.beginning in,new york undertook a number of reforms in the hopes of eliminating corruption in the process,but none successfully alleviated the problem in january,public concerns about political influence in court fiduciary appointments reached a peak,after the press published a letter written by two disgruntled attorneys seeking to perpetuate their receipt of brooklyn supreme court appointments as a political reward for service to their party.
in response to the explosion of public concern generated by the letter disclosure,and the resulting impairment of public confidence in the judicial system,chief judge judith kaye announced a comprehensive program to reform the appointment process.to further this purpose,she established a commission on fiduciary appointments the commission and an office of the special inspector general for fiduciary matters the special inspector general,and charged them with gathering data on appointments and making recommendations for improved practices.after conducting investigations,these bodies released to the chief judge detailed reports documenting widespread problems in the appointment process,including appointments based on political party connections.see special inspector general report at,commission report at.for example,the special inspector general found that one county political leader had received nearly one hundred appointments,another had received over appointments,and an attorney whose small law firm employs another county leader had received nearly one hundred appointments.see commission report at describing information gathered by special inspector general.in light of these findings,the commission recommended that political party leaders,their immediate relatives,and the partners,legal associates,and other employees of their law firms be prohibited from receiving judicial appointments while the leaders served and for two years after resigning their positions.id.at.
in consultation with the administrative board of the courts and with the approval of the new york court of appeals,chief judge kaye responded to these recommendations by adopting a new part of the rules of the chief judge this rule contained the following provision 
no person who is the chair or executive director,or their equivalent,of a state or county political party,or the spouse,sibling,parent or child of that official,shall be appointed while that official serves in that position and for a period of two years after that official no longer holds that position.this prohibition shall apply to the members,associates,counsel and employees of any law firms or entities while the official is associated with that firm or entity.
regs.tit,c i.the rule was to become effective june,but contained a grandfather clause allowing incumbent party chairs to avoid future restrictions on appointments by resigning their positions before january.
kraham,a lawyer licensed to practice in the state of new york,was elected in september to serve as of the orange county democratic committee.she remained in her position after the adoption of the rule,and,around the time it went into effect,began seeking legal employment.according to kraham complaint,the rule prevented her from securing work as an attorney for approximately one year.specifically,she claims she was denied three legal employment to form a partnership with another attorney,and two to join existing law members of the law firms did not want to become ineligible for judicial appointments.she wrote to the office of court administration describing her financial hardship and seeking a waiver of the rule,but counsel to the unified court system responded that the rule was an absolute bar that did not allow for any waivers.
kraham filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that in limiting her employment opportunities because of her party leadership,the rule violated her freedom of political association as protected by the first amendment.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,and this appeal followed we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.
