canatella involvement in nine other matters also was the subject of discipline.
sanctions were ordered against him or his clients times.courts repeatedly found him responsible for frivolous,meritless and vexatious actions.sanctions totaled more than in one matter,and the opposing parties were granted all fees and costs in another.

in mitigation,canatella has no record of discipline since beginning to practice law in and he demonstrated his good character by presenting testimonials from eight people,including four attorneys and three judges.he also presented a lengthy list of his professional accomplishments.
in addition to containing an electronic version of the california bar journal,the california bar website also contains a member search function that allows the public to search for information on california attorneys.before,if a member had a disciplinary record,a member search would only reveal the not the that record.at some point after march,however,that same search would reveal both the existence of a disciplinary record and the california bar journal summary of that record consequently,at some point after august the same disciplinary summary that appeared in the online california bar journal also appeared in response to a member search for canatella name.

canatella challenges the district court decision granting appellees motion to dismiss his claims pursuant to rule b.because limited matters outside the pleading s were presented to the district court in ruling on that motion,canatella motion is treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule.fed.civ.b.we review such rulings de novo.orr bank of,cir.in so doing,w e must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all justifiable inferences in its favor,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.accord celotex catrett,d.furthermore,a district court decision as to whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is reviewed de novo,santa maria pac.bell,cir,as is the question of when the statute of limitations begins to run,orr,at.applying that standard,we affirm the district court decision because under california law,the statute of limitations ran on canatella claims before he filed his complaint
