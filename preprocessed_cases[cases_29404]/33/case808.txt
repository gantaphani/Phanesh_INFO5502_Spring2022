an attorney representing a corporate defendant in a class action lawsuit concerning overtime wages for managers declared before the court that his firm represented both the defendant and its managers.he later clarified that his only intention in so declaring was to put opposing counsel on notice that the defendant corporation managerial agents were represented parties to the extent provided in state bar rules of professional conduct,rule but that he certainly did not mean to convey the impression that he represented the managers in their individual capacities.of course,the obvious albeit unspoken corollary was that if the proscriptions of rule were successfully invoked,his client would gain a tactical advantage in discovery.in any event,the attorney supplemental declarations were too late.he had already conveyed the impression that he baldly professed to represent all parties to the action,both the plaintiffs and the defendant.the trial court disqualified his firm from further participation in the case.the defendant challenges the disqualification on appeal.
we hold that an attorney unilateral declaration regarding representation can not,by itself,create an relationship when none otherwise exists.here,there was no evidence,other than the erroneous declaration,that the law firm in fact represented the interests of the managers both as corporate representatives and as potential class members.there was no evidence that any of the potential class members had hired the law firm.there being no relationship,it was an abuse of discretion to disqualify the law firm,thereby necessitating that the defendant find another law firm to pick up the ball and continue the defense of the potentially massive and costly lawsuit.we reverse and remand.
factsa.class action filings 
kerry bartlett bartlett filed a class action complaint,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,alleging that defendant rubio restaurants,rubio failed to pay salaried general managers and assistant managers overtime compensation bartlett rubio restaurants,super.orange county,the bartlett action.gabriel koo koo filed a similar class action complaint koo rubio restaurant,super.orange county,the koo action.
motion to compel 
the law firm of righetti wynne righetti,representing bartlett,sought to discover the names,addresses and telephone numbers of all of rubio managers.rubio objected to the request.consequently,righetti filed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories,stating the information sought was directly relevant to class certification.
in response to the motion to compel,the law firm of carlton,disante freudenberger carlton,representing rubio,filed an opposition,a responsive separate statement,and a supporting declaration of counsel.the responsive separate statement and declaration of counsel each contained wording that may have been merely sloppy,or may have been crafted when the writer attention was focused on winning the immediate discovery battle.
among other things,rubio responsive separate statement contained the following language rule prohibits ex parte communications with a represented party about the subject of the representation.here,rubio counsel represents rubio current assistant and general managers.freudenberger.therefore,plaintiff counsel can not directly contact these individuals without rubio consent.the responsive statement,in distinguishing the case of atari,superior court d.dealing with the right of the defendant to contact potential class members,also stated further,atari does not address a plaintiff counsel right to directly contact current managerial employees represented by defendant counsel,as is the case here.in his declaration in support of the opposition,attorney timothy freudenberger freudenberger stated flatly rubio has retained my law firm to represent all of its district managers,general managers,and assistant managers in connection with this lawsuit.as such,my firm represents all current managerial employees of rubio in this matter.
the motion to compel in the bartlett action was heard before judge raymond ikola.judge ikola indicated a need to impose some regulation on bartlett contact with the current rubio managers.counsel for bartlett remarked at the hearing that rubio counsel was claiming to represent both the employer and certain members of the potential class.he further expressed his opinion that it was a conflict of interest.in response,freudenberger stated,my firm represents rubio.we have an relationship with rubio.by virtue of that,we represent the managerial managers of rubio the case of any communication or depositions with the plaintiffs counsel.
the judge remarked that little discovery had been done and that in order to develop facts relevant to class certification bartlett could take a representative sampling of the depositions of current rubio managers.he further explained to bartlett counsel that he could have full access to the current managers,but only by deposition.a formal order to that effect was entered.
consolidation 
subsequently,the bartlett and koo actions were consolidated,with the koo action designated the lead case.the cases were assigned to judge robert jameson for all purposes.
motion to disqualify 
shortly thereafter,righetti,on behalf of bartlett,filed a motion to disqualify carlton,on the basis of the statements rubio and freudenberger had made in opposing the motion to compel.the motion to disqualify cited the language contained in rubio responsive separate statement and in freudenberger declaration.
rubio filed an opposition to the motion to disqualify,coupled with a second declaration of freudenberger.rubio tried hard to clarify its previous loose language with respect to carlton representation of the individual managers.it endeavored to make clear that the statements of both itself and freudenberger,made in opposition to the motion to compel,were not intended to establish an relationship with the current managing agents of the corporation.rather,they were intended only to assert the application of rule with respect to those managing agents and to put righetti on notice that it was required to comply with the rule.
rubio further explained why it was so important to inform righetti of its assertion that rule was applicable,given the prior history between righetti and carlton in unrelated litigation.righetti and carlton had previously opposed each other in another class action,perry bank super.alameda county,the perry action.according to rubio,righetti,representing the named plaintiff in the perry action,had contacted numerous current managerial employees of the defendant corporation by mail and telephone.carlton,on behalf of the defendant corporation,filed a motion to disqualify righetti.attorney edward wynne of the righetti firm filed a declaration in the perry action explaining that righetti communications with absent class members took place in order to investigate the case.he further declared that until he was served with the motion to disqualify his firm,he had no idea that d efense counsel claimed to represent any absent class members rubio anticipated that righetti would employ the same tactics in this litigation,unless put on notice of the claimed application of rule.
despite rubio explanation,at the hearing on bartlett motion to disqualify,the court indicated carlton appeared to have an irremediable conflict.in response,freudenberger reiterated that carlton was not counsel to any current managers of rubio.it was counsel to rubio,the corporate defendant,and only rubio.he continued w e represent rubio only.and our representation of managerial agents of rubio is only in their representative capacity as managerial agents of rubio.we absolutely do not,have not,have never stated that we represent current managers in their individual capacity.we certainly do not.we represent rubio only,the corporate defendant.the court,having heard freudenberger explanation,granted the motion to disqualify.
motion for reconsideration 
having been unsuccessful on its legal arguments in its opposition to the motion to disqualify,rubio resolved to try to put some factual information before the court concerning the lack of any actual relationship between carlton and rubio individual managers.it filed a motion for reconsideration.in that motion,rubio conceded that the first freudenberger declaration was poorly worded.
in addition,rubio stated the declaration was incorrectly interpreted as meaning that carlton had undertaken the representation of the individual interests of rubio current assistant and general managers,in addition to rubio interests,in this litigation.any such interpretation,however,is completely inaccurate.carlton has been retained by,and only represents,rubio in this litigation.moreover,carlton has never taken any action in furtherance of a representation of the individual interests of rubio current assistant and general managers.no attorney or other employee of carlton has had any contact with any of rubio current assistant and general managers.carlton has obtained no confidential information from these individuals nor provided these individuals with any advice as to their rights in this litigation.in short,carlton has no relationship whatsoever with rubio current assistant and general managers.without an relationship,carlton can not be disqualified for purportedly representing clients with potentially conflicting interests.boldface in original.
in support of its position,rubio offered yet another declaration of freudenberger.freudenberger reiterated that carlton had had no contact with any of rubio current assistant or general managers and that its only client in the litigation was rubio 
the court denied the motion for reconsideration.rubio filed an appeal from the disqualification order.
analysisa.standard of review 
in reviewing a court order granting a motion to disqualify,we generally apply the abuse of discretion standard.frazier superior court th,d.in deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion,w e are bound by the substantial evidence rule.citations.the judgment of the trial court is presumed correct all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support the judgment conflicts in the declarations must be resolved in favor of the prevailing party,and the trial court resolution of any factual disputes arising from the evidence is conclusive.citations.citation.strasbourger pearson tulcin wolff wiz technology,th,d.
basis of disqualification 
the order disqualifying carlton contains no findings and the record contains no statement of decision.however,at the hearing on the motion to disqualify,the court articulated its viewpoint that freudenberger first declaration,to the effect that he had been retained to represent rubio managers,gave rise to an irremediable conflict.taking these comments into consideration,bartlett and koo conclude that carlton was disqualified due to a violation of rule.
rule c,provides a member shall not,without the informed written consent of each client accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict i n all but a few instances,the rule of disqualification in simultaneous representation cases is a per se or automatic one.citations.gilbert national for housing partnerships th,d.
according to bartlett and koo,this clinches it.as they see it,freudenberger declared that carlton simultaneously represented both the potential class members,rubio managers,and the defendant employer,rubio.as far as bartlett and koo are concerned,since carlton apparently did not obtain conflict waivers from its various clients,this should be the end of the discussion.they contend freudenberger declaration was not only substantial evidence,but unequivocal evidence supporting the order.furthermore,they insist that it would have been an abuse of discretion had the court denied the motion to disqualify.
we disagree.disqualification was not proper unless an relationship existed between carlton and the managers.strasbourger pearson tulcin wolff wiz technology,supra,th at,d.before an attorney may be disqualified from representing a party in litigation because his representation of that party is adverse to the interest of a current or former client,it must first be established that the party seeking the attorney disqualification was or is represented by the attorney in a manner giving rise to an relationship.citations.civil service com.superior court d.the burden is on the party seeking disqualification to establish the relationship.in re lee th,d.
relationship 
creation of relationship 
here,bartlett and koo failed to meet their burden,because freudenberger declaration alone did not suffice to create an relationship.an relationship is not created by the unilateral declaration of one party to the relationship.see fox pollack d.individuals can not unilaterally create an relationship without the agreement of the attorney.rather,the relationship can only be created by contract,express or implied.responsible citizens superior court th,d fox pollack,supra,d at.
freudenberger,in an effort to urge the application of rule,declared that his firm represented both rubio and its managers.but freudenberger loose language in that declaration can not serve to create an relationship if no express or implied contract in fact existed between carlton and the individual managers.there is no evidence that the individual managers agreed to be represented by carlton.
evidence of relationship 
aside from the first two freudenberger declarations,the only other evidence submitted to the court before it ruled on the motion to disqualify was the declaration of deborah beasley,rubio director of human resources.in her declaration,beasley stated rubio restaurants,has retained carlton to represent it in the bartlett action and the koo action.rubio has also,as a matter of course,instructed carlton to represent its managerial agents,including rubio current assistant and general managers,as part of its representation of rubio,and on behalf of rubio,in this litigation.
the term managerial agents would appear to be derived from rule b,which provides that a party represented by counsel,for the purposes of the rule,includes a managing agent of a corporation.in other words,it would appear rubio intention was to invoke the proscriptions of rule against ex parte communications with its managing agents,who were deemed represented parties within the meaning of the rule.
it would also appear that the intention,as expressed in the beasley declaration,was for carlton to represent the general and assistant managers in their capacities as representatives of the corporation,inasmuch as they can only be managerial agents when they act in their representative capacities.there is no indication that rubio hired carlton to represent the managers in the pursuit of their individual claims,if any,against rubio.furthermore,just as freudenberger lacked the ability to create an relationship between carlton and the managers in their individual capacities,beasley had no capacity to establish that relationship by virtue of her unilateral declaration.fox pollack,supra,d at.
this interpretation of the beasley declaration is supported by the second freudenberger declaration.in that declaration,freudenberger set forth the history of the perry action.he stated that he had anticipated that righetti would make the same argument in the bartlett and koo actions as it had in the perry action,to the effect that it did not violate rule because it did not know the current rubio managers were represented parties.the purpose of his first declaration was to forestall any such claim by putting righetti on notice that rubio considered its current district,general,and assistant managers to be represented by his firm,within the meaning of rule.
in his second declaration,freudenberger further explained that rubio had correctly asserted in opposition to the motion to compel that the current assistant and general managers are represented parties pursuant to rule because these employees are potentially privy to confidential information about the litigation and their statements may be imputed to the corporation or may constitute admissions by the corporation.a corporation,like rubio here,operates and functions through its officers and managers.because the current assistant and general managers are considered represented parties pursuant to rule,plaintiffs are not only not entitled to discover their names,home addresses,and home telephone numbers,but also plaintiffs counsel can not have ex parte communications with these individuals.boldface in original.
perhaps most importantly,freudenberger declared neither i,nor any attorney in my firm,have ever claimed that carlton has an relationship with rubio current assistant and general managers or that carlton represents them in their personal capacities.as stated clearly in my previous declaration,carlton has been retained by rubio and rubio is carlton only client in this matter.boldface in original.
freudenberger original assertion that carlton represented rubio managers in their representative capacities,as opposed to their individual capacities,was not entirely unfounded.after all,t he attorney for a corporation represents it,its stockholders and its officers in their representative capacity he in nowise represents the officers personally.meehan hopps d,see also mills land water golden west refining d.corporate counsel represented director in his discreet role as such.
furthermore,carlton concern that righetti would claim lack of knowledge of representation as a bar to the application of rule was valid,even in the absence of the prior history between the two law firms in connection with the perry action.case law makes clear that rule is only a bar to ex parte contact if the lawyer seeking contact actually knows of the representation.as explained in truitt superior court th,d the proscription against ex parte contact does not apply merely because an attorney should know that the opposing party will be represented by some unidentified attorney at some time after a complaint is filed.citation.a bright line rule is absolutely necessary in this situation.citation.lawyers should not be at risk of disciplinary action for violating rule because they should have known that an opposing party was represented or would be represented at some time in the future.rule does not provide for constructive knowledge.it provides only for actual knowledge.ibid.
totality of the circumstances 
carlton effort to invoke the application of rule,however,did not serve to establish an relationship with the individual managers.in determining the existence of an relationship we should ask whether the totality of the circumstances so indicate.responsible citizens superior court,supra,th at,d.the question of whether an relationship exists is one of law.citations.however,when the evidence is conflicting,the factual basis for the determination must be determined before the legal question is addressed.citation.ibid.generally,in the absence of express findings,we will presume the court found in favor of the prevailing party on all disputed factual issues.citation.our task in such cases is to determine if the presumed findings are supported by substantial evidence.citation.id.at,d.
in the bartlett and koo actions,the presumed finding that an relationship existed between carlton and the members of the potential class is not supported by substantial evidence.there is no evidence suggesting any of the managers in their individual capacities agreed to be represented by carlton.furthermore,freudenberger unilateral declaration regarding carlton representation of the managers in their representative capacities did not,by itself,create the relationship required for disqualification.fox pollack,supra,d at.
as stated above,there is a distinction between a corporate counsel representation of corporate officers and managers in their representative capacities and the representation of those persons in their individual capacities mills land water golden west refining,supra,d at.meehan hopps,supra,d at.in explaining the intent of his declaration,freudenberger tried his best to convince the trial court of this distinction before it ruled on the motion.he made this effort not only via his second declaration,but also at oral argument.in addition,before the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to disqualify,freudenberger offered to file a supplemental declaration to the effect that no attorney or other representative of carlton had had any contact or communication whatsoever with any of rubio current general or assistant managers.he was not given that opportunity,however.
in considering the totality of the circumstances,one should not overlook the obvious.it is untenable that experienced,and presumably ethical,class action defense counsel would deliberately undertake the representation of both the potential class members,the individual managers in their individual capacities,and the class action defendant,and then announce to the court that it was representing both sides.see dch health services waite th,d the court should start with the presumption that,unless proven otherwise,lawyers will behave in an ethical manner.the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from freudenberger first declaration is exactly what freudenberger said upon clarification carlton represented rubio and,to the extent permissible by law,sought to employ rule to block righetti ex parte communications with rubio managers.no trier of fact could reasonably conclude that freudenberger,by his declaration,meant to say that carlton represented all parties to the class action,both the potential class members in their individual capacities and the defendant.strasbourger pearson tulcin wolff wiz technology,supra,th at,d.the only reasonable conclusion is that he misspoke in his first declaration.
exercise of discretion 
in exercising its discretion to grant or deny a motion to disqualify,the trial court is required to make reasoned judgments which comply with legal principles and policies.consequently,the trial court ruling is subject to reversal where there is no reasonable basis for the action taken.citation.state farm mutual automobile ins.federal ins.th,d.that is the case here.
motions to disqualify counsel present competing policy considerations.on the one hand,a court must not hesitate to disqualify an attorney when it is satisfactorily established that he or she wrongfully acquired an unfair advantage that undermines the integrity of the judicial process and will have a continuing effect on the proceedings before the court.citations.on the other hand,it must be kept in mind that disqualification usually imposes a substantial hardship on the disqualified attorney innocent client,who must bear the monetary and other costs of finding a replacement.a client deprived of the attorney of his choice suffers a particularly heavy penalty where,as appears to be the case here,his attorney is highly skilled in the relevant area of the law.gregori bank of america d.see also bell century ins.d.mills land water golden west refining,supra,d at.in re agent orange product liability litigation cir.
here,there is no evidence that carlton,by attempting to invoke the rule bar on ex parte contact with rubio managerial agents,wrongfully acquired an unfair advantage that will undermine the integrity of the judicial process or have a continuing effect on the proceedings.therefore,there is no reason to disqualify carlton,with the result that rubio is penalized by having to find new counsel.
as stated in chronometrics,sysgen,d,we detect a common theme in the cases relating to disqualification of attorneys by trial courts.if the status or misconduct which is urged as a ground for disqualification will have a continuing effect on the judicial proceedings which are before the court,it is justified in refusing to permit the lawyer to participate in such proceedings if,on the other hand,the court purpose is to punish a transgression which has no substantial continuing effect on the judicial proceedings to occur in the future,neither the court inherent power to control its proceedings nor the code of civil procedure section statutory powers can be stretched to support the disqualification.
