appellant ran li crashed a new bmw during a test drive.kenneth gonsalves,a salesperson for the bmw dealership,was a passenger in the vehicle.gonsalves sued,alleging that li drove recklessly during the test drive,causing the accident,and that gonsalves suffered significant back injuries as a result.a jury found that li was negligent,that gonsalves was not comparatively negligent,and awarded gonsalves more than million in damages.li argues the trial court committed numerous evidentiary errors and failed to adequately investigate juror misconduct.he further argues that gonsalves trial counsel committed multiple acts of misconduct.we conclude the trial court erred in admission of certain evidence and find that gonsalves counsel committed misconduct in at least two instances.we conclude that the cumulative prejudice from these errors requires the verdict be set aside and the matter be remanded for new trial.
background 
undisputed facts 
on december,gonsalves assisted potential customers xiaoming and li at a bmw dealership in concord.gonsalves accompanied them on test drives of a bmw and of a more powerful car,a bmw.xiaoming drove the first half of the test drive and li drove the second half.during the test drive,li exited the highway to return to the dealership,but then pressed an m button in the car and returned to the highway.he lost control of the vehicle in the curve of the.the car rear wheels lost traction and the car hit the guardrail,turning to face oncoming traffic.none of the airbags deployed and there were no skid marks.accident reconstruction experts for both parties agreed that the was traveling at about miles an hour when it entered the curve of the,and then accelerated.california highway patrol officers interviewed the parties shortly after the accident.gonsalves reported that the driver had accelerated in a turn,spun the vehicle out,and hit the guardrail.li reported that,after he exited the highway,gonsalves told him about the functions of the m button li pushed the m button and returned to the highway and the accident occurred as he accelerated in the curve of the.
gonsalves version 
gonsalves testified that when li and xiaoming arrived at the dealership they expressed interest in test driving both the and,but gonsalves persuaded them to test drive the.only xiaoming drove the.when xiaoming asked if he could test drive the,gonsalves told him the dealership typically only allows confirmation test drives of the,test drives after an agreement on price and confirmation of a customer ability to pay because purchasers want to buy those cars with no mileage on them.xiaoming told gonsalves he lived in orinda,was wealthy enough to pay cash for the car,and was very interested in buying the car.because gonsalves was concerned that he had insulted xiaoming,he let xiaoming test drive the without the usual confirmatory paperwork.
xiaoming initially drove the and then asked gonsalves if his son could drive the car.gonsalves initially said no,but relented after xiaoming told him li was a very safe driver who had never received any tickets.when li got on the highway,he accelerated to miles per hour and began to weave dangerously between cars.gonsalves repeatedly told li to slow down.as li was returning to the dealership,he asked gonsalves about various buttons on the dashboard,including the m button.gonsalves told him not to press the m button.li accelerated to to miles per hour and headed toward the highway both xiaoming and gonsalves told him to slow down and sometime before he got on the highway,he pressed the m button.he told gonsalves,i just going to get on the freeway and i get right back off.as he accelerated into the curve of the,he lost control of the vehicle.
according to medical reports,gonsalves told doctors that he was injured when a test driver accelerated to miles per hour and ran into a wall.in response to an interrogatory,gonsalves wrote that the car was going about miles an hour on the.in a deposition,gonsalves had said the car was going to miles an hour at the time of the crash.at trial,gonsalves said he could not estimate the car speed in the curve of the,but he was sure it was traveling faster than miles an hour.he admitted it was not traveling to miles per hour on the.gonsalves testified that he tried to tell the chp officers about li dangerous driving on the highway,but the police directed him to describe only what happened during the accident itself.
gonsalves expert testified that the accident occurred because of driver error the driver accelerated and turned the steering wheel in a manner that caused the car to exceed the maximum friction in the roadway.this is clearly not a turn where miles an hour is maintained constant through the turn.it or miles an hour starting into the turn and then gunning it and turning the steering wheel hard.that what caused the accident.the expert acknowledged that the m button might have been programmable to disengage the car dynamic stability control system,which was designed to automatically direct braking power to wheels that start to slip.he acknowledged that the car might have handled differently with the stability control disengaged and,because it was unknown how the m button was programmed,it would have been imprudent of gonsalves to suggest that li press the m button such an act might have contributed to the accident.if the driver thinks he got more capability than he does,then he may exceed those capabilities.gonsalves expert nevertheless opined that the accident was caused by driver error regardless of whether the m button had disengaged the stability control system.
li and xiaoming version 
xiaoming testified that he went to the bmw dealership because he was interested in purchasing a new car that he would share with li,who had just finished college and was working in san francisco.gonsalves suggested they test drive a.he collected driver licenses from xiaoming and li and,per their agreement,xiaoming drove the first half of the test drive and li drove the second half.after the test drive,gonsalves asked if there was anything they did not like about the car and they said they preferred a stick shift.he suggested they test drive a manual transmission.again,per their agreement,xiaoming drove the first half of the test drive and li drove the second half.xiaoming could tell immediately that the was very different from the.when li took over,he drove about miles per hour and passed some cars but he was not weaving.xiaoming told him to be careful gonsalves said nothing.
li exited the highway and was about to return to the dealership when gonsalves said,oh,do you want to see the full potential of the car there a button.if you press the button,it going to change the behavior of the car.gonsalves pointed out the m button and said it would cause the car to stiffen and release a lot of power.because travel had to be at a sufficient speed to feel the difference,gonsalves advised them to get back on the highway to try it out.li rapidly accelerated in the curve of the,and the car started moving sideways as well as forward.xiaoming told li to be careful,but li must have pressed on the brake so hard,because then the car was totally out of control.it spun a little bit and hit the guardrail.it happened very quickly.t he car had indeed stiffened substantially once the car was in motion with sufficient speed li similarly testified that pressing the m button somehow changed the car performance so when i made that turn,a turn that i would typically think was a safe speed,the car lost control.he had had no trouble driving the before the button was pushed.following the accident,gonsalves calmly and cordially told xiaoming that the accident occurred because li was not used to driving a drive vehicle.
the defense expert opined that pressing the m button affected the way the accident happened.t he dynamic stability control on the vehicle was clearly off when this accident occurred otherwise,we would see the rear of the vehicle spinning out or coming out to the left as it did in this accident.when the wheels are spinning,the speed of the vehicle does not increase.thus,the accident was not caused by excessive speed.instead,pressing the accelerator caused the rear wheels to spin,which is what caused the vehicle to lose control.that was all caused by the dynamic stability control being turned off.
gonsalves injuries 
gonsalves testified that he was thrown around from side to side and back and forth as the car spun.for years after the accident,he suffered from neck and back pain,had a limited range of motion in his neck,and developed numbness and tingling in his upper extremities.when pain medication,physical therapy and epidurals failed to alleviate his symptoms,gonsalves underwent artificial disk replacement surgery in may,which provided substantial relief.he anticipated having further surgery on another disk in the future.it was disputed at trial whether gonsalves medical problems after the accident were caused by the accident or were normal degenerative problems typical of persons his age.
in closing argument,plaintiff counsel asked the jury to award in past medical expenses,in future medical expenses,and between and in pain and suffering damages.defense counsel argued li had not been negligent and that gonsalves past medical expenses were overstated,future medical expenses were unproven,and noneconomic damages were in the range of to.
verdict and motion for new trial 
the jury found only li negligent and awarded gonsalves for past medical expenses,in future medical expenses,and in noneconomic damages.the trial court denied li motion for a new trial,and entered judgment against li for.
ii.discussion 
evidentiary errors 
li argues the trial court made several errors in admitting evidence and allowing examination on certain subjects.with the exception of one issue of statutory interpretation,we review these issues for abuse of discretion.people foss th.
requests for admission 
li argues the court erred in permitting plaintiff counsel to examine li about his negative responses to gonsalves requests for admission rfa and admitting those responses in evidence.we agree that this was error.
background 
gonsalves called li as an adverse witness during his case in chief.plaintiff counsel had li confirm that he prepared responses to gonsalves rfa and swore under penalty of perjury that his responses were true.the court instructed the jury before trial,each party has the right to ask another party to admit in writing that certain matters are true.if the other party admits those matters,you must accept them as true.no further evidence is required to prove them.however,these matters must be considered true only as they apply to the party who admitted they were true.so prior to the trial during this discovery process,the plaintiff sent the defendant these requests for admissions.plaintiff counsel is now asking the witness about those requests.the other side can do the same.
plaintiff counsel then told the jury that li was asked to admit that at the time as you began your turn from concord avenue onto highway northbound you were driving too fast for the conditions,and that li replied,responding party has a lack of information and knowledge to admit this request for admission.a reasonable inquiry concerning this matter has been made,and the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable responding party to admit this matter.plaintiff counsel then extensively examined li on this and similar responses to rfa over multiple defense objections when li testified in the defense case in chief,plaintiff counsel again asked questions in about li responses to the rfa and elicited li statement,i stand by my admissions that i signed.
defense counsel made at least nine objections that questions about li denials of the rfa were argumentative,that these are not exhibits in the case,and that the questions called for legal opinions or were contention questions all of the objections were overruled.
at the conclusion of li testimony,the court admitted in evidence the full sets of the rfa and special interrogatories that asked li to explain any denials to the rfa,as well as li responses to both defense counsel moved to strike and exclude all testimony regarding li responses to the rfa and to admonish the jury to disregard the evidence.the motion was denied.
in closing argument,plaintiff counsel urged the jury to consider li failure,in response to the rfa,to admit that his pressure on the accelerator was a substantial factor in causing the accident,as evidence of his failure to take responsibility for gonsalves injuries.counsel told the jury,i encourage you to look at the requests for admissions that we sent to ran li asking him to admit some very basic facts about this crash.his responses are there as well.let just look at a few of them this is a simple question,ladies and gentlemen.how much did you push on the accelerator.his response is a bunch of double speak,a bunch of i sorry i not taking responsibility and not only am i doing it,i doing it in a way that makes no sense.i t been more than four and a half years since this crash,and he will not in any way take any responsibility for it and that why we need to impanel a jury like you.
posttrial,li renewed his argument that the examinations were improper in his motion for a new trial such questions add no facts to the case,deny the defendant representation,and improperly inflame the jury.the court denied the motion.
li argues the discovery statutes do not authorize admission at trial of denials to rfa and that the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff counsel to examine him about his qualified denials and in admitting the written responses.we agree.
as a preliminary matter,gonsalves argues defense counsel implicitly waived any objection to admission of li responses when he stipulated to admission of the written responses at trial.as set forth ante,however,the defense made this stipulation only after the court had overruled its objections to use of the responses during the examinations of li and after the court appeared unpersuaded by defense counsel arguments that the written responses were not admissible evidence.in context,therefore,the stipulation can not be deemed truly voluntary or an intentional waiver of the objection.see boyle certainteed th,n o waiver may be implied where,as here,a party alleging error has made its objection and then acted defensively to lessen the impact of the error.
interpretation of the discovery statutes is subject to our de novo review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th.li notes that the discovery statutes expressly allow any part of a deposition or interrogatory to be introduced at trial with certain restrictions not relevant here,whereas the statutes only provide that admissions in response to rfa are binding on the party at trial.code civ,any part or all of a deposition italics added,any answer or part of an answer to an interrogatory italics added,a ny matter admitted in response to rfa italics added see also wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group,a dmissions made in response to rfa may be received into evidence at trial italics added.li further notes that the statutory scheme provides for monetary sanctions,reasonable expenses including attorney fees when a party unreasonably fails to admit a matter in response to rfa,but does not expressly permit a denial,objection or failure to respond to rfa to be used against the party at trial.code civ,subd.a.he argues that the statutory scheme therefore implies that the only authorized sanction for an unreasonable failure to admit is a monetary award and a denial can not be used to impeach a witness at trial.in this case,the court actually denied sanctions for li failure to admit the rfa,yet the court allowed li to be impeached with that same conduct.gonsalves argues that the statutes are essentially silent on the subject of whether denials or qualified denials are admissible at trial,leaving the admissibility subject to the trial court discretion.
neither li nor gonsalves cites authority that we find to be directly on point.our own research reveals a somewhat surprising paucity of relevant authority.in morris frudenfeld d morris,the appellant asserted it was error to not permit impeachment of the respondent by showing certain denials to rfa were inconsistent with respondent admissions on the witness stand.id.at.citing evidence code section,the trial court declined to permit reading of the denials to the jury on the basis of excessive time consumption.noting that the record was unclear as to precisely what pretrial denials appellant was attempting to introduce,the reviewing court held that such a ruling was within the sound discretion of the trial judge.morris,at pp.while perhaps implicitly suggesting that admission at trial of denials to rfa is committed to the trial court discretion and not precluded by statute,the case does not so hold.the issue presented in morris was whether the court could properly exclude an allegedly inconsistent prior statement.gonsalves does not allege any inconsistency between the discovery responses and trial testimony.in fact,he argued to the jury that they should draw adverse inferences from the fact that li continued to deny the request,consistent with his earlier responses.
li analogizes the examinations by plaintiff counsel to asking a witness to explain the basis of his legal contentions,conduct condemned in rifkind superior court th rifkind.in rifkind,the witness was asked at deposition to state with respect to each of his affirmative defenses all facts that support the affirmative defense the identity of each witness who has knowledge of any facts supporting the affirmative defense and the identity of any documents that pertain to the facts or witnesses.id.at pp.the court of appeal condemned the practice,which it referred to as asking legal contention questions,but held the same questions could properly be asked in interrogatories.id.at.the distinction between these discovery devices is that the client presumably knows the facts although not always,but he can hardly be expected to know their legal consequences.this is what lawyers are for.citation.id.at.l egal contention questions require the party interrogated to make a application that is beyond the competence of most lay persons.citation.even if such questions may be characterized as not calling for a legal opinion citation,or as presenting a mixed question of law and fact citation,their basic vice when used at a deposition is that they are unfair.they call upon the deponent to sort out the factual material in the case according to specific legal contentions,and to do this by memory and on the spot.id.at.
while not directly on point,we agree that the underlying concerns discussed in rifkind apply to the use of qualified denials to rfa in the examinations here.li was asked to explain by memory and on the spot and without the ability to consult with his attorney why he took the legal position that he could not admit or deny certain rfa without further inquiry.and he was asked to do this not in a deposition,as in rifkind,but in front of the jury.
we find that the weight of authority in other jurisdictions also favors li position.massachusetts highest court interpreted a statutory scheme similar to california and concluded that denials to rfa are not admissible evidence at trial the purpose of rfa is to narrow the issues for trial by identifying those issues and facts as to which proof will be necessary.citation.a denial is not a statement of fact it simply indicates that the responding party is not willing to concede the issue and,as a result,the requesting party must prove the fact at trial.citations.the sanction for improperly responding to rfa is the shifting of the award of incurred expenses see rule a of the massachusetts rules of civil procedure.further,massachusetts rules of civil procedure,rule b,which governs rfa,does not specifically provide for the admission of denials in evidence.although the rule states that admissions are conclusively binding on the responding party,it makes no parallel provision for the use of a denial.by contrast,massachusetts rules of civil procedure,rule b,governing interrogatories,states that the answers to interrogatories may be used at trial to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.the omission of a similar provision in rule b indicates that,although admissions have binding effect,denials do not have such an effect and can not be introduced in evidence.gutierrez.bay transp.authority,final brackets in original.therefore,the trial court incorrectly concluded that a denial of a request for admission is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach a witness at trial.ibid.
intermediate courts in at least three states have similarly held that denials of rfa are inadmissible at trial.see winn dixie stores,gerringer so d,citing morris,supra,d for the proposition that denials can not be used for impeachment purposes mahan missouri pacific,the propriety of defendant denials is for the court to decide,not the jury amer.communications commerce north bank,w hen an answering party denies or refuses to make an admission of fact,such refusal is nothing more than a refusal to admit a fact.in most cases the use of denials of rfa to impeach a witness at trial is nothing more than an attack on the character of the defendant and that issue i s not before the jury.mahan missouri pacific,at.
perhaps recognizing the lack of any inconsistency between li responses to the rfa and his trial testimony,gonsalves suggests that the responses were admissible to impeach li credibility by showing h is attitude toward the action in which he testifies,subd.j.gonsalves cites no cases that support his interpretation of this section of the evidence code.section has been held applicable to a witness reluctance to testify or fear of retaliation for testifying people merriman cal th,people mendoza cal th,or a witness desire for revenge against the defendant people stewart d.as li points out,courts have held in other contexts that litigation conduct is not relevant evidence at trial in the ordinary case.palmer ted stevens honda,supra,d at o ne significant defect in such evidence is that it holds the client responsible for the attorney litigation strategy.white,supra,cal d,which allows such evidence in a bad faith case,has been criticized as unfairly compromising a defendant right to defend himself.see california physicians service superior court th,fn.we find no support for gonsalves attempt to make a party litigation conduct a legitimate subject for inquiry under evidence code section,subdivision j,absent truly exceptional circumstances.
we are persuaded,therefore,that denials of rfa are not admissible evidence in an ordinary case,a case where a party litigation conduct is not directly in issue.thus,the trial court permitted examination of li that was unfair and prejudicial to him,and erred in admitting those responses in evidence.
questioning about substantial factor and causation 
li argues the trial court erred by allowing plaintiff counsel to question him about an ultimate legal issue in the case whether his driving was a substantial factor in causing the accident.we agree.
background 
during examinations of li and xiaoming in plaintiff case in chief,plaintiff counsel extensively questioned the witnesses about whether li conduct was a substantial factor in causing the accident.defense counsel raised at least objections that the questions about causation and substantial factors were argumentative,improperly asked the witnesses to explain their legal contentions,and called for improper opinion testimony.all of the objections were overruled.
if a witness is not testifying as an expert,his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is permitted by law,including but not limited to an opinion that is a rationally based on the perception of the witness and b helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony.
a lay witness may testify in the form of an opinion only when he can not adequately describe his observations without using opinion wording.citation.people callahan th.thus,a lay witness may express an opinion that a person was drunk citation,or that people engaged in a discussion were angry citation,or that an impact was strong enough to jar a passenger from a seat citation,or that someone appeared to be trying to break up a fight.citation.osborn mission ready mix d.for example,the osborn court held a plaintiff was properly asked if a hazard was open and obvious a matter which could best be described to the jury by way of opinion testimony.id.at pp.but the plaintiff was not properly asked if the defendant conduct was reasonable the ultimate issue of fact to be decided by the jury.ibid.
while appropriate to ask li for a description of the accident,and how the car spun out as he drove along the curve of the,counsel repeated questions about whether li driving was a substantial factor in causing the accident were improper attempts to force li to opine as to the ultimate issue of liability in the action.
moreover,there was an inherent tension between the trial court admission of expert witness testimony on the issue of causation and the court allowing li,a lay witness,to be questioned on the subject.the subject matter of expert and lay opinion testimony do not overlap a properly qualified expert,with special knowledge,skill,experience,training or education may provide an opinion about a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that it would assist the trier of fact.lay opinion testimony is admissible where no particular scientific knowledge is required,or as a matter of practical necessity when the matters observed are too complex or too subtle to enable the witness accurately to convey them to court or jury in any other manner.citations.citation.citation.people chapple th.we have previously held that where a court rules that a witness lacks the expertise necessary to provide expert testimony on a subject,the court can not allow the same witness to provide lay opinion testimony on the same subject.id.at.here,the trial court admitted expert testimony on causation of the accident,thus implicitly ruling that causation of this particular accident was a subject beyond common experience.having so ruled,the court did not explain why it nevertheless would permit plaintiff counsel to solicit li lay opinion on the same subject matter.
we conclude the court erred in allowing plaintiff counsel to examine li and xiaoming on substantial factor causation.
speeding tickets 
li argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior speeding tickets,which he claims was inadmissible propensity evidence.again,we agree.
background 
during examination of li in plaintiff case in chief,plaintiff counsel introduced evidence that li had received two tickets before the accident for driving to miles per hour in a mile per hour zone.he also elicited li acknowledgment that he drove the to miles per hour in a mile per hour zone during the test drive.
defense counsel twice objected to examination about the speeding tickets on grounds that the questions solicited irrelevant and propensity evidence.the court overruled the objections.the court later explained on the record,i allowed it in for a specific purpose and that was to show knowledge,knowledge as to how fast he was going because there were different estimates of speed he unclear during his testimony about how fast he was going at various times during this test drive.this goes to his knowledge about what it feels like to speed.defense counsel responded,i do think he was unclear.he said he was speeding.
defense counsel filed a midtrial motion to strike and exclude the evidence of li driving history,arguing the evidence was inadmissible character and specific acts evidence under evidence code sections,subdivision a and.moreover,s uch evidence does not prove any element of this case because both experts have already testified that this accident occurred at a speed of on a so speed is not even an issue in this case.the court denied the motion.
defense counsel then asked for a limiting instruction regarding the evidence,which apparently would have instructed the jury it could not consider the evidence for any purpose.the court rejected the proposed instruction because it had admitted the evidence for a specific purpose.defense counsel reiterated that he did not understand the rationale for admitting the evidence to show li knowledge that he was speeding and said,then i do want the limiting instruction,i do understand it myself.li made similar arguments in his denied motion for a new trial.
with specific exceptions not relevant here,evidence code section provides that evidence of a person character or a trait of his or her character in the form of specific instances of his or her conduct is inadmissible when offered to prove his or her conduct on a specified occasion,except to prove some fact such as motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake or accident,other than his or her disposition to commit such an act,or to impeach a witness credibility.see also,prior conduct admissible on credibility alone only if conduct resulted in felony conviction.however,even if admissible under evidence code section,t he court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will a necessitate undue consumption of time or b create substantial danger of undue prejudice,of confusing the issues,or of misleading the jury.
in personal injury actions arising from traffic accidents specifically,as a general rule,evidence of prior traffic citations is not admissible to prove that on the particular occasion in question the driver receiving such prior citations was negligent.travis southern pacific d.however,where a car speed at the time of impact was an issue at trial and the driver testified that he was always conscious of speed laws,the driver was properly impeached with prior speeding tickets.id.at pp.here,li did not testify that he always abided by the speed limit on the contrary,he admitted that he sped during the test drive.therefore,the prior ticket evidence did not serve to impeach li testimony.
the trial court admitted the evidence under evidence code section,subdivision b to show li had knowledge of how fast he was going on this occasion.the court apparently reasoned that li prior speeding tickets demonstrated that li knew what it felt like to drive at to miles per hour because li had been penalized for driving at those speeds,he must have learned from that experience what it felt like to drive at those speeds the court stated the evidence was admissible because li was unclear during his testimony about how fast he was going at various times during this test drive.before he was asked about the speeding tickets,however,li had only been asked how fast he was driving while on the curve of the via questions about his responses to rfa and about substantial factor causation.plaintiff own expert had testified that li entered the curve of the traveling at about miles per hour.therefore,the speeding tickets were not properly admitted to impeach prior testimony by li.subsequently,li admitted that he drove to miles per hour in a miles per hour zone during the test drive.gonsalves,on the other hand,testified that li drove as fast as miles per hour on the highways during the test drive.if the prior speeding tickets tended to show that li knew what it felt like to speed,the evidence would tend to corroborate li testimony rather than impeach it.
on appeal,gonsalves argues the evidence was admissible to impeach xiaoming.gonsalves cites his own testimony that xiaoming persuaded him to allow li to test drive the by saying that li was a safe driver who had never received any driving citations.but xiaoming had been dismissed as a defendant prior to gonsalves testimony.moreover,the questions about the speeding tickets were posed not to xiaoming but to li and were asked,not in the context of questioning a witness about how gonsalves was induced to allow li to test drive the car,but in the context of questioning li about how fast he was driving on the at the time the accident occurred.in sum,the speeding tickets were not relevant to establish xiaoming liability or to otherwise impeach xiaoming.because the evidence had little,if any,relevance to the purpose for which it was ostensibly admitted,and was completely inadmissible as propensity evidence to establish liability,it was unduly prejudicial and should have been excluded under evidence code section.
li argues the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence about what gonsalves allegedly told california highway patrol officer mitchell buck when interviewed at the dealership following the accident.we do not find error in the admission of this evidence.
background 
in plaintiff case in chief,buck testified that he responded to the crash with his partner,officer erik gutierrez,and personally interviewed gonsalves and li at the dealership.gonsalves told buck,basically that they were on a test drive.they were on concord avenue preparing to get onto southbound.and as the driver of the vehicle made the turn,he accelerated,spun the vehicle out,and hit the guardrail.buck did not recall hearing about an argument between the parties or any dispute about whose idea it was to press the m button.
plaintiff counsel proffered gutierrez deposition testimony to impeach buck.after the court found that gutierrez was unavailable within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision c e,it entertained argument on whether the content of the deposition was otherwise admissible.defense counsel argued,t he sections they want to read are all hearsay on hearsay.officer gutierrez says multiple times in his deposition that i did talk to anybody.i let officer buck handle everything.so then he had conversations with officer buck,and he gave some information in his deposition of what he thinks officer buck said about the accident.moreover,you ca offer an inconsistent statement against a witness if they not a party unless you confront them with it on the stand so they can have a chance to deal with it.the court responded,yes,you can if they subject to recall.defense counsel said,well,he been released,and the court said it would go back and look.the court then said,but it not just inconsistency.impeachment rules are a little bit different.it impeaches officer buck.defense counsel disagreed the rules were different.the court admitted the deposition testimony,and plaintiff counsel read to the jury the following excerpts 
question if you read through this briefly,do you have any memory of this accident 
answer yes,i do.
question gonsalves has described the entire way that the entire test drive had some complaints about the way my client was driving during the entire test drive.
answer okay.
question i wondering did you hear anything about that 
answer okay.no,i did.i believe if we had,i would have put that on a statement here or somewhere in the report.
question the m button is mentioned in li statement,but it not mentioned in gonsalves statement.what i wondering,do you have any memory of officer buck when talking with him that there was a dispute between the parties about whether or not the m button was used.
answer the only thing i recall is that gonsalves,told li 
question yes 
answer to not press the button.i guess he went ahead and pressed it.that from what i recall.
question and that is your memory 
answer with the conversation i had with officer buck.
the trial court instructed the jury you have heard some testimony read from the deposition transcript of officer gutierrez.in that testimony,officer gutierrez recalled a conversation he had with officer buck.that testimony can not be considered for the truth of the matter alleged in the conversation.it can be used to show that officer gutierrez has a different memory of events from officer buck.
hearsay evidence is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.except as provided by law,hearsay evidence is inadmissible,subds.a,b.each level of hearsay in proffered evidence must come within an exception to the hearsay rule for the evidence to be admissible.
the foundational issue that made admission of gutierrez deposition testimony potentially relevant was whether gonsalves told li in the car not to press the m button.this issue was relevant to whether li or gonsalves acted negligently and whether any such negligence was a substantial factor in causing the accident.li,xiaoming and gonsalves gave conflicting testimony on the issue.gonsalves testified that li,not gonsalves,was the first person to mention the m button and that he specifically told li not to push the button.
the defense impeached gonsalves with evidence including buck testimony that gonsalves did not mention reckless driving by li or a dispute over the m button in his statement to police immediately after the accident.although buck related statements by gonsalves,those statements were admissible because they were offered against a party opponent.
plaintiff counsel then attempted to rehabilitate gonsalves with the deposition testimony of gutierrez,which contradicted buck testimony about gonsalves statements to buck.the court ruled that the deposition testimony was admissible pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c e despite the fact that it recited statements by gutierrez.li argues that the question before us is whether the next layer of hearsay in the deposition testimony buck statement to gutierrez falls within some exception to the hearsay rule.he argues it does not because a prior inconsistent statement of a witness is admissible only if it is offered in compliance with section.evidence code section provides,unless the interests of justice otherwise require,extrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that is inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing shall be excluded unless a the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the statement or b the witness has not been excused from giving further testimony in the action.buck was not given an opportunity during his testimony to explain or deny his alleged statement to gutierrez.see simons,cal.evidence manual hearsay evidence,pp.nor was buck subject to recall he had been excused at the conclusion of his testimony at trial.
the flaw in li argument is his assumption that gutierrez testimony about buck statement was offered to prove the truth of what buck said,that gonsalves in fact told buck that he had told li not to press the m button.see simons,cal.evidence manual,supra,c ompliance with ensures that a prior inconsistent statement is admissible not only to impeach the witness but also for the truth of the facts asserted in the statement.gutierrez testimony,however,was expressly admitted on the condition that the testimony can not be considered for the truth of the matter alleged in the conversation.it can be used to show that officer gutierrez has a different memory of events from officer buck italics added,to impeach buck testimony.
the court did not err by admitting the testimony.
medical expert testimony

in a motion in limine,defense counsel attempted to exclude testimony by rao based on alleged violations of expert witness disclosure rules,specifically rao designation as treating physician and nonretained expert witness until shortly before trial,when he was redesignated a retained expert.during argument on the motion,the court commented that the scope of a treating physician testimony is basically the same as the scope of a retained medical expert testimony and asked whether any improper designation of rao mattered.defense counsel argued the difference is giving them documents if you give a doctor documents,you got to list them as a retained expert,but the court suggested a treating physician might review a patient entire medical records in order to prepare for surgery,not for the purpose of providing an expert opinion on causation.the court ruled that rao would be allowed to opine on causation if he testified that he reviewed gonsalves medical history as part of his planning for treatment and if rao established that he had the expertise to render a causation opinion based on his review of that record and his examination and performance of surgery on gonsalves.
on direct examination,rao testified that he reviewed gonsalves full prior medical records before coming to a diagnosis or treatment plan for gonsalves,and he was permitted to offer an opinion on causation.specifically,rao testified that gonsalves had two disk herniations that were caused by the trauma of the car accident rather than regular wear and tear.the herniations caused the numbness and tingling in gonsalves arm,and gonsalves neck and back pain also resulted from the accident.absent that crash,there no way that he would have had these symptoms.he testified that gonsalves surgery was medically necessary and gonsalves likely would need further surgery in the future.
on appeal,li renews his argument that rao should have been excluded as a witness because gonsalves did not properly designate him as a retained expert witness.the court,however,admitted the testimony on the ground that rao properly testified about causation in his role as a treating physician.li does not establish that the scope of rao testimony was beyond that appropriate for a treating physician.therefore,li fails to meet his burden of establishing error.
juror misconduct 
li argues the trial court erred in failing to make a sufficient inquiry into the juror misconduct during trial.we conclude that the trial court did not prejudicially err.
background 
on the fifth day of trial,juror reported that juror told her she had looked up plaintiff trial counsel and learned that he was a hot shot,which made her feel honored to serve as a juror in this case.juror had also told juror during voir dire that the case was five years old,a fact that juror thought had not been publicly disclosed.
the court interviewed juror and confirmed that she had looked up plaintiff counsel and formed a favorable opinion of him.the court then said,and then you shared what you learned about the attorney with another juror,at least one other juror.correct juror replied,yes,i did.the court admonished her not to do any other research about the case and not to discuss the matter with other jurors.after the juror left the courtroom,the court told counsel it was inclined to dismiss juror from the jury.defense counsel said,actually,i think we need to know more.it more than likely she actually made these comments to other jurors too,i guess,not just one.the court responded,well,i asked that specifically and she said no,and defense counsel said,you asked if she said the comments to that one if she said it to any other jurors at lunch or anything like that i did hear that question.the court then said,i going to excuse her.i will the jury as they come in.i have no indication that comments were made to anyone else or around anyone else,and i believe i did ask her whether she shared that with anyone else,but i clarify that with the other jurors.after the court confirmed with juror that juror comment would not affect her ability to be impartial,the court replaced juror with an alternate juror and addressed the full jury i want to reiterate you can not have any contact with anyone about this case or about any of the parties involved,which includes the lawyers.you ca research them.you ca ask about them.you ca discuss them.the case is about the evidence,not the lawyers.i want to impress upon you how important that its,that there be absolutely no research,no googling,no discussion,no anything about anything having to do with the case,which includes the lawyers.all right thank you.
li argued in his motion for a new trial that the court conducted an insufficient inquiry into whether the conduct tainted the jury.in its denial of the motion,the court explained,w e had a fairly lengthy discussion with both of those jurors on the record it was clear to me at the time that that was the only juror that the offending juror had spoken to.and i declined that we were going to go one by one through the other jurors because i did think,it was necessary.there was anything to suggest whatsoever that she had had any conversations with anyone else.and,i thought,frankly,it would highlight the issue and open up a door that was previously opened.there was nothing in front of me then or now to suggest that any of the other jurors had been contacted by the one juror or had done anything inappropriate.n ormally when i see this,there a request for juror identifying information so that interviews can be done and affidavits produced if,in fact,there was anything there.i did have any of that attached to the motion.
although li argues the trial court erred by conducting an insufficient inquiry into the misconduct,he cites no legal authority for the proposition that the court duty of inquiry in such situations extends as far as he suggests.the decision whether to investigate the possibility of juror bias,incompetence,or misconduct like the ultimate decision to retain or discharge a juror rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.citation.a hearing is required only where the court possesses information which,if proven to be true,would constitute good cause to doubt a juror ability to perform his duties and would justify his removal from the case.people ray cal th.a trial court failure to question each juror privately regarding a juror misconduct claim presents an issue of abuse of discretion,not one of constitutional magnitude people pinholster cal th.people castorena th,parallel citations omitted.
the trial court had substantial evidence that juror gathered information about plaintiff counsel and shared that information with juror.the court followed up on that information by interviewing both jurors,dismissing juror,confirming that juror could remain impartial,and reminding the other jurors that they could not independently investigate the case.citing the fact that juror spoke to juror twice about the case,suggesting she was talkative and might not have confined her comments to juror,li faults the court for not inquiring whether juror spoke with other jurors about plaintiff attorney.the court stated that it had asked that specifically and she said no.in fact,the court had not.but,as the court stated when denying li motion for a new trial,it never had affirmative evidence that juror had in fact shared the prejudicial information with anyone else on the jury.there was nothing in front of me then or now to suggest that any of the other jurors had been contacted by the one juror or had done anything inappropriate.in the absence of such evidence,the court had no duty to inquire further.the scope of the court inquiry was committed to its discretion and the court explained that it believed further inquiry would highlight the issue,potentially creating prejudice.there was no error.
attorney misconduct 
li argues that gonsalves trial counsel committed multiple acts of misconduct making repeated and unnecessary references to li and xiaoming chinese origin asking the jury to send a message through its verdict improperly appealing to the jury sympathy by mentioning his prior representation of a paraplegic child and telling the jury that gonsalves would be required to reimburse the workers compensation system if he recovered damages at trial,a fact not in evidence.in evaluating claims of attorney misconduct,e ach case must ultimately rest upon the reviewing court view of the overall record,taking into account such factors,inter alia,as the nature and seriousness of the remarks and misconduct,the general atmosphere,including the judge control,of the trial,the likelihood of prejudicing the jury,and the efficacy of objection or admonition under all the circumstances.citation.du jardin city of oxnard th.we conclude that gonsalves trial counsel committed misconduct in at least two instances.
chinese origin 
background 
in opening statement and examinations of li and xiaoming,plaintiff counsel made several comments or elicited evidence that both were born in china and that xiaoming lived and worked in china,returning to california only for visits.defense counsel did not object to these comments at trial.however,in his motion for a new trial,li cited the comments as evidence of prejudicial attorney misconduct.this testimony concerning being from china are the first statements the jury ever heard from the defendants.none of these questions elicited any facts about the actual accident on december.none of these questions elicited any facts about the injury claims of plaintiff.all of these questions likely inflamed the jury.plaintiff argued the evidence was admissible as it demonstrates that xiaoming is firmly entrenched in china,and therefore was not realistically interested in purchasing a vehicle in the united states and had no real incentive to purchase a bmw here 
q uestioning or argument of counsel relative to the race,nationality or religion of a party,when irrelevant to the issues,is improper.kolaric kaufman d.gonsalves argues the evidence that xiaoming worked and primarily lived in china was relevant to prove that,contrary to xiaoming testimony,they took the on a test drive for fun rather than because of a sincere interest in buying the car.
li raises legitimate concerns about the jury impact of this line of questioning.however,the defense raised no contemporaneous objections and never requested an admonishment that might have dispelled any lingering prejudice and deterred plaintiff counsel from pursuing the line of questioning.moreover,the court instructed the jury,you must not be biased in favor of or against any witness because of his or her disability,gender,race,religion,ethnicity,sexual orientation,age,national origin,or socioeconomic status,and we presume the jurors abided by this instruction.in all of the circumstances,we can not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by not intervening sua sponte or in denying the motion for new trial on this ground.
send a message 
background 
plaintiff counsel argued in closing,when we talk about negligence in a case like this,ladies and gentlemen,and when we get our community together,what we do is we have a conversation really about what we believe reasonable conduct in our community is.that what your verdict will do in this case.your verdict will not only send a message to the lis,but also to the whole community.
defense counsel objection.improper argument.
the court ladies and gentlemen,as i well,rephrase your argument.
plaintiff counsel certainly.what you asked to decide as a jury is what is reasonable conduct,and the decision that you make sets a standard here in the community for what we accept and what we do accept.and in this case,it happens to be what we accept with the way people drive cars and whether or not people take unreasonable risks for themselves and whether they take unreasonable risks for others,which is exactly what ran li did in this case.
in addition to objecting when the argument was first made,li argued in his motion for a new trial plaintiff counsel often urge a jury to send a message to the community by its verdict.this argument may be appropriate in punitive damages cases citation.but many judges feel it is improper in other cases,particularly when made in the context of the amount of damages to be awarded.citation.
counsel is granted wide latitude to discuss the merits of the case,both as to the law and facts,and is entitled to argue his or her case vigorously and to argue all reasonable inferences from the evidence.citation.any suggestion that the jury should send a message by inflating its award of damages,however,would be improper where,as here,punitive damages may not be awarded.nishihama city and county of san francisco th.
here,plaintiff counsel urged the jury to send a message by holding li liable for negligence,not by urging the jury to return a large damages verdict.further,when counsel later argued in favor of large damages,he did not allude back to the argument.therefore,there was no error.in any event,the court responded to defense counsel objection by directing plaintiff counsel to rephrase his argument.plaintiff counsel urged the jury to set a standard here in the community for what we accept and what we do accept by returning a liability verdict,an argument li does not challenge as improper.because the comment was fleeting and addressed liability rather than damages,and because the court interposed a redirection to counsel,we conclude that any error was harmless.see nishihama city and county of san francisco,supra,th at pp.garcia conmed th.
paralyzed child 
background 
on of defense expert radiologist erik gaensler,plaintiff counsel asked 
y ou do this same kind of testimony three,four times a year for juries just like this,correct 
a.some years not at all other years more 
just in the last couple of years,you testified in at least three other courtrooms here in the bay area on behalf of the defendant where you given basically the same power point that you do see any evidence of traumatic injury on these mri scans is that right 
well,the same power point would mean it the same power point.obviously,every patient is different.every situation is different.it would be like saying to a surgeon you do the same operation on everybody.so each patient has different films.there different features to the films.
doctor,you testified against my client katarina sankovich,my client,in los angeles in the sankovich case about two years ago.do you remember that 
very well.that was a young child.whether she was three,four,or five,i do remember.but she was in a car accident and had a spinal cord injury in her lower lumbar spine.so it had absolutely nothing to do with the cervical spine,absolutely nothing to do with degenerative disease.there was a question of doubt as to the instant when it occurred,which is when the car accident occurred and the subsequent hospitalization.i mean to you,a spine case may be a dime a dozen.to me,they could not have been more different 
they not a dime a dozen to me.i represented a paraplegic in that case,doctor.in this case,i represent a gentleman who was very badly injured and needed spinal surgery and needs another spine surgery.
the court can i see counsel at the bench,please 
bench conference 
the court the jury will disregard the question.rephrase,please.
while discussing gaensler testimony in his rebuttal closing argument,plaintiff counsel said,he regularly testifies that the mri does show an injury as opposed to degenerative findings.he admitted to testifying against another one of my clients,a paraplegic girl two years ago.defense counsel objected that t hat part was stricken and the court sustained the objection.
in li motion for a new trial,defense counsel wrote that plaintiff counsel had told the jury that he once represented a child with paralys i s and gaensler had tried to minimize that injury as well the defense has no way to fight such claims without arguing the facts of a completely different case.the jury was improperly told that plaintiff attorney represents sympathetic and badly injured children and gaensler is essentially an evil defense witness who will say anything these were blatant and inexcusable attempts to inflame the jury.the defense argued the comment was intentional misconduct in light of the extensive trial experience of plaintiff counsel,and a ground for a mistrial.
r emarks intended to play upon the emotions of sympathy,shock and horror are improper matters for the jury to consider.citation.see horn atchinson,ry.cal d.gonsalves argues that his counsel remark during the of gaensler was provoked by and was a fair response to the witness own suggestion that plaintiff counsel viewed personal injury cases as a dime a dozen.we assume for purposes of argument that he is correct as to the initial comment.gonsalves,however,provides no explanation for his counsel repeating the statement during closing argument after the trial court had sustained a defense objection to the initial statement and told the jury to disregard it.the remark in argument was therefore misconduct.although the court again sustained a defense objection to the argument and again admonished the jury to disregard the statement,we assess the prejudicial effect differently when the conduct appears deliberate.m isconduct by counsel in closing argument in civil cases can constitute prejudicial error entitling the aggrieved party to reversal of the judgment an
