this writ proceeding requires us to resolve two questions related to whether an employer prelitigation investigation of an employee harassment and discrimination claims is protected from disclosure in discovery.as an initial matter,we consider whether the employer prelitigation factual investigation is protected by the privilege or work product doctrine when the investigation is undertaken by outside counsel who is specifically directed not to provide legal advice as to which course of action to take.if we conclude the investigation is privileged,we must next consider whether the employer assertion of an avoidable consequences defense waives any applicable claim of privilege when the investigation was initiated after the employee had already left his or her job with the employer.
the trial court ruled in favor of the former employee on the privilege issue,concluding that outside counsel was acting as a fact finder and not an attorney who was providing legal advice.the court also concluded the employer waived any privilege that might be claimed by asserting an avoidable consequences defense and thereby placing the investigation at issue.
we conclude the trial court erred.the dominant purpose of outside counsel factual investigation was to provide legal services to the employer in anticipation of litigation.outside counsel was not required to give legal advice as to what course of action to pursue in order for the privilege to apply.further,the privilege was not waived by the employer assertion of an avoidable consequences defense under the circumstances presented here.
factual and procedural history 
andrea waters began working as a firefighter and paramedic for the city of petaluma city in.she was the first and only woman to hold that position.she claims she was immediately subjected to harassment and discrimination based upon her sex.according to waters,she was subjected to retaliation when she complained.for its part,the city maintains that its records show that waters never complained to her supervisors,to city supervisors,or to anyone in the city human resources department about harassment or discrimination.
in february,waters went on leave from her job with the city.in may of that same year,the city received a notice of charge of discrimination from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc indicating that waters had filed a charge with the eeoc alleging sexual harassment and retaliation pertaining to the terms and conditions of her employment and training.according to the city,the eeoc notice was the first indication it had that waters felt she had been the subject of discrimination and harassment at work.just days after the city received the eeoc notice,and while waters was still on leave from her job,she voluntarily resigned her position as a city firefighter and paramedic.
the city has a policy and practice of investigating every claim of harassment or retaliation in the workplace.depending upon the nature of the claims,the investigation may be conducted by city staff or an outside investigator.
as a consequence of the fact that waters had resigned shortly after filing her eeoc charge,city attorney eric danly city attorney concluded that waters was not seeking corrective action but was instead exhausting her administrative remedies before filing suit against the city.on june,the city attorney retained outside counsel,the law offices of amy oppenheimer oppenheimer,to investigate waters eeoc charge and to assist him in preparing to defend the city in the anticipated lawsuit.the city attorney office could have conducted the investigation itself but chose to retain oppenheimer to benefit from her legal expertise and experience of over years in employment law.the city attorney wanted to ensure that the investigative report as well as related notes and analysis would be subject to the privilege and work product doctrine just as if the investigation had been conducted by the city attorney office.
the retention agreement between the city and oppenheimer specified that oppenheimer was retained to do an impartial investigation of an eeoc complaint filed by waters.as set forth in the agreement,oppenheimer was required to interview witnesses,collect and review pertinent information,and report to you on that information.oppenheimer agreed to tell the city what we believe happened,and the basis for that conclusion.oppenheimer promised to arrive at findings based on an impartial and professional evaluation of the evidence.the agreement stated that it created an relationship between the city and oppenheimer and further provided as follows as attorneys,we will use our employment law and investigation expertise to assist you in determining the issues to be investigated and conduct impartial.the agreement further specified that the investigation would be subject to the privilege until the city waived the privilege or a court determined that some or all of the investigation was not subject to the privilege.
although the retention agreement anticipated that oppenheimer would offer a professional evaluation of the evidence based upon her experience in employment law,the agreement stopped short of asking oppenheimer to advise the city on what to do in response to waters eeoc complaint.specifically,the agreement provided it is understood that in this engagement we will not render legal advice as to what action to take as a result of the findings of the investigation.as set forth in the agreement,the city attorney was solely responsible for providing the city legal advice relating to this matter,including the legal implications and actions the city should take based on the results of the investigations 
oppenheimer provided a written report to the city as required by the terms of her retention.she provided the report to the city only and not to the city fire department or any member of its staff.every page of her report contains an indication that it is confidential and privileged.oppenheimer claims she was zealous in preserving the report confidential status and in transmitting the report to the city in confidence.according to the city attorney,all communications with oppenheimer and work product submitted by her have been maintained in confidence and not disclosed to anyone outside the relationship.
waters filed suit against the city in november.she alleged causes of action under the fair employment and housing act,et feha for hostile environment harassment,discrimination based upon sex,retaliation in violation of feha,and failure to prevent harassment,discrimination,and retaliation from occurring.
in its answer to the complaint,the city generally denied the allegations of the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses,including alleging in its eighteenth affirmative defense that it exercised reasonable care to prevent or correct instances of unlawful harassment or discrimination but that waters had unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities or to otherwise avoid harm.the city further alleged in its affirmative defense that any claims or damages were barred in whole or in part by waters failure to take reasonable and necessary steps to avoid the harms consequences she allegedly suffered.taken together,these two affirmative defenses make up the avoidable consequences doctrine.
in discovery requests served on the city,waters sought documents and testimony relating to the city investigation of her complaint,including the investigative report prepared by oppenheimer.the city objected to every request seeking production of oppenheimer report and other materials bearing on the investigation on the ground they were protected by the privilege or work product doctrine.
waters moved to compel production of documents and testimony relating to the investigation of her eeoc complaint.she claimed the investigation was not privileged and,that even if it was privileged,the city had waived any applicable privileges by placing the investigation at issue.
the trial court granted the motion to compel.the court concluded that the documents and information sought by waters are not subject to either the privilege or work product protection.it reasoned that oppenheimer investigation and report can not be construed to constitute communications because the terms of oppenheimer engagement specified that she would not render legal advice.the court observed that,even if oppenheimer had offered legal advice,the privilege would extend only to communications containing legal advice and not to the factual investigation.the court also concluded that any applicable privilege had been waived because the city put the investigation at issue by asserting an avoidable consequences defense.it did not suggest waters had failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective opportunities that resulted from the investigation,which was initiated only after waters left her job.instead,the court explained that the investigation was the best evidence of what the city would have done earlier if waters had pursued her complaints while still employed.
the city filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court challenging the trial court order.after we denied the petition,the supreme court granted a writ of review and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief requested by the city should not be granted.we issued an order to show cause at the supreme court direction.
discussion 
scope and propriety of writ review 
interlocutory writ review of discovery rulings is ordinarily limited to situations involving an issue of first impression that is of general importance to the legal profession,an order denying discovery that effectively precludes a litigant from having a fair opportunity to litigate his or her case,or a ruling compelling discovery that violates a privilege.oxy resources california llc superior court th,oxy resources.writ review is appropriate here because the trial court order compelling production of documents and testimony violates a privilege allegedly held by the city.an appeal following a final judgment does not offer an adequate remedy because there is no way to undo the harm resulting from the disclosure of privileged materials.ibid.

p rinciples governing privilege and work product doctrine 
the privilege,which is set forth in evidence code section,confers a privilege on the client to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between client and lawyer the fundamental purpose of the privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics surrounding legal matters.costco,supra,cal th at.the privilege is absolute and precludes disclosure of confidential communications even though they may be highly relevant to a dispute.ibid.
a party that seeks to protect communications from disclosure based upon the privilege must establish the preliminary facts necessary to support its exercise,a communication made in the course of an relationship.costco,supra,cal th at.once that party establishes facts necessary to support a prima facie claim of privilege,the communication is presumed to have been made in confidence and the opponent of the privilege has the burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the privilege does not for other reasons apply.ibid.
an relationship exists when the parties satisfy the definitions of lawyer and client as specified in evidence code sections and,respectively.for purposes of the privilege,client is defined in relevant part as a person who,directly or through an authorized representative,consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity,italics added.a confidential communication means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by confidential means.a confidential communication may include a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.ibid.
in assessing whether a communication is privileged,the initial focus of the inquiry is on the dominant purpose of the relationship between attorney and client and not on the purpose served by the individual communication.costco,supra,cal th at pp.if a court determines that communications were made during the course of an relationship,the communications,including any reports of factual material,would be privileged,even though the factual material might be discoverable by other means.id.at.

the protections of the privilege and the work product doctrine may be waived by disclosure of privileged communications or work product to a party outside the relationship if the disclosure is inconsistent with goals of maintaining confidentiality or safeguarding the attorney work product.see oxy resources,supra,th at pp.although the privilege and work product doctrine are both subject to waiver,there are important distinctions between the two.among other things,the privilege applies only to communications,whereas work product protection applies irrespective of whether any material claimed to be privileged is communicated to the client.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the issues raised by the city petition.
treating prelitigation factual investigation as privileged 
the city contends the factual investigation is protected by the privilege and the work product doctrine because it retained outside counsel to provide legal services.in rejecting the city claim of privilege,the trial court focused on the fact that the terms of outside counsel retention did not extend to providing legal advice to the city.waters takes the position that outside counsel services were limited to a role as a fact finder without any evidence to suggest counsel was retained to provide a legal service.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the city that it had an relationship with outside counsel even though counsel role was limited to a factual investigation and did not extend to providing legal advice as to which course of action to take based upon the results of the investigation.
as an initial matter,waters claims we are obligated to defer to the lower court factual findings including its conclusion that there was no relationship between the city and oppenheimer unless the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence.we do not agree that deference is owed to the trial court conclusions under the circumstances presented here,where the relevant facts are undisputed.waters does not dispute the terms of oppenheimer retenti
