defendant guillermo aliro perez appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york following a jury trial before edward korman,chief judge,convicting him of failing to file a currency report,in violation of b,and making a false statement to the government,in violation of a,and sentencing him principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.on appeal,perez contends principally that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney,who had also been his employer,a was a potential witness at trial,and b was representing another person who had been charged with a similar offense and that the trial court erred in allowing perez to be with respect to that other person conduct.for the reasons that follow,we find no merit in any of perez contentions,and we affirm the judgment.
background 
on september,at john kennedy international airport jfk,as perez prepared to board a flight to the dominican republic,a customs inspector advised him of the federal requirement that he file a report if he was about to transport from the united states monetary instruments totaling more than currency report,see.perez proceeded to sign a form declaring that he was carrying a total of.a routine examination of his luggage,however,showed that one bag contained five aerosol cans,and closer inspection revealed that the cans contained united states currency totaling.in all,perez was found to be in possession of approximately.he was arrested for violating the currency report requirement and was eventually indicted on that charge and on one count of making a false statement to the government,in violation of a.
from early september until the time of his arrest,perez was employed as a paralegal by ramon pagan.after his arrest,perez was represented in the present criminal proceeding by pagan.at that time,pagan was also representing one andres almonte.on september,eight days prior to perez arrest,almonte had been arrested at jfk as he prepared to board a flight to the dominican republic and was charged with having failed to file an accurate currency report he was carrying some in his luggage,secreted in six aerosol cans.
this opinion principally addresses perez contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because pagan represented both perez and almonte and because pagan was a potential witness at perez trial.
a.the first curcio inquiry 
in january,the government wrote to the district court pointing out the similarity between the money smuggling acts of perez and almonte,along with pagan representation of both defendants,and requested that the court conduct an inquiry of perez pursuant to united states curcio,cir curcio hearing.at such a hearing,the trial court advises the defendant of his right to representation by an attorney who has no conflict of interest,instructs the defendant as to the dangers arising from particular conflicts,permits the defendant to confer with his chosen counsel,encourages the defendant to seek advice from independent counsel,allows a reasonable time for the defendant to make a decision,and determines,preferably by means of questions that are likely to be answered in narrative form,whether the defendant understands the risk of representation by his present counsel and freely chooses to run them.see id.at.the ultimate goal of these procedures is to permit the court to determine whether the defendant waiver of his right to counsel is knowing and intelligent.see id.at.
in requesting a curcio hearing for perez,the government stated that t he central question in this case is whether the defendant knew that there was money in the cans in his luggage.letter from special assistant united states attorney sausa steven to chief judge edward korman,dated january,at.the government contended,inter alia,that that knowledge could be inferred from the facts that perez,as pagan paralegal,would have had access to facts pertaining to almonte,pagan client that the two smuggling efforts were strikingly similar that the cans perez was carrying were substantially identical to the cans almonte had carried and that the two attempts had occurred little more than a week apart.the government stated that it appeared that pagan was at least a potential witness at trial,as he might have material information as to the knowledge that perez,while working as his paralegal,had gained as to the details of almonte case.the government also noted that,when arrested,perez was employed by pagan and said he was traveling on business.
on january,a curcio hearing was begun before magistrate judge steven gold,to whom the matter had been referred for report and recommendation.those attending the hearing included perez,pagan,and a representative of the new york state association of criminal defense lawyers defense bar association.
at that hearing,the government informed the court that it could not be sure whether it would attempt to call pagan as a witness.see hearing transcript,january,tr,at.the defense bar association representative urged the court not to allow the government to interfere with an accused right to counsel of his choice,absent some more certain reason to believe there was a conflict of interest.see tr.at.pagan stated that he was not aware of any actual or potential conflict of interest resulting from his representation of both perez and almonte.see tr.at.pagan also stated that perez job as his paralegal had not entailed any meaningful contact with almonte 
perez never saw almonte file or complaint,never interviewed almonte here or at any jail facility.he met the family,simply because they were brought to my office to bring me copies of their income taxes and proof of identity and citizenship and things of that nature.
the court received assurances from perez that he spoke and understood english and that he was not laboring under a medical or mental condition that might impair his judgment.the court then proceeded,in accordance with united states curcio,to advise and instruct perez at length as to the dangers of potential conflicts,including the possibility that pagan might be called as a witness at perez trial,and that other conflicts might arise if almonte chose to cooperate with the government,or if perez were offered a cooperation agreement that depended on his inculpating almonte,or if pagan were targeted by a grand jury investigation.see,tr.at.the magistrate judge also stated several times that one of the purposes of the hearing was to ensure that,if perez were convicted,pagan simultaneous representation of perez and almonte would afford perez no basis for challenging his conviction.see tr.at.
under oath,perez stated that he understood all that had been said,and he informed the court that he wanted pagan to continue as his attorney 
the defendant according to my feelings,i do see any conflict of interest in this situation.i think we can prove that later.i can prove that.i want pagan to continue being my lawyer.
the court would you like the opportunity to consult with a lawyer at no cost to you before you make that decision 
the defendant i do think right now i have any reason to do that.
tr.at see also tr.at i want him to continue as my lawyer.the magistrate judge adjourned the hearing to give perez additional time for reflection.
the hearing was resumed on the following day.the magistrate judge briefly summarized the potential conflicts of which he had warned perez in the previous day proceeding.see hearing transcript,january,tr,at.in addition,pagan stated that the issues had been covered with perez 
very extensively and he also been told the same by the members of the new york state association of criminal defense lawyers.so i think in the long run,perez has had more attorney attention from the private bar than the normal defendant would be sic before this court.
tr.at.perez stated that he had thought about the court advice and instructions,and he rephrased the potential conflicts in his own words.see tr.at.perez stated that the issues were clear to him and that he wanted to continue with pagan as his attorney 
the court do you still want to give up your right to have a different lawyer appointed to represent you and continue with pagan as your attorney 
the defendant yes,your honor.
the court do you understand that by doing this,you giving up your right to challenge your conviction,if it should be you convicted,you will not be able to complain to this court or the court of appeals that your conviction should be set aside because pagan had competing interests and did represent you properly as a result.
do you understand that 
the defendant i understand.
as a result of these proceedings,the magistrate judge found perez waiver of the issues that have been raised thus far knowing and voluntary and recommended that the curcio waiver be accepted and that pagan continue as perez attorney.tr.at.
b.the government motion to disqualify pagan 
in may,the government moved to disqualify pagan as counsel for perez,stating that it planned to call pagan as one of its witnesses at trial.the government argued that perez,upon his arrest,had made statements to customs officials from which one could infer that perez was traveling for pagan the government wished to call pagan as a rebuttal witness to testify that perez in fact was not traveling for pagan.the government also argued that by reason of perez assistance to pagan in the representation of almonte with respect to almonte attempt to smuggle reportable currency out of the united states in aerosol cans,pagan testimony could help to establish that perez likely had knowledge that the aerosol cans perez carried likewise contained reportable currency.the government motion was referred to magistrate judge gold for report and recommendation.
perez opposed the motion,contending that he had not told customs officials that he was traveling for pagan.pagan argued that his testimony was not needed to establish that perez worked for him as a paralegal,for that could be stipulated.pagan also argued that perez,in that capacity,had had no access to any information as to the nature of the charges against almonte.
the magistrate judge recommended that the government disqualification motion be granted.he reasoned that pagan testimony could help the government case by describing perez contacts with the almonte case but if the government were able to prove those facts by other means,pagan might usefully be called as a witness by perez to counter the government proof.the magistrate judge thus viewed pagan as a potential witness for either side.
perez filed objections to the magistrate judge recommendation,submitting an affidavit from perez and argument from pagan.perez affidavit stated,in pertinent part,as follows 
on september,i was arrested en route to the dominican republic.
i was not traveling on business for pagan or on his behalf and i never stated that to any one.
i want ramon pagan to be my lawyer in representing me in this matter.
i will not be able to hire another lawyer and it will create a great financial hardship on me and my family.
to disqualify pagan as my attorney is to deny me of sic my right of counsel of my choice.
i worked briefly for pagan.i never examined or had access to andres almonte file other than as required by the curcio hearings and pleadings therein.i have yet to meet andres almonte.
i am willing to proceed with pagan as my attorney.
affidavit of guillermo aliro perez,dated july,perez aff.
the accompanying memorandum submitted by pagan stated,inter alia,that although perez had worked for pagan,and perez had stated that he was traveling on business when he was arrested,perez never stated that he was traveling on business for pagan and in discovery,the government had produced no evidence that perez ever stated he was traveling on business for,or on behalf of,pagan.objections to the granting of government motion to disqualify counsel,dated july,objections or perez objections to disqualification,at.pagan also stated that he had no knowledge of any fact that the government would wish to prove at trial 
my testimony before the grand jury revealed neither unique nor material knowledge of the relationship between perez and almonte,if such a relationship exist sic.but rather,my testimony revealed that 
perez was not in my office when i met with almonte family 
perez only duty with respect to the almonte case was to pick up documents from almonte family and delivered sic them to my office 
perez did not have access to almonte file prior to his arrest or since other than as required by the curcio hearings 
i did not know that perez was leaving the country or when he was returning and 
i was surprise sic to learn that perez was traveling on business when he was arrested.
objections at.pagan stated that the fact of perez employment by pagan could be introduced in the form of a stipulation to avoid my having to testify.objections at.
after a hearing on perez objections to the magistrate judge recommendation,chief judge korman concluded that the government motion to disqualify pagan should be denied.the court found that the government would not need pagan testimony to counter the inferred statement by perez that he was traveling on behalf of pagan,because perez had now submitted an affidavit saying that he was not traveling on behalf of pagan.see hearing transcript,july,july tr,at.further,after being informed that perez planned defense was that the bag containing the aerosol cans belonged to someone else,that perez was doing that person a favor to take the bag to the dominican republic,and that perez had never opened the bag,the court concluded that pagan testimony also would not be necessary on any other issue.see july tr.at.
the motion for disqualification was denied.on the government motion for reconsideration,the district court adhered to that decision.the court concluded that the likelihood that pagan would provide any testimony that would help the government was insufficient to override perez right to counsel of his choice.see hearing transcript,september,tr,at.
c.the second curcio inquiry 
thereafter,perez and pagan participated in a proffer session with the government.during that session,perez stated that,prior to attempting to board the airplane,he had in fact looked inside the bag he had been given and had seen the aerosol cans.that statement was in direct conflict with pagan representation to the court at the july hearing that the defense would be that perez had never looked inside the bag.in light of perez more recent statement,the government wrote to the district court to request a new curcio hearing.the government explained that if perez testified at trial that he had not looked in the bag and had not seen the cans,the government would attempt to impeach him with the statement he made at the proffer session.the government conceded that it had other witnesses who could testify to perez statement that he had looked in the bag and that there thus would be no need to call pagan for that purpose but the government stated that perez might wish to rebut the impeaching testimony of those witnesses by calling pagan as his own witness,which would provoke pagan disqualification as trial counsel.the government thus requested a new curcio inquiry 
to explore the potential conflict of interest with the defendant,and then determine whether the defendant would prefer to preserve his right to call pagan as a witness at trial thus necessitating his disqualification or to forego sic his ability to call him as a witness at trial thus retaining him as his trial counsel.
letter from sausa to chief judge korman,dated october,at.
in october,a second curcio inquiry was conducted by magistrate judge gold,who explained to perez that retaining pagan as his attorney would prevent him from calling pagan to testify as to what perez had had not the proffer session.perez once again stated that he wished to continue with pagan as his attorney.following a recess of hours to permit perez to consider the question further,perez stated that he wished to keep pagan,to waive the right to call pagan as a witness,and to waive any right to complain about the outcome of the case on the basis that pagan was unavailable as a witness.the magistrate judge found perez waiver to be knowing and voluntar y and recommended that the case proceed with pagan as perez counsel.hearing transcript,october,at.pagan remained perez attorney through trial.
perez testimony at trial 
at trial,the government presented evidence of the events surrounding perez arrest.in his defense,perez testified that he did not know there was money in his luggage.he testified that the bag containing the aerosol cans of money had been given to him by a man he knew only as tony,who asked him to take the bag to the dominican republic for tony sick mother.perez stated that he had looked in the bag and had seen aerosol cans but he did not know there was money in them.on,perez was questioned about the knowledge he had gained of the almonte case in the eight days before his arrest while working as a paralegal for a criminal defense attorney who represented almonte.perez testified that he knew almonte had been arrested for attempting to transport more than out of the united states but that he did not know almonte had carried the money in aerosol cans.
the jury found perez guilty on both counts of the indictment.he was sentenced as indicated above,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,perez contends principally that pagan representation of both perez and almonte,and pagan potential appearance as a witness at perez trial,created conflicts of interest that were unwaivable.he also contends that the admission of evidence referring to the prosecution of almonte deprived him of a fair trial,that pagan performance was constitutionally deficient,and that the court should have imposed a shorter sentence by departing downward from the sentencing guidelines.finding no basis for reversal,we affirm.
a.the allegedly unwaivable conflicts 
invoking this court recent decision in united states schwarz,cir,perez contends that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because pagan had conflicts of interest a as counsel for both perez and almonte,and b as a potential witness at perez trial,and that those conflicts were not waivable.we reject his contentions.schwarz presented highly unusual facts,id.at,that are not easily analogized to other certainly not to this,as discussed below,schwarz involved a defense attorney that actually conflicted with his client interests so severely as to permeate every aspect of the representation.
multiple representation and united states schwarz 
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.const.amend.vi.this constitutional guarantee generally ensures that an accused may be represented by any attorney who will agree to take his case.see,united states cunningham,cir.although a defendant right to counsel of his choice is not an absolute one,united states ostrer,cir,we have consistently recognized that the right of an accused who retains an attorney to be represented by that attorney is a right of constitutional dimension,united states wisniewski,cir quoting united states sheiner,cir,cert.denied,d.hence the c hoice of counsel should not be unnecessarily obstructed by the court.united states bernstein,cir see also united states bubar,cir recognizing a defendant constitutional right to be represented by counsel of his own choice,cert.denied,d united states,cir sixth amendment protects criminal defendant selection of retained counsel.
the right to the effective assistance of counsel also includes the right to be represented by an attorney who is free from conflicts of interest.see,wood georgia,d holloway arkansas,d armienti united states,cir united states blau,cir.this right may be violated if the attorney has a potential conflict of interest that result s in prejudice to the defendant,or an actual conflict of interest that adversely affect s the attorney performance.united states levy,cir.an attorney has an actual,as opposed to a potential,conflict of interest when,during the course of the representation,the attorney and defendant interests diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.united states schwarz,at internal quotation marks omitted winkler keane,cir,cert.denied,d.an attorney has a potential conflict of interest if the interests of the defendant may place the attorney under inconsistent duties at some time in the future.united states kliti,cir.
where the right to counsel of choice conflicts with the right to an attorney of undivided loyalty,the choice as to which right is to take precedence must generally be left to the defendant and not be dictated by the government.see,united states cunningham,at.to ensure that a defendant choice is knowingly and intelligently exercised,the district court,after learning of the possibility of a conflict of interest,determines whether the attorney has an actual conflict,a potential conflict,or no conflict at all.see,united states levy,at.if the court discovers no genuine conflict,it has no further obligation.id.at the other end of the spectrum,if the court determines that counsel has an actual conflict that is so severe as to indicate per se that the rendering of effective assistance will be impeded,or is analogous to such a conflict in breadth and depth,the court must,as discussed below,disqualify counsel.see united states fulton,cir united states schwarz,at.and if,between these two extremes,the court determines that the attorney suffers from a lesser actual or only a potential conflict,then it may accept a defendant knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel and permit the defendant to be represented by the attorney of his choice.united states levy,at accord united states schwarz,at.the courts do,of course,retain discretion to reject a defendant knowing and intelligent waiver when his attorney conflict jeopardizes the integrity of judicial proceedings.see,united states locascio,cir united states arrington,cir.but absent such institutional concerns,courts will not assume too paternalistic an attitude in protecting the defendant from himself,and although the defendant choice of counsel may sometimes seem woefully foolish to the court,the choice remains his.united states curcio,cir.
our opinions in united states fulton and united states schwarz illustrate the very narrow category of cases in which we have held attorney conflicts to be unwaivable.in fulton,a prosecution for conspiracy to possess and import heroin,a government witness had implicated the defendant trial counsel in related heroin importation.that accusation meant that the attorney needed to be concerned not only with the interests of the defendant but also with the attorney own personal reputation,and more than that,the potential that he himself might be accused of a crime,at internal quotation marks omitted.as a consequence,we concluded that there was an actual conflict of interest so severe as to amount to per se ineffective assistance.the attorney in avoiding criminal charges or reputational damage was so powerful as to affect virtually every aspect of counsel representation of the defendant,and to be of a different character than other conflicts.id.at.advice as well as advocacy would be permeated by counsel,and no rational defendant would knowingly and intelligently be represented by a lawyer whose conduct was guided largely by a desire for.id.given the breadth and depth of this conflict,we concluded that there could be no meaningful waiver.id.
we drew heavily on these principles in finding an unwaivable conflict in united states schwarz,although the principal conflict involved the attorney not in terms of his liberty or reputation,as in fulton,but rather in matters of finance.the schwarz case involved the prosecution of several police officers,including schwarz,in connection with the assaults of abner louima en route to and inside of a police precinct house.louima asserted that in the precinct house he had been assaulted by officer justin volpe and another officer.schwarz had an interest in showing either that there was no second assaulting officer or that the second officer was someone other than himself.the attorney representing schwarz had recently formed a law firm that received a,million retainer to represent the policeman benevolent association pba,which was a defendant in a civil suit filed by louima alleging a of the events involving the assault on him.in light of the civil suit,it would have been against the interest of the pba for the jury in the criminal trial to find that there was a second officer,even if he were someone other than schwarz.thus,as a substantive matter,the interests of schwarz and the pba were divergent.
more importantly,schwarz interests diverged from the of his attorney.although the attorney and his firm were to have no formal role in the civil suit,the pba had a right to hold back a portion of counsel million retainer to ensure the pba satisfaction with the firm performance the pba also had the right to cancel the retainer agreement on days notice and the attorney could expect that satisfaction with the firm performance would result in a renewal of the retainer upon its expiration.at.under this arrangement,counsel powerful interest in his own financial gave him a significant incentive to protect the interests of the pba,even where they conflicted with the interests of schwarz.
in sum,counsel representation of schwarz was in conflict not only with his ethical obligation to the pba as his client,but also with his own substantial in the,million retainer agreement his newly formed firm had entered into with the pba.id.at.the conflict generated by counsel was so severe as to give rise to the distinct possibility that,at each point the conflict was felt,counsel would sacrifice schwarz interests for those of the pba.id.thus,we concluded that no rational defendant in schwarz position would have knowingly and intelligently desired that attorney representation,and that fulton rationale with respect to when an attorney renders a conflict unwaivable was equally applicable to the unusual facts of the schwarz case.id.
as we made plain in fulton,however,lesser conflicts,such as an attorney representation of two or more defendants or his prior representation of a trial witness,are generally waivable.see united states fulton,at.although such a conflict might require a defendant to abandon a particular defense or line of questioning,he can be advised as to what he must forgo he can then seek the legal advice of independent counsel and make an informed judgment that balances the alteration in the trial strategy against the perceived effect of having to get a new and perhaps less effective defense counsel.united states fulton,at.in the multiple representation situation,the defendant can be advised by independent counsel of the dangers of such matters as one defendant cooperating with the government,and make a knowing and intelligent decision that he wishes to continue to be represented by his attorney despite the attorney representation of another accused.id.where the defendant can rationally opt to retain counsel of his choice despite a conflict,the court conducts a curcio hearing to determine whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives his right to representation.see,united states leslie,cir,cert.denied,d united states levy,at.
in the present case,perez has proffered no facts on which it could be concluded that pagan had an unwaivable actual conflict of interest based on the representation of both perez and almonte.seeking to analogize his circumstances to the extraordinary actual conflict at issue in schwarz,perez states that pagan was blinded by his own substantial in that he stood to gain a considerable amount of monies if he remained counsel to both defendants perez brief on appeal at.that statement,however,is conclusory and unsupported by any citation to the record,and we have seen nothing whatever to indicate that pagan had anything approaching the sort of fiscal that was present in united states schwarz.there was nothing to indicate that pagan had a continuing relationship with,or an exceptionally lucrative retainer from,almonte.there was also nothing to suggest that the proceedings in the trial of either perez or almonte would have repercussions at the trial of the other.nor was pagan himself accused of being involved in the money smuggling activities of either perez or almonte.
in sum,the conflicts cited by perez were only potential,not actual,and they involved the rather routine discrete problems that arise when counsel loyalty is divided among multiple clients.such conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,and we see no basis for concluding that the district court erred in not finding that the dual representation here produced a conflict that was unwaivable.
there was the possibility that either perez or almonte might be offered a cooperation agreement by the government,with potentially beneficial treatment of the offeree conditioned upon that defendant inculpation of the other defendant.this posed a potential conflict,but one whose likelihood a defendant could assess and knowingly and intelligently decide to waive.perez received a full explanation of the potential conflicts from the magistrate judge he also received advice from members of the defense bar association task force see tr.at tr.at and he was repeatedly apparently opportunity to consult with other independent counsel see,tr.at tr.at.at each hearing,perez repeatedly stated that he wanted to retain pagan as his attorney.the court nonetheless advised perez that he remained free to contact the court to reopen the question of his representation by pagan if perez developed to any judgment of to the wisdom of his choice,and perez indicated that he understood.see,tr.at.perez never retreated from his election to be represented by after he was convicted.
pagan as a potential witness 
we also reject the contention that pagan had an unwaivable conflict of interest because he was a potential witness for the government at trial.the record shows that the government motion to disqualify pagan so that he could be called as a government witness was denied several months prior to trial.the government,in its initial letter to the court and in its motion to disqualify pagan,had stated that it wished to show perez employment by pagan when pagan represented almonte,and that it wished to call pagan as a witness to rebut perez inferred statement to customs officials on his own arrest that he was traveling on behalf of pagan.however,it then transpired that the fact that pagan was perez employer was undisputed and was to be stipulated.see,perez objections to disqualification at july tr.at.and the government need to call pagan as a witness to testify that perez was not traveling on behalf of pagan vanished when perez submitted his own affidavit to the court stating,i was not traveling on business for pagan or on his behalf and i never stated that to any one.perez aff.
on the strength of this affidavit,the district court denied the government motion to disqualify pagan,stating that any benefit the government might gain if it were allowed to call pagan as a witness was outweighed by perez interest in retaining pagan as his counsel of choice.see july tr.at see also tr.at denying government motion for reconsideration.thus,the potential for the government to call pagan as a witness was eliminated.
finally,perez contends that the court was required to disqualify pagan because,due to pagan dual representation of both defendants,was prevented from pursuing a defense that would have established that he was traveling on business for pagan.perez brief on appeal at.leaving aside the lack of any explained connection between the dual representation and the defense perez now states he wished to pursue,this contention is baseless because it ignores perez sworn statement to the district court,that i was not traveling on business for pagan or on his behalf perez aff.emphasis added.perez made this statement to the district court expressly in order to persuade the court that pagan should not be disqualified.the court was not required to disqualify pagan on the premise that perez might later,despite his sworn representation to the court,decide to change his story.
in sum,the record does not disclose any conflict on the part of
