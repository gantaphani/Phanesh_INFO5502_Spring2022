patricia ann ensign appeals from her conviction on four counts of willful failure to file tax returns,and oscar stilley seeks review of the district court refusal to allow him to proceed pro hac vice as ensign attorney.we determine that the district court acted within its discretion in declining to allow stilley to represent ensign pro hac vice and that stilley lacks standing to appeal the district court orders.
ensign,along with eight other individuals,was charged in a indictment with one count of conspiring to defraud the government for the purposes of impeding and impairing the internal revenue service irs in violation of,and a number of counts of willful failure to file tax returns.ensign and four were eventually tried before a jury.ensign was acquitted on the conspiracy charge,but convicted on four counts of willful failure to file tax returns.following her conviction,ensign filed a timely notice of appeal claiming inter alia that her sixth amendment right to counsel of her choice was violated by the district court orders declining to allow stilley to represent her in addition,stilley filed a notice of appeal on his own behalf.
stilley first became involved in this case in the fall of,when ensign,through her appointed counsel,alex gonzalez,sought to have stilley appointed as or advisory counsel.stilley was admitted to the practice of law in arkansas,but was not admitted to the district court bar or the arizona bar.on november,the district court appointed stilley as legal for the with compensation under the criminal justice act cja at per hour for up to hours.
on january,ensign moved to associate stilley as a cja attorney,pro hac vice.the motion was accompanied by stilley affidavit stating that he was admitted to the practice of law in arkansas,was not presently suspended or disbarred,but had one disciplinary proceeding that has yet to be resolved and has been pending since no hearing has been set on such proceeding as of yet.that same day,the district court appointed stilley as lead counsel for ensign with a compensation rate of per hour under the cja.
on february,the government submitted under seal evidence concerning disciplinary actions against stilley in arkansas.at a hearing on march,after excusing all defendants and counsel except stilley and ensign,the district judge asked stilley whether he had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings in arkansas and directed him to respond in writing.
on april,after having considered stilley written response,the district court entered an order under seal terminating stilley representation of ensign as lead counsel,legal advisor,consultant under the cja.the court explained that usually the federal public defender office screened attorneys for the cja defense panel and required disclosure of all pending disciplinary proceedings,but because stilley was appointed through means other than the typical application process,the court was obligated to conduct its own review of stilley.
the court proceeded to exercise its discretion by withdrawing stilley conditional appointment.the court noted that it had been unaware of the disciplinary matters concerning stilley pending in arkansas,and concluded that stilley presented issues which would preclude his appointment or qualification to the district cja panel in the ordinary course of panel selection.the court set forth several reasons for its decision.first,it noted that during the lengthy trial in this case,stilley might be required to serve a sentence imposed by the arkansas circuit court.second,the court observed that stilley had not been forthcoming regarding the various matters pending in arkansas.third,the court commented that the present proceedings in arkansas concerning stilley did not appear to be isolated or infrequent as stilley seemed to have been subject to sanctions and discipline proceedings in arkansas on several occasions.finally,the court observed that instead of responding to the court specific questions,stilley submitted a brief devoting more than twenty pages to collaterally attacking the various proceedings in arkansas and concluded that the fact that stilley was either unable or unwilling to focus on the key issue,further lends credence to this court concerns regarding his representation.
the april,order also addressed its impact on ensign.the order indicated that it did not prejudice ensign because during the period that stilley acted as ensign lead counsel,ensign had been concurrently represented by gonzalez,who had been her attorney of record since march.in addition,the order concluded that ensign sixth amendment right to counsel of her choice was not implicated because ensign all along has had capable and competent counsel,and it is well settled indigent defendants do not have the right to have a particular counsel appointed.united states mack,cir.
on april,the district court denied ensign motion for reconsideration,and on may,it denied ensign objection to the removal of stilley as a defense consultant.ensign and stilley requests for interlocutory relief from this court were unsuccessful.on may,we indicated that the order revoking stilley pro hac vice status was not appealable,and on june,we denied ensign and stilley petition for a writ of mandamus.
jury selection for the trial of ensign and her commenced on may.on june,ensign informed the court that she had retained stilley as her attorney and requested that he be allowed to appear as her counsel,pro hac vice.the district court declined to interrupt proceedings to consider the request,but later that day the court considered the request during a break in the trial.
after limited argument on the request,the district court declined to allow stilley to appear pro hac vice.the court opined that regardless of whether stilley sought appointment under the cja or pro hac vice,it still had an obligation to ensure that he was qualified to proceed and that stilley had not satisfied the court previously expressed concerns regarding his ethical fitness.the court further noted that there were disciplinary proceedings pending against stilley in arkansas,some of the pleadings that he had filed during the time that he was admitted pro hac vice were of dubious merit and possibly submitted for improper purposes such as delay,and the timing of the request was significant.expanding on this last point,the court noted that stilley had been relieved of his responsibilities in april,trial had started two weeks earlier,and it would be disruptive to bring stilley into the case at that time.the court concluded that the request that stilley appear pro hac vice sought a privilege not a right,and denied the request as a matter within its discretion.
the court offered further explanation of its order in response to questions from ensign.when ensign objected that stilley had done an excellent job and had never been disrespectful of the court,the district judge agreed that he had always been very respectful.when ensign asked if stilley could work for her in any capacity,the district court responded that the motion was only to associate oscar stilley pro hac vice as lead counsel,and that ensign counsel could pursue stilley as a consultant even though the district judge thought that might be problematic.
our general rule is that the denial of a motion to appear pro hac vice is reviewed for abuse of discretion,except to the extent that the appeal raises an issue of law,which is reviewed de novo.united states walters,cir.see united states ries,cir we have determined that the judge was well within his discretion in concluding that the attorney was not living up to his responsibilities.ensign,like the defendants in walters and ries,has filed an appeal from her conviction and sentence which challenges the district court refusal to allow her attorney to appear pro hac vice.
to the extent that ensign challenges the april,order revoking stilley cja appointment as violating her right to counsel under the sixth amendment,the challenge is not persuasive.the district court assertion that ensign did not have a right under the sixth amendment to have stilley appointed cja counsel pro hac vice was recently reaffirmed by the supreme court in united states,d.the court held that the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them.id.the district court april,order only revoked stilley pro hac vice status as cja appointed counsel.ensign and stilley actions following the april order,including their failure to seek stilley admission as retained counsel until after trial had commenced,reflect their understanding that the april order only denied stilley leave to participate as cja appointed counsel.accordingly,the april order did not implicate ensign right to counsel of choice,and because ensign has failed to argue that the revocation was an abuse of the district court discretion,she has not demonstrated that she is entitled to any relief from the order.
the district court june,denial of ensign motion to appoint stilley as her trial counsel,however,does implicate constitutional concerns.we have held that a defendant right to the counsel of his choice includes the right to have an out lawyer admitted pro hac vice.walters,at internal quotations marks and citations omitted see also ries,at.
however,in both walters and ries,we recognized that the sixth amendment right to chosen counsel is not absolute and could be revoked to serve a compelling purpose,such as the efficient and orderly administration of justice.walters,at ries,at.in ries,we stated 
where,as here,an attorney strongly suggests through his behavior that he will neither abide by the court rules and impeding the orderly administration of justice nor be readily answerable to the court,the judge may,consistent with the compelling purpose standard of united states,at,cir reject his pro hac vice application.
ries,at.similarly,in walters,we explained that a defendant exercise of his right to counsel of choice could not unduly hinder the fair,efficient and orderly administration of justice,but noted that 
the mere fact that a defendant seeks to retain an attorney does not hinder the efficacious administration of justice.his choice of counsel must be respected unless it would unreasonably delay proceedings or burden the court with counsel who was incompetent or unwilling to abide by court rules and ethical guidelines.
walters,at 
our approach is consistent with the supreme court recent opinion in,where the court wrote 
nothing we have said today casts any doubt or places any qualification upon our previous holdings that limit the right to counsel of choice and recognize the authority of trial courts to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them.as the dissent too discusses,post,at,the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them.see wheat united states,at,d caplin drysdale united states,at,d nor may a defendant insist on representation by a person who is not a member of the bar,or demand that a court honor his waiver of representation.see wheat,at,we have recognized a trial court wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness,at,and against the demands of its calendar,morris slappy,d.the court has,moreover,an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.wheat,supra,at,
applying this case law,we conclude that the district court denial of ensign request on june to have stilley represent her pro hac vice was supported by the compelling purposes inherent in the fair,efficient and orderly administration of justice the district court gave three reasons for its order.first,it expressed concerns regarding stilley ethical fitness.second,the court noted that some of the pleadings stilley filed while he was ensign counsel appeared to be improper.third,the court was concerned with the timeliness of the request because the trial had started two weeks earlier and opening arguments were scheduled to begin immediately.
all of the trial court concerns were justified.its concerns with stilley ethics were reasonably based not only on pending disciplinary proceedings in arkansas,but also on stilley failure to state in his pro hac vice application that he was subject to pending disciplinary proceedings and on his failure to directly address those proceedings when so requested.this,combined with stilley failure to cure his contempt of the arkansas court orders,raised concerns that he would neither abide by the court rules and practices,nor be readily answerable to the court.ries,at.furthermore,the record reveals that following his appointment as ensign counsel,stilley had filed numerous motions of dubious merit.although a defendant is entitled to a zealous defense,the number and nature of the motions allowed for a reasonable concern that stilley might consider obstruction to be part of the defense he would proffer for ensign.
moreover,as the consolidated trial of ensign and four other defendants had already started and was scheduled to continue for a number of weeks,the addition of stilley at the counsel table would likely have engendered considerable confusion and delays.jurors could be distracted by the sudden inclusion of a new attorney.also,the addition of a new attorney could interfere with the other defendants rights to a fair trial accordingly,the district court denial of ensign motion was a reasonable exercise of its wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel against the demands of the court calendar in an effort to maintain the fair,efficient and orderly administration of justice.see.at.the district court order denying ensign motion to appoint stilley pro hac vice is affirmed.
stilley also seeks appellate review on his own behalf of the district court refusal to allow him to appear pro hac vice as ensign counsel.he asserts that he was denied payment on substantial amounts of time worth tens of thousands of dollars and that his professional reputation was damaged.
initially,we note that regardless of ensign right to counsel under the sixth amendment,stilley has not asserted that he had a right to be admitted pro hac vice,and we know of no authority to that effect.we have held that the decision to grant pro hac vice status is discretionary.gallo united states dist.court,cir see also ries,at we have determined that the judge was well within his discretion in concluding that the attorney was not living up to his responsibilities.although we noted in both gallo and ries that this discretion is not unlimited,this does not convert the denial of a privilege into an injury sufficient to give the attorney standing to appeal.
our cases that have considered when an attorney has a sufficient to invoke appellate jurisdiction in his or her own right lead us to conclude that stilley lacks standing in united states chesnoff,cir,an attorney and his law firm sought to appeal an order disqualifying them from continuing to represent their client.id.at.we held that they lacked standing to appeal and dismissed the appeal.id.in doing so,we first outlined the constitutional dimensions of the issue noting that the litigant must have suffered some,adequate to satisfy article iii requirement.id.quoting caplin drysdale united states,d.we then quoted the supreme court statement in valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church state,d,that at a minimum article iii requires that the appellant show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putative illegal conduct.chesnoff,at.we further noted,again citing caplin drysdale,at,that even if the article iii requirement is met,we must then determine whether prudential considerations favor permitting the litigant to proceed with a claim on a third party behalf.at.we concluded in chesnoff that appellants lacked standing because they nowhere identified any injury to them caused by the district court disqualification order.id.at emphasis in original.
in weissman quail lodge,cir,and united states talao,cir,we further considered what type of order concerning an attorney would allow the attorney to appeal.in weissman,we indicated that although a sanc
