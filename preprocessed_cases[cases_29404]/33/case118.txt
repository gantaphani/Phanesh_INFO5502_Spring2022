angel tueros was convicted in state court of murder and criminal possession of a weapon.tueros alleges that his attorney in the criminal proceedings believed that she owed a duty of confidentiality to a witness who could have offered exculpatory testimony,but who ultimately invoked his fifth amendment privilege not to do so,and that this belief rendered tueros attorney conflicted and thus prevented her from exercising sufficient zeal in her attempts to elicit the testimony.on appeal of the district court denial of his habeas petition under,tueros does not argue that his lawyer belief was correct or that his lawyer actually owed a duty to the defense witness.he argues instead that the resulting subjective belief that she had a conflict by itself gives rise to an actual conflict under cuyler sullivan,d,for which only an adverse effect on tueros lawyer performance need be shown to demonstrate a constitutional violation.he further argues that any other conclusion is contrary to or an unreasonable application of sullivan.we reach only this final point,affirming the district court and holding that it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent for the state court to conclude that tueros attorney did not labor under an actual conflict as the supreme court used the term in sullivan.
background 
in,angel tueros was convicted of murder and criminal possession of a weapon,both in the second degree,after a jury trial in new york state supreme court,queens county.the state case relied on three witnesses to the events surrounding the shooting.yudis esteves,one of these three witnesses,lived across the street from the site of the shooting.she testified that she was in her driveway and that she saw tueros commit the murder.
hermena perlmutter,tueros trial attorney,subpoenaed juan esteves esteves,yudis esteves husband at the time,to testify at tueros trial.the evening before esteves was to appear in court,esteves called perlmutter and,with the aid of the translator,stated that yudis esteves could not have seen the shooting because she was in the basement when it occurred.at the end of this conversation,perlmutter asked esteves if he had ever been convicted or arrested.esteves replied that he had been arrested in massachusetts and that he had jumped bail and fled.upon hearing that esteves was a fugitive,perlmutter ended the conversation,stating that she could not speak with him further,that he should come to court in the morning,and that she needed to speak with the judge.neither party mentioned establishing any form of relationship.
the following morning,perlmutter spoke with the court ex parte.she indicated that she had spoken the night before with a subpoenaed witness who possessed information relevant to tueros defense,and the following exchange occurred 
perlmutter h e said something that,i believe,to have been an privilege.now,if that is an privilege,and the way he said it to me,it was to admit to me something which i know would be harmful to him and perhaps criminal.
court it is certainly not privilege,because you are not his attorney.
perlmutter he does have to pay me to be his attorney.if he comes to me and speaks to me as an attorney,if he believes it is so,then i am bound by that confidentiality.
court well,go ahead 
perlmutter then requested esteves be assigned an attorney because she believed it is altogether possible that if he is advised that he may not testify.the court appointed counsel,who advised esteves not to answer any questions.when perlmutter examined esteves during the trial,outside the presence of the jury,esteves invoked his fifth amendment privilege and refused to answer nearly all questions.perlmutter did not reveal the information that esteves had previously communicated to her,and she acquiesced in esteves claim to his fifth amendment privilege.
tueros raised a conflict of interest claim on direct appeal,but the appellate division affirmed tueros conviction,holding that the conflict,if any actually existed,was resolved when the court assigned separate counsel to the defense witness.people tueros.tueros sought leave to appeal,which was denied.people tueros.while his direct appeal was pending,tueros filed a motion under.proc.law h in a collateral attack on his conviction.this motion was denied in a memorandum decision,issued without a hearing.although tueros presented a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel argument,the court rule d that the defendant has not established that perlmutter had an relationship with the witness esteves,and therefore,no conflict of interest could arise from that relationship,citing only to new york state law for the definition of an relationship.leave to appeal the denial of the motion was denied.
having exhausted his remedies,tueros filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge.tueros argued,as he did in state court,that he had been denied his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to counsel because perlmutter had an actual conflict of interest under cuyler sullivan,d,and because the state court failed to investigate the conflict when the trial judge was first alerted to the potential conflict by perlmutter in a hearing before the district court,perlmutter stated that she believed that she had owed a duty of confidentiality to esteves,that she had felt obligated to request an attorney for him despite knowing that such an act would likely culminate in esteves claiming his fifth amendment privilege,and that in retrospect she believed that she should have asked to have been relieved from representing tueros.she testified that she knew she was in an untenable position and that this untenable position was the reason why she asked for an attorney for esteves.
in a brief unpublished decision,the district court dismissed tueros habeas petition.crediting perlmutter subjective belief that she had been prohibited by the attorney client privilege from utilizing this witness in a way that might adversely affect the witness legal position,it nonetheless concluded that the state court on appeal had ruled,with justification,that defendant attorney was not the witness counsel and that t here was no conflict.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on all aspects of the issue of whether there was a conflict of interest.
discussion 
on appeal,tueros argues that he was deprived of his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to counsel as defined by cuyler sullivan,d,because the subjective conflict of interest under which perlmutter labored amounted to an actual conflict of interest as defined in sullivan,and this conflict adversely affected her representation of him.he further argues that the state court implicit decision otherwise was contrary to or an unreasonable application of sullivan.we hold that it is not an unreasonable interpretation of sullivan to conclude that an actual conflict does not exist when the only conflict alleged is premised on a purely subjective belief of a duty of confidentiality.
standard and scope of review 
we review a district court denial of habeas relief de novo,but we review its findings of fact only for clear error.delvalle armstrong,cir.
provided a state court has adjudicated petitioner claim on the merits,d,a federal court has only the limited authority to review a state court conviction as established in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.because it is clear that the state court response to tueros motion adjudicated tueros claim on the merits as we have interpreted the phrase,see aparicio artuz,cir,aedpa requires that we query only whether the state court implicit holding on tueros constitutional claim was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court opinion is contrary to federal law if it arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.an unreasonable application of federal law occurs if a state court either identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case,or if it fails to extend a principle of clearly established law to situations which that principle should have,in reason,governed,kennaugh miller,cir.
under either prong,the unreasonably applied federal law must be clearly established at the time that petitioner conviction becomes final,and only the holdings of supreme court cases may comprise federal law.williams,at.
ii.the state court did not unreasonably apply supreme court law 
this appeal presents the question whether tueros claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by strickland washington,d,which applies to general allegations of ineffectiveness of counsel,or by sullivan,which applies only when an attorney labors under an actual conflict of interest.the importance of this choice is evident in the different burden that each standard places on a defendant attempting to demonstrate a constitutional violation.under strickland,the ineffectiveness of a defendant counsel amounts to a constitutional violation only if the defendant can show both that counsel performance was so deficient as to be outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,strickland,at,and that prejudice resulted because there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.in contrast,sullivan provides that if a defendant lawyer had an actual conflict of interest in which the lawyer actively represented conflicting interests,the defendant need only demonstrate that the actual conflict adversely affected his lawyer performance in order to prove a violation of his sixth amendment right to effective counsel.sullivan,at.sullivan thus grants the defendant a limited presumption of prejudice.strickland,at.
despite the importance of the definition of an actual conflict,which if demonstrated permits a defendant to bring his case within the ambit of sullivan,our role as reviewer of the district court denial of tueros habeas petition is limited and does not entail stating our opinion as to the proper division between the cases in which strickland and sullivan should apply.under our congressionally circumscribed authority established in d,we address the issue only tangentially and hold that it was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent to conclude that tueros counsel did not have an actual conflict of interest as defined in sullivan.
furthermore,although we hold that the state court was not required to apply sullivan,we do not proceed to the strickland analysis in this case.such an analysis will often be a logical subsequent step in similar cases,but petitioner failed to present a strickland argument to this court in his brief,and expressly disclaimed the applicability of strickland during oral argument,so we consider petitioner strickland argument to have been abandoned see fed.a losacco city of middletown,cir holding that issue is abandoned where not raised in appellate brief.
a.the alleged actual conflict in sullivan 
in sullivan,sullivan and his two alleged accomplices were tried for murder in pennsylvania state court in three separate trials,and two privately retained lawyers,dibona and peruto,were involved in all three trials.sullivan,at.neither sullivan nor his lawyers objected to multiple representation at trial or on direct appeal.id.at.sullivan trial occurred first,and the defense rested without having sullivan testify.id.at.sullivan was convicted,although the two other defendants were subsequently acquitted.id.during sullivan petition in state court for collateral review,peruto testified that the decision not to have sullivan testify at his own trial was affected by peruto conflict with the interests of the other defendants peruto was concerned that having sullivan testify would only be exposing defense witnesses for the other two trials that were coming up.id.at.other explanations for sullivan silence were,however,also given.id.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed both sullivan conviction and the denial of his petition for collateral relief,finding that no multiple representation had occurred because dibona had represented sullivan,and peruto had represented the other two defendants in their subsequent trials.id.at.
sullivan filed a habeas petition in federal court.id.the district court denied the petition,but the third circuit reversed the district court and granted the petition.id.at.the reversal was based on two conclusions the third circuit found that,contrary to the finding of the pennsylvania supreme court,dual representation did occur because both lawyers represented all three defendants,sullivan cuyler,cir,and it held that,as a matter of law,dual representation amounted to constitutionally defective counsel requiring reversal if there was some showing of a possible conflict of interest or prejudice,however remote,id.at quoting walker united states,cir per curiam.
the supreme court vacated the third circuit judgment.sullivan,at.the court agree d with the court of appeals that these facts establish the existence of multiple representation,id.at,but held that multiple representation violates a defendant sixth amendment rights only if the defendant can establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance,id.at.because the third circuit had not considered whether the conflict under which sullivan attorney labored had adversely affected his performance,the court remanded.id.
multiple representation 
respondent argues that the state court decision not to extend the scope of sullivan actual conflict analysis to encompass tueros claim was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,sullivan because the adverse effect standard in sullivan is limited to cases of multiple representation.smith hofbauer,cir refusing,on habeas review,to apply sullivan to an alleged conflict due to the prosecution of defendant attorney in the same county in which defendant was convicted beets scott,cir en banc applying,on habeas review,strickland rather than sullivan to two alleged breaches of ethical duties by defense counsel,taking a media rights contract as a fee and failing to withdraw to testify as a material witness.
insofar as respondent suggests that we are bound by language in mickens taylor,d,to sustain this argument,we are unpersuaded.in mickens,the court addressed a defense counsel conflict arising from successive representation and held that the sullivan adverse effect standard controlled even if the trial court neglected a duty to inquire into the potential conflict of which it knew or should have known.id.at.as a postscript to its holding,however,the court noted that certiorari had been granted on the presumption that sullivan applied to successive representation cases,and that w hether sullivan should be extended to such cases remains,as far as the jurisprudence of this court is concerned,an open question.id.at.in the course of this discussion,the court also noted that sullivan stressed the high probability of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation and that the language of sullivan itself does not clearly establish,or indeed even support,expansive application of the adverse effect standard beyond cases in which attorneys actively represent conflicting interests.id.at.this language in mickens,however,is not dispositive of our analysis here.not only was mickens decided several years after the state court conviction became final,but the discussion of the scope of sullivan is dicta.see id.noting that the question presented to the court presumed that sullivan applied and that questions related to sullivan scope were outside the issues considered.for clearly established federal law under d,we must look to sullivan,not to the mickens postscript.if sullivan by its own terms were to apply to cases other than multiple representation cases,the supreme court could not retroactively this clear law in dicta,because the command of d indicates that we are only able to consider the holdings of supreme court cases decided at the time of the state court conviction.
insofar as respondent relies on the language of sullivan itself,the argument that sullivan applies only in cases of multiple representation also misses the point if we were to accept tueros theory,as discussed below,that a subjective conflict of interest can constitute an actual conflict,then perlmutter effectively engaged in multiple representation because she felt she had a duty both to esteves as a witness and to tueros as the defendant.tueros alleges a conflict between duties owed to more than one person,not a conflict between a client interests and the lawyer,the most common type of case in which courts have held that strickland rather than sullivan should apply.beets,at considering the rationale for applying strickland rather than sullivan to conflicts between an attorney personal interest and his client interest.although sullivan dealt with a lawyer who owed duties to multiple defendants,it may well be unreasonable not to extend sullivan definition of an actual conflict to a lawyer whose conflict was defined by representing the divergent interests of a defendant and an important subpoenaed witness 
can a purely subjective conflict be an actual conflict 
tueros argues that his counsel subjective belief that she owed a duty of confidentiality to esteves,combined with the duty she actually owed to tueros,creates the type of actual conflict to which the adverse effect standard articulated in sullivan applies,and that concluding that tueros counsel did not labor under an actual conflict is either contrary to or an unreasonable application of sullivan.
we initially note that we credit tueros allegation that his counsel believed that she owed a duty of loyalty to esteves not to divulge confidential information.although a person subjective beliefs are by their nature difficult to verify,the subjective belief of tueros counsel is a question of fact,and the district court found that tueros counsel believed that she had conflicting duties counsel believed that she was prohibited by the attorney client privilege from utilizing this witness in a way that might adversely affect the witness legal position.we hold that this finding is not clearly erroneous.
however,while we accept that tueros counsel believed she had a conflict of interest and that,as tueros states in his brief,she decided to treat esteves massachusetts problems as confidential information,we do not determine whether tueros counsel owed an actual legal duty of any kind to esteves.tueros does not argue on appeal that the objective events that occurred created a relationship entailing any legal duties owed by perlmutter to esteves he argues only that perlmutter believ ed that she had a duty to act as esteves attorney as well as petitioner and that the case presents the question whether the conflict in perlmutter actual,subjective loyalties affected her performance at trial.
this characterization of perlmutter conflict as purely subjective,however,does not minimize the potentially detrimental impact of the conflict on the quality of tueros representation.although lacking an objective counterpart,a heartfelt belief on the part of counsel that she owes a duty of confidentiality to a witness can wreak the same havoc on an effective defense whether she is correct or mistaken in that belief.
to determine whether the state court implicit conclusion that a purely subjective conflict of interest can not amount to an actual conflict under sullivan is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,we turn to the analysis in sullivan itself.at one point in the opinion,the court language can be read to define whether a conflict exists by the effect of the conflict on the defendant representation.see sullivan,at.a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.if it is the effect that defines an actual conflict,then a purely subjective conflict should fall within the ambit of sullivan because,as discussed above,its impact on the defendant representation can be similar to the effect of conflicting actual duties.other language in sullivan arguably defines an actual conflict by the conduct of the attorney during representation,see id.at.u ntil a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests,he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance,which also suggests that a subjective conflict is within the scope of sullivan because an attorney who mistakenly believes that she has a conflict of interest will likely act in the same fashion as one who correctly holds that belief.
despite this ambiguous language,however,the court holding in sullivan is not so broad.the court indicated that before it could discuss whether an actual conflict existed,it had to review the third circuit rejection of the pennsylvania supreme court conclusion that no multiple representation occurred.see sullivan,at.noting that a t the outset,we must consider the third circuit conclusion on multiple representation.although multiple representation does not by itself give rise to a conflict of interest,see holloway arkansas,d,the sullivan opinion is structured such that it is not unreasonable to conclude that multiple a similar a required precondition of an actual conflict.the fatal blow to tueros argument,however,flows not from the court search for some form of multiple representation itself,see ante section,but from the contents of the court analysis used to discern whether multiple representation occurred.the court engaged in a examination of the trial court proceedings to conclude that the conduct of the attorneys gave rise to the duties inherent in the representation of a criminal defendant.sullivan,at.
in affirming the third circuit conclusion that multiple representation had occurred,the court relied on the opinion below and summarized it as follows 
the court of appeals carefully recited the facts from which it concluded that dibona and peruto represented both sullivan and his codefendants.the court noted that both lawyers prepared the defense in consultation with all three defendants,that both advised sullivan on whether he should rest his defense,and that both played important roles at all three trials.in fact,the transcript of sullivan trial shows that peruto rather than dibona rested the defense.we agree with the court of appeals that these facts establish the existence of multiple representation.
id.internal citations omitted.the court did not focus on whether the attorneys believed that they owed conflicting duties rather,it queried whether their conduct was the type of conduct that constituted representation of a criminal defendant,a relationship that entails objective legal duties.
the third circuit,in the discussion on which the supreme court relied,also had examined whether the facts created the legal duties inherent in representation.for example,it described the significance of peruto role in sullivan defense as follows 
we believe that an attorney who enters an appearance on behalf of a criminal defendant,consults with him confidentially for the purpose of preparing a defense,investigates his case,aids in the pretrial preparation of his defense,appears at his trial,participates in the selection of the jury that is to decide his fate,argues motions and objections,confers with on trial strategy,offers the defendant legal advice,including advice on whether he should testify or present evidence in his defense,and argues the issue of penalty,a matter of life and death,to the jury on the defendant behalf must be said to represent that defendant and owe to him all the duties an attorney owes to a client in a criminal case.we find that peruto represented sullivan as well as his codefendants.
sullivan,at emphasis added.
petitioner therefore mischaracterizes sullivan insofar as he argues that the court reasoned that multiple repres
