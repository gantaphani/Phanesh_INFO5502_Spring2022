patrick eng,individually and on behalf of his partners in the missouri law firm of eng woods collectively eng woods,filed a declaratory judgment action against cummings,mcclorey,davis acho,plc cmda,a michigan law firm,seeking a judgment that eng woods need not share a portion of the attorney fees awarded to the firm in a personal injury action.cmda to recover of the fee award.the district granted summary judgment in favor of eng woods.we affirm.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to cmda.see dovenmuehler cloud,cir.in november,ernie fazio,a client of cmda attorney james acho,called acho to inform him that fazio,beverly townsend,and her husband,douglas townsend,had been killed in a motor vehicle accident in missouri.the purpose of fazio call was to ensure that cmda would represent two of beverly children,michael richina and khemya mitrahina,in any lawsuit arising from the accident.fazio indicated that he had a close relationship with richina and asked acho to take care of him.
acho spoke with richina the following day,who indicated that he wanted cmda to handle any suit arising from the accident.richina agreed that cmda would either pursue the lawsuit in missouri or refer the case to a missouri law firm,although richina never signed a representation agreement with cmda.acho decided that cmda would not try the case itself and began researching missouri firms to refer the case to,eventually settling on eng woods.acho called patrick eng,a founding partner at eng woods,and the two agreed that eng woods would handle the case.according to acho,eng also agreed that cmda would retain of the fees that eng woods garnered from the case,a fact that eng woods vigorously disputes.acho put eng in touch with richina and,on november,both richina and mitrahina entered into contingent fee contracts with eng woods.in the contracts,eng woods agreed to represent richina and mitrahina in any case arising out of the death of their mother,in exchange for of all sums recovered.neither contract made any mention of any agreement with acho or cmda.
on december,acho sent a letter to eng purporting to memorialize the alleged agreement they had made.it stated 
this letter will serve as a to our phone conversations of the past two weeks.first,please accept my sincere thanks for agreeing to take on this tragic case.anytime individuals lose their lives,a case takes on more significance and it makes us fight just that much harder.your client,mike richina,was referred to me by his uncle,ernie fazio,who has been my client for several years.i in turn contacted you via the recommendation of my father,ronald acho,who holds you in high regard.
as we agreed on the phone,this firm will retain a consulting fee against any recovery eng woods garners on behalf of mike richina,or any other party the firm represents as a result of the action.we understand,of course,that the fee is after your actual costs.i will work with you on the case as liaison,keeping in constant communication with ernie fazio,and when necessary,mike richina.i will also be on call at any time for you or your partner,should you need any assistance.
if you have any questions or concerns,or if this is not an accurate recital of our understanding,please contact me at once.i look forward to working with you,and eventually bringing this to a successful resolution.
appellant add.eng received this letter and discussed it with his partner,matthew woods,but took no action on it.on december,acho also sent a letter to richina,confirming that cmda had referred richina case to eng woods and reiterating the alleged fee agreement acho argues he made with eng woods.see id.at.acho made clear that this fee agreement would not affect the overall amount of richina recovery.
eng woods pursued the wrongful death claim in missouri state court,with woods acting as lead counsel for richina and mitrahina acho received occasional oral updates on the status of the case from eng and relayed this information to fazio and richina.acho also offered to fly in to help with depositions,but eng told acho that he had already done enough as a conduit to receive his fee.the case settled in december for a total of,with going to each richina and mitrahina from those amounts,the court directed richina and mitrahina each to pay in attorney fees to eng woods,for a total fee award of.at the time the settlement distributions were made,richina asked eng if acho would be receiving a portion of the fee,and eng replied that acho would get of the fee paid to eng woods.
in january,after hearing that the case had settled,acho contacted eng about payment of his portion of the attorney fee award,first via telephone and then in a letter dated january.acho argues that eng acknowledged in this telephone call that there had been a fee arrangement,though eng was not sure of the exact amount.the same day that eng received acho january letter,woods sent acho a check in the amount of in consideration for the contact information for purposes of obtaining richina case.this amount represented of the fee from richina,or of eng woods entire fee from the case.following his receipt of this check,acho called eng and the two had a heated argument about the amount of their fee arrangement.during this conversation,eng told acho that he would stop payment on the check unless acho agreed to accept it.acho agreed to accept the check but told eng that he expected another check for the difference owed him under the alleged agreement.eng stopped payment on the check.
eng woods filed a declaratory judgment action against cmda in federal court in may,seeking a declaration that cmda had no right to any portion of the attorney fees recovered by eng woods from richina and mitrahina.cmda for breach of contract,fraud and misrepresentation,unjust enrichment,and bad faith breach of duty.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for eng woods,holding that,even if an agreement existed between eng and acho,the agreement was unenforceable under missouri law because it did not comply with the missouri rules of professional conduct.the court also held that cmda counterclaims failed as a matter of law due to the unenforceability of the alleged fee agreement under missouri law.
cmda appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of eng woods.first,cmda argues that a agreement existed between acho and eng and that this agreement complied with both the letter and the purpose of the missouri rules of professional conduct.second,cmda argues that,even if we find the agreement unenforceable,it should be allowed to pursue its claims of fraud,misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,giving the nonmoving party the most favorable reading of the record as well as the benefit of all reasonable inferences that arise from the record.gentry,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.viking supply cart,cir.disputes that are not genuine,or that are about facts that are not material,will not preclude summary judgment.see anderson liberty lobby.in a diversity action such as this,we apply state substantive law.see gylten swalboski,cir.our task is not to answer the factual question of whether an agreement between eng and acho actually existed.rather,we must determine whether this agreement,if it did exist,complies with the missouri rules of professional conduct,and,if not,whether cmda counterclaims can stand.
attorney fees are not owned,they are earned.neilson mccloskey,quotation and alteration omitted.if two attorneys from different firms wish to share the fees generated from a single case,they may do so only if based on a sharing of services or responsibility.londoff vuylsteke.this principle is embodied in missouri supreme court rule e,also known as missouri rule of professional conduct e,which,at the time this alleged agreement between acho and eng was made,provided 
a division of fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if 
the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or,by written agreement with the client,each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation 
the client is advised of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved and 
the total fee is reasonable.
e the rule permits the lawyers to divide a fee by agreement if all assume responsibility for the representation as a whole and the client is advised and does not object.id.cmt.rule has the force and effect of law in missouri.londoff,at.
the parties do not dispute that the total fee was reasonable,or that,at least as pertains to richina,the client did not object to the participation of both cmda and eng woods.rather,this case turns primarily on whether cmda had a written agreement with richina and mitrahina to assume joint responsibility for their representation,as required by rule e we agree with the district court that,assuming there was a agreement between acho and eng,this agreement did not comply with rule e.first,there is no written agreement between cmda and either richina or mitrahina.cmda has produced no representation agreement with richina or mitrahina,and acho is not certain if richina returned a signed employment agreement or not.appellant add.moreover,it appears that cmda had no direct contact with mitrahina whatsoever,thus any argument that cmda is entitled to a share of the attorney fees from her recovery finds no support in rule e 
recognizing that this lack of a written agreement could be fatal its claim,cmda argues that the december letter acho sent to richina is sufficient to constitute a written agreement for purposes of rule e and that richina actions clearly demonstrate that he knew of and accepted the agreement.the december letter purports to confirm earlier communications between acho and richina regarding a agreement,but we question whether missouri courts would consider it to be a written agreement.as the district court noted,i f the version of rule e in effect in had allowed for agreements where an attorney merely sent his or her client a letter confirming the client agreement to the,the amendment in to specifically allow for this procedure would not have been necessary.eng cummings,mcclorey,davis acho,p,wl,at.june.to be sure,the evidence demonstrates that richina was aware of the arrangement,and while we might agree with cmda that the underlying purpose of rule e to advise the client that each lawyer will assume joint responsibility for the case and ensure the client does not satisfied here,the letter of the rule was not.
cmda argues that tobin jerry,supports its position that the december letter is sufficient to constitute a written agreement.in tobin,an attorney sought to enforce the terms of a contingent fee agreement with his client by way of an attorney lien.id.at.during a hearing on the motion to enforce the lien,neither party was able to produce a signed copy of the agreement.id.nevertheless,the trial court found sufficient indicia of an agreement from all the facts and circumstances,such that the agreement was valid and enforceable under missouri rule of professional conduct c id.quotation omitted.on appeal,the client argued that the lack of a signed copy of the agreement made the agreement unenforceable under rule c.id.at.the missouri court of appeals disagreed,noting that the rule does not require a signature and that,in general,a signature is not required in order to show mutuality or assent to the terms of a writing.id.quotation and alteration omitted.
cmda argues that we should construe rule e the same way the tobin court construed rule c.however,we see a key distinction in tobin,the record was crystal clear that there was a signed agreement,at,and the parties were simply unable to produce a signed copy of that agreement at trial.that is not the case here,as the record clearly shows the lack of any signed agreement between cmda and richina or mitrahina.indeed,this case turns on whether a written agreement exists,whereas tobin was primarily concerned with the terms of a written agreement that was acknowledged by both parties.see id.at.thus,tobin does little to advance cmda argument.
second,even if the december letter qualifies as a written agreement,it does not meet rule e joint responsibility requirement.by its terms,rule e requires that the written agreement itself inform the client that each lawyer will assume joint responsibility for the case,not just that the lawyers will split the fee between them.cmda attempts to sidestep this requirement by pointing to the many phone calls and many contacts with the clients that cmda had during the pendency of this case,arguing that this shows cmda had assumed joint responsibility.appellant br.we disagree.rule e requires that the written agreement itself state that each lawyer is jointly responsible.see londoff,at plaintiff contends the facts show he was jointly responsible.however,the rule requires a written agreement with the client in which each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for representation.the fact that cmda was in touch with one of the clients or could have been liable for malpractice if richina or mitrahina were unhappy with their representation is not enough to show joint representation.see id.at the facts that plaintiff did a few hours of work on the case before he referred it to defendants and that he may thereafter have been liable for malpractice damages or a portion of the costs do not satisfy the rule requirement of a written contract.
to the extent that cmda contact with the clients is relevant to our analysis of joint responsibility,it appears that cmda overstates the amount and extent of contact it actually had with richina and mitrahina and understates eng woods role in the case.cmda has admitted that it had no direct contact whatsoever with mitrahina.and it appears to include acho contact with fazio within its definition of client contact.for example,in its brief,cmda notes that acho received multiple telephone calls from fazio while the litigation was pending requesting information on the status of the lawsuit,appellant br,and that acho had constant contact with richina and fazio throughout the handling of the case,id.at.as fazio was not a party to the wrongful death suit,any contact with him is arguably irrelevant to our analysis here.thus,we are left with acho occasional telephone conversations with one client,richina,as the entirety of cmda client contact.while we can readily agree that keeping a client informed about the status of his case is an important element of the relationship,we see nothing to substantiate cmda claim that acho contact with richina and fazio was imperative to eng garnering a successful outcome in richina case.id.at.nor does the record show that eng woods was brought in only as the trial specialist in a jurisdiction in which acho did not practice.id.indeed,for all his purported contact with richina,acho was not even aware that the case had settled until a month after the fact,and even then only found out through fazio,not richina.see appellant app.
finally,even if cmda actions show the exercise of some level of professional responsibility,they do not amount to joint responsibility as that term is used in rule e.the comments to the rules state that j oint responsibility for the representation entails the obligations stated in rule for purposes of the matter involved.e cmt.rule addresses the responsibilities of partners,managers,and supervisory lawyers within a law firm,and requires them to make reasonable efforts to ensure that other lawyer s conform to the rules of professional conduct.b.nothing that acho did rises to this level.he did not file an appearance in the wrongful death action he did not pay any portion of the court fees he did not take depositions although it appears at one point he offered to and he did not assist eng woods in formulating a trial strategy.indeed,he appears to never have actually met richina,mitrahina,or eng.acho role appears to have been limited to occasional telephone conversations with one of the clients and with that client uncle.to merely refer a case to another lawyer and to do nothing further in the handling of the
