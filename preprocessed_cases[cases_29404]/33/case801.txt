this case raises a significant issue as to the duties attorneys owe to.it arises out of a tragic event.a young girl drowned in a pool at the home of the paternal grandmother while the father and grandmother were present at the house,but the mother was not.the mother retained a lawyer to represent her in a wrongful death action against the grandmother,her husband mother.the father never consulted with his wife lawyer about the case against his own mother.only after the mother recovered a settlement in that lawsuit did the father sue his now estranged spouse for half the recovery and her lawyer for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.he alleged the lawyer owed him a duty either to advise him of his rights in connection with the wrongful death action or to name him as a nominal defendant in that action.the lawyer moved for summary judgment,arguing he owed no duty to the father,who was never his client.the trial court denied the motion,finding triable issues of material fact concerning the lawyer state of mind.
in this writ proceeding,we conclude the lawyer owed no legal duty to the father as a matter of law and the lawyer,therefore,is entitled to summary judgment.accordingly,we direct the trial court to vacate its order denying petitioners summary judgment motion and to issue an order granting the motion.
facts and proceedings below 
based on our review of the record,the following facts are undisputed 
on may,real party in interest brent lindrum took his daughter to his mother house.some of brent other relatives were there,but his wife,estella lindrum,was not.at some point during the day,brent found his daughter at the bottom of his mother pool.an ambulance took the toddler to the hospital.she died two days later after she was removed from a life support system.
on february,estella began to live separate and apart from brent.sometime before then,she contacted petitioner,attorney howard hall,and arranged a meeting to discuss whether she had any legal claims arising from her daughter death.estella met with hall on march,and retained him that day to file a wrongful death action against brent mother.on april,hall filed the action on behalf of estella.hall never consulted with brent about the wrongful death case.
brent was angry with estella for filing the lawsuit against his mother and he asked her to drop it.he believed it was such an evil thing they estella and hall were doing.brent told estella he did not want anything to do with any dirty money she recovered from the lawsuit.brent contacted a lawyer in or around late march or early april to discuss a potential divorce.he told estella if she did not dismiss the case against his mother by his birthday,may,he would file for divorce.on september,brent filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.
in december,the wrongful death case went to mediation.the limit on the homeowner insurance policy held by brent mother was.the case settled for.on january,fireman fund issued a check in that amount,made payable to estela sic lindrum as executrix of the estate of shelby lindrum her atty howard h hall.no party has received any portion of these settlement funds.
after the wrongful death case settled,brent consulted an attorney and decided he wanted a portion of the recovery.in june,he filed this action for damages against hall,the law offices of howard hall collectively,hall and his estella the first amended complaint alleges causes of action against hall for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.it also alleges causes of action against estella for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract brent seeks half of the proceeds from the settlement and other damages in an unspecified amount.
the first amended complaint alleges hall had a duty to advise brent of his rights in connection with the wrongful death action,or to suggest brent consult another attorney about those rights,or to name brent as a nominal defendant in the wrongful death action.brent alleges he would not have been opposed to the lawsuit against his mother and,in fact,would have joined it,if someone had informed him the lawsuit could be pursued without any practical damage to the interests and emotional state of his mother or her ability to retain ownership of her home of more than years.he also alleges he did not understand the underlying action was,as a practical matter,fully covered by the insurance provided by fireman fund.brent asserts he lost his right to seek his own recovery for the wrongful death of his daughter because hall and estella kept him in the dark about his rights.according to brent,estella filed a against hall for legal malpractice,which is pending in the trial court.
hall moved for summary judgment,arguing he did not have a duty to proactively seek out and advise brent,a,of potential legal rights at the hearing on the motion,the trial court agreed hall did not owe brent any duty.the court stated its conclusion hall would have violated rule of the rules of professional conduct if he had represented brent or advised him in any way.based on the circumstances of the child death,the fact brent was present and estella was not,the court perceived a potential conflict of interest between brent and estella.
notwithstanding the above conclusion,the trial court questioned whether hall had a professional duty to join brent in the wrongful death action as a nominal defendant.the court pointed out wrongful death cases are subject to the single action rule,and all known heirs should be joined in one wrongful death action.the court queried i f hall was obligated to so join lindrum as a nominal defendant,what are the legal consequences of his failure to do so,since he owed no duty it is a question of duty what is it 
the trial court denied hall summary judgment motion,finding triable issues of material fact as to what was going on in hall mind.the court determined the jury must decide many factual questions,such as what hall thought about the potential of brent lindrum for exposure to the defense of contributory negligence and whether or not lindrum did or did not blame her husband for the loss of their child 
we issued an order to show cause to review the trial court ruling.
discussion 
it is axiomatic brent lindrum must establish hall owed him a legal duty in order to prevail on his causes of action for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.the determination of duty is a question of law accordingly,if brent can not establish such a duty,hall is entitled to summary judgment.the parties do not dispute this.
relying entirely on this appellate district opinion in meighan shore brent contends hall had a duty to advise both him and his then wife of their options concerning the wrongful death action against brent mother.we agree meighan is an appropriate starting point for our analysis because it provides a useful guideline for defining the scope of an attorney duty to a client spouse.
in meighan,the plaintiff contacted defendant attorney and made an appointment with him to discuss whether she and her husband had any legal claims arising from the treatment her husband had received at a hospital after he was admitted for chest pains both the plaintiff and her husband met with the attorney and discussed the facts of the case with him.the attorney concluded plaintiff husband had a viable medical malpractice claim against the hospital and the attending physician for failing to administer medication that might have limited the extent of damage from the heart attack he suffered the attorney took the case and had plaintiff husband sign a retainer agreement.the attorney told the plaintiff he was not representing her and she understood he was not representing her.the plaintiff had several subsequent conversations with the attorney in which he repeatedly gave her legal advice presumably about the medical malpractice action on behalf of her husband.
about a year after the attorney filed the medical malpractice action,plaintiff husband retained new counsel and learned of the plaintiff entitlement to pursue an action for loss of consortium.by that time,however,any loss of consortium claim against the health care providers was.plaintif
