appellant randall miller miller appeals from an order denying his motion to disqualify attorney john walton and his firm law offices of john walton,collectively walton in three related actions.walton represents respondent chih teh shen shen in the related actions,all of which involve miller and arnon development group,arnon,a corporation owned by miller and shen as shareholders.in his motions to disqualify walton,miller argued that walton should be disqualified because,as shen counsel,he is prosecuting claims on behalf of arnon in one action while simultaneously prosecuting claims against arnon in another matter.the trial court denied miller motion to disqualify walton on the ground that there was no basis to infer an relationship between walton and arnon.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
arnon is a commercial real estate development corporation formed in.miller and shen are the only shareholders of arnon.they are also and directors of the company.
on july,shen filed a complaint against miller,captioned shen miller et.case no.the individual action.shen alleged that miller attempted to force shen to accept an underpriced buyout or face dissolution of the corporation.shen alleged that miller thereafter commenced numerous actions in violation of his fiduciary duties to arnon and to shen,including eliminating shen access to arnon electronic files eliminating shen access to arnon banking accounts attempting to remove shen signatory authority with respect to a major project in which arnon was involved sixteenth street medical center,llc operating the business as if shen were no longer an officer and director locking shen out of the arnon offices and purporting to unilaterally dissolve arnon.shen filed a first and a second amended complaint,the latter is the operative complaint 
on january,miller filed a verified petition for court supervision of voluntary winding up proceeding the winding up proceeding,requesting judicial supervision of the winding up of arnon.the trial court determined that the individual action and the winding up proceeding were related cases within the meaning of former california rules of court,rule 
on august,the trial court granted miller petition for judicial supervision of the winding up of arnon,and ordered both notice to creditors of arnon and presentation of claims.
on or about december,shen filed notice of creditors claims in the winding up proceeding.among shen claims were profits,management fees,receivables,unused vacation and benefits,intangible assets,goodwill,and other things.
on may,walton was substituted as counsel of record for shen in both the individual action and the winding up proceeding.
on january,shen filed a complaint derivatively on behalf of arnon captioned shen sixteenth street medical center,llc et.case no.the derivative action.walton was named as counsel for shen.shen alleged claims for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that arnon is entitled to percent class b membership in sixteenth street medical center,llc and another limited liability company created by arnon.shen sought declarations that arnon is entitled to fees resulting from its interest in these llc.
in the derivative action,shen alleged that he is a percent shareholder of arnon,and that he will fairly represent the interests of arnon in the proceeding.shen further alleged that the board of arnon is currently incapable of making a decision because,pursuant to the bylaws,consent by both directors is required.in addition,shen alleged that miller is incapable of making a disinterested decision regarding the litigation,because he is one of the alleged wrongdoers and is manager of the two defendant llc.
on june,shen filed a notice of related case,indicating that the derivative action is related to the individual action and the winding up proceeding.on july,shen filed a first amended complaint in the derivative action adding miller,miller father,angela yee,and miller companies nautilus group,and nautilus group street llc as defendants in the derivative action.the first amended complaint in the derivative action added a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against miller,sixteenth street medical center,llc,miller father and angela yee.
on august,miller filed a motion for disqualification of walton in the individual action,the winding up proceeding and the derivative action.miller argued that walton should be disqualified because,as shen counsel,he is prosecuting claims on behalf of arnon in the derivative action while simultaneously prosecuting claims against arnon in the winding up proceeding.
on august,shen filed another action for declaratory relief captioned shen arnon development group,et.case no.the declaratory relief action.walton was named as counsel of record for shen.through this action,shen sought a declaration that he is entitled to at least percent of arnon assets,after payment to creditors,subject to equitable allocation by the court.on august,shen filed a notice of related case stating that the declaratory relief action is related to the individual action,the winding up proceeding,and the derivative action.
on august,miller filed an amended notice of motion identifying the declaratory relief action as an additional basis for the disqualification of walton.
on september,shen filed papers opposing the motions to disqualify.shen argued that walton had never been retained by arnon,never provided legal advice to arnon,and had never been paid by arnon.in sum,shen argued that there is no relationship between walton and arnon.
on september,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying miller motion for disqualification of walton.the court concluded that there was no basis to infer an relationship between walton and arnon 
a lthough walton firm did file the complaint in the shareholder derivative action on behalf of shen and essentially arnon,the court finds that the distinction between a client and a real party in interest is important in the analysis of this motion.again,taking judicial notice of the complaint in the shareholder derivative action,as well as the materials in the file in this case it is apparent that arnon had no part in the filing of the shareholder derivative action,and would likely not join forces with shen,due to the disputes between shen and the other shareholders,officers,and directors of arnon.ultimately,there is no basis for this court to infer that an relationship ever arose between walton firm and arnon such that the firm is concurrently representing two clients with adverse interests.
the court also noted 
b ecause shen is at odds with miller,it is likely that arnon will either decide not to pursue the shareholder derivative action,or will obtain its own counsel in these four cases.thus,it is unlikely that an relationship between arnon and the walton firm will ever arise.
after argument on the motions,the trial court stated that the tentative ruling would stand as the order of the court.
on october,miller filed notices of appeal from the order denying the motions for disqualification filed in the individual action,the winding up proceeding,and the derivative action.the matters were consolidated for the purposes of this appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,speedee oil.
ii.legal principles related to disqualification motions 
a motion to disqualify a party counsel may implicate several important interests.speedee oil,supra,cal th at.thus,judges must examine these motions carefully to ensure that literalism does not deny the parties substantial justice.ibid.specifically,depending on the circumstances,a disqualification motion may involve such considerations as a client right to chosen counsel,an attorney interest in representing a client,the financial burden on a client to replace disqualified counsel,and the possibility that tactical abuse underlies the disqualification motion.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.however,determining whether a conflict of interest requires disqualification involves more than just the interests of the parties.ibid.the paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.ibid.
a trial court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.citations.speedee oil,supra,cal th at.
california courts have developed distinct tests for representations involving conflicting interests on the part of an attorney.flatt superior court cal th,flatt.where an attorney potentially conflicting representations are simultaneous,t he primary value at stake is the attorney duty and the client legitimate expectation of loyalty.id.at.in such cases,the rule of disqualification is a per se or automatic one.ibid.
in the matter before us,the trial court determined,based on undisputed evidence,that an relationship never arose between walton and arnon,thus no conflicting representation exists.generally,t he question of whether an relationship exists is one of law.citations.citation.blue water sunset,llc markowitz th,blue water.
iii.walton does not represent arnon in the derivative action 
miller argument that shen lawyers should be disqualified is based on miller position that walton client in the derivative action is arnon.because walton represents arnon in the derivative action,miller argues,his position adverse to arnon in the related litigation should result in automatic disqualification.flatt,supra,cal th at.
disqualification is not proper unless an relationship exists between walton and arnon.see koo rubio restaurants,th,koo before an attorney may be disqualified from representing a party in litigation because his representation of that party is adverse to the interest of a current or former client,it must first be established that the party seeking the attorney disqualification was or is represented by the attorney in a manner giving rise to an relationship.citations.the burden is on the party seeking disqualification to establish the relationship.citation.id.at.generally,the formation of an relationship is a question of fact.flatt,supra,cal th at.intent and conduct are critical to the formation of an relationship.citation.canton poultry deli,stockwell,harris,widom woolverton th.an relationship can only be created by contract,express or implied.koo,supra,at.a formal retainer and fee agreement is not necessary.when a party seeking legal advice consults an attorney at law and secures that advice,the relation of attorney and client is established prima facie.citation.speedee oil,supra,cal th at.miller presents no facts suggesting the existence of an express or implied agreement between arnon and walton for the provision of legal advice.
while miller implicitly acknowledges that walton has no formal relationship with arnon,miller claims that in prosecuting the derivative action,walton represents the interests of the corporation.in support of this argument,miller points to corporations code section,which specifies that a derivative action is brought in right of a corporation.miller further cites case law explaining that a derivative claim is a property right that belongs to the corporation.citations.cotton expo power systems,th.if successful,a derivative claim will accrue to the direct benefit of the corporation and not to the stockholder who litigated it.citations.citation.ibid.because the derivative action is a representative action brought on behalf of the corporation,the shareholder acts in a fiduciary capacity substantially as guardian ad litem for the corporation.hogan ingold cal d.
while the basic principles of law cited by miller are correct,miller fails to cite a case in which it has been held that the attorney for a shareholder prosecuting a derivative action on behalf of a corporation enters an relationship with the corporation simply by filing the derivative action.
in addressing this issue,it is helpful to review the basic nature of a shareholder derivative action.
in order for a shareholder to have standing to bring a derivative action,the shareholder plaintiff must allege that it is a record or beneficial shareholder of the corporation that it presented the basis of the litigation to the corporation board and that it tried to secure from the board such action as the plaintiff desires,subds.b.demand on the board is excused only when the plaintiff sufficiently alleges that the demand would have been futile,subd.b.thus,a shareholder may only bring a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation if the corporation has refused to pursue the claim.in bringing the derivative action,the shareholder attorney is acting against the corporation wishes.
nevertheless,should the shareholder prevail in the derivative action,the corporation is the ultimate beneficiary.patrick alacer th,patrick.therefore,the corporation must be joined in the action.normally,the corporation is joined as a nominal defendant because of its refusal to join the action as a plaintiff.citation.id.at.in other words,in a shareholder derivative suit,t he corporation has traditionally been aligned as a defendant because it is in conflict with its stockholder about the advisability of bringing suit citation.ibid.however,i n a real sense,the only claim a shareholder plaintiff asserts against the nominal defendant corporation in a derivative action is the claim the corporation has failed to pursue the litigation.ibid.
in essence,the corporation that is the subject of the derivative claim is generally a nominal party only.because the claims asserted and the relief sought in the derivative complaint would,if proven,advance rather than threaten the interests of the nominal defendant,the nominal defendant must remain neutral in the action.citation.patrick,supra,th at.
in this matter,arnon is named in the derivative action both as a derivative plaintiff,and as a nominal defendant.however,walton is listed as attorney for respondent shen only.if walton represented arnon,there would be no need for a derivative action,as the corporation itself would be pursuing shen claims.
miller has presented no facts suggesting the formation of an relationship between walton and arnon.arnon has not sought or obtained legal advice from walton at any time.nor has miller presented any authority for the proposition that walton filing of the derivative action as shen attorney is sufficient to create an relationship between walton and arnon.because miller has failed to meet his burden of proving that an relationship exists between walton and arnon,miller motion for disqualification of walton was properly denied.
iv.the cases cited by miller are distinguishable 
miller draws our attention to numerous cases which,he claims,support his position that walton should be disqualified from representing shen in the related cases.as set forth below,all are distinguishable.
the first case miller relies upon is blue water,supra,th.blue water,a percent shareholder of three limited liability companies llc,filed a derivative action on behalf of the llc against the other shareholder,markowitz,and a limited liability company owned exclusively by markowitz four star.markowitz filed a and sued derivatively and individually against blue water and the llc.kurtz represented markowitz and four star,and sandler represented the llc.id.at pp.
kurtz prepared demurrers on behalf of markowitz,a codefendant,four star,and the llc.at the hearing on the demurrers,kurtz appeared on behalf of markowitz and four star,and made a special appearance on behalf of the llc because sandler was not in attendance.blue water,supra,th at.
under these factual circumstances,this court determined that kurtz was subject to automatic disqualification.specifically,kurtz preparation of the demurrer and special appearances on behalf of the limited liability companies at the demurrer hearing created an relationship and he owed them a fiduciary duty,including a duty of utmost loyalty.blue water,supra,th at pp.we would reach the same conclusion even if he only made an appearance.id.at.
four star and markowitz had interests adverse to the llc.thus,kurtz knowingly agreed to represent conflicting interests at the demurrer hearing.therefore,we concluded,he could not avoid the rule of automatic disqualification.blue water,supra,th at.
blue water is factually distinguishable from the matter presently before us.here,there is no indication that walton ever made an appearance on behalf of arnon or filed a demurrer or any other motion on behalf of arnon.furthermore,it should be noted that in blue water,neither of the attorneys representing the two percent shareholders was held to have an relationship with the llc merely because they filed derivative actions involving the llc.
gong rfg oil,th gong is also distinguishable.there,rfg was owned by jeffrey gong holding percent of the corporate stock and david gong holding percent of the corporate stock.when the brothers had a falling out,rfg terminated jeffrey and forced him to resign.id.at.jeffrey sued david and rfg for involuntary dissolution,declaratory relief,breach of fiduciary duty,and wrongful discharge.ibid.jeffrey challenged david counsel ability to represent both david and rfg,and filed a disqualification motion when new counsel substituted in to represent both david and rfg.id.at.the court of appeal determined that jeffrey position was correct,since david and rfg are not percent aligned on all issues in the litigation.id.at.gong is distinguishable because the law firm representing david and rfg did not deny that it was the firm intention to represent both parties.the law firm specifically substituted in as counsel for both parties,and never denied that it had an relationship with both the majority shareholder and the corporation itself.id.at.here,in contrast,walton is not attorney of record for arnon.in fact,walton expressly disavows any relationship with arnon,and miller has failed to set forth facts suggesting that such a relationship exists.
miller also cites forrest baeza th forrest.in forrest,the attorney who was the subject of the disqualification motion was simultaneously representing the forrests and the corporations they were accused of embezzling from and subjecting to penalties for tax fraud.id.at.the forrest court acknowledged that case law forbids dual representation of a corporation and directors in a shareholder derivative suit,at least where,as here,the directors are alleged to have committed fraud.citations.ibid.here,in contrast,walton does not simultaneously represent the corporation and a director.as set forth above,he has no relationship with the corporation at all.
finally,miller cites jacuzzi jacuzzi,d jacuzzi.in jacuzzi,the defendants,including the corporation,argued that an attorney gray could not represent the minority shareholders in this action by the minority shareholders against the corporation.gray had represented the corporation for years and had served as chairman of the corporation board of directors.however,gray averred that he had not obtained any confidential information during that time relating to the subject matter of the present action.id.at pp.the trial court found that no conflict existed,and the court of appeal affirmed.the court explained that the minority shareholders were acting as guardians ad litem for the corporation,and were bringing the suit for the benefit of the corporation.the court concluded,s ince gray here acts for the benefit of the corporation he previously represented it is apparent he is not representing an interest adverse to the corporation.id.at.
jacuzzi is inapposite.walton has not represented arnon in the past,nor does he currently represent the corporation.thus there is no question as to whether he will be called upon to breach a confidence entrusted to him by the corporation.he has never been in an relationship with arnon,thus he has not been in a position to receive such client confidences.
miller makes much of the language in several cases,including jacuzzi,indicating that shareholders bringing a derivative action act as guardians ad litem for the corporation.see jacuzzi,supra,d at see also hogan ingold,supra,cal d at whitten dabney cal,describing shareholder position in a derivative action as that of a trustee pure and simple,seeking in the name of another a recovery for wrongs that have been committed against that other.miller argues that the guardian ad litem can not even be considered a party to the cause.citations.whitten,supra,at.
miller contends that,because a shareholder acts as a guardian ad litem for the corporation,the exercise of identifying the attorney client in a derivative action is no different from other engagements in which an organization acts through an authorized representative.according to miller,shen role as guardian ad litem for the corporation automatically renders his attorney,walton,counsel for the corporation.
it is shen,not walton,who has stepped into the role of guardian ad litem for arnon miller has provided no case law indicating that a lawyer for a guardian ad litem automatically has an relationship with the guardian ad litem ward.
miller cites williams superior court th,williams,for the proposition that the role of a guardian ad litem is to oversee the attorney work to ensure the child legal interests are protected.williams involved a father objection to the court appointment of his children maternal grandmother as guardian ad litem in wrongful death litigation involving the death of the children mother.the father contended that as the children sole custodial parent,he had the right to decide what person is best qualified to represent his minor children.id.at.in disagreeing with father,the court discussed the limited role of the guardian ad litem,who is appointed merely to aid and to enable the court to perform its duty of protection.citations.id.at.in so doing,the court specified,a guardian ad litem does not replace the parental function,but merely oversees the attorney work to ensure the child legal interests are protected.id.at.it is clear from the context of this statement that the attorney the guardian ad litem is charged with overseeing is the independent attorney for the child,not an attorney representing the guardian himself walton has no relationship with arnon,therefore shen can not be charged with overseeing any such relationship.
similarly,in county of los angeles superior court th,two minors had been appointed independent counsel ic to investigate claims of abuse.the ic never filed any claim or complaint on the minors behalf.id.at pp.when the ic was replaced,the minors claims were untimely filed.the minors argued that their time within which to present a claim was tolled due to the juvenile court error in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent their interests.the court of appeal agreed,holding the juvenile court should have appointed a guardian ad litem to oversee the work being done by the ic,and it should have done so shortly before or after the ic was appointed.id.at,fn.omitted.the case does not suggest that under the circumstances of this case,walton has unwittingly stepped into an relationship with the corporation.
in sum,the language in certain cases suggesting that shen is acting as a guardian ad litem for arnon in the derivative action does not convince us that walton relationship with shen automatically creates an relationship between walton and arnon.
v.the foreign authority cited by miller
