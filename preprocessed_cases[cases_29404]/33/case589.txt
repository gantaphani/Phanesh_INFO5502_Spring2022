in wiley county of san diego cal th,d,we held that in a legal malpractice action against an attorney for alleged negligence in representing the plaintiff the accused in a criminal action,the plaintiff must establish,as a necessary element of the malpractice cause of action,that he or she is actually innocent of the offense charged in the underlying criminal proceeding.our holding in wiley applies to legal malpractice claims asserted against both private attorneys and public defenders,and in that case we were not confronted with the issue whether a public defender is entitled to statutory immunity for his or her acts or omissions in representing a criminal defendant.we granted review in the present case to decide whether the immunity for discretionary acts set forth in government code section applies to a deputy public defender representation of a defendant in a criminal action 
defendant julie leeds is a deputy public defender who represented plaintiff glenn russell barner in a criminal action that resulted in barner conviction.after the conviction was set aside and barner obtained a judicial determination of factual innocence,he filed this legal malpractice action alleging that his conviction and incarceration resulted from leeds negligence in representing him.the trial court concluded that leeds is immune from liability pursuant to section,because her alleged negligence consisted of discretionary acts or omissions.the court of appeal reversed.
as we shall explain,the acts or omissions of a deputy public defender in representing a defendant in a criminal action do not involve the type of basic policy decisions that are insulated from liability pursuant to section.instead,legal representation provided by a deputy public defender entails operational as opposed to policy decisions that are incident to the normal functions of the office of the public defender.once the decision is made to provide legal services,a deputy public defender actions implementing that decision do not qualify for the immunity afforded by section.although the court of appeal utilized a faulty analysis,it correctly concluded that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment for leeds.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
on june,two brandishing a a bank of america facility in el segundo.a confidential informant subsequently contacted an el segundo police officer and identified one of the robbers appearing in a bank surveillance photograph as an individual named rusty,who resided on south crenshaw boulevard.a deputy sheriff matched the surveillance photograph with a previous booking photograph of plaintiff glenn russell barner,whose last known address was on south crenshaw.after viewing a photographic lineup including barner booking photograph,one bank employee identified barner as the individual wielding the handgun during the robbery.another employee also identified barner as one of the robbers.
barner was arrested based upon this information.the court appointed the public defender office for the county of los angeles to represent barner.at barner preliminary hearing,one bank employee identified barner as the robber who held a handgun and who wore clothing lighter in color than that worn by his accomplice.a police officer testified that another individual present at the bank on the day of the robbery had identified barner from a photographic lineup as the robber who held a gun.barner was held to answer and arraigned.
the case initially was assigned for purposes of trial to deputy public defender debra cole,but responsibility for barner defense was transferred to defendant julie leeds sometime in late october or early november.when leeds received barner case file,it contained an august,memorandum prepared by the federal bureau of investigation fbi.this memorandum stated that a confidential source had reviewed the bank surveillance photographs and recognized the bank robber who wore clothing as raymond bell.
according to leeds,she reviewed the fbi memorandum but concluded that it contained no information suggesting that the identification of raymond bell,as the bank robber who wore clothing,was by a second confidential,by an informant other than the individual who had contacted the el segundo police officer.leeds assumed that the fbi memorandum referred to the same informant who had identified rusty barner as the man with a gun,and that this informant had identified raymond bell as barner unarmed accomplice.she further believed that her colleague cole had considered but rejected the possibility of filing a motion for disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant.leeds,however,did not verify her assumptions by discussing the memorandum or its contents with cole,the prosecutor,the fbi agent who prepared the memorandum,or other law enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the crime.based upon her assessment of the memorandum significance,and because there was inadequate time before trial to prepare and file a motion regarding the confidential informant,leeds did not attempt to file such a motion.
a jury trial commenced on november.throughout the proceedings,barner maintained that he was innocent,but he was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of years.approximately one month later,the prosecutor advised leeds that the confidential informant mentioned in the fbi memorandum was a second informant who had identified raymond bell as the suspect who had brandished a weapon.an fbi agent had indicated to the prosecutor his belief that raymond the robber wielding a gun.
leeds conveyed this information to barner appellate counsel,and barner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court.the prosecutor,cole,and leeds advised the court of the contents of the fbi memorandum,and the people conceded the merits of the petition.in june,the court set aside the judgment and vacated the sentence,and remanded barner into custody pending a new trial.barner,represented by privately retained counsel,then moved for disclosure of the identity of the fbi informant.after hearing testimony from federal agents who invoked a privilege not to disclose the informant identity,the court denied the motion.the superior court subsequently granted barner motion for dismissal on the ground that nondisclosure of the informant identity might deprive barner of a fair trial.see,subd.d.
on the same day that the criminal action against barner was dismissed,raymond bell was arrested for committing several bank robberies.pursuant to a plea agreement,bell pleaded guilty to three counts of bank robbery and admitted committing four others,including the bank of america robbery for which barner had been convicted.in light of this development,in december the superior court granted barner petition for a finding that barner was factually innocent of the bank of america robbery.see.
barner then filed this action alleging several claims against a number of defendants,including a cause of action for legal malpractice against the deputy public defenders who represented him in the criminal prosecution.the complaint alleges that these deputy public defenders,including leeds,negligently failed to investigate the information they had received before trial regarding the fbi confidential informant,file a motion for disclosure of the identities of the confidential informants,and introduce exculpatory evidence that would have been revealed by such an investigation.absent the negligence of these attorneys,barner alleges,he would not have been convicted of bank robbery and incarcerated for more than one year for a crime that he did not commit.
leeds moved for summary judgment,contending among other things that the immunity set forth in section for a public employee discretionary acts shielded her from liability.the trial court granted the motion after concluding that the acts of leeds were and that discretionary act immunity applied.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment in favor of leeds.the court determined that the acts of privately retained counsel and publicly appointed counsel should be measured by the same standard.according to the appellate court,because the legislature has not clearly provided for discretionary act immunity for deputy public defenders,they remain subject to liability for legal malpractice until the legislature chooses to extend such immunity.the court opinion expressly declined to reach leeds contention that her decision not to file a motion seeking disclosure of the fbi informant identity was a discretionary act immunized under section.nevertheless,the court of appeal stated given the unambiguous nature of the august,fbi report,which leeds had the ministerial duty to read and comprehend,we could conclude that harm resulted from her ministerial failure to do so.italics added.
we granted review to consider the validity of the court of appeal conclusion.
under the california tort claims act et,public employees are liable for their torts unless a statute provides otherwise,subd.a.one exception to this general rule of liability is found in section,which codifies the common law immunity for the discretionary acts of a government official performed within the scope of his or her authority.caldwell montoya cal th,d,caldwell.section states except as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,whether or not such discretion be abused.leeds contends,and the trial court concluded as a matter of law,that leeds is immune pursuant to section because her allegedly negligent acts or omissions in representing barner resulted from her exercise of discretion within the meaning of this statute.
in reviewing the trial court ruling granting summary judgment for leeds,we exercise our independent judgment and decide whether leeds established undisputed facts that negate barner claim or state a complete defense.romano rockwell,cal th,d.we also conduct de novo review of the trial court resolution of the underlying issues of statutory construction.regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.
for the purpose of determining whether the immunity in section provides a complete defense to barner legal malpractice claim,the following relevant facts are undisputed.leeds is a deputy public defender who was assigned to represent barner in a criminal action.she did not file a motion for disclosure of the identities of confidential informants mentioned in the case file or conduct an independent investigation regarding the informants or the information they revealed.barner conviction subsequently was set aside,and he obtained a judicial declaration of factual innocence,based in part upon the information imparted by these informants.barner claims that these omissions by leeds were negligent and that,absent such negligence,he would not have been convicted and incarcerated.
the parties further do not dispute the following points.leeds,as a deputy public defender,is a public employee within the meaning of the california tort claims act,and she acts within the scope of her employment when representing assigned clients charged with criminal offenses.briggs lawrence d.deputy public defenders and privately retained counsel owe the same duty of care to their clients.see polk county dodson,d wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th,d.therefore,leeds is liable for injury caused by her professional negligence to the same extent as a private attorney,e xcept as otherwise provided by statute including section,subd.a,italics added.
despite the legislature express reference to section as an exception to the general rule that a public employee is liable for his or her torts,the court of appeal did not decide whether leeds allegedly negligent acts or omissions in representing barner were the result of her exercise of discretion within the meaning of section.instead,the court emphasized that the acts of privately retained and publicly appointed counsel should be measured by the same standard,and that because the legislature has not clearly provided for discretionary immunity for deputy public defenders,the general rule of liability controls.for this proposition,the court of appeal relied upon ramos county of madera cal d,which states that immunity is the exception to the general rule that a public employee is liable for his or her negligence,and that u nless the legislature has clearly provided for immunity,the important societal goal of compensating injured parties for damages caused by willful or negligent acts must prevail.
we agree with leeds that the court of appeal erred in concluding that leeds lacks immunity pursuant to section solely because the legislature has not clearly or specifically declared that deputy public defenders are immune from liability for professional negligence.in enacting section,the legislature clearly has provided for immunity for injuries caused by acts or omissions that are the result of a public employee exercise of discretion,as that term is used in section.in determining whether discretionary act immunity applies with regard to the acts of a public employee,courts must consider whether the acts or omissions of the particular employee resulted from the exercise of discretion within the meaning of section.the approach taken by the court of there is no immunity pursuant to section unless the legislature otherwise has provided specifically that a particular class of employees is would eliminate immunity for discretionary acts and render the entire text of section surplusage.
because our task in reviewing the order granting summary judgment is to conduct an independent review of the trial court resolution of questions of law green ralee engineering cal th,d,we shall proceed to consider whether the trial court correctly determined that leeds alleged professional negligence resulted from her exercise of discretion within the meaning of section.
as explained in caldwell,supra,cal th at page,d,not all acts requiring a public employee to choose among alternatives entail the use of discretion within the meaning of section.under that statute,i mmunity is reserved for those basic policy decisions which have been expressly committed to coordinate branches of government,and as to which judicial interference would thus be unseemly.citation.such areas of are sufficiently sensitive citation to call for judicial abstention from interference that might even in the first instance affect the coordinate body process citation.caldwell,supra,cal th at,d,original italics bracketed text added by caldwell.on the other hand,there is no basis for immunizing lower level decisions that merely implement a basic policy already formulated.ibid.the scope of the discretionary act immunity should be no greater than is required to give legislative and executive policymakers sufficient breathing space in which to perform their vital policymaking functions.tarasoff regents of university of california cal d,tarasoff.
in determining whether an act of a public employee is discretionary under section,we have distinguished between the employee operational and policy decisions.caldwell,supra,cal th at,d,citing cases.for example,in sanborn chronicle pub.cal d,we concluded that,although a decision by the clerk of a city and county to discuss a particular matter with the press may have been within the clerk discretion as that term is used in common parlance,it was not in the nature of a basic policy decision made at the planning stage of city operations but rather fell within the category of routine duties incident to the normal operations of the office of the clerk.in contrast,in caldwell,supra,cal th at page,d,we held that the decision by individual members of a school board whether to vote to renew a superintendent employment contract was a peculiarly sensitive and subjective one,with fundamental policy implications judicial abstention with respect to the individual participants is thus appropriate.where such an important policy issue is at stake,it would be unwise and unseemly to hold individual board members personally accountable at law for things they said or considered in the course of deliberations.
our previous decisions construing section have not determined whether a public employee charged with a professional duty of care in rendering services to the employee as a publicly employed attorney or health care policy,as opposed to operational,judgments in discharging his or her duties to the client.we considered a related issue,however,in tarasoff,supra,cal d,which held that psychologists employed by the government are not immune from liability under section for the failure to warn a third person of a risk of harm posed by a patient.we reasoned that the employee decision whether to disclose such a risk of danger may require the exercise of considerable judgmental skills,but that the failure to warn does not rise to the level of a basic policy decision for which the statute provides immunity.tarasoff,supra,cal d at.our decision stated we emphasize that our conclusion does not raise the specter of therapists employed by the government indiscriminately being held liable for damage despite their exercise of sound professional judgment.we require of publicly employed therapists only that quantum of care which the common law requires of private therapists.the imposition of liability in those rare cases in which a public employee falls short of this standard does not contravene the language or purpose of government code section.tarasoff,supra,cal d at.
our decisions also have stated that a public employee initial decision whether to provide professional services to an individual might involve the exercise of discretion pursuant to section,but that once the employee undertakes to render such services,he or she is not immune for the negligent performance of professional duties that do not amount to policy or planning decisions.in johnson,supra,cal d,we discussed with approval the court of appeal decision in sava fuller d,which considered whether a botanist employed by the state was immune in an action for negligence alleging that he had erred in analyzing the toxicity of a substance ingested by the plaintiff.the court of appeal concluded that the botanist had exercised discretion by agreeing to analyze the substance,but that once he had decided to do so,the law required the botanist to exercise due care in performing that service.o nce the determination has been made that a service will be furnished and the service is undertaken,then public policy demands except when the legislature specifically decrees otherwise that government be held to the same standard of care the law requires of its private citizens in the performance of duties imposed by law or assumed.id.at.our decision in johnson explains that sava and other cases establish the principle that,although a basic policy decision may be discretionary and thus warrant governmental immunity,subsequent operational actions in the implementation of that basic decision still must face adjudication on the question of negligence.johnson,supra,cal d at,see also mccorkle city of los angeles cal d.
as they relate to publicly employed health professionals,the foregoing principles are reflected in a particular provision of the california tort claims act.section,which was enacted at the same time as section,provides immunity for a public employee failure to make an adequate physical or mental examination for the purpose of determining whether an individual has a condition that would endanger the individual or others.the statute specifies,however,that this immunity does not extend to an examination or diagnosis performed for the purpose of treating the individual although we are not confronted with any issue arising under section in the present case,we believe that this statute affords some guidance in ascertaining the scope of the immunity provided for discretionary acts.section implicitly suggests that the provision of professional health services,including the making of decisions regarding what constitutes an adequate examination for a particular purpose,does not constitute an act resulting from the exercise of discretion within the meaning of section otherwise,the additional immunity set forth in section would have been unnecessary.furthermore,the exception in section for examinations conducted for the purpose of treatment indicates a legislative intent not to eliminate the preexisting liability to patients seeking diagnosis and treatment by publicly employed health professionals.see caldwell,supra,cal th at,d,the immunity for discretionary acts provided in restated preexisting california law muskopf corning hospital dist.cal d,no common law discretionary act immunity for negligent treatment of a patient in a public hospital bohrer county of san diego d.no immunity under for negligence in prescribing medication to a patient of a county clinic.the law revision commission comments regarding section support this view the immunity does not apply to examinations for the purpose of treatment such as are made in doctors offices and public hospitals.in those situations,the ordinary rules of liability would apply.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ed.foll,see creason department of health services cal th,d.
although publicly employed health professionals and deputy public defenders obviously perform different services for distinct purposes,a deputy public defender,like a health professional,must exercise considerable judgment in making decisions regarding the type and extent of services necessary to discharge his or her duty of care to clients.in addition,the actual performance of such services ordinarily requires a high level of skill and often involves many choices among complex alternatives.as the foregoing decisions instruct,however,even if the initial determination whether to provide representation to a certain class of individuals or to represent a particular defendant is a sensitive policy decision that requires judicial abstention to avoid affecting a coordinate governmental entity decisionmaking or planning process see in re brindle d,and even though a deputy public defender actual representation of a client requires the exercise of considerable skill and judgment,such representation generally does not involve discretionary acts within the meaning of section,policy or planning decisions.instead,such services consist of operational duties that merely implement the initial decision to provide representation and are incident to the normal functions of the office of the public defender.
leeds concedes that certain actions undertaken by a public defender in representing a client are not discretionary acts within the meaning of section.for example,she states that the actual preparation and filing of a motion for disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant would be a ministerial act,and that a deputy public defender could be liable for negligently missing the filing deadline or omitting certain information from the motion.but,according to leeds,the initial decision whether to file such a motion is inherently discretionary and should not be subject to later judicial scrutiny in a civil action.
we disagree.leeds does not explain why the decision whether to file a motion is a discretionary act within the meaning of section while the decision regarding what information should be included in the motion is not.both decisions require the exercise of professional judgment in light of an evaluation of all the circumstances of the case,and both may cause injury to the client if made without the exercise of due care.neither act,however,properly may be characterized as a sensitive decision implicating fundamental policy concerns warranting judicial abstention.indeed,leeds admits that barner allegation that she engaged in negligent acts and omissions concerns the routine,fundamental tasks of providing a criminal defense.c ourts encounter this type of allegation daily and are well suited to resolve its validity under traditional tort doctrine.johnson,supra,cal d at.
