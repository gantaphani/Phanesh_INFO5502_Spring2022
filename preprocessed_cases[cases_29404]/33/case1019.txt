we have for review moakley smallwood,so d dca,a decision of the third district court of appeal,which expressly and directly conflicts with the decision of the second district court of appeal in israel lee,so d dca,and the first district court of appeal in miller colonial baking,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the conflict issue presented in this case is whether a trial court possesses the inherent authority to assess attorneys fees as a sanction against an attorney for the attorney bad faith conduct during the course of litigation.
background 
this case arises out of proceedings and the imposition of attorneys fees against petitioner barbara moakley,the former wife,and her trial attorney.the third district explained the factual background of this case as follows 
according to the findings of the trial court in proceedings,the former wife moakley subpoenaed the former husband and two of his former attorneys,seeking to compel production of an original note which had been awarded to the former wife in the final judgment.on its face,the motion to compel production conceded that one of the former attorneys,appellee sheri smallwood,did not have the note and she so testified.because of short notice,smallwood was unable to be relieved of the obligation to attend the hearing,fifty miles from her office.the trial court granted monetary sanctions against the former wife and her counsel.the court concluded that there was no reasonable explanation for issuance of the subpoena to smallwood.
moakley,so d at footnote omitted.the trial court imposed attorneys fees in the amount of against moakley and her counsel,margaret broz,as compensation for the time smallwood expended in responding to the subpoena.see id.at.on appeal,the third district affirmed the imposition of monetary sanctions against both moakley and her attorney,concluding that the trial court possessed the inherent authority to do so.see id.
the issue before us in this case is whether the trial court possessed the inherent authority to impose attorneys fees against moakley attorney absent a specific rule or statute authorizing the imposition of such fees this court has explained that g enerally,a court may only award attorney fees when such fees are expressly provided for by statute,rule,or contract.bane bane,so d.however,since,this court has recognized the inherent authority of trial courts to assess attorneys fees for the misconduct of an attorney in the course of litigation.see united states sav.bank pittman,so.in pittman,this court approved an award of fees against an attorney,where the trial court found that the attorney had unnecessarily conducted foreclosure proceedings on a mortgage for the sole purpose of increasing his fee and that the attorney was acting in his own and against the wishes of his client.id.
as we have subsequently stated,clearly,a trial judge has the inherent power to do those things necessary to enforce its orders,to conduct its business in a proper manner,and to protect the court from acts obstructing the administration of justice.levin,middlebrooks,mabie,thomas,mayes mitchell,united states fire ins,so d.most recently,the court in bitterman bitterman,so d,recognized the inherent authority of a trial court to award attorneys fees for bad faith conduct against a party,even though no statute authorized the award 
the inequitable conduct doctrine permits the award of attorney fees where one party has exhibited egregious conduct or acted in bad faith.attorney fees based on a party inequitable conduct have been recognized by other courts in this country.see vaughan atkinson,d awarding attorney fees based on respondent recalcitrance and callous attitude rolax atlantic coast line,cir holding that attorney fees were justified because plaintiffs of small means have been subjected to discriminatory and oppressive conduct by a powerful labor organization.we note that this doctrine is rarely applicable.it is reserved for those extreme cases where a party acts in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.foster tourtellotte,cir quoting rich united states ex rel.industrial lumber,d.bad faith may be found not only in the actions that led to the lawsuit,but also in the conduct of the litigation.dogherra safeway stores,cir quoting hall cole,d.this court and other courts in this state have recognized that attorney fees can be awarded in situations where one party has acted vexatiously or in bad faith.see florida patient compensation fund rowe,so d,this state has recognized a limited exception to this general american rule in situations involving inequitable conduct.hilton oil transport oil transport,so d,dca in re estate of duval,so d,dca.
nothing in the court reasoning in bitterman,in which we acknowledged the trial court inherent authority to award attorneys fees under extremely narrow circumstances,limits the application of this authority to a party rather than the party attorney.indeed,the attorney is not only a representative of the client,but also an officer of the court.see preamble to rules of professional conduct,regulating.bar a lawyer is a representative of clients,an officer of the legal system,and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.
moreover,appellate decisions that have addressed this issue have recognized that trial courts must sparingly and cautiously exercise this inherent authority to award attorneys fees against an attorney.for example,in patsy patsy,so d dca,another dissolution proceeding,the fourth district affirmed an award of attorneys fees and costs against an attorney for the bad faith filing of a motion to disqualify counsel.the fourth district recited the facts as follows 
in a modification proceeding in which he represented the former husband,meisler filed a motion to disqualify opposing counsel on the ground that he had perpetrated a fraud on the court on two prior occasions.at meisler request,based on the motion,the court stayed further proceedings until after it conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion to disqualify.after hearing the evidence the trial court found that the motion had no factual basis,was filed solely to delay the proceedings,and was a sham.the court assessed attorney fees of and costs.
id.at emphasis supplied.after reviewing the applicable case law,the fourth district concluded that trial courts possess the inherent authority to assess attorneys fees for litigating in bad faith.see id.at see also david nunes,ferguson,so d,dca citing patsy for the proposition that the trial court had inherent authority to assess attorneys fees against counsel who did not attend a mediation and advised his clients that they also did not have to attend.
similarly,in lathe florida select citrus,so d,dca,the fifth district upheld the imposition of attorneys fees against an attorney who lied to the trial court after he failed to appear for a deposition.the fifth district observed that the attorney did not deny that he lied to the court,but argued that the trial court could not impose attorneys fees without first finding him in contempt.see id.relying on this court decision in pittman,the fifth district rejected this argument and held that a trial court has inherent authority to order an attorney,who is an officer of the court,to pay opposing counsel reasonable attorney fees incurred as a result of his or her actions taken in bad faith.lathe,so d at.the fifth district explained that in the case before it,the attorney had notice and an opportunity to object to the sanctions and to provide mitigating evidence before awarding fees for the attorney bad faith conduct.see id.
indeed,many jurisdictions recognize this limited inherent authority to impose attorneys fees against an attorney for bad faith conduct in the course of litigation.see,eberly eberly,holding that trial court had inherent authority to assess attorneys fees against attorney who unreasonably and vexatiously prolonged the proceedings below and increased the cost of representation to both parties charles charles,holding that trial court has inherent authority to impose attorneys fees against attorney who repeatedly failed to
