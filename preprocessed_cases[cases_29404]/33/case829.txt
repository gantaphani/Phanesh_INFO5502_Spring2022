we hold in this case that the personal disqualification of an attorney based on an earlier adverse representation will not automatically lead to the vicarious disqualification of a law firm in a different but substantially related litigation rather,the law firm may rebut a presumption of shared confidences and avoid vicarious disqualification by showing that effective screening methods were in place that prevented the passing of confidential information from the individual attorney to others in the firm.

factual and procedural background 
in february,panther brought an action against canam,its president and managing partner,russell grosse,famf and park,who controlled famf as its sole trustee,for wrongfully foreclosing on panther interest in real property hereafter sometimes referred to as the panther grosse litigation.panther was represented by micheli,his attorney since.grosse was represented by stephen schreiner,who on grosse behalf,executed a joint defense agreement with famf regarding the litigation.the agreement provided for the exchange of privileged communications,attorney work product,and discovery together referred to as common interest privileged information,in order to facilitate the representation and anticipated defense of the parties in the litigation.
canam and famf,which had taken control of canam in the course of the litigation,filed against panther,alleging,inter alia,that he defrauded famf investors,and breached his fiduciary duty to canam and had improperly managed canam affairs.in the course of discovery,park,and ken tremblett,a member of canam management committee,learned that panther held a stock option in a company called the credit store,and was in negotiations with a jay botchman regarding botchman purchase of panther shares in the credit store,once panther exercised the option.park informed botchman of the litigation,sent him the pleadings,and he and tremblett told botchman at various times that famf and canam would win the case,and in particular,would prevail on their and would be able to execute on the judgment s by taking over panther stock option rights.park and tremblett claimed that once they did so,they would sell the stock to botchman for a total of million,of the million sales price he and panther had agreed to.botchman declared that as a result of these communications,he believed canam and famf would prevail in the litigation and would take control of panther stock option,and thus decided not to buy the stock from panther for million,but to wait until famf and canam obtained the option rights and then purchase it for million.
park disagreed below with botchman characterization of their communications but confirmed that he and tremblett discussed the claims against panther in the panther grosse litigation and the status of panther stock option as a possible source of recovery if canam famf prevailed.park also declared that in accordance with the joint defense agreement,confidential information was shared between him,famf attorney,grosse and schreiner pertaining to the strategies,merits,strengths and weaknesses of famf and grosse defenses,as well as the merits of famf and canam.schreiner also remembered discussing the panther grosse litigation with park,grosse and the attorneys for canam and famf in a confidential settlement conference.
contrary to park assertions,canam and famf did not prevail on the.canam was dismissed by nonsuit during trial,and the jury found in favor of panther on famf.
in october,panther,represented by the mazzarella firm,brought the instant action against,inter alia,park,tremblett,canam and famf but not grosse alleging slander,defamation of character,negligent and intentional interference with contractual relationships,and negligent and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,based on statements park and tremblett had made to botchman regarding panther stock option and the panther grosse litigation.panther park et.
a year later,on october,after the conclusion of the panther grosse litigation and after his former firm had dissolved,schreiner became associated with the mazzarella firm as an independent contractor,where he is paid a certain percentage of what he originates,bills and collects.schreiner brought with him his paralegal from his former firm,and uses his own computer and printer.he is not networked into the mazzarella firm computer system and does not use their system.schreiner current case files are maintained in the office of his paralegal,and he does not have access to the files of the mazzarella firm.when he moved to the firm,schreiner was no longer involved in any litigation involving panther,and his files relating to the panther grosse litigation were in storage and not kept at the mazzarella firm.schreiner and micheli spoke before schreiner moved to the mazzarella office,and micheli told him because he would continue to represent panther as he had for the preceding years,he would not be discussing any aspect of the panther litigation with schreiner and instructed schreiner to refrain from discussing the matter.there were also two other meetings between schreiner and the mazzarella firm partners at which the topic of not discussing or disclosing any information pertaining to the panther matter was discussed.micheli also testified that he spoke to the firm associates and staff about schreiner moving his offices,and instructed them not to discuss the panther case with him.before schreiner moved,micheli sent an email to all personnel in the firm reminding them of this edict.micheli also put in place procedures for handling mail related to the panther matter,so that all such mail would be routed to micheli who would ensure nothing pertaining to panther was routed to schreiner.in addition,micheli instructed panther not to talk to schreiner if he saw him in the office.schreiner testified that he had not shared any information with panther,which micheli corroborated.neither schreiner nor micheli knows of any instance in which the screening procedures have failed.
in november,park was deposed at the mazzarella firm in a related bankruptcy proceeding and learned that schreiner had moved to the firm.shortly thereafter,famf,canam and park moved to disqualify the mazzarella firm and micheli from representing panther in the panther park et litigation.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that confidential information had been exchanged between famf,canam,park,grosse and schreiner in the course of the panther grosse litigation that was substantially related to panther park et,which would disqualify schreiner and vicariously disqualify the mazzarella firm.the court stated no california case had sanctioned the use of screening procedures where former government attorneys were not involved,and held further that screening procedures should not work to prevent automatic disqualification where the firm is aware that the attorney was in a confidential relationship with an opposing party.
