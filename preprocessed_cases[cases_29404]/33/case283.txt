diekemper appeals his sentence,alleging that his wife probation condition violates his fundamental right to a marital relationship the district court judge failure to recuse himself for bias violates diekemper right to due process the district court application of the sentencing enhancement was in error and the district court failure to weigh all of the sentencing factors in was in error.we affirm.
background 
joseph and margaret diekemper were dairy farmers who had been married for years.the couple filed for bankruptcy in may.for close to four years thereafter diekemper engaged in a scheme to conceal assets from the bankruptcy court.eventually the government discovered diekemper conduct and indicted him on counts.he ultimately pled guilty to five of the charged counts.
at diekemper plea hearing,he signed a stipulation of facts admitting to a variety of illegal conduct,including undervaluing property and assets by more than million dollars,hiding farm equipment on friends properties,titling and selling vehicles and equipment in others names,using the mail service to effectuate these transfers,failing to disclose financial information to the bankruptcy trustee,fraudulently obtaining agricultural subsidies from the usda,and urging others to lie under oath during his bankruptcy proceedings.in the interim between diekemper plea hearing and his sentencing hearing,diekemper was sentenced for her participation as a in the scheme.a condition of her probation was that she refrain from all contact with diekemper during those two years.
one month after diekemper sentencing,diekemper had his own sentencing hearing.during that hearing,diekemper did not challenge his wife probation condition.see appellee app.at m y understanding of the ruling was that diekemper was not permitted contact and i can stand here and question the validity of that judgment,i not going to do that.statement by diekemper counsel.but diekemper did contest the enhancement to his sentence for his role as the organizer of an extensive criminal activity,pursuant to a.ultimately,however,the district court found the enhancement appropriate and sentenced diekemper to months imprisonment for his mail fraud and months imprisonment on each of the other counts,with each sentence to run concurrently.
ii.analysis 
diekemper now challenges various aspects of his sentencing.we address each of his contentions in turn.
diekemper probation condition 
diekemper first argues that his wife probation condition violates his fundamental right to a marital relationship.although the government urges us to find that diekemper waived this argument through his attorney statement at sentencing and indeed,he may have,we need not address the issue of waiver because diekemper argument is not properly before us in the first instance,and in any event,diekemper lacks standing to pursue it.
to raise a claim before an article iii court,a litigant must present a case or controversy that can be properly adjudicated by the federal courts.city of chicago,cir.to be properly before the federal courts,a litigant must have timely appealed a final judgment,see generally fed.fairley andrews,cir the only prerequisites to appellate jurisdiction are a final judgment and a timely notice of appeal,and have standing to raise the challenged issue,michigan environmental protection agency,cir.a litigant has standing when he demonstrates an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and a favorable decision will likely redress the injury,at internal quotation marks omitted.
diekemper argument fails at its inception because the probation condition with which he takes issue was decided in an entirely different case.he is appealing the final judgment in his own case,not the final judgment in diekemper case.diekemper neither took issue with her probation condition nor appealed her sentence.and that judgment is not now before us.we therefore have no ability to reach the probation condition because the judgment imposing that condition is not on appeal.
even assuming that we could examine diekemper probation condition,we fail to see how diekemper can prove causation and redressability,which,for purposes of this case,seem readily intertwined.although the condition was imposed on his wife probation,diekemper argues that he has standing because his marriage is affected by the terms of that condition in essence,he seems to argue that being affected by the condition is enough to satisfy the three standing requirements.but what diekemper fails to realize is the mere fact that he may suffer the effects of his wife probation condition does not confer upon him article iii standing.
diekemper is currently serving a prison sentence of months.without some affidavit from diekemper that absent her probation condition she would visit her husband,we have no way of knowing that she would in fact do so.without any corroboration,diekemper own statement that his marriage is affected because his wife can not visit him is unavailing.we are not at the pleading stage of the case,where general allegations of fact are enough to withstand a challenge.lujan wildlife fed n,d lac du flambeau band of lake superior chippewa indians norton,cir.instead,each element of standing must be supported by more than unadorned speculation.plotkin ryan,cir.
certainly,the district court sentence prohibiting diekemper from seeing her husband could be the reason she will have no contact with diekemper for two years.but again,without some statement from diekemper to that effect,we have no way of knowing whether,in the absence of that condition,she actually would contact her husband.see perry village of arlington heights,cir explaining that standing requires a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct,such that the injury can be fairly traced to the challenged action of the defendant and not from the independent action of some third party not before the court.
and because they are so intertwined in this case,diekemper failure to show causation also amounts to a failure to demonstrate redressability.in the absence of a causation showing,we simply can not assume that if we were to remand the injury complained of would be remedied.plotkin,at stating specifically that redressability must be proven.in fact,a sufficient remedy would unlikely be available even if causation were present because a remand would amount to a full resentencing,yet again subject to the district court broad includes the discretion to resentence diekemper thus preventing her from seeing her husband through incarceration.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d noting that when a claim depends on the independent actions of third parties,standing will be hard to satisfy.because there are numerous deficiencies in his argument,diekemper challenge to his wife probation condition must fail.
diekemper also asserts that the district court judge failure to recuse himself for bias violated diekemper rights to due process and the recusal statute.in the context of,our standard of review varies based on the claim.in this circuit,review of a decision denying recusal under a must be sought immediately through a writ of mandamus or it is waived.united states troxel,cir.as for claims arising under b,if a claim is properly preserved,our review is de novo.united states balistrieri,cir.it is less clear under our case law whether we may
