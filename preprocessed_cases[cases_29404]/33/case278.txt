a foundation created by jay hayden,and the estates of his mother and of another woman maurine johnson,brought this rico suit against a bank,two law firms,and seven persons connected with either the bank or the law firms.the suit charges that the defendants along with others not named as defendants,in particular robert cochonour had formed an informal rico enterprise that had defrauded the foundation and the estates.without waiting to file an answer to the complaint,the defendants moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to rule b,on the ground that the complaint itself showed that the plaintiffs had missed the deadline governing rico suits.rotella wood,agency holding associates,cancer foundation,cerberus capital management,lp,cir.the district judge agreed and granted the motion.although the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense to liability and so ordinarily must be pleaded and proved by the defendant,if it is plain from the complaint that the defense is indeed a bar to the suit dismissal is proper without further pleading.jones bock,cancer foundation,cerberus capital management,lp,supra,at limestone development village of lemont,cir.
the complaint alleges that the fraud began,and the rico enterprise if that is what it is came into existence,in,when the plaintiff foundation was created by hayden will.but the plaintiffs argue that although they were reasonably diligent they did discover the fraud before may,four years before they filed suit and that even if that argument is rejected and a finding made that they did discover it before then,the defendants prevented them from obtaining information essential to their being able to file a complaint that would withstand dismissal.
our only source of facts is the paragraphs of the second amended complaint,which sprawl over pages.for purposes of the appeal we assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true,though without vouching for their truth.
hayden will had appointed the lawyer robert cochonour,afterward an illinois judge,to be the executor of his estate.between becoming executor in upon the death of hayden,and,cochonour looted the hayden foundation and the two women who were still alive during that period,but very elderly by forging endorsements and signatures on checks,on security agreements,and on other financial documents and by writing checks drawn on the foundation to himself or to entities that he controlled.he tunneled the looted money through an account in the defendant bank,which was in cahoots with him,called the m m account,which he had opened by forging the signatures of johnson and of another woman,who later became johnson agent.the defendants assisted cochonour fraud by allowing him to forge signatures and convert funds that they knew did belong to him and by preparing false documents that facilitated the transfer of funds to him from the hayden foundation and the two old women.
the fraud began to unravel in.it was then that cochonour acknowledged to maurine johnson agent who had a power of attorney because johnson had become incompetent that he had stolen money from johnson,though he lied about the amount he had stolen and it was also then that her agent learned from someone associated with the bank about the existence of the bank account through which stolen funds had been channeled.the trustees of the hayden foundation became suspicious around the same time when they learned that cochonour had arranged for a court hearing to approve annual reports of the estate for the years to although he administered the foundation affairs,he had never filed a financial report with the trustees.the trustees filed a complaint with the illinois judicial inquiry board and notified the state attorney general of their concerns,and the attorney general filed a petition in an illinois state court to intervene in the jay hayden estate,which had never been closed.the petition was granted and cochonour immediately resigned his judgeship.by this time the trustees knew that the foundation,though believed to have had more than million in assets when it was created on jay hayden death in,now had no assets at all,and there was no record of what had happened to the money.
all this was in.in january of the following year cochonour pleaded guilty to having stolen more than from the jay hayden estate between and,and was sentenced to prison.also well before may,four years,remember,before this suit was filed,employees of the defendant bank tried to persuade one of the foundation trustees to get the trustees to drop their inquiry into cochonour.they told the trustee that all the irregularities could be explained,and that in any event,because a close confidant of cochonour had become the subject of grand jury proceedings for stealing from an elderly person,cumberland county the site of the fraud did need more bad publicity.a cousin of jay hayden hired a lawyer who told the cousin that he believed there was a conspiracy between cochonour and the defendants.
yet besides alleging all these things and more,the complaint also alleges that the defendants made assiduous efforts to prevent the plaintiffs from learning more about the conspiracy.they tried to convince johnson agent not to investigate cochonour and they filed complaints against the lawyer who had been retained by jay hayden cousin to investigate the defendants.at the behest of the defendants the illinois attorney registration disciplinary commission told the lawyer to leave the state forthwith,as otherwise the commission would reopen investigations of him that had opened but not pursued to completion.and cochonour in the legal proceedings against him tried to hide behind the fifth amendment,refusing to come clean about his activities,and when his stonewalling failed he defied court orders and was held in contempt.see estate of hayden.
a defendant who prevents a plaintiff from obtaining information that he needs in order to be able to file a complaint that will withstand dismissal is forbidden,under the rubric of equitable estoppel estopped is the legal term,to plead the statute of limitations for the period in which the inquiry was thwarted.beckel associates,cir cada baxter healthcare,cir see also rotella wood,supra,at.but if the obstructive behavior occurs after the plaintiff inquiry has reached the point at which he has discovered,or by exercising reasonable diligence should have discovered,that he has a claim upon which to found a suit,the defendant obstructionism has no causal significance,see flight attendants against ual offset commissioner,cir,and so is not a ground for an estoppel.paige police department,cir per curiam.likewise if the defendant behavior,whenever begun and however ill intentioned,fails to prevent the plaintiff from learning that he has a claim in time to sue within the statutory period.see flight attendants against ual offset commissioner,supra,at dummar lummis,cir shropshear corporation counsel of city of chicago,cir.for again the behavior has no causal significance.
we have said not inconsistently with the qualifications just indicated that the plaintiff lack of due diligence is not a defense to a claim of equitable estoppel,because the defendant conduct is deliberate,just as a plaintiff contributory negligence is not a defense to an intentional tort.id.at see also flight attendants against ual offset commissioner,supra,at.not all courts agree,see,egerer woodland realty,cir robinson dalton,cir,to the supreme court has held that when an event occurs that tolls the statute of limitations in either a rico or an antitrust case,even if the event is fraud by the defendant,the plaintiff can not fold his hands,sit back,and do nothing until the defendant returns to good behavior.he has to continue investigating diligently,to the extent he can despite the defendants obstructionism,because the rico and antitrust statutes seek not merely to protect private rights but also to enlist private plaintiffs in enforcing these laws,which are believed to serve important public purposes.klehr smith,see also in re copper antitrust litigation,cir prudential ins.united states gypsum,cir.
