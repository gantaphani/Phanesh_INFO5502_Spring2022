at issue in this case are the duties of disinterest and disclosure of an examiner appointed to facilitate a reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the issues arise from the appointment of baxter schilling to serve as the examiner in the reorganization of big rivers electric corporation,which was unable to meet obligations on billion in debt and whose september bankruptcy petition represented the largest chapter case filed in kentucky history.
as an examiner,schilling did much to advance the successful reorganization of big rivers,which emerged from chapter in june through a consensual plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court.during his tenure as examiner,however,schilling sought privately to negotiate a success fee with three of the estate unsecured creditors,by which they would pay him a percentage of their increased recovery on top of the hourly fee authorized by the bankruptcy court for his services.schilling did not disclose the negotiations,or the agreements he believed he had reached with these creditors,to the debtor in possession,to the other creditors or to the court until many months later.when schilling conduct came to light,several parties objected to his actions,as did the united states trustee which is responsible for appointing bankruptcy examiners and trustees.in view of his conduct,they argued that schilling and his law firm should disgorge all of the fees dispensed to them during the nearly million.the district court agreed,and we now affirm.
unable to meet the continuing obligations on more than billion in debt,the big rivers electric corporation filed a petition to reorganize the company under chapter of the bankruptcy code and to remain as a debtor in possession during the reorganization.filed on september,the petition represented the largest bankruptcy case ever filed in kentucky and at the time was one of the largest bankruptcy cases in the country.a utility,big rivers owed billion of its debt to the rural utilities service of the united states department of agriculture the utilities service,which held a perfected security interest in all of big rivers assets.see in re big rivers.big rivers largest other creditors included bank of new york,chase manhattan bank,and mapco equities,each of which held unsecured claims.id.
on october,bluegrass containment,a smaller unsecured creditor,moved the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee or an examiner in the big rivers case.id.in a chapter case,a trustee replaces the debtor in possession and takes immediate control of the business and the reorganization effort.see a,a.examiners,by contrast,assume a more limited role.they typically investigate the debtor business and handle other duties specifically assigned by the bankruptcy court,but do not replace the debtor in possession in handling the affairs of the business.see id.c,b.
the bankruptcy court decided that an examiner should be appointed and ordered the united states trustee to select one.in addition to the tasks expressly required of examiners under the bankruptcy the debtor affairs and filing a report,see id.b the bankruptcy court ordered the examiner to w ork with big rivers and its creditors in resolving various disputes with creditors,and if feasible,attempt to negotiate a global settlement of the disputes in this case and the development of a consensual plan of reorganization.ja.the court did not specify the terms of the examiner compensation.
the united states trustee selected baxter schilling,a kentucky bankruptcy practitioner,as the examiner.at the time of his appointment,schilling had frequently served as a chapter trustee,had twice served as a chapter trustee,but had never served as an examiner.on october,the bankruptcy court entered an order approving schilling selection but again did not specify the terms of the examiner compensation.at.
soon after his selection,schilling signed a document entitled affidavit of examiner that he is disinterested,in which he attested that he was a disinterested person in this case and did not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors.id.at.schilling also submitted a separate verified statement that he had no connections with the debtor,creditors,or any other interested parties.id.at.
on october and november,schilling held meetings in washington,with the major secured and unsecured creditors.in the course of the meetings,schilling sought to mediate a dispute between the utilities service and some of the unsecured creditors regarding the priority of their claims so that the parties could submit a consensual plan of reorganization to the court.id.at.when the initial negotiations did not bear fruit,schilling reached the conclusion that the parties would never agree on a plan of reorganization unless someone found a way to bring new value into the estate.to that end,schilling decided to undertake the task himself,performing in his words trustee duties,including the principal duty of a trustee to maximize the value of the debtor estate,as well as examiner duties.ja.because he effectively would function as a trustee in this new role and because he customarily had received a fee as a chapter trustee,schilling believed he should be paid like a chapter trustee for his work as the examiner in the big rivers case.at see also ja schilling i had been given the misnomer of examiner,but i had been given trustee duties.
near the conclusion of these at times when the utilities service representatives were not in the discussed these views with some,but not all,of the unsecured creditors.schilling initially told chase and bank of new york representatives that he wanted them to pay him a percentage fee based on the success he brought to the estate in the form of new value.at.explaining what he meant by a success fee,schilling later told chase,bank of new york and mapco representatives that he expected each of them to pay him three percent of their increased recovery from big rivers.id.without such a deal,schilling told bank of new york attorney,he would not perform his mediation duties.id.
schilling left the washington meetings believing that,subject to bankruptcy court approval,bank of new york,chase and mapco would pay him three percent of their increased recovery.as later communications reveal,however,none of these three creditors believed they had reached such an agreement with least not at that time.id.
by november,the utilities service learned that schilling had made statements about his desire to seek compensation based on the new value added to the estate.according to the bankruptcy court,one or more interested persons,including the utilities service,spoke to a member of the bankruptcy court staff the morning of november,and requested an in camera hearing regarding the examiner compensation.id.at.these persons,unidentified except for the utilities service,expressed concern about schilling statements that he would seek compensation based upon new value added to the estate during his tenure.the bankruptcy judge instructed his staff member to tell the parties that they could raise the issue at a hearing if they wished,but that he would not hold an in camera hearing.no one raised the issue in court during the hearing on november.id.
a few days later,on november,the bankruptcy court entered an order providing for schilling interim compensation.id.with the utilities service consent,the bankruptcy court allowed the examiner to receive interim compensation of per hour in and per hour in,all of which big rivers would pay from its cash collateral,cash in which the estate and another entity here,the utilities service had an interest.see a.the court order did not alter schilling ongoing obligation to compl y with all applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code.ja.
in the meantime,schilling learned that chase would not support his proposal.he called chase and accused the company of going behind his back and not being an honest dealer.at.in response,chase wrote schilling a letter saying that he was incorrect and reaffirming its support for a arrangement.chase asked schilling to keep this confidential,ja,and he complied.
on december,schilling had a similar conversation with representatives from bank of new york.having heard that the bank local counsel had objected to the united states trustee about schilling proposed success fee,schilling called the bank to inquire.the bank representatives assured schilling that if local counsel had registered any such complaint,she had no authorization to do so.at.
on january,big rivers filed its proposed plan of reorganization.the next day,according to schilling,he sought and received the bankruptcy judge approval to begin to negotiate his fee with the banks chase and bank of new york and mapco.id.this conversation,to the extent it in fact took place,was ex parte,was and was not the subject of discovery,and it did not include at any rate the court approval to seek such a fee directly from the three creditors.id.at.
the following day,january,schilling telephoned bank of new york,chase and mapco to confirm his fee arrangements.and the following week,schilling sent each of these creditors a letter to confirm their telephone conversation and to request written confirmation of the agreement they had reached during the washington meetings to pay him three percent of their increased recovery.ja schilling letter to bank of new york ja schilling letter to chase ja schilling letter to mapco.
schilling letter to chase stated that the bank and schilling had an oral agreement reached during the washington conference that schilling would receive compensation of of the new value that chase received in the case.it is this figure of,the letter continued,which was discussed on the telephone last friday january and which we agreed was reasonable compensation for the examiner to receive from chase at the closing of the plan.ja.
schilling letter to mapco reflected a similar understanding.schilling reported that mapco share of the fee amounted to and added that he agreed with the suggestion of chase representative that the payments from mapco and the banks be deposited into an escrow account on the closing date under the plan.ja.
the letter to bank of new york likewise asserted that schilling and the bank had reached an agreement in washington.the bank obligation,schilling reported,came to.in the letter schilling added that the bank had made this promise not only at the washington meetings but also during a december,meeting between schilling and the bank that the parties had two oral agreements.ja.
bank of new york and mapco responded with letters of their own,each denying that they had reached such an agreement.bank of new york strongly took issue with schilling continuous references to agreements that ha d allegedly been reached between schilling and bank of new york concerning compensation,ja,and reminded schilling that it is inappropriate for any fiduciary to seek compensation directly from individual creditors.ja.mapco insisted that it had never previously approved or even considered any compensation agreement with schilling,and that schilling compensation would be determined by the bankruptcy court under the bankruptcy code.ja.
chase took a different tack.in a phone call with schilling in response to his letter,it acknowledged that schilling and chase had reached an oral agreement regarding a success fee,but said that they had struck the agreement during their january,telephone call,not during the fall washington meetings.at.in the months after january,chase asked schilling to take several positions adverse to the utilities service in the bankruptcy,at times doing legal research for the examiner to substantiate chase position.at.
while schilling and the three unsecured creditors engaged in a considerable number of communications about what agreement was reached and when the agreement occurred,one thing is clear neither schilling nor these unsecured creditors initially disclosed any of these private discussions in washington,the telephone calls,the the utilities service,to the united states trustee,or to the other parties involved in the big rivers bankruptcy.
on march,schilling filed his first interim fee application.in making bankruptcy fee applications,bankruptcy rule a requires applicants,including examiners,to disclose what payments have theretofore been made or promised to the applicant for services rendered or to be rendered in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case.fed.a.in his application schilling included a rule a disclosure statement,asserting that he was a disinterested person and did not represent or hold an interest adverse to the interests of the estate with respect to the matters about which the examiner was appointed.at.he did not,however,mention his agreement with chase or the agreement that he believed he had reached with bank of new york and mapco.id.
on june,schilling filed a request for payment of administrative expenses,which explained to the bankruptcy court that he might seek million in compensation based on new value he had brought into the estate.at.he also filed a proof of claim for an amount not to exceed million.id.at.while these documents disclosed schilling plan to seek compensation,they nowhere disclosed his agreement with chase or his alleged agreements with bank of new york and mapco to have the fee paid directly by them.id.
a few days later,on june,the bankruptcy court confirmed big rivers consensual plan of reorganization.id.as schilling had earlier predicted,new value enabled the parties to develop a consensual plan of reorganization.in contrast to the plan initially proposed by big rivers,the approved plan included an additional million in new value for the creditors.
no one denies that schilling played a significant role in the negotiations leading to the approved plan.most significantly,schilling supported the auctioning of big rivers assets and opposed accepting a lease deal that big rivers had negotiated with pacificcorp energy company.big rivers and the utilities service opposed the auction.the bankruptcy court ultimately ordered an auction on the condition that the bidders compete with the pacificcorp agreement.louisville gas and electric in the end submitted the highest bid,which added considerable value to the estate and which laid the groundwork for the consensual plan of reorganization that the court eventually confirmed.at.
on july,schilling filed a second interim fee application.he again included a rule a disclosure disclaiming any improper interest.and he again failed to report the promise that chase had made to him and the promises that he believed bank of new york and mapco had made to him.
the first written confirmation of an agreement between schilling and one of the creditors came in the form of a letter from chase to schilling dated july.ja.in the letter,chase confirm ed its support for schilling application for a fee enhancement and,subject to bankruptcy court approval,formally agreed to be responsible for up to of the fee enhancement.id.
schilling filed the chase letter with the bankruptcy court the same day.he attached it to a pleading entitled preliminary pleading regarding application for allowance of compensation and reimbursement of expenses,in which schilling noted a s previously stated in pleadings,and as disclosed to the court,bank of new york,chase and mapco agreed during the washington meetings to a approach,and the utilities service stated,at that time,it would not agree or disagree with a percentage compensation to the examiner.ja.schilling further claimed that the court had instructed the parties on july,to attempt to negotiate the examiner fee request,that the examiner has begun additional negotiations,but that those negotiations have concluded only with chase,as evidenced by the agreement attached hereto.id.this constituted the first public disclosure of schilling intention and efforts to have his compensation paid by these three creditors as opposed to the estate.at.
in response to the pleading,mapco attorney wrote privately to schilling that the statement was incorrect,at least as to my client.ja.schilling persisted,claiming that the statement was correct and that all three creditors had agreed to his proposal.at.
spurred by the public disclosure of schilling agreement with chase,the utilities service and the united states trustee requested discovery into schilling fee arrangement.in view of the chase agreement,the utilities service objected to the continued use of its cash collateral to pay schilling and,along with the united states trustee,asked the court to order schilling to disgorge the fees he and his law firm had already received.the bankruptcy court rejected both requests and enjoined further court filings and discovery concerning the examiner fees.
not until one year later,in september,did the bankruptcy court revisit the issue of schilling compensation.the court permitted the parties to submit pleadings on the examiner fees,but continued a ban on discovery and refused to hear any evidence.at this point schilling claimed for the first time,in open court,that he ha d never said there was a side agreement with mapco.id.at.soon after schilling made this statement,mapco filed with the bankruptcy court copies of schilling earlier letters to the company in which he had insisted that they had reached such an agreement.bank of new york also filed with the court a copy of its letter from schilling asserting a similar agreement.id.at.
schilling filed his final fee application in october,requesting approximately million in compensation to be paid by the debtor,various creditors of th e estate as the court equitably determines is appropriate,or a combination thereof.ja.this figure combined schilling hourly fees which totaled with an enhancement of three percent of the new value brought into the estate during schilling tenure as examiner which came to.
on october,in response to this application,the united states trustee filed a motion to disgorge all of schilling fees because he had improperly negotiated secret side agreements for his compensation.schilling responded that he had never truly believed that he and bank of new york,chase and mapco had reached such agreements and that his statements claiming otherwise were intentionally untrue.at.as schilling put it 
a common tactic used in negotiations is to make a statement,as if it were fact,even though the statement is incorrect and is known to be incorrect.the examiner used this common place tactic in his january,letters to chase and counsel for bank of new york and mapco,asserting,as a fact,that an agreement had been reached at the washington settlement conference,wherein these creditors would pay the examiner on any new value their clients received.
shortly thereafter,the bankruptcy judge disqualified himself from hearing the fee issues and transferred the case to another bankruptcy judge.the new judge continued the ban on discovery and without an evidentiary hearing issued a decision on schilling fee application,awarding schilling covered his hourly compensation plus an enhancement of four times that be paid by big rivers.in re big rivers.big rivers,the utilities service,the united states trustee and schilling each appealed this decision to the district court.
on appeal,the district court affirmed in part and reversed in part.it affirmed the bankruptcy court order regarding schilling base compensation,reversed the order granting schilling an enhancement and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court to consider the disgorgement issue as an initial matter because the bankruptcy court had not reached the issue.see in re big rivers.schilling appealed the decision to this court,which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.see d granting the courts of appeals jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of district courts on appeal from bankruptcy courts irs hildebrand in re brown,cir w e are to inquire into the finality of the district court decision,not the finality of the bankruptcy court decision.
on march,the bankruptcy court,on remand,transferred the case to the district court asking it to consider whether to withdraw the order of reference.on march,the district court withdrew the order of reference,which meant that the district court rather than the bankruptcy court thereafter would have original jurisdiction over the case.when all of the district court judges in the western district of kentucky recused themselves from hearing the case,the chief judge of the sixth circuit assigned the case to judge avern cohn of the eastern district of michigan.
on august,judge cohn granted the joint motion of the utilities service and the united states trustee for disgorgement,granted big rivers motion for partial disgorgement,and ordered schilling and his counsel to disgorge all fees paid to them.at.based on detailed factual findings,the court held that schilling was not entitled to any fees because he was not a disinterested examiner under d.as the court explained 
the bankruptcy code and rules mandate that a professional,such as an examiner,be a neutral,disinterested party in the case.the moment that the examiner approached three of big rivers largest unsecured creditors and broached the subject of his compensation,suggesting that they pay him a fee based on the success or new value he brought them to the estate,he was no longer a disinterested party.whether or not such an agreement was reached or whether an agreement was subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court is irrelevant.what is relevant is that the examiner sought to have his compensation tied to the enhanced value brought to the estate and,in particular,tied to what bank of new york,chase and mapco received on their claims from the estate.
at.recognizing that schilling made it known to all the he was going to seek compensation in the amount of a percentage of the enhanced value he brought to the estate,the district court explained that schilling intention to have his compensation paid by bank of new york,chase and mapco was known only to him and these creditors.id.at.this lack of disinterestedness,the district court concluded,meant that schilling was not a properly appointed professional and is therefore not entitled to any compensation.id.
the court also held that schilling failed to disclose his fee arrangements as required under and bankruptcy rule.section a requires a ny attorney representing a debtor to disclose his fee arrangements.rule a applies broadly to any entity seeking interim or final compensation and requires disclosure of any payments made or promised to the applicant.the district court concluded that schilling violated both provisions by failing to disclose his fee discussions with mapco,chase,and bank of new york.at.the court did not credit schilling assertion that he only reached an agreement with chase in july and it was immediately disclosed.id.schilling letters written in january of belie this assertion,the court found it was only when the government questioned the examiner actions that the examiner retreated from the position in his letters and made the assertion that his statements were intended for negotiation.id.under these circumstances,the court concluded,the only effective solution is to deny the examiner,and his law firm,all compensation.at.the court order required schilling individually and doing business as the law firm of baxter schilling to remit to big rivers,the amount that had already been dispensed to him and his firm throughout the case,plus interest.schilling now appeals the district court disgorgement order,requesting reinstatement of his hourly and enhanced fees.
because the district court was exercising original rather than appellate jurisdiction when it ordered schilling and his law firm to disgorge all compensation,we review its order for abuse of discretion.see michel federated dep t stores,in re federated dep t stores,cir.in doing so,we adopt the district court underlying factual findings unless clearly erroneous and we review its underlying construction of the bankruptcy code de novo.id.
in considering the district court resolution of these issues,we start with the statutory framework.in a typical chapter reorganization,the debtor remains in possession of and operates the business at the same time that it manages the reorganization effort.less,for example,the debtor management is guilty of fraud or gross bankruptcy court orders the appointment of a trustee to replace the debtor in possession and to take control over the business and the reorganization effort.see a,a.the appointment of an examiner,as happened here,straddles these options,as an examiner performs some of the functions of a trustee but does not replace the debtor and does not take on the task of running the company.see id.c,b.
the bankruptcy code expressly requires examiners to perform two duties normally required of trustees and authorizes the court to assign other duties as well.id.b.first,the code requires examiners to perform an investigation,which means they must investigate the acts,conduct,assets,liabilities,and financial condition of the debtor,the operation of the debtor business and the desirability of the continuance of such business,and any other matter relevant to the case or to the formulation of a plan.id.a.second,the code requires examiners to file a report,which means they must identify and memorialize any fact ascertained pertaining to fraud,dishonesty,incompetence,misconduct,mismanagement,or irregularity in the management of the affairs of the debtor,or to a cause of action available to the estate.id.a a.in addition to these mandatory duties,a bankruptcy court may order an examiner to perform any other duties of the trustee that the court orders the debtor in possession not to perform.id.b.
given the sensitivity of these tasks and the objectivity required to perform them,the code requires all examiners,like all chapter trustees,to be disinterested.id.d.a defined term,disinterested person means a person who 
a is not a creditor,an equity security holder,or an insider 
b is not and was not an investment banker for any outstanding security of the debtor 
c has not been,within three years before the date of the filing of the petition,an investment banker for a security of the debtor 
d is not and was not,within two years before the date of the filing of the petition,a director,officer,or employee of the debtor or of an investment banker specified in subparagraph b or c of this paragraph and 
e does not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or equity security holders,by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to,connection with,or interest in,the debtor or an investment banker specified in subparagraph b or c of this paragraph,or for any other reason.
while examiners and trustees perform some of the same duties and while each of them must remain disinterested,the code distinguishes examiners from trustees in other ways.in contrast to earlier practices,the code now prohibits an examiner from serving as a trustee or as counsel for the trustee in order to ensure that examiners may not profit from the results of their work.compare bankruptcy reform act of,b a person that has served as an examiner in the case may not serve as trustee in the case,f the trustee may not employ a person that has served as an examiner in the case.with bankruptcy act of,as amended,reprinted in collier on bankruptcy app.a pt.a ed.including no such prohibition.see cong.rec.daily ed,reprinted in in order to ensure that the examiner report will be expeditious and fair,the examiner is precluded from serving as a trustee in the case or from representing a trustee if a trustee is appointed.cong.rec.daily ed,reprinted in collier the purpose of section f is to ensure that examiners discharge their investigatory duties in a purely objective fashion.leonard gumport,the bankruptcy examiner,cal,in the interest of fairness to the subject of the investigation,congress rejected the historical practice of permitting the examiner to profit from its report by becoming the trustee or an employee of the trustee.
nor may examiners play a role in a chapter proceeding.in a chapter liquidation,which occurs among other times at the end of an unsuccessful effort to reorganize a company under chapter,a trustee always replaces the debtor in possession,and the code prohibits the use of an examiner when a trustee has already been appointed.id.c.see also b giving a trustee,but not an examiner,the right to raise and appear and be heard on any issue in a chapter case in re baldwin united,an examiner performs the investigative duties of a trustee,and may perform other trustee duties as the court directs,but he stands on a different legal footing than a trustee.these modest differences between trustees and examiners do not diminish an examiner duties of disinterest but in fact serve to highlight them.
the bankruptcy code neither expects nor requires examiners to volunteer their time.like other officers and professionals appointed in a chapter case,examiners may request reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services and reimbursement for actual,necessary expenses.a a b.only a fter notice to the parties in interest and the united states trustee and a hearing,however,may the court award examiners these fees and expenses.id.the bankruptcy court may,on its own motion or on the motion of the united states trustee or any other party in interest,award compensation that is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.id.a.these same standards apply to interim compensation,which the code also authorizes.id.a.
rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure provides additional details about the procedure that a n entity,such as an examiner,seeking interim or final compensation from the estate must follow.an application for compensation,the rule says,shall include a statement as to what payments have theretofore been made or promised to the applicant for services rendered or to be rendered in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case and the source of the compensation so paid or promised.fed.a emphasis added.
in enumerating the duties of examiners and trustees,the drafters of the code also invoked the equitable duties applicable to these positions of trust.see young united states,d t he bankruptcy code incorporates traditional equitable principles.in defining the obligation of disinterestedness,the code says that examiners and trustees may not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or equity security holders,by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to,connection with,or interest in,the debtor or an investment banker specified in subparagraph b or c of this paragraph,or for any other reason.e emphasis added.the phrase for any other reason is not defined.by prohibiting any materially adverse interest to any party to the bankruptcy for any reason,congress plainly courts to construe disinterestedness against the backdrop of the equitable duties that apply to positions of trust.see in re martin,cir acknowledging that the code is less than explicit in mapping the contours of the disinterestedness requirement and interpreting the requirement in a way that is faithful to our view of congress intent and to the overriding consideration that equitable principles govern the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction quotation omitted cent.states southeast southwest areas pension fund cent,d congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of fiduciaries authority and responsibility by providing,for example,that assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust.quotation omitted nlrb amax coal,d erisa essentially codified strict fiduciary standards by providing,for example,that a fiduciary may not act in any transaction on behalf of a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its participants or beneficiaries.quoting b.
by linking trustees and examiners in this making them equally obligated to remain disinterested congress also signaled that examiners must satisfy the unbending standards of fiduciary duty that the law and society long have come to expect of trustees in general and that the supreme court has required of bankruptcy trustees in particular.see commodity futures trading comm weintraub,d stating that a chapter trustee owes a fiduciary duty to shareholders as well as to creditors mosser darrow.equity tolerates in bankruptcy trustees no interest adverse to the trust.woods city bank trust.protective committees,as well as indenture trustees,are fiduciaries.in re baldwin united,an examiner legal status is unlike that of any other officer which comes to mind.he is first and foremost disinterested and nonadversarial.the benefits of his investigative efforts flow solely to the debtor and to its creditors and shareholders,but he answers solely to the court.in re hamiel sons,t he trustee or examiner constitutes a court fiduciary and is amenable to no other purpose or interested party.wolf weinstein,d if,seems beyond dispute from the very terms of the trustee is himself a fiduciary within the meaning of the statute,logic and consistency would certainly suggest that those who perform similar tasks and incur like obligations to the creditors and shareholders should not be treated differently under the statute for this purpose.
finally,the code not only says that examiners and trustees must remain disinterested,but it also says that they may receive only reasonable compensation.a a.the compensation phrase,the supreme court has reasoned,suggests that trustees and examiners must remain loyal to all relevant parties in the bankruptcy and must act as fiduciaries in doing so.see wolf,at.r easonable compensation for services necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of those for whom the claimant purported to act.quotation omitted woods,at.the statutory term reasonable compensation requires strict adherence to the equitable principles that govern the standard of conduct for fiduciaries.
in incorporating the equitable duties of trustees into the bankruptcy code and in applying them to bankruptcy trustees and examiners,congress followed a path.the national legislature frequently legislates against the backdrop of common law and equitable principles,and the federal courts have often looked to these traditions in determining the contours of a trustee or another fiduciary duties.see young,at.t he bankruptcy code incorporates traditional equitable principles.field mans,d n either the structure of a of the code nor any explicit statement in a a reveals,let alone dictates,the particular level of reliance required by a a,and there is no reason to doubt congress intent to adopt a understanding of the terms it used.cent.states,at.r ather than explicitly enumerating in erisa all of the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries,congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of their authority and responsibility.amax coal,at.given this established rule against dual loyalties and congress use of terms long established in the courts of chancery,we must infer that congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary.
when congress enacted the bankruptcy act of,ch,stat,which became the basis for modern bankruptcy law,it assuredly meant to incorporate similar duties as the original act nowhere defined,much less mentioned,a duty of disinterestedness or any equivalent concept.when congress substantially modified the act through the chandler amendments in,ch,stat,it did the same thing in adopting a requirement of disinterest,which was broadly defined as an adverse interest for any reason.see chandler amendments of,stat.a person shall not be deemed disinterested appears that he has for any reason an interest materially adverse to the interests of any class of creditors or stockholders.and in,when the current bankruptcy code was adopted,congress embraced a similar definition of disinterest.see e d isinterested person does not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or equity security holders,by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to the debtor or for any other reason.
in each of these,in,in legislated against the backdrop of centuries of decisions about the duties of trustees and other fiduciaries as well as against the backdrop of courts construing statutes in the context of similar traditions.and in each instance,congress incorporated these principles and traditions.wolf,at.t he purpose behind was to codify these decisions and to give pervasive effect in chapter x proceedings to the historic maxim of equity that a fiduciary may not receive compensation for services tainted by disloyalty or conflict of interest.
an examiner duties in a bankruptcy proceeding,then,flow from the code,the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and the common law,including the principles of equity.all of these sources considered,a bankruptcy examiner has three general duties.first,consistent with the statutory requirement of disinterest,the examiner may not have a material adverse interest to any party to the bankruptcy for any reason,either at the time of appointment or during the course of the bankruptcy.see in re marvel entm t group,cir a plain reading of this section suggests one is a disinterested person only if he has no interest that is materially adverse to a party in interest in the bankruptcy.roger au son,aetna ins.in re roger au son,this section appears broad enough to include anyone who in the slightest degree might have some interest or relationship that would color the independent and impartial attitude required by the code.quotation and citation omitted in re watson,a disinterested person should be divested of any scintilla of personal interest which might be reflected in that person decisions concerning estate matters.
second,consistent with the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,examiners have several disclosure obligations.they must disclose all payments made or promised to them,meaning they must disclose in all fee applications any understandings they believe they have reached with anyone regarding their compensation.see henderson kisseberth in re kisseberth,cir an attorney in a bankruptcy case has an affirmative duty to disclose fully and completely all fee arrangements and payments.mapother mapother,cooper in re downs,cir t he fulfillment of the disclosure duties imposed under the code are crucial to the administration and disposition of proceedings before bankruptcy courts.neben starrett chartwell fin.in re,cir the disclosure rules impose upon attorneys an independent responsibility.in re bh p,cir holding that a trustee breache s the duty of disclosure when he contemplate s and discusse s a specific situation involving a potentiality for conflict but fails to disclose it.
third,consistent with the statutory requirement for receiving reasonable compensation and with the standards of fiduciary duty,examiners owe the creditors and shareholders a duty of loyalty.in imposing this duty on examiners and trustees,bankruptcy law seeks to avoid such delicate inquiries into the conduct of its own appointees by exacting from them forbearance of all opportunities to advance.mosser darrow.see bogert,law of trusts and trustees ed trustees must display throughout the administration of the case complete loyalty to the interests of the creditors and shareholders and must exclude all selfish interest collier a chapter trustee,like the trustee of a conventional personal trust,owes devotion to the interests of those on whose behalf the trustee acts.
schilling conduct as an examiner in the big rivers bankruptcy failed to live up to these standards.first,he violated his duty to remain disinterested.an agreement with a single creditor that links the examiner compensation to the creditor recovery qualifies as such an interest because it creates the risk that the examiner will favor one creditor at the expense of other creditors,to say nothing of all equity holders.given the realities of most bankruptcies,every dollar recovered by a favored creditor becomes a dollar lost to a disfavored creditor.opportunities abound,moreover,for bankruptcy examiners paid in this manner to benefit selected creditor patrons.they might decline to investigate and report any cause s of action available to the estate against the favored creditor say,for a fraudulent conveyance.see a.they might file,or threaten to file,a report that harms a disfavored creditor unless it accepts a settlement that increases the recovery of a favored creditor.they might stall or obstruct confirmation of a plan that represents the best interests of the estate if it contains no recovery for the favored creditor and no commission for the examiner.
whether as a matter of fact an individual examiner chooses to do any of these things does not alter the disinterestedness inquiry.that might lead examiners to act in these ways suffices to disqualify them,because the code does not merely prohibit trustees and examiners from acting upon materially adverse interests,it prohibits trustees and examiners from having them.see woods,at.t he incidence of a particular conflict of interest can seldom be measured with any degree of certainty.the bankruptcy court need not speculate as to whether the result of the conflict was to delay action where speed was essential,to close the record of past transactions where publicity and investigation were needed,to compromise claims by inattention where vigilant assertion was necessary,or otherwise to dilute the undivided loyalty owed to those whom the claimant purported to represent.where an actual conflict of interest exists,no more need be shown in this type of case to support a denial of compensation.dev.trustee in re dev,cir in a bankruptcy proceeding,limited and general partners do hold materially adverse positions.in re crimson,b y receiving compensation from debtor creditors,debtor counsel had,and has,a pecuniary interest materially adverse to the interest of the secured creditors and the interests of the conflict of interest that requires denial of all compensation.
schilling undeniably had such an oral chase no later than january.had schilling reached such an agreement before his appointment,the bankruptcy court could not have allowed him to serve as a trustee or examiner because he would not have been disinterested.see michel,at holding that the debtor retention of a professional who was not disinterested,as required under the code,was invalid from day one despite the bankruptcy court approval based on equitable concerns.that schilling reached the agreement in the midst of his examination and in secret only makes matters worse,especially in view of his affirmative statements to the court that he remained a disinterested person who did not represent or hold an interest adverse to the interests of the estate.ja.
second,schilling violated his disclosure obligations.each time schilling filed an interim fee application,rule a required him to disclose payments made or promised to him for services rendered or to be rendered in any capacity whatsoever in connection with the case.schilling january oral agreement with chase regarding his compensation constituted a payment promised within the meaning of the rule,whether or not the promise was subject to bankruptcy court approval.yet schilling did not disclose the agreement in his march and july interim fee applications,each time in violation of the rule.see henderson kisseberth in re kisseberth,cir an attorney in a bankruptcy case has an affirmative duty to disclose fully and completely all fee arrangements and payments.mapother mapother,cooper in re downs,cir t he fulfillment of the duties imposed under these provisions and rule are crucial to the administration and disposition of proceedings before the bankruptcy courts.in re crimson,at c ounsel failure to disclose forthrightly the source of all compensation should warrant the denial of all compensation.
rule a also required schilling to disclose the promises for payment that schilling believed bank of new york,chase and mapco had made to him at the fall conference in washington.when a fiduciary believes a party has promised him payment,he may not use later disputes over the existence or enforceability of the promise to excuse an earlier failure to disclose it.see in re bh p,cir holding that a trustee who has contemplated and discussed a specific situation involving a potentiality for conflict has a duty to disclose it.
third,schilling violated his duty of just by entering into the oral agreement with chase,but by misrepresenting his actions to the court and to the parties during his negotiations with the parties and during his efforts to backtrack from them.schilling did so on multiple occasions when he filed documents claiming to have no adverse interest when he filed documents claiming to have received no promises for payment when he claimed that he never said there was a side agreement with mapco,at and when he asserted in january letters to bank of new york,mapco and chase that they had agreed at the washington conference to pay him a percentage of their recovery,only to claim later that these assertions were just a negotiation,a misrepresentation.rather than serve all parties to the bankruptcy and rather than do so in a straightforward and transparent manner,schilling sought compensation in a way that did none of these things.hired to serve the estate interests,he started down a path that served his own.
in each of these instances,it bears repeating,the issue was not whether schilling would be compensated for his efforts.absent violations of the code and his fiduciary obligations,he would be,and indeed the court early on provided that he would be compensated at his standard hourly rate of per hour in and per hour in.perceiving an opportunity to be paid still more,however,schilling negotiated,and in some instances consummated,compensation arrangements for his personal benefit and ostensibly for the benefit of some creditors but not others.all the while,he did so secretively and outside of the traditional mechanisms for permitting fiduciaries to identify and pursue matters of to all parties and a hearing before the court.where the law demanded n ot honesty alone,but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive,meinhard salmon,cardozo,and forbearance of all opportunities to advance self interest,mosser,at,schilling responded with too little honesty and too much.his conduct simply was not compatible with an examiner,or for that matter a trustee,duty of loyalty.
having concluded that schilling violated his duties to remain disinterested and loyal and having concluded that he violated his duty to disclose payments promised to him,we must consider whether the sanction imposed by the district court was appropriate.wolf,at.t he bare holding that of the bankruptcy act has been violated does not automatically determine the consequences of such a violation.our role in this respect is a modest one,as a bankruptcy court or,in this instance,a district court acting in its place is given a great deal of latitude in fashioning an appropriate sanction.mapother mapother cooper in re downs,cir.t he court sanction,therefore,should not be disturbed unless a clear abuse of discretion is found.id.
no abuse of discretion occurred here.because the code permits only reasonable compensation and because that requirement necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of those for whom the claimant purported to act,wolf,at,a fiduciary may not receive compensation for services tainted by disloyalty or conflict of interest,id.at.absent peculiar and unique circumstances,we thus have held,a court must deny all compensation when a party is not disinterested at the time of appointment.see michel,at holding that the debtor financial the code required to be not disinterested,was not validly appointed,and therefore was not entitled to compensation,even though the financial advisor had fully disclosed its interest at the outset and even though the bankruptcy court had approved the appointment.
that schilling breached these duties at some point after his appointment does not change matters.in in re downs we held that a bankruptcy court abused its discretion by allowing a party to retain fees who had exhibited a willful disregard of rule and of requiring a debtor attorney to report compensation arrangements and who did so after an appointment.at.the authority to decline all fees,we concluded,is inherent,and in the face of such infractions should be wielded forcefully.id.at.section and rule are fundamentally rooted in the fiduciary relationship between attorneys and the courts,and the fulfillment of the duties imposed under these provisions are crucial to the administration and disposition of proceedings before the bankruptcy courts.id.at.while in re downs did not involve a simple technical breach of rule attorney there acted affirmatively to conceal his fee arrangement and misled the trustee and other creditors,id.at does this case.see gray english,cir w hen a fiduciary loses his disinterested status during the course of administering a bankrupt estate the court should lean strongly toward denial of fees,and if the past benefit to the wrongdoer can be quantified,to require disgorgement of compensation previously paid that fiduciary even before the conflict arose.this approach is most in keeping with common law fiduciary principles and best serves the deterrence purpose of the rule.
what is true of schilling is also true of the law firm of baxter schilling,the sole member of which is baxter schilling.ja.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that,for these purposes,schilling and his counsel schilling were one and the same,and that schilling firm must also disgorge all fees.at.
no doubt the sanction in this case is a harsh and unforgiving one.schilling efforts,he claims,brought approximately million of new value into the estate.rather than the thanks of a grateful court and the thanks of grateful parties,he received an order to reimburse the debtor nearly million in fees.steep as the sanction may be,it represents the price of disloyalty,a price the courts have not hesitated to charge in dealing with similar breaches of trust.serving as an examiner,as with trusteeship,is serious business and is not to be undertaken lightly or so discharged.mosser,at.when it comes to loyalties and conflicts of interest,we do not ask whether harm has resulted,because the effect is often difficult to trace.id.at.where an actual conflict of interest exists,no more need be shown in this type of case to support a denial of compensation.woods,at.see mosser,at.e quity has sought to limit difficult and delicate tasks concerning its own trustee by precluding such transactions for the reason that their effect is often difficult to trace,and the prohibition is not merely against injuring the is against profiting out of the position of trust.ross kirschenbaum in re beck,cir courts do not take kindly to arguments by fiduciaries who have breached their obligations that,if they had not done this,everything would have been the same.friendly.
nor are examiners and trustees without recourse when these issues arise in the course of a bankruptcy.mosser advice on the point remains as sound today as it was a ago seek instructions from the court,given upon notice to creditors and interested parties.id.at.when,for whatever reason,an examiner sees a legitimate need to serve some masters rather than others in a bankruptcy,and above all when one of the preferred masters is himself,the necessary condition for proceeding is full disclosure and court permission.schilling instead chose secrecy and deception,a choice that properly cost him his fees.
schilling makes several contentions to the contrary,all of which amount to variations on a few points and none of which is persuasive.
first and foremost,schilling argues that merely negotiating a fee arrangement with creditors does not make an examiner improperly interested or disloyal.appellant br.at reply br.at.saving for later the question whether this argument has a mistaken factual until july schilling merely negotiated with the three creditors and had not reached any fee disagree with its legal premise.
as the district court properly concluded,the law does not allow a fiduciary to engage in secret and negotiations so long as the parties stop short of a formal agreement.at.an examiner violates the duty to remain disinterested and loyal no less by negotiating a fee in secrecy than by reaching a formal but secret agreement because the risks of partiality in each setting are equally grave,as this case well proves.
schilling conduct during the negotiations illustrates the point.when schilling proposed a fee arrangement in secret to bank of new york,mapco and chase at the fall washington conference,he threatened that he would not perform his mediation duties without such a deal.when a chase representative denied that a deal existed,he accused chase of not being an honest broker.in january schilling sent letters to bank of new york,mapco and of the estate to whom he owed a duty of that each of them had agreed at the washington conference to pay him a percentage of their recovery.in an august letter to mapco,schilling continued to insist that he and the three creditors had reached a compensation agreement at the washington conference.schilling later claimed,at a september court hearing,that he never said there was a side agreement with mapco,at,which led two of the creditors to disclose the january letters.upon disclosure of the letters,schilling changed his story again,claiming that what he had asserted in the january letters was intentionally untrue a common tactic used in negotiations,schilling explained,is to make a statement,as if it were fact,even though the statement is incorrect and is known to be incorrect.the examiner used this common place tactic in his january,letters asserting,as a fact,that an agreement had been reached at the washington settlement conference.model rules of prof l conduct in the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person.on this record,schilling can not tenably show that his conduct during the negotiations was any more consistent with his duties of disinterest and loyalty than a formal compensation agreement would have been.
the core problem with schilling contrary position is his apparent view that he was just another party seeking to maximize his personal recovery,failing to realize that many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm length,are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties.meinhard,at.as every law student learns,fiduciaries are held to something stricter than the morals of the market place,a principle that appropriately applies to the sensitive duties of trustees and examiners.whether or not other parties were permitted to negotiate in secret or to mislead each other in pursuit of a larger recovery,and whether or not schilling was permitted to negotiate in secret for the estate gain or to mislead the estate creditors for the estate gain,schilling had no right to negotiate in secret or to mislead the estates creditors for his own gain.
nor is schilling correct in arguing that this overlooks a of the code,which provides that a court may not confirm a plan of reorganization unless a ny payment made or to be made by the proponent,by the debtor,or by a person acquiring property under the plan,for services or for costs and expenses in or in connection with the case has been approved by,or is subject to the approval of,the court as reasonable.it is true that this section makes most fees incurred in a chapter case subject to court approval.and it is true that this section refers to court approval of fees that in some instances may be paid directly by creditors,indicating that creditors like bank of new york,chase and mapco may pay professionals fees themselves including,to use one obvious example,their own professionals fees.yet a does not,as schilling argues,authorize an examiner to negotiate an agreement to share in a creditor recovery so long as the agreement is ultimately subject to court approval.the provision by no means eliminates the examiner duty to remain loyally disinterested and to comply with pertinent disclosure requirements at each stage of the case.
neither leiman guttman,nor mabey southwestern power in re cajun power,cir,comes to a different conclusion.leiman stands for the general proposition that a bankruptcy court must approve all fee arrangements provided for in a plan of reorganization before confirming the plan.at.and in re cajun held that a
