the court entered summary judgment for respondents.the court found appellant had acted as a real estate broker when working on the little exuma project.see bus,discussed below.the court pointed,however,to appellant lack of evidence that jane venturi unnamed broker had employed or authorized her to work on the project.hence,appellant did not present a triable issue of fact that it was a licensed real estate broker entitled to compensation.the court entered judgment for respondents but denied respondents request for attorney fees.this appeal and respondents for attorneys fees followed.
