robert amico robert and richard amico appeal from judgments of conviction in the united states district court for the western district of new york siragusa,on charges arising from a mortgage fraud scheme.robert was convicted of a variety of financial crimes,including mail fraud,tax evasion,and conspiracy.his brother richard was convicted on one count each of mail fraud,tax evasion,and conspiracy.during proceedings before the district court,as well as on appeal,the amicos contend,principally,that the district judge should have recused himself because his handling of,and reaction to,his prior dealings with the government main cooperating witness concerning a mortgage application for the judge created an appearance of partiality.we conclude that they are correct,and that recusal was required.see a.accordingly,the judgments of conviction are vacated.
this appeal deals exclusively with the appearance of partiality.nothing we say should be understood to to the district judge engaged in misconduct concerning the application.this appeal centers around the issue of recusal,a small facet of the proceedings below.our need to discuss the issue in some detail should not obscure the fact that,during a long and complicated case,the district judge addressed the many other issues and problems presented to him with considerable skill and professionalism.but we do find that,as problems surrounding the application evolved,an appearance of partiality arose that made it inappropriate for him to continue to preside.see chase manhattan bank affiliated fm ins,cir.
in addition to recusal,several other issues are raised.since further proceedings will be required,we address only those issues calling for guidance on remand.they are whether the judge improperly failed to require the recording of sidebar discussions and chambers conferences whether statements made by robert to his probation officer in a prior case should have been suppressed whether the fraud charge was adequate and whether there was sufficient evidence to convict richard of mail fraud.
background 
in december,the amico brothers,their father,robert amico robert,patrick mcnamara,and others were charged in a multiple count indictment with conspiracy to defraud banks and private mortgage lenders by falsifying loan applications and misrepresenting the value of properties offered as collateral.the indictment also alleged that the defendants submitted false information on loan applications for borrowers,including themselves.the government alleged that patrick mcnamara,a mortgage broker,and robert,a builder,were the driving forces behind the scheme,which originated around.during the course of the scheme,mortgages were obtained from various lenders on more than homes based on false documentation.in many cases,the mortgage amounts were greater than the value of the properties being purchased.some of the purchasers were apparently willing participants in the fraud,while others did not know that false information had been submitted on their behalf.at trial,richard main defense was that he was not involved in the scheme and that he too had been mislead by mcnamara,who typically prepared false documents without richard knowledge.
in january,mcnamara entered into a plea agreement and agreed to cooperate,to fully disclose his criminal activity,and to testify.because of his prominent role in the fraud,his cooperation and testimony were central to the government case.trial commenced on november,on march,the jury convicted robert of one count of engaging in a continuing financial crimes enterprise in violation of one count of conspiracy to commit bank and mortgage fraud in violation of four counts of mortgage fraud in violation of and sixteen counts of mail fraud in violation of.richard was convicted of one count of mail fraud in violation of and one count of conspiracy to commit bank and mortgage fraud in violation of.in addition,robert and richard each pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion in violation of,and the remaining tax counts were dismissed.
the recusal issue arose from allegations by mcnamara that he had helped prepare a fraudulent application in the beginning of his scheme with the judge siragusa,who was then the first assistant monroe county district attorney.because the appearance of partiality stems from a cumulative series of events over a number of months,we review them in some detail.this review is complicated by the fact that during proceedings,as well as during the trial itself,numerous chambers and side bar conferences were not recorded.
the issue first surfaced on january,when the government wrote the judge and defense counsel that during a debriefing,patrick mcnamara advised the government that he believes he assisted your honor in obtaining a mortgage loan in the late years before he met robert amico.mcnamara claim was addressed the next day,first in an unrecorded chambers conference and then in open court.richard attorney,peter jacobson who does not represent richard on this appeal stated that,while he was not suggesting any impropriety on the judge part,he believed that mcnamara had falsified documents on numerous occasions without the borrower consent and may have done so with the judge mortgage application.the judge volunteered that the property he purchased was worth more than the loan he had obtained and,consequently,any examination of mcnamara on this loan would be irrelevant because the loans underlying the indictment involved inflated appraisals.the judge explained that he had no recollection of meeting mcnamara,and assured the parties that this will in no way affect the judge ability to sit on the case.the judge concluded that,given the absence of evidence of any real conflict,r ight now there nothing to consider.
one week later,on january,counsel met with the judge in an unrecorded chambers conference.although the precise exchange is disputed by the parties,the government informed the court that mcnamara had changed his story.he was now claiming that in he had submitted a mortgage application on behalf of the judge which may have falsely indicated that the judge was married,when he was separated at the fact that could have influenced his creditworthiness.during the conference,the judge called home and had a letter contained in his old divorce file faxed to chambers.the letter was sent to gold post mortgage robert mcnamara employer at the time of the application,apparently accompanied by a copy of the judge separation agreement,demonstrating that the broker was aware of his marital status.in view of the contents of the letter,the judge concluded mcnamara allegations were not an issue.
one week after this conference,the government wrote the court indicating that mcnamara had changed his version of the events yet again.mcnamara now stated that he was certain that he did not say that the judge was married on the application.in addition,the letter reminded the court that in the unrecorded january conference,the government had disclosed that mcnamara had told the government that while in detention between december and january,mcnamara had discussed the judge application with robert.the government requested that defense counsel be precluded from questioning mcnamara at trial about the judge application.
on april,jacobson submitted a proposed subpoena to the court requiring key bank of new york,the lender to which gold post had forwarded the judge application,to turn over its files relating to the judge mortgage.in response,the court informed jacobson in an telephone conversation that the subpoena was too broad given the confidential nature of the information that could be disclosed.
the subpoena issue resurfaced at an unrecorded chambers conference on september.jacobson told the judge that he would be subpoenaing the judge entire mortgage file in an effort to ascertain whether mcnamara had falsified the judge application.by this time it was apparent that jacobson was intent on pursuing this issue for the ostensible purpose of showing that mcnamara had devised the scheme underlying the indictment prior to,and independently of,the amicos involvement.although the record is unavailable,apparently jacobson also raised the possibility of reassigning the case.later,on the record,the judge expressed his disapproval of jacobson intention to subpoena the mortgage file and cautioned him that no basis existed for recusal.
on october,the court learned during a pretrial hearing that robert also may have been privy to information regarding the judge loan,well before the court was informed.at that time,a witness testified that robert had stated to her on the day that he was arraigned that the judge had purchased homes through pat mcnamara and they had a plan to go public with it,to get rid of that particular judge.
after learning from the marshals that they had a subpoena for him,the judge retrieved certain files from the lender attorney relating to the mortgage application.that file contained a number of documents concerning mcnamara allegations and the judge responses to them.of principal importance,the file included two conflicting,an unsigned,undated,and typed mortgage application prepared on the judge behalf by gold post,and the other,a copy of the judge march separation agreement.the unsigned mortgage application contained a number of apparent misrepresentations,including i listing the judge marital status as married rather than separated ii stating that the purchase will be for a tenancy by the entirety,whereas the judge title was actually a fee simple iii listing his marital home as his residence,as opposed to his residence and iv valuing his net worth by attributing to it the equity in the marital home.the application indicates through a checked box that the information was taken during a interview.the file also contained two documents that imply that the unsigned loan application may never have been signed or sent to the lender one,a letter to gold post mortgage,verifying that the judge had sent them a copy of his separation agreement and two,a note stating that the lender would require a copy of the last page of the judge separation agreement.
on october,the judge held a hearing concerning the content of the files.he noted that the married as opposed to the separated box had been checked on the unsigned application,as well as answers indicating that he had no alimony or support obligations.he allowed counsel to inspect,but,because of security considerations,not copy,the documents.the case had been garnering considerable media attention,and the judge also noted that jacobson had been improperly telling the press that an appearance of partiality existed.
on october,one week after viewing the mortgage files,the government wrote to the court,indicating that mcnamara had again changed his story.this time,the government wrote that it 
anticipates that if asked questions regarding this issue at trial,mcnamara would testify that it is his recollection that while working as a loan officer for goldpost mortgage,he created a handwritten loan application during his meeting with your honor at your office he believes that he indicated on the handwritten application that your honor was married not separated,after discussing the issue of your marital status.he recollects explaining that if separated was marked,the lender would require a copy of a separation agreement.he would further testify that he believes your honor signed the application 
the government went on to write that if defense counsel were to mcnamara and bring up the alleged false loan application,it was possible that the judge could be called as a witness at trial.the government would therefore be filing a motion in limine to exclude any questioning of mcnamara regarding the loan.the government letter also stated that,were the defense to question mcnamara regarding his conversation with robert about the loan,this may create an appearance of a conflict of interest.
on october,the parties assembled in court to address,in the judge words,the specter of conflict created by the information that had been disclosed.the judge went through a detailed chronology of the events involving mcnamara that had unfolded.he also projected a number of his personal documents onto a screen for the purpose of demonstrating that his mortgage agreement with gold post indicated that the closing could not be scheduled until the company had received his separation papers.
the judge expressed his displeasure at the manner in which the government had handled an obviously delicate situation it offends me that the united states attorney office is using a witness who it anticipates is lying.he instructed the government to do some before putting mcnamara on the stand.he stated that,i trying to keep calm,but it hard for me not to get a little emotional,as whenever anybody integrity is challenged,and mentioned that he had spent sleepless nights thinking about the issue.the judge concluded that,based on the evidence that he presented refuting mcnamara claim,there was no need to recuse himself.
that same day,robert counsel orally moved to preclude the testimony of mcnamara.the government opposed the motion in writing,contending that his testimony was critical since he was the only eyewitness to the entire mortgage fraud scheme and the only key player not on trial.the government conceded that mcnamara was at best,mistaken about the judge application and acknowledged that the facts do not support mcnamara recollection of the events,but stated that it did not believe that he would perjure himself if called to testify.the government once again asked that the defense be precluded from questioning mcnamara about the judge mortgage,contending that because mcnamara had falsified hundreds of loans in the past,such testimony would be,among other things,cumulative.
less than two weeks before the scheduled trial date,the defendants formally moved for recusal on the grounds that there was an appearance of partiality and that it was likely that the judge would be called as a material witness.see a,b iv.two days later,having been instructed by the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division to either join the recusal motion or make its own motion,the government joined as to a.
at a hearing on november on the recusal motion,the judge voiced his displeasure at this turn of events,and accused the government of being disingenuous for joining the defendants motion.the judge denied the,orally,and later in a written the grounds that the motion was untimely and,in any event,without merit.according to the court,it was untimely because robert would have known as early as december that mcnamara was planning to allege that he had falsified the judge loans,and because in january,the government informed the court that mcnamara was claiming that he had helped the judge prepare his loan application.in the alternative,the judge found the recusal motion to be without merit.he again went through a detailed chronology of when he was informed of mcnamara allegations and how he responded.the judge stressed that it as much my obligation to stay on this case if i should,as it is to get off it if i should.he concluded,a reasonable person,knowing all the facts,would conclude that this trial judge impartiality could not reasonably be questioned more damage to the justice system would be done by this court recusing itself.
on november,jacobson submitted a petition for an emergency stay and a writ of mandamus from this court,asking us to compel recusal.in response,the judge,through his law clerk,opposed the petition,highlighting the extent to which the judge believed the petition was inaccurate,incorrect,misleading,or incomplete.on november,we denied the motion.
the controversy surrounding mcnamara allegations continued into the trial,which began on november.before mcnamara testified,the government asked once more that defense counsel be precluded from mcnamara about the judge loan application.two lengthy court sessions were spent analyzing the chronology of events in which the judge learned about mcnamara accusations and their relationship to mcnamara testimony.the judge deferred his ruling on the government request until mcnamara direct examination had been completed.
on the morning that of mcnamara was to begin,the court announced its position on the testimony 
i will point out that with respect to the unsigned mortgage application,it was not secured by subpoena it was secured by the court.the court obtained it at its own initiative,and the fact remains,and it should be pointed out,that the subpoena served by the defense yielded absolutely nothing.so but for the court attempt to really try to put this all out on the table and the court attempt to equally guard the rights of the defendant,we be back where we were at when i produced the letter the issue is not whether something was done wrong or not,because i think the court has established without any doubt that the lender was fully apprised of the court marital status through the court initiative well before closing and well before the commitment letter.that not the issue.the issue is did mcnamara act in accordance with the cooperation agreement.
the judge then permitted defense counsel to mcnamara regarding the application to the extent that it related to the requirements of his plea agreement.the judge instructed mcnamara to refer to him as an anonymous judicial officer rather than by name.
mcnamara testified before the jury for nearly a month,and things did not go smoothly.during extended discussions and lengthy submissions over a variety of topics,including the judge loan application,the judge pointed counsel to specific instances in which it appeared that mcnamara testimony concerning the loan was inconsistent with the government letters to the court,and questioned mcnamara himself.the judge suggested on more than one occasion that defense counsel might make a perjury motion regarding mcnamara testimony,but counsel elected to wait until the testimony concluded.the judge,on his own initiative,did some research on perjury.ultimately,he concluded that mcnamara was testifying falsely.
on the final day of,defense counsel moved for a mistrial.this motion resulted in an extended discussion over the course of two days between the judge and counsel,in which the judge evaluated whether mcnamara had committed perjury,and,if so,what the appropriate remedy should be.the government took the position that it did not concede that mcnamara had committed perjury but that,if the court were to find that he did,the appropriate remedy would be a curative instruction rather than a mistrial.the discussion understandably became animated 
the government you know what we getting to,your honor we getting to the fact that i on trial here,and i been on trial here for a year now.
the court excuse me.guess what,the court was on trial,too and that not the issue.
on january,the judge ruled that mcnamara had committed perjury in his testimony regarding the judge loan,and that the government should have known that false testimony would be adduced.the judge denied the motion for a mistrial,but decided that the jury should be instructed as a matter of fact that mcnamara had committed perjury.the judge instructed the jury at the conclusion of mcnamara testimony and at the end of the trial that he had perjured himself concerning the transaction with a judicial officer,as well as an unrelated incident in which he claimed to have observed richard give a check to an attorney at a closing.the court further instructed the jury that they were free,but not required,to reject mcnamara entire testimony or to decide how much of his testimony to believe.
on april,the jury convicted robert on all counts,and convicted richard of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud,but acquitted him on all other charges.robert was sentenced to months and richard was sentenced to months incarceration both sentences were at the top of the then mandatory guidelines ranges.robert and richard were each ordered to make restitution of more than million and to forfeit more than million.judge siragusa declined to sentence mcnamara and referred the sentencing to the michael telesca,who sentenced mcnamara to months,which included an substantial assistance departure.
this appeal followed.we vacate the convictions and remand for further proceedings.

iv is to the judge knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.
on appeal,the amico brothers renew their contention that recusal was required under a and b iv we review the denial of a motion under a for abuse of discretion.see united states diaz,cir in re certain underwriter,cir.
timeliness 
we turn first to the district court finding that the november,motion for recusal was untimely.to ensure that a party does not hedg e its bets against the eventual outcome of a proceeding,a party must move for recusal at the earliest possible moment after obtaining knowledge of facts demonstrating the basis for such a claim.apple jewish hosp.medical center,cir.when evaluating timeliness,we look to four factors whether the movant has participated in a substantial manner in trial or proceedings granting the motion would represent a waste of judicial resources the motion was made after the entry of judgment and the movant can demonstrate good cause for delay.id.at internal citations omitted.
the judge found that the defendants had not raised recusal sufficiently early,since,in his view t he record clearly indicates the defense was aware of mcnamara accusation almost two years before making its recusal motion.the judge relied on affidavits of robert and the late robert asserting that,while in detention,mcnamara told them that he had falsified the judge application.this conversation would necessarily have taken place before mcnamara release on january.it was a year later,on january,that the government told the court and defense counsel that mcnamara was claiming that he had helped the judge falsify documents,and it was not until october,that the government first told the court that mcnamara was accusing the judge of knowingly filing a false mortgage application.
based on our review of the record,we conclude that the district judge abused his discretion when he found that the recusal motion was untimely.first,we are hard pressed to see how on the basis of the january conversation alone defense counsel could have documented an appearance of partiality.the record reflects that,as of that time,all defense counsel would have known is what mcnamara had allegedly said while in detention.neither robert nor the court would have known whether mcnamara was telling the truth regarding the existence of the mortgage application or his intention to accuse the judge.these facts created no basis for requesting reassignment based on an appearance of partiality under a,let alone of any actual conflict under b.a motion for recusal at that point would have had little substance and would have risked antagonizing the judge.as we explain below,our finding of the appearance of partiality is based not simply on mcnamara accusations,but on the judge efforts over a number of months to deal with the escalating impact of those accusations.
a more substantial question is whether the defendants should have moved for recusal in january,when the government first disclosed that mcnamara claimed to have falsified the judge loan application.a recusal motion at this point in time would have been problematic because mcnamara had not yet accused the judge of knowingly filing a false loan application,and the months of highly charged court proceedings were just beginning.the fact that mcnamara was claiming that he had falsified one loan application on behalf of the judge is not especially significant given that mcnamara had falsified hundreds of applications in the past and the judge did not remember having dealt with mcnamara.indeed,the judge noted himself that by january mcnamara accusations against him constituted a dead issue.
the fact that jacobson subpoenaed the judge loan application between january and october does not demonstrate that there was evidence to support recusal at the time,but,at best,that the parties were aggressively investigating the issue.the calculus changed on october,when the judge allowed counsel to inspect his mortgage file in chambers,and changed even more when,on october,the government wrote the court that mcnamara had changed his story and was accusing the judge of knowingly filing a false mortgage application.it was also on october that the government first requested that the court limit the of mcnamara in light of the prospect that defense counsel would attempt to call the judge as a witness.
regardless of the truth of mcnamara statements,once he told the government that the application was prepared with the judge acquiescence and the defense announced that mcnamara testimony was important to show behavior that predated the conspiracy,the judge was presented with a new set of alternatives,all unpalatable.if he precluded the testimony,he exposed himself to accusations that his ruling was motivated by.if he admitted the testimony,he exposed himself to an accusation that placed in possible jeopardy his ability to continue to preside.
while we do not gainsay the difficulties of the choices facing the judge,we nonetheless conclude that he incorrectly weighed the four apple factors in holding that the defendants should have filed the recusal motion in january.see at.while the motion was filed after two years of pretrial proceedings and just weeks before trial,the record reflects that from the first time that the government informed the court that mcnamara claimed to have helped the judge falsify a loan,the issue was discussed at nearly every pretrial court appearance and often brought up by the judge sua sponte.it was only when the government informed the court and the defendants that mcnamara was claiming that the judge had knowingly falsified his loan application that the defense moved for recusal and was joined by the government.
accordingly,while the first two apple substantial participation of the movant in proceedings and the waste of judicial untimeliness,the third factor,the absence of a final judgment before the motion was filed,leans in the defendants favor.more importantly,a t the crux of the balancing is the fourth factor,whether the movants can demonstrate good cause for delay.united states brinkworth,cir.since this pivotal factor weighs decisively in favor of the defendants,we conclude that the district judge abused his discretion in determining under the apple test that the recusal motion was untimely.
ii.the merits 
section a requires that a judge recuse himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.liljeberg health serv.acquisition,d quoting a.while we credit the judge explanation of what transpired with regard to his mortgage application,this test deals exclusively with appearances.its purpose is the protection of the public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary 
consequently,we are not primarily concerned with whether the allegations with respect to the mortgage application are true.instead,our central focus is on whether those allegations,when coupled with the judge rulings on and conduct regarding them,would lead the public reasonably to believe that these problems affected the manner in which he presided.in other words,we ask w ould a reasonable person,knowing all the facts,conclude that the trial judge impartiality could reasonably be questioned or,phrased differently,would an objective,disinterested observer fully informed of the underlying facts,entertain significant doubt that justice would be done absent recusal united states lovaglia,cir internal citations omitted we believe that such a disinterested observer would entertain those doubts.
here,we find that an appearance of partiality arose from the cumulative effect of the judge reactions to the various problems surrounding the application.mcnamara accusations suggested that when the judge applied for a loan in the,there was a relationship of some sort between the judge and mcnamara former employer,gold post mortgage.in addition,the unsigned,unfiled loan application appeared to have a number of misrepresentations.a disinterested observer might conclude that the judge was obligated to address these allegations and to put them to rest.at the same time,such an observer could form the impression that the judge handling of these issues was intended to protect his own reputation,perhaps by discrediting mcnamara.
mcnamara was the government key witness and his accusations regarding the judge involved the same type of behavior for which the amicos were on trial.a disinterested observer would have perceived this,and would also have seen that the judge repeatedly raised the subject of mcnamara accusations sua sponte,conducted discovery on his own initiative,and in lengthy pretrial sessions dedicated to this issue,marshaled the evidence that he had discovered.a disinterested observer would have discerned on occasion a defensive or perhaps even hostile approach by the judge when addressing the accusations against him,calling them,for example,upsetting and offending.such a disinterested observer would also have viewed with concern the judge efforts to dissuade the government from calling mcnamara.it could have appeared to the observer that the judge had knowledge concerning potential evidence in the case and was permitting his concerns surrounding such knowledge to affect the way that he conducted proceedings.
other events might have caused a disinterested observer to question the judge impartiality.the disinterested observer would have noted that the government joined the defendants motions for very unusual development demonstrating that all parties were seriously concerned about the appearance of partiality.the observer would also have seen the judge take pains to explain to the parties his lack of bias in making evidentiary decisions,yet repeatedly attempt to persuade defense counsel to move for a finding of perjury.the observer would have seen the judge chastise the government for its actions in relation to mcnamara,conclude that he had committed perjury,and instruct the jury sua sponte about perjury.the observer would have further noted that the judge recused himself from the sentencing of mcnamara,and sentenced the amico brothers to the top of their guidelines ranges.finally,we note that federal rule of appellate procedure b permits a district court,whose decision is the subject of a petition for a writ of mandamus to the court of appeals,to request to be invited to respond.but the rule makes clear that it may not do so unless invited or ordered to do so by the court of appeals.fed.b.in this case,it would have appeared to the disinterested observer that the judge response to the defendants petition for was made through his law clerk without such an invitation or the rule and unnecessarily injected the district court into the appellate process.in isolation,each of these decisions might have been reasonable or defensible.casting no aspersions on the district judge,we believe that,in the aggregate,they would lead a disinterested observer to conclude that the appearance of partiality existed 
iii.remedy 
section does not specify any particular remedy,as congress has wisely delegated to the judiciary the task of fashioning the remedies that will best serve the purpose of the legislation.liljeberg,at.in liljeberg,the supreme court held in the context of a rule b motion that in determining how best to address a violation of a,three factors are considered i the risk of injustice to the parties in the particular case ii the risk that the denial of relief will produce injustic
