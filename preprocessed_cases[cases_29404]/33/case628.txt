a lawyer represents a client under a fee agreement that does not contain an arbitration clause.as sometimes occurs these days,the lawyer changes firms in the middle of the litigation.the client signs a new engagement and fee agreement that includes an arbitration clause set forth in understandable terms.is it the client responsibility to read the fee agreement,or does the scope of the lawyer fiduciary duty require the lawyer to separately explain the arbitration clause to the client,so that the client admitted failure to fully read the agreement is reasonable and a basis to avoid arbitration under the circumstances of this case,involving clients who are sophisticated businesspersons,we conclude there was no duty to separately explain the arbitration clause.
petitioners desert outdoor advertising doa,a nevada corporation,and paul jurich are the plaintiffs in a professional negligence action against real parties in interest gerald murphy and his law firm,luce,forward,hamilton and scripps,llp luce forward.real parties filed a petition to compel arbitration,which the trial court granted.petitioners seek a writ of mandate to set aside the order compelling arbitration.for the reasons set forth below,we deny writ relief.
the material facts are set forth in declarations and are essentially undisputed,except where noted 
in late or early,bahram farahi,doa president,retained murphy regarding a dispute with the city of oakland over the installation of a billboard.at the time,murphy was a partner with the law firm of jacobs,spotswood,casper murphy,llp jacobs spotswood.
on may,farahi and petitioner jurich signed a written fee agreement with murphy and jacobs spotswood concerning an action brought by the city of oakland against doa and jurich in alameda county superior court the fee agreement was three pages long and did not include an arbitration clause.murphy proceeded to represent petitioners in the alameda county action,as well as a related federal action filed by petitioners against the city of oakland in the united states district court for the northern district of california.
in january,murphy wrote farahi and jurich,told them he was moving his law practice to luce forward,and enclosed a new engagement and fee agreement.the new engagement and fee agreement,dated january,was seven pages long and contained an arbitration clause.the clause,set forth in a separate paragraph on page four,at the conclusion of a lengthy section regarding statements for fees and costs,provided in the event of any dispute over the amounts due,any collection action by us,or any other dispute of any kind whatsoever between us,including without limitation,dissatisfaction with the services provided to you or your belief that the firm has engaged in malpractice,you hereby agree to submit to binding arbitration in san francisco,california pursuant to the rules of and before jams,or,in the event that the law requires otherwise as to fee disputes,before and in accordance with the rules of the bar association of san francisco.you further agree to pay our costs of collection,including actual attorneys fees and costs,including expert fees,involved in obtaining amounts due us.you are aware and acknowledge that this agreement for binding arbitration constitutes a waiver on your part of any right to initiate a court proceeding with respect to any dispute in connection with this agreement or the services provided hereunder and that,as a part of such waiver,you are waiving your right to a trial by jury.
on page five of the fee agreement,at the conclusion of the section entitled conflict waiver,the agreement stated you have the right to seek the independent advice of your own counsel prior to executing this document and i recommend that you do so.
murphy also sent the new agreement to jeff herson,doa ceo,and alan herson,an attorney who represented doa in the federal litigation 
jurich signed the new agreement on january.farahi signed it on february.
the state and federal litigation was resolved adversely to petitioners.in the state action,the city of oakland obtained an injunction requiring petitioners to remove the billboard because it violated the oakland municipal code,and also obtained a ruling that petitioners had engaged in unlawful business practices.for the latter,the trial court awarded the city of oakland statutory penalties,disgorgement of profits,and attorneys fees.we upheld these rulings.city of oakland jurich et,nonpub.opn.in the federal litigation,in which petitioners alleged the applicable portion of the oakland municipal code was unconstitutional,petitioners lost both in the trial court and on appeal.see desert outdoor advertising city of oakland cir.
on march,petitioners filed a complaint against murphy and luce forward alleging professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duties 
on april,invoking the arbitration clause of the luce forward fee agreement,murphy and luce forward petitioned to compel arbitration.
petitioners opposed the petition.they argued the arbitration clause was buried in the last paragraph of the section of the fee agreement entitled statements.they also argued murphy had committed constructive fraud by breaching fiduciary duties toward petitioners by not separately disclosing there was an arbitration clause in the luce forward fee agreement,when there had not been one in the jacobs spotswood fee agreement.
farahi submitted a declaration in support of the opposition in which he stated he informed murphy of various health problems in,including mantle cell lymphoma,thyroid cancer,and depression.in january he told murphy he was seeing a psychiatrist.farahi declared he did not read the letter fee agreement dated january,carefully before i signed it.despite the fact the agreement was twice as long as the first one,farahi declared when i signed the letter fee agreement i thought that it was the same agreement that i had signed before,but that murphy merely had changed law firms.farahi stated he wanted to continue having murphy as his lawyer,and only signed the agreement with luce forward because that was where murphy was working.
farahi further stated murphy did not tell me that the new fee agreement had any terms that differed from the old one.finally,farahi declared i did not realize that there was a provision for arbitration of any malpractice claims that doa might have until doa had begun to consider the malpractice claims against the defendants.because there had been no arbitration provision in the earlier agreement with murphy while he was with jacobs,spotswood,i would have objected to a change of terms in the agreement that would have prevented a jury trial.
jurich also submitted a declaration in which he stated he was only named as a defendant in the state action because he leased the billboard space to doa and personally had little to do with the case.he stated that when murphy moved to luce forward he did not want to change lawyers.when i received the new fee agreement from murphy,i thought that the only thing involved was the change in firms.
like farahi,jurich did not read the letter agreement dated january,carefully before i signed it,jurich said he did not carefully read the agreement because he had no idea that there were any changes in the legal arrangement with murphy.jurich declared murphy did not tell him that there was a change in the terms of his representing me,in the sense that any disputes between us had to be handled in arbitration.however,despite his claim that he did not carefully read the fee agreement,jurich made a correction on page five the page after the arbitration clause.jurich corrected the oakland street address of the billboard location,changing street to street.
alan herson submitted a declaration in which he stated he did not read the new fee agreement because it contained too many pages and he had no reason to believe it meant anything more than murphy changing law firms.jeff herson,the ceo of doa,did not submit a declaration in opposition to the petition to compel arbitration.
murphy submitted a supplemental declaration in which he stated he never told farahi or jurich the new luce forward fee agreement was identical to the jacob spotswood fee agreement,and noting the new agreement encouraged farahi and jurich to seek the advice of independent counsel.
the trial court granted the petition to compel arbitration,ruling that california law expresses a clear public policy in favor of the enforceability of arbitration provisions within contracts,including attorney retainer agreements with clients.
petitioners sought a writ of mandate to set aside the trial court ruling.on august,we summarily denied the petition.on october,the california supreme court granted review and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to vacate our order denying the petition and to issue an order to show cause.we complied.real parties filed a return to the order to show cause and we have heard oral argument.
ii.discussion 
the supreme court transfer order does not mean petitioners are correct on the merits or that a writ should issue,but rather we should reconsider the matter and file an opinion.we may reach the same result as we did upon our first consideration of the case,and we do so now.see gressett superior court th,fn.turner superior court th,fn.on the facts of this case,petitioners can not avoid arbitration due to their asserted failure to carefully read the new fee agreement.

a cardinal rule of contract law is that a party failure to read a contract,or to carefully read a contract,before signing it is no defense to the contract enforcement.see,powers dickson,carlson campillo th,powers izzi mesquite country club d.to make out a claim of fraud in the execution,parties seeking to avoid arbitration must show their apparent assent to the contracts their signatures on the client agreements is negated by fraud so fundamental that they were deceived as to the basic character of the documents they signed and had no reasonable opportunity to learn the truth.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,rosenthal.accordingly,a necessary element of the defense of fraud in the execution is reasonable reliance,and g enerally,it is not reasonable to fail to read a contract this is true even if the plaintiff relied on the defendant assertion that it was not necessary to read the contract.brown wells fargo bank,th,brown.
thus,under a substantial evidence standard of review,petitioners are bound by the luce forward fee agreement because they signed it,and regardless of whether they failed to carefully read it or,in jurich case,read it carefully enough to make a minor correction on a page after the page containing the arbitration clause.petitioners claim an exception from this principle by attempting to fashion a claim of constructive fraud based on a supposed violation by murphy of his fiduciary duties by failing to personally explain the new agreement.
petitioners advance their claim of constructive fraud on a theoretical framework set forth in brown,supra,th at pages.in essence,petitioners claim the scope of murphy fiduciary duty included separately informing them of the arbitration clause in the new fee agreement.this could theoretically excuse petitioners from their failure to carefully read the agreement.brown,supra,at.however,this argument presupposes a duty which we do not find in this case for the following reasons.

petitioners claim murphy had a duty to separately disclose and explain the arbitration clause in the luce forward agreement based primarily on these facts he knew farahi was in ill health there was no arbitration clause in the jacobs spotswood fee agreement and the luce forward agreement introduced arbitration into the relationship between the parties for the first time.however,under the circumstances of this case,we do not agree that murphy had a duty to explain the arbitration clause that was clearly set forth in the fee agreement signed by the clients.
murphy clients were the president of a corporation for its prominence in the billboard industry,as well as another businessman.both clients were sent the new fee agreement,urged to read it,and encouraged to seek the advice of their own counsel before executing it.it strains credulity that farahi and jurich believed the new agreement was the same as the first one it was twice as long.farahi health issues aside,the agreement involved significant,litigation at the heart of farahi business.jurich read the new agreement carefully enough to make a correction.in addition,the ceo of doa and one of its attorneys also received the agreement.these were not unsophisticated people unschooled in the ways of litigation.nor was the agreement a contract of adhesion that was forced on them.the cover letter described a new retainer agreement with luce forward and explained that if the clients did not want to sign it murphy would prepare a substitution to allow doa corporate counsel to continue representing doa.
there is ample evidence supporting the trial court implicit determination that,in this case,the scope of murphy fiduciary duties did not include separately explaining the luce forward retainer agreement to doa and jurich.murphy cover letter made clear the luce forward retainer agreement was new.and there was simply no mistaking from the letter that it needed to be reviewed and approved.the cover letter even anticipated that petitioners might be unwilling to sign the new agreement,and stated arrangements would be made for new counsel if that was the case.the cover letter also showed copies of the new retainer agreement were sent to doa ceo,who was murphy primary contact during the litigation,as well as its corporate and litigation counsel.the signatories,farahi and jurich were knowledgeable business persons,and the new,luce forward retainer agreement was obviously substantially different from the old,jacobs spotswood agreement.while the arbitration provision was not preceded by a separate heading and not in a different font,it was set forth in a separate paragraph and all paragraphs were set off by double,double spacing and was in the same font as the rest of the agreement.in short,the arbitration provision was readily discernable and clear.there is no assertion of any effort to conceal the arbitration clause or any affirmative misrepresentations about it.thus,even taking into account farahi ill health,the circumstances here do not come close to those in rosenthal,wherein some of the plaintiffs made a showing sufficient to raise a triable issue that their failure to read the arbitration agreement was reasonable and,as to them,the scope of the defendant fiduciary duty was broader rosenthal,supra,cal th at.
petitioners expert,jerome fishkin,offered the opinion murphy was required to separately explain that the arbitration section constituted a significant change in the new attorney client fee agreement as contrasted to the previous one and explain the significant differences to the clients.fishkin indicated he agreed with the rationale of california compendium
