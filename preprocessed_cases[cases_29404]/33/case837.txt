factual and procedural summary 
we treat this case as an appeal on the judgment roll,since it reaches us based only on the clerk transcript.rubin los angeles fed.sav.loan d.because the case is presented in that posture,we presume that the trial court findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence,and its conclusions of law are binding upon us unless error appears on the face of the record.bond pulsar video productions th,d.except where otherwise indicated,the following facts are taken from the trial court findings of fact.
huskinson brown states that it is a law firm specializing in defense of health care providers.a client,beverly sanchez approached the firm with a potential medical malpractice case against a health care provider.rather than undertake the representation of this client in court,with the attendant risk of conflict of interest,the firm referred the matter to wolf.the two firms entered an oral agreement by which wolf would pay huskinson brown,as a referral fee,percent of any attorney fees wolf received from its work on the referred matter.
rule conditions a fee splitting agreement among counsel from different law firms upon written consent from the client.sanchez never consented in writing to the referral fee agreement.there was evidence that sanchez was informed of the arrangement before the case was referred to wolf,but no evidence that her consent to fee splitting was sought or given.huskinson brown alleges that wolf agreed to obtain her written consent.
wolf brought a suit on behalf of sanchez.that action ended with a judgment in sanchez favor for.we refer to this litigation as the sanchez lawsuit.huskinson brown alleges that wolf received attorney fees of from the proceeds of the judgment.
at some point before the case was referred to wolf,huskinson brown paid to rex greene,a medical expert involved in the sanchez lawsuit.huskinson brown spent approximately hours performing legal services in furtherance of the sanchez lawsuit,which the trial court valued at per hour.huskinson brown did not produce any records or invoices for these hours.
after the judgment was satisfied in the sanchez lawsuit,huskinson brown wrote twice to wolf asking for its percent share of the attorney fees and reimbursement of the in expenses.after receiving the second letter,wolf responded with a letter that acknowledged the debt but asked for time to pay it due to financial hardship.the trial court found that,at the time wolf received its attorney fees in the sanchez lawsuit,it had no intention of honoring its agreement to pay the referral fee.
after waiting seven months for payment,huskinson brown sued wolf to recover the referral fee.the second amended complaint,which is the operative pleading,sought recovery under the following causes of action breach of contract,breach of partnership,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,fraud,unfair business practices,monies owed,unjust enrichment,and quantum meruit.wolf demurred.the record does not contain the ruling on the demurrer,but we infer that it was overruled.
the matter was tried to the court.the court disallowed recovery for breach of contract because written consent had not been obtained from sanchez.the court did not allow recovery from fraud due to insufficiency of evidence,and it made no statement as to the third,fourth and sixth causes of action.the court awarded huskinson brown under the unjust enrichment cause of action in the alternative,the court awarded huskinson brown plus interest for monies owed and quantum meruit,including in attorney fees for the hours huskinson brown expended.
the judgment also awarded huskinson brown in prejudgment interest and in costs and disbursements.a nunc pro tunc correction to the judgment four months later eliminated the prejudgment interest award and reduced the costs and disbursements to.
wolf filed a timely appeal from the judgment 
discussion 
except between associates,partners,or fellow shareholders,an attorney may not divide a fee for legal services with another attorney unless a full disclosure of the arrangement has been made to the client and the client has consented to the arrangement in writing.rule a.although the attorneys agreed to share a legal fee in the sanchez lawsuit,no written consent from sanchez was obtained.wolf argues that the trial court erred in allowing huskinson brown to recover,under an unjust enrichment theory,the amount it would have been entitled to under the referral fee agreement.
wolf relies on margolin shemaria th,d,which held that where one attorney refers a case to another and the second agrees to obtain the client written consent to a referral fee under rule but fails to do so,the second attorney is not estopped from asserting noncompliance with the rule as a basis for avoiding payment of the referral fee.id.at,d.the margolin court held that even where an attorney is relying on his or her own failure to obtain written consent from the client to avoid paying a referral fee,that attorney is not sufficiently unjustly enriched by the retained referral fee to be estopped from asserting rule as a defense.the reason lies in the purpose for the rule to protect clients,not referring attorneys.the court also based its decision on the fact that the referring attorney could have obtained the written consent from the client.margolin,supra,at,d.
on analogous facts,the trial court in this case awarded damages on huskinson brown unjust enrichment theory.in its statement of decision,issued before margolin was decided,the court reasoned that the failure to obtain written consent did not harm the client because the referral fee did not result in higher attorney fees.the court found that wolf had agreed to pay a referral fee,and that wolf would be unjustly enriched by being allowed to enter into that agreement then denying its existence.the court stated that forfeiture of the fee by huskinson brown would be disproportionate to the illegality of the arrangement.
the trial court did not have the benefit of the reasoning in margolin to guide its decision.we see no basis for disagreement with the analysis of the relevant rules of law in margolin.huskinson brown is presumed to have been aware of the requirement under rule,and could have protected itself by obtaining written consent from sanchez.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.it was not reasonable for huskinson brown to rely on wolf promise to obtain sanchez written consent to the agreement.id.at,d.
huskinson brown would distinguish margolin from the present case because margolin was a pure referral case while in this case huskinson brown spent about hours on the matter margolin did not find one party more culpable than the other and in this case,unlike margolin,the referred firm acknowledged the referral fee in a letter to the referring firm.none of these facts requires a different result.
whether the referring attorney worked on the matter or not is irrelevant because the language of rule expressly prevents any fee division except between partners,associates,or shareholders without written consent of the client.rule a.as margolin points out,the purpose of the rule is consumer protection,not attorney protection.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.it is a prophylactic rule.the consumer is served by full disclosure and written consent whether the referring attorney performs no work or performs hours of work.
culpability is a factor courts consider in deciding whether to make an exception to the rule against enforcement of illegal contracts to avoid unjust enrichment other factors include the nature of the illegality and the policies to be served by enforcement or by denying enforcement.dunkin boskey th,d.as wolf points out,the issue of relative culpability was not discussed in margolin.here,the trial court decision may be understood to reflect a view that wolf was culpable because,though it promised to pay the referral fee,it did not intend to do so when it received the fees.the attorney in margolin who accepted the referred case also had agreed to pay a referral fee.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.we see no significant difference in culpability that would warrant an exception here but not in margolin.
the significant writing,missing in margolin as well as in this case,was one that would have fulfilled both the rule literal requirement and its consent signed by the client.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.the defendant attorney in margolin also wrote a letter agreeing to pay a referral fee,although that letter acknowledged the need for written client consent before the fee could be paid.id.at,d.that letter,though not an unconditional agreement to pay a referral fee,arguably served the consumer protection interest of the rule more closely than the letter here from wolf to huskinson brown because it was sent to the client,while here the letter was only from one attorney to the other.thus,to the degree the cases are distinguishable at all,the facts in margolin present a more appealing basis for disregarding the rule than is present in this case.in the end,the rule properly applies to both.
huskinson brown argues that it is discriminatory and unfair to deny recovery of a share of attorney fees under unjust enrichment or quantum meruit even though there is no written consent from the client as required by rule.huskinson brown fails to show why this rule is any more burdensome than any other requirement for a writing,such as civil code,section,which margolin analogizes to rule.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.
huskinson brown contends that rule is especially burdensome because of the harsh consequences it imposes in cases where no writing was obtained due to the dishonesty of an attorney,or when one is lost,stolen,damaged,or otherwise inadmissible the evidence code eliminates this burden by allowing the use of otherwise admissible secondary evidence to prove the content of a writing that has been lost or destroyed,or one that its proponent can not reasonably procure,subd.a,subds.b c.there is nothing in rule that prevents a party from proving the client written consent to fee sharing by such secondary evidence.
huskinson brown argues the trial court ruling should be upheld because courts enforce illegal contracts where the conduct of the parties is not equally wrong,if the violation does not involve serious moral turpitude,when refusal to enforce would unjustly enrich one party and be disproportionately harsh to the other,and where enforcement serves the purpose of the statute.it argues that norwood judd d,and denning taber d,upon which norwood relied provides a basis for the trial court decision.
in norwood,the court allowed one partner in a contracting venture to recover from another for a share of the assets and profits after the partnership dissolved.id.at.the illegality in norwood was that neither the plaintiff partner nor the partnership was licensed as required by law,although the defendant partner did hold a license.when the partnership dissolved,the partners agreed to divide the assets and profits.id.at.the court ruled equity can and will grant relief where the court is not required,in granting the relief,to lend its aid in enforcing a transaction illegal only because a permit that could have been secured was not secured.id.at.in other words,relief was possible because the cause of action was not predicated on the illegal partnership agreement but on a new promise arising out of the executed partnership agreement.ibid.
our supreme court pointed to this distinction in refusing to enforce an agreement between an unlicensed subcontractor and a licensed contractor.lewis queen ball sons cal d.in lewis queen,the contractor hired the subcontractor to do an entire state construction project,contrary to state requirements that the contractor itself perform half the work,then refused to pay the subcontractor for some of the work.id.at.the action in lewis queen was one to enforce directly an illegal contract,not merely to obtain an accounting for profits arising from one.id.at.
as in lewis queen,the present action is one to enforce an illegal contract,not to obtain an accounting for profits arising from a contract.unlike norwood,there was no secondary,untainted agreement which the court could enforce without enforcing the illegal agreement the only agreement found by the trial court was the illegal one,in which wolf would pay huskinson brown a portion of the attorney fees without regard to the requirements of rule.
huskinson brown relies upon several other cases,which we next discuss,for the proposition that illegal contracts may be enforced under the proper circumstances.none justifies an exception to the application of rule.
in asdourian araj cal d,the court found that a contractor who obtained a license under a fictitious business name but did business under his own name was permitted to sue a customer for nonpayment despite lack of literal compliance with a statute.the statute barred resort to state court by unlicensed contractors.the court reasoned that the purpose of the statute was satisfied.id.at.literal compliance would not have provided the customer with any greater assurances that he was dealing with an experienced and competent contractor.id.at.here,although payment of the referral fee now may not harm sanchez,failure to inform her and obtain her written consent is inconsistent with the consumer protection purpose of the statute.
in homestead supplies,executive life ins.d,the illegality was an insurance contract that offered the insured a rate on life insurance lower than published rates as an inducement to buy the insurance.this violated a law against inducements to enter an insurance contract.id.at.when,years later,the insurer sought the published rate in a renewal,the insured sued for declaratory relief,at.the court enforced the illegal lower rate,finding the insured was less culpable because he was not presumed to know about the law against inducements serious moral turpitude was not involved and it would be inequitable to allow the insurer to benefit from the illegal inducement.id.at.although the trial court in this case also found a lack of serious moral turpitude,the factors that favored the insured in homestead of the rules and equity of reliance on an not favor either party in this case.both law firms should have known about rule,and it was not reasonable for huskinson brown to rely on wolf promise to obtain compliance with the rule.margolin shemaria,supra,th at,d.
wilson stearns d,is distinguishable because the court did not find the contract involved was illegal.id.at.
in robertson hyde d,buyers sought to cancel a promissory note secured by a deed of trust to certain property,recover payments made on the note,and keep the property.the seller,a senior citizen,had illegally transferred the note and the deed of trust to her son in order to qualify for pension benefits from the state.id.at.the court enforced the illegal transfer,refusing to grant the requested relief because doing so would defeat the very purpose of the statute by leaving the state with no property in which it might retain an interest for the reimbursement of amounts of which it has been defrauded.id.at.here,in contrast,the consumer protection purpose of the rule would be harmed if the illegal contract were enforced.margol
