the district court granted in part and denied in part the government motion to compel the production of documents and an attorney testimony before a federal grand jury.the government appeals that portion of the district court order denying its motion to compel.the client,contesting the order insofar as it granted the motion.we affirm.
in light of the need to observe the requirements of grand jury secrecy,we will provide only a basic recitation of the facts.in the course of earlier,unrelated proceedings,the client was the target of an investigation into whether he had received improper payments.the client received the assistance of the attorney in responding to these accusations and provided the attorney with an alternate,explanation for his conduct.the attorney relied upon this explanation in formulating his legal advice and drafted documents that memorialized what the client said had taken place.the government contends that the client knowingly lied to the attorney by providing the attorney with a false for the monies the client had allegedly improperly received.
in november,a federal grand jury issued subpoenas to the client attorney and the attorney law firm,seeking documents as well as the attorney testimony.in response to the subpoena,the law firm produced a privilege log,identifying documents that it claims are protected under the or work product privileges.the attorney declined to answer the grand jury questions,citing privilege.in june,the grand jury indicted the client and another party.
the government moved to compel the production of the documents and the attorney testimony.the government argued that because the client had used his attorney services to perpetrate a fraud,the and attorney work product privileges were vitiated under the exception to these privileges.
the district court reviewed documents in camera,of which the government had asked the court to examine.following a hearing and briefing by the parties,the district court concluded that,under the exception,the client could not assert the or work product privileges because the government had presented a prima facie case that the client had used his attorney counsel in furtherance of a fraud.the court also concluded that because there was no evidence that the attorney had known of the client fraud,the rule did not preclude the attorney from asserting his own work product privilege.the district court ordered the disclosure of documents that it determined had been generated in furtherance of the fraud,but permitted the attorney to assert his work product privilege as to any opinion work product that might be contained therein.the district court determined that the rest of the documents it had reviewed were not discoverable under the exception because they were not generated in furtherance of any fraud the district court also permitted the attorney to decline to answer the grand jury questions,except for questions relating to the origins of documents.the government contests the redactions and the restrictions on the attorney grand jury testimony.the client appeals that portion of the district court order requiring the production of the documents and the attorney limited testimony.
issues pertaining primarily to the government appeal 
communications and attorney work product are privileged and are not ordinarily by the grand jury.see in re grand jury subpoenas duces tecum,cir noting that the grand jury broad investigatory powers do not require production of evidence protected by a valid claim of privilege in re grand jury proceedings duffy,cir work product privilege applies in grand jury proceedings.neither the privilege nor the work product privilege is absolute,however.under the exception,privilege does not extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or a crime.united states zolin,d quotation omitted.accordingly,we have recognized that,under the exception,a communications lose their privileged character when the lawyer is consulted not with respect to past wrongdoings but rather to further a continuing or contemplated criminal fraud or scheme.gundacker unisys,cir quoting in re berkley,cir.we have not yet explicitly held that the exception applies to the work product privilege as well.see in re murphy,cir stating that the applicability of the exception to the work product privilege is an unresolved question.we so hold today.as set forth in greater detail below,a client who has used his attorney assistance to perpetrate a crime or fraud can not assert the work product privilege as to any documents generated in furtherance of his misconduct.we also hold that an attorney who does not knowingly participate in the client crime or fraud may assert the work product privilege as to his opinion work product.
the work product privilege is distinct from and broader than the privilege.in re murphy,at quotation omitted.while the purpose of the privilege is to encourage clients to make a full disclosure of all favorable and unfavorable facts to their legal counsel,the work product privilege functions not merely and perhaps not mainly to assist the client in obtaining complete legal advice but in addition to establish a protected area in which the lawyer can prepare his case free from adversarial scrutiny.in re special september grand jury ii,cir.because the work product privilege protects not just the relationship but the interests of attorneys to their own work product,both the attorney and the client hold the privilege.united states under seal in re grand jury proceedings,cir citation omitted.
other circuits have concluded that a client who has used an attorney assistance in furtherance of a fraud may not assert the work product privilege.see,in re special september grand jury ii,at when the case being prepared involves the client ongoing fraud,however,we see no reason to afford the client the benefit of this doctrine.we agree.although there is a societal interest in enabling clients to get sound legal advice,there is no such interest when the communications or advice are intended to further the commission of a crime or fraud.united states richard roe,in re richard roe,cir.
an attorney independent assertion of his work product privilege,on the other hand,stands on a very different footing because the attorney privilege is based on the attorney interest in protecting his opinions and thought processes from disclosure.this is a protection that benefits all of the attorney clients because it accords the attorney a measure of privacy within which he can candidly compose his thoughts.
to determine the proper scope of an attorney work product privilege when the client has committed a crime or a fraud,it is necessary first to distinguish between two kinds of work product ordinary work product,which includes raw factual information,and opinion work product,which encompasses counsel mental impressions,conclusions,opinions or legal theories.baker general motors in re gmc,cir.we have recognized that opinion work product enjoys substantially greater protection than ordinary work product.in re murphy,at.ordinary work product is generally discoverable upon a showing of substantial need and an inability to secure the substantial equivalent of the materials by alternate means without undue hardship.id.opinion work product,by contrast,enjoys a nearly absolute immunity and can be discovered only in very rare and extraordinary circumstances.id.we suggested,for example,that opinion work product might be discoverable if it contained evidence of the attorney misconduct.id.at.the central question regarding opinion work product,then,is whether client misconduct of which the attorney is unaware is a rare and extraordinary circumstance warranting an exception to the nearly absolute immunity adhering to opinion work product.
other circuits recognizing the work product distinction have concluded that an attorney may assert the work product privilege with regard to opinion work product even if the client has used the attorney services to commit a crime or perpetrate a fraud,so long as the attorney was unaware that the client was doing so.in re grand jury proceedings,at holding that while the privilege may be vitiated without showing that the attorney knew of the fraud or crime,those seeking to overcome the opinion work product privilege must make a prima facie showing that the attorney in question was aware of or a knowing participant in the criminal conduct quotation omitted in re grand jury proceedings,cir affirming district court order permitting an innocent attorney to refuse to disclose opinion work product in re antitrust grand jury,cir ordering the district court to require disclosure of opinion work product should it find that the attorneys were knowing and willing conspirators in the alleged crime in re special september grand jury ii,at remarking that requiring an innocent attorney to disclose mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,and legal theories would be an invasion not justified by the misfortune of representing a fraudulent client in keeping with the significant protection we accord opinion work product,we hold,as have our sister circuits,that an attorney who is not complicit in his client wrongdoing may assert the work product privilege with respect to his opinion work product.in light of the lesser protection accorded ordinary work product,we conclude that an innocent attorney may be required to disclose ordinary work product.in re grand jury proceedings,at because fact work product enjoys less protection than opinion work product,it may be discovered upon prima facie evidence of a crime or fraud as to the client only and thus even when the attorney is unaware of the crime of fraud.in re antitrust grand jury,at concluding that ordinary work product may be disclosed if there has been client fraud.
the government contends that even if the district court correctly held that the attorney opinion work product was shielded from disclosure,the district court did not properly draw the line between ordinary and opinion fact work product.in particular,the government disagrees with the district court determination that the attorney notes and his recollections about conversations he may have had with the client were protectable as opinion work product.we discern no error in the district court division between opinion and fact work product.
notes and memoranda of an attorney,or an attorney agent,from a witness interview are opinion work product entitled to almost absolute immunity.baker,at.an attorney notes of a witness interview are opinion work product because when taking notes,an attorney often focuses on those facts that she deems legally significant.id.accordingly,the district court correctly determined that the attorney notes were protectable as opinion work product.the district court determination regarding the attorney recollections of conversations with the client was also sound.in duffy,we concluded that an attorney recollections of conversations with a client were protectable work product.at.although,as the government points out,duffy did not explicitly distinguish between ordinary and opinion work product,duffy did remark that testimony regarding an attorney recollections of conversations with clients would reveal the attorney mental impressions and thought processes.id.in other words,the attorney recollections are protectable as opinion work product.in sum,we conclude that the district court drew an appropriate line between ordinary and opinion work product in this case 
issues pertaining primarily to the client 
the client takes issue with the standard the district court used to determine that the documents were generated in furtherance of a crime or fraud.the district court held that the standard was met because the government evidence,if it were believed by the trier of fact,would establish the existence of a crime or fraud.the district court also determined that it would have found that the exception applied even if it had used a probable cause standard,as the client had suggested.the client argues on appeal that otherwise privileged documents should be discoverable under the exception only if the district court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the documents were generated in furtherance of a crime or fraud.the client also contends that a district court should take into account evidence countervailing the application of the exception 
with respect to the quantum of proof,before the exception may be applied,the moving party must make a prima facie showing that the legal advice has been obtained in furtherance of an illegal or fraudulent activity.united states horvath,cir see also in re murphy,at to invoke the exception,there must be a prima facie showing that the client was engaged or planned to engage in illegal or fraudulent activity when he sought the legal advice.courts of appeals have articulated varying standards regarding the quantum of proof necessary to make this prima facie showing.compare in re grand jury proceedings corporation,cir requiring reasonable cause to believe that the attorneys were being utilized in furtherance of a crime or fraud quotation omitted,and in re antitrust grand jury,cir requiring a prima facie showing based on evidence that would provide a prudent person with a reasonable basis to suspect the perpetration of a crime or fraud quoting in re grand jury subpoena duces tecum,cir,with haines liggett group,cir requiring evidence which,if believed by the,would be sufficient to support a finding that the elements of the exception were met,in re grand jury subpoena,cir requiring evidence such as will suffice until contradicted and overcome by other evidence to establish crime or fraud quotation omitted,in re sealed case,requiring evidence that if believed by the trier of fact would establish the elements of an ongoing or imminent crime or fraud quotation omitted,and in re grand jury proceedings,at requiring evidence that,if believed by a trier of fact,would establish the elements of some violation that was ongoing or about to be committed and noting that proof either by a preponderance or beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime or fraud is not required.
in considering the disparate formulations regarding the level of proof necessary to justify the application of the exception,we look to supreme court precedent.in united states zolin,the court considered,inter alia,the level of proof necessary to justify a district court ordering the production of documents for the purpose of an in camera review to determine whether the exception applied.the court ruled that a district court may not order the production of documents for in camera review unless the party urging production has made the threshold showing of a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person that the exception applies,at.although the court did not specify the level of proof necessary to trigger the exception,it suggested that a higher burden than that required for in camera review would be necessary to overcome the privilege.zolin,at.we believe that both of the standards enunciated by the district court meet this higher threshold.one requires that crime or fraud be established,and the other requires that there be probable cause to believe that a crime or fraud had been perpetrated.
we reject the client suggestion that fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.apart from the fact that it is not harmonious with the standards articulated by our sister circuits the standard is too exacting for proceedings at the grand jury stage.the supreme court has cautioned that any rule that would saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and frustrate the public interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.united states dionisio,d see also in re grand jury investigation,cir if courts always had to hear testimony and conflicting evidence on such matters,the rationale behind the prima facie promotion of speed and simplicity at the grand jury be lost.the grand jury is an investigative body we do not believe that it would be prudent to saddle its proceedings with a clear and convincing evidence standard,which would unduly impede its investigation.
