defendant and appellant fred charness charness appeals a judgment in favor of plaintiff and respondent james christian sims sims following a court trial.
the essential issue presented is whether a fee sharing agreement between attorneys charness and sims amounted to a pure referral and thus was subject to rule of the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california,requiring written disclosure to,and written consent by,the client 
rule by its language is inapplicable where a member of the bar shares fees with a partner,associate,or fellow shareholder.rule a.however,a question remains as to the proper interpretation of the term associate.rule a.based on our analysis,we conclude that where an outside lawyer functions on a particular matter essentially on the same basis as an employee of the law office state bar formal opinion,the outside lawyer is an associate for purposes of rule,and no case referral is involved.on the facts herein,the outside lawyer,sims,was an associate of charness.accordingly,the rule does not preclude sims from enforcing the fee sharing agreement,and the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the parties are lawyers.sims sued charness for fraud,money had and received,breach of contract and of fiduciary duty,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the action arose out of the parties agreement to divide the attorney fees earned on several cases.charness had the original retainer agreement with the various clients.charness brought in sims for his trial expertise to try the cases.sims resides in oregon,is licensed in both oregon and california,and also has a practice of his own.
the haze lawsuit.
the principal dispute concerns charness case brought by and haze against the vale inn motel hereafter,the haze case.pursuant to an oral agreement,charness retained sims to try the case in return for percent of the attorney fees due under the client retainer agreement in the event a favorable verdict were obtained.in march,the jury returned a verdict for and haze in the amount of.dissatisfied with certain matters in the trial and trial preparation,haze subsequently filed a malpractice action against sims,charness and another participating lawyer,dennis braun,who leased space from charness.haze also disputed any award of attorney fees under the retainer agreement.the malpractice action by haze was successfully defended and dismissed.
the interpleader action.
after the fee dispute arose,the attorneys for the defendant vale inn motel interpled the funds awarded in the haze case into court.they deposited a total of for attorney fees,costs and postjudgment interest for disposition in the interpleader action.charness hired braun to handle the interpleader action,apparently agreeing to braun receipt of a percent contingency fee.haze defaulted in the interpleader action,and on july,judgment was entered in said action.the interpleader court awarded all the funds then on deposit,including interest,to charness.the disbursement to charness represented for attorney fees,for costs,and for interest on the attorney fees and costs.following entry of the interpleader judgment,charness paid to braun for his services in the matter.
charness accounting and payment to sims.
in september,charness submitted to sims a combined statement of attorney fees due sims on the haze case,less setoffs for braun attorney fees and half of certain costs in another matter they handled,known as the portillo case.charness tendered a check to sims for,which sims negotiated.that sum was calculated,according to the statement,as,less half of braun attorney fees,less half of the portillo costs charness did not disclose the fact he had received in interest in the interpleader action.the gross figure of was about percent of,the total net attorney fees recovered in the haze case,thus implying that was the total charness had collected.
sims promptly complained to charness that braun attorney fees were excessive,that sims was due for reimbursement of his expenses of suit submitted to charness in the haze case,and that he did not owe half the portillo costs.sims subsequently learned that the amount tendered to him had failed to disclose the interpleader interest.sims filed this action on february.
proceedings.
the instant action was tried before the court sitting without a jury.the trial court found the agreement between sims and charness called for charness to pay sims percent of the net attorney fees from the haze case,payable upon receipt.said agreement later was modified by the need to hire braun to prosecute the interpleader action.thus,the original fee split was subject to a deduction for braun services in the interpleader action.
with respect to the proper computation,the trial court found the total payout to charness in the interpleader action was.of that sum,charness was entitled to retain his costs percent of the in attorney fees interest on those amounts and of braun attorney fees for a total of.there was no agreement warranting the offset of the portillo costs.therefore,of the payout,sims was entitled to the remaining.because charness previously had paid sims,there was an underpayment of.in addition,the trial court awarded sims in prejudgment interest,as well as an additional in emotional distress damages on his breach of fiduciary duty claim.
the trial court also rejected charness affirmative defense that the fee sharing agreement was unenforceable due to noncompliance with rule.the trial court ruled the fee sharing agreement fell within an equitable exception to the unenforceability doctrine.the trial court found the purpose of rule was to protect the client,but the underlying transaction was over,the fee dispute had been litigated to its conclusion,the harm to the client was a fait accompli and redress to the client was moot.the trial court also noted that although haze did not consent in writing,the total fee charged to the client was not increased and the fee was not unconscionable.further,haze knew sims was trying his case,made no objection,and must at least have known of,and probably tacitly consented to,sims compensation.the trial court reasoned that at this juncture,to apply rule to defeat sims recovery would benefit only charness,who would be unjustly enriched directly in the face of his breach of fiduciary duty to sims.
charness appealed the judgment.
contentions 
charness contends an oral agreement between attorneys is void as against public policy and the rules of professional conduct.further,even assuming the agreement herein is enforceable,the trial court erred in failing to assess profits and losses of the joint venture on a pro rata basis,and in calculating the profits and losses from the joint venture.
discussion 
no merit to charness contention that noncompliance with rule renders this fee sharing agreement unenforceable by sims the agreement was not within rule because sims was an associate of.rule does not apply where an attorney is sharing a fee for legal services with an outside attorney who is functioning on a particular matter essentially on the same basis as an employee of the law office.
rule a provides a member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless the client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division and the total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule.
in the instant case,the applicability of the written disclosure and written consent requirements of rule turns on whether sims,the outside lawyer,was an associate of charness.if sims was charness associate,their fee sharing agreement was not subject to rule.rule is not implicated unless a case referral was made by charness to sims in the first instance.if a referral took place,it would be necessary to obtain the referred client written acknowledgment and consent to the fee sharing agreement,in compliance with rule.
