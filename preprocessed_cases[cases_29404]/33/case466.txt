james douglas alexander appeals from the judgment of conviction,following a trial by a jury,of five counts of interstate communication of threats to injure others,in violation of c.he seeks reversal on the ground that his indictment and conviction were obtained in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel and the privilege.he further contends that he was prejudiced by certain evidentiary rulings.
alexander also maintains that the district court erred in calculating his sentence.we affirm the judgment of conviction because we conclude that the district court did not err in ordering alexander former counsel to present evidence of threats of bodily harm made by alexander during communications regarding pending criminal proceedings.we also uphold the district court sentencing decision.
in,alexander was a member of the state bar of montana.in that year,the federal bureau of investigation and the state bar of montana began investigations regarding alleged fraudulent representations made by alexander to induce persons to pay him a retainer for his services in arranging the adoption of orphans from the republic of macedonia.the fbi investigation resulted in the return of a federal mail and wire fraud indictment on june.
the montana supreme court commission on practice cop inquiry into alexander alleged unethical behavior led to his disbarment.the cop investigation was conducted by rockwood brown,gary ryder,and phillip carter.
on october,the district court appointed assistant federal defender mark werner werner,of the federal defenders of montana,to represent alexander on the mail and wire fraud charges.werner was assisted by russ curry curry,an investigator for the federal defenders of montana.
alexander resided in oklahoma following his pretrial release.he communicated with werner and curry over the telephone and by sending letters to montana.
between the fall of and june,alexander made many threats to kill various individuals in his conversations with werner and curry.he threatened to harm werner,curry,rockwood brown,gary ryder,phillip carter,fbi special agent scott cruse,and assistant united states attorney lori harper.on one occasion he stated to werner i have no problem coming in and killing half a dozen people,and taking them out,and i would testify to that in court.
on june,curry reported to werner that alexander had stated in a telephone conversation that he has only one wish,and that wish is to kill.to not only kill,but also to watch people being tortured before he kills them.concerned for his own safety and that of others,werner wrote a letter on the same date to a pretrial services officer of the united states probation office in which he stated i feel compelled to disclose to you that alexander has stated threats against various individuals.in those threats he has expressed his intent to inflict harm and death.
on june,werner filed a motion to withdraw as alexander attorney of record.on or about the same date,werner was served with a grand jury subpoena duces tecum.he was ordered to appear before the grand jury on june,to testify regarding the threats made by alexander,and to bring his office files and records relating to his communications with alexander.
when werner appeared before the grand jury,he asserted the privilege on alexander behalf.the government moved for an order compelling werner to testify and to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.the district court granted the motion and ordered werner to testify concerning the threats.he was also admonished,however,not to reveal any communication with alexander that was not related to his threats.werner redacted all information from his files and records that was not directly related to the threats.
werner testimony before the grand jury was limited by the prosecutor questions to the threats uttered by alexander.the grand jury indicted alexander on one count of obstruction of justice and eight counts of communicating interstate threats to injure others the indictment was filed on august.the earlier indictment resulting from the alleged charges was dismissed on august.
werner and curry testified at trial regarding alexander threats.werner also testified that he informed alexander that threatening persons with bodily harm was a criminal act.alexander was convicted of count ii,telephone communication of threats to injure werner count vi,telephone threats to injure curry count vii,communication in interstate commerce of threats to curry to injure werner count viii,threats made to curry in interstate commerce to injure rockwood brown and count ix,threats made to curry in telephone communications threatening to injure gary ryder.he was acquitted of the remaining counts.he was sentenced to serve months in prison.
we note at the outset of our discussion of alexander contentions that he does not argue that the evidence was insufficient to persuade a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that he made threats to harm others in his communication with his attorney.instead,alexander seeks reversal of the judgment of conviction and dismissal of the indictment on the ground that his attorney violated his sixth amendment right to counsel and the privilege by testifying before the grand jury and at trial,and disclosing his files pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum.
a party asserting the privilege has the burden of establishing the relationship and the privileged nature of the communication.whether the party has met these requirements is reviewed de novo.united states bauer,cir citation omitted.
it is undisputed that alexander was represented by werner when he used the mails and the telephone to communicate his threats to harm others.alexander has failed to demonstrate,however,the privileged nature of the threats during his communication with his attorney.to prevent abuse and assure the availability of relevant evidence to the prosecutor,the privilege is limited to only those to obtain informed legal might not have been made absent the privilege.in re grand jury investigation,cir quotation omitted.
the supreme court instructed in nix whiteside,d as follows 
a defendant who informed his counsel that he was arranging to bribe or threaten witnesses or members of the jury would have no right to insist on counsel assistance or silence.counsel would not be limited to advising against that conduct.an attorney duty of confidentiality,which totally covers the client admission of guilt,does not extend to a client announced plans to engage in future criminal conduct.
we have previously held that communications with a person legal counsel are protected only if they were made in order to obtain legal advice.bauer,at.alexander threats to commit violent acts against werner and others were clearly not communications in order to obtain legal advice.had alexander sought werner advice regarding the commission of future violent crimes,i t is well settled that the privilege does not extend to communications which solicit or offer advice for the commission of a crime or fraud.in re grand jury investigation,at.
the record shows that werner scrupulously protected alexander privileged communications.when summoned by the grand jury,he asserted the privilege and refused to testify regarding alexander threats or to surrender his files.the district court ordered him to testify and to produce documents concerning the threats,but not to disclose any privileged communications.
alexander has failed to demonstrate that werner divulged any privileged communications in his testimony before the grand jury or at trial pertaining to alexander defense against the charges in the indictment.the record also shows that werner redacted all communications from his files that did not refer to alexander threats.werner appeared before the grand jury as a percipient witness to criminal activity,not as alexander defense counsel concerning the pending indictment.accordingly,werner testimony regarding alexander threats to commit future violent crimes against werner and others was not protected by the privilege nor did it deprive alexander of his sixth amendment right to counsel regarding the charges 
alexander argues that the distri
