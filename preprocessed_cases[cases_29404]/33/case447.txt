this case involves a murder that only one of two people could have committed the appellant,daniel lee lewis,or his nephew,steven berg.lewis was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to an aggregate term of years to life.berg served as the primary witness for the prosecution.despite the antagonistic positions of the two men,lewis was represented at trial by a lawyer who had represented berg on another matter immediately prior to undertaking lewis defense.
lewis contends that this successive representation presented a conflict of interest that adversely affected his defense.the california court of appeal rejected lewis conflict of interest claim and affirmed the judgment.the district court for the eastern district of california denied his federal habeas petition.we have jurisdiction under and.we both reverse and remand with directions to grant the habeas petition.
factual and procedural background 
evidence relating to the crime 
kurtis mitchell was killed by a shotgun blast in el dorado county,california,on june.a few days before the shooting,lewis and tori grimm,lewis employee and close friend,found mitchell at lewis house.mitchell claimed to be retrieving some belongings that he had stored there.he took a rifle that he thought belonged to his girlfriend,but that actually belonged to lewis wife.mitchell accused grimm of wearing mitchell clothes,and a fight ensued between mitchell,on one side,and lewis and grimm,on the other.lewis ordered mitchell off his property.shortly thereafter,mitchell called lewis and said,you all dead.
on june,lewis reported the fight and theft of the rifle to the sheriff department.lewis also called his landlord and friend,frank vilt,who had worked as a marshal,to mediate the dispute with mitchell,to alert police to mitchell possession of the rifle,and to prepare a restraining order to keep mitchell away from lewis family.lewis wife and children moved into a hotel.
berg,lewis nephew,learned about mitchell theft and threats the next day at lewis house.although lewis had told berg that mitchell threat was against the entire family,including berg,berg testified later that he did not feel threatened by mitchell because they were friends.however,later in the afternoon,berg borrowed a shotgun and shells from his neighbor and told him that there were some problems up on the mountain and that he did not want to walk into a situation where he would be caught with his pants down.berg recovered the rifle that mitchell had taken,which had been retrieved by a third person from mitchell earlier that day.
several witnesses testified at trial that lewis was very upset over mitchell theft and threats.berg testified that he saw lewis with a,shotgun,and that lewis spoke of settling matters with mitchell 
berg claimed that he proceeded to mitchell barn,where mitchell lived,and warned him that lewis was on his way.berg then went inside the barn to smoke methamphetamine.berg testified that through the barn door,he saw lewis arrive and argue with mitchell.he claimed that lewis pointed his gun at mitchell and said,you disrespected my family it time to pay,and then fired.berg face and clothing were spattered with blood and tissue.lewis then ran off.
berg and his girlfriend drove to berg home.en route,one of them tossed berg spattered out of the car.berg showered when he got home,cleaned his remaining clothes,and cleaned the shotgun and shells that he had borrowed from his neighbor.he later threw away his bloody tennis shoes and cleaned his car,which was also spattered,at a car wash.the next day,berg returned the gun and contacted the sheriff department about the murder.
evidence presented at trial showed that mitchell was found dead just outside the barn door,and that considerable blood and tissue spatter were found in the barn.experts testified that heavy spatter could be expected on someone in back of,or to the side of,mitchell,and that the forensic evidence did not contradict berg account of the position of the three individuals.the shotgun that berg alleged he had earlier seen on lewis was never found.the shotgun pellets recovered from mitchell and the murder scene also did not match the shells that berg had obtained from his neighbor.
lewis testified that berg had told him that lewis was not present when mitchell was killed,and that berg said the gun went off when mitchell attempted to grab the gun out of his hand.
evidence relating to the alleged conflict 
from late through,attorney david weiner represented berg on a felony charge of driving under the influence of alcohol dui in sacramento county.in july,weiner withdrew from representing berg in order to defend lewis on charges of murder in el dorado county.in december,after berg had pled no contest to dui,and admitted several prior dui convictions,he was placed on probation for the offense.
weiner stated later,during a hearing on a motion for a new trial,that lewis family had approached him to represent lewis.berg offered to pay part of weiner fee,and family members asked berg to sell his car in order to contribute to lewis defense.
in august,lewis and berg signed nearly identical waivers of any conflict of interest.lewis waiver provided 
advisement 
notice is hereby given that pursuant to rules of professional conduct,rule,california rules of court,you are advised as follows 
david weiner,attorney at law,has represented steve berg in the sacramento county case number.david weiner has recently withdrawn from that case with the court approval in sacramento county for reasons that there is a conflict of interest between steven berg and daniel lewis 
steven berg is a prosecution witness potentially adverse to daniel lewis in connection with the charges pending against him in el dorado county 
steven berg has been advised of his rights pursuant to rules of professional conduct,rule,california rules of court,and has consented to david weiner representation of daniel lewis in connection with the el dorado county case pending 
daniel lewis,because of the conflict of interest between steven berg and daniel lewis,is advised to seek the advice of an independent lawyer to discuss the ramifications of being represented by david weiner in view of his past representation of steven berg.
i have read the above advisement and also the advisement and consent that was executed by steven berg,and hereby consent to and request that david weiner represent me in the charges presently pending against me in el dorado county.
the parties also discussed the potential conflict in a preliminary hearing in which the state court confirmed that lewis and berg waived any potential conflicts of interest.the judge advised lewis,n ormally it would be a conflict of interest and inappropriate for an attorney to represent a defendant when he an attorney of record for a prosecution witness,and asked whether lewis understood that rule.after lewis told the judge that he waived the conflict,the judge asked,and your lawyer has fully explained to you the implication of this lewis answered,yes.lewis,however,never obtained independent counsel to advise him of the ramifications of waiving the conflict.
frank vilt later declared in an affidavit submitted with lewis motion for a new trial that berg came to his house after signing the waiver and stated,weiner will be representing my uncle but he will never turn on me,that is my insurance policy.i have an insurance policy,i no fool.in his own declaration,berg denied making this statement.
at trial,weiner raised the question of whether it was berg who actually shot mitchell.on,berg admitted that he had consumed a large quantity of alcohol and methamphetamine shortly before the murder.berg also admitted that he was a convicted felon and was illegally in possession of a firearm.weiner questioned berg at length about why he had cleaned the shotgun and shells.weiner also pointed out inconsistencies in berg testimony.although the prosecution,on direct examination,had elicited an admission from berg that he had been convicted of four separate burglary charges,weiner did not question berg about his most recent dui charge or about his probation status.he also did not bring out the fact that berg was in a substance abuse treatment program as a condition of his probation or that berg had helped arrange for weiner to represent lewis and offered to pay his fee.
during his closing argument,weiner argued that the case was a credibility contest between berg and all of the other witnesses and physical evidence.he argued that berg had shot and killed mitchell,and that if berg were on trial for murder,the evidence against him would be overwhelming.
motion for a new trial 
after lewis trial,robert blasier replaced weiner as lewis counsel.lewis filed a motion for a new trial in may,in which he alleged,inter alia,ineffective assistance of counsel.blasier examined weiner at the evidentiary hearing about several alleged shortcomings in his representation.
in addition to weiner testimony,blasier conducted an independent investigation that yielded new witnesses.one witness was vilt,who declared that he had provided weiner with the names and addresses of several witnesses who were willing to testify at trial.vilt declared that he told weiner about witnesses who could testify that berg was a chronic liar berg had asked about hair triggers just days after the shooting a few hours before the shooting,berg had a shotgun and said he was going to dust someone and berg confessed to killing mitchell.
california court of appeal 
the court of appeal found that the alleged conflict of interest did not warrant a reversal of lewis conviction.the court first opined that lewis had arguably waived any conflict of interest claim since he was aware of his right to representation and had waived that right by signing a valid written waiver and discussing the conflict at a preliminary hearing.the court held that,even if the waiver was not valid,lewis failed to establish a sixth amendment violation because any alleged conflict of interest did not adversely affect his attorney performance at trial.
the court then turned to lewis other claims.it held that weiner did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel because,while he may have failed to act competently,there was not a reasonable probability that lewis would have fared better had weiner impeached berg with his felony dui conviction and probation.in response to lewis claim that weiner failed to investigate the case adequately,the court found that weiner had competently investigated,or,in the alternative,even if he had not adequately investigated,there was not a reasonable probability that lewis would have fared better with the evidence submitted after trial.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this circuit reviews de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for habeas corpus.dows wood,cir.
this petition was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.under aedpa,a federal court may grant habeas relief to a petitioner in state custody only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,or if the decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.as we have explained,however,we still look to our own law for its persuasive authority in applying supreme court law our cases may be persuasive authority for purposes of determining whether a particular state court decision is an unreasonable application of supreme court law.van tran lindsey,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by lockyer andrade,d quoting duhaime ducharme,cir.
the sixth amendment right to counsel includes a correlative right to representation free from conflicts of interest.wood georgia,d.lewis contends that his representation at trial by david weiner presented a conflict of interest that adversely affected his defense.we must first determine whether lewis validly waived his right to counsel.we conclude that he did not.
the california court of appeal considered the government waiver argument and deemed the waiver arguably sufficient.however,the court explicitly stated that it was not relying on the waiver to resolve the conflict issue but was instead examining whether the alleged conflict adversely affected lewis representation.noting that berg was the principal prosecution witness and only other possible suspect,and that weiner was representing him at the time he agreed to represent lewis,the court stated 
these vital ties mandate a closer look at the potential conflict,in line with the principles that we must indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of unimpaired assistance of counsel and that defendant must be advised of the full range of the dangers and possible consequences of the conflicted representation in his case.citation omitted emphasis added by state court of appeal 
for these reasons,the court of appeal refused to hold on waiver,but proceeded to examine the merits of the conflict of interest claim.
de novo review,rather than aedpa deferential standard,is applicable to a claim that the state court did not reach on the merits.nulph cook,cir.here,the state court reached the merits of lewis conflict of interest claim,but in examining that claim,did not resolve the waiver issue.the principle that comity and federalism concerns are not implicated where a state court does not reach a claim applies here with equal force.because the state court explicitly held on other grounds,we do not apply aedpa deference to its discussion of lewis waiver.
our standard of review is not controlled by delgado lewis,cir.there,we held that where a state court provides no rationale for a decision,a habeas court does not apply de novo review,but instead determines whether the state decision was objectively unreasonable based on its independent reading of the record.here,however,the state court was not silent as to its reasoning rather,it specifically declined to hold that lewis validly waived his right to counsel,and resolved lewis conflict of interest claim on other grounds.therefore,we review de novo whether lewis waived his right to conflict free counsel,while deferring to any factual findings made by the state court under e.
a defendant may waive his right to the assistance of an attorney who is unhindered by conflicts.holloway arkansas,d.a valid waiver of conflict of interest must be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent,such that the defendant is sufficiently informed of the consequences of his choice.belmontes woodford,cir.we are required to ascertain with certainty that a defendant knowingly and intelligently waived that right by focusing on what the defendant understood.lockhart terhune,cir citations omitted.
here,the state court of appeal found that lewis signed a written waiver,discussed the potential conflict with weiner,and was advised to seek outside counsel on the matter.it also found that lewis was generally advised of the dangers and possible consequences arising from the conflict,including the fact that berg would be a witness for the government.we presume these factual findings to be correct.e.however,there is no evidence that lewis understood any of the specific ramifications of his waiver,at,since he did not seek the advice of outside counsel and had only a cursory discussion with the judge.garcia bunnell,cir finding a waiver valid where the defendant had an extensive discussion with the judge about the conflict,received a continuance to consult with his family on the matter,and clearly understood his right to unbiased counsel.
in belmontes,we concluded that a defendant was not sufficiently informed of the consequences of a waiver,in part because he was not told that his attorney owed a continuing duty of loyalty to a former client whom the defendant now implicated in the murder.at.here,too,there is no evidence that lewis was told that weiner had any continuing obligations to berg.even if lewis understood the theoretical risk of an attorney being biased towards a former client,and dismissed that risk as unlikely,it is less likely that he foresaw other potential consequences of the instance,the fact that the charges on which weiner previously represented berg might provide material for impeachment.
