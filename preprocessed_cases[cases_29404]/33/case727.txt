plaintiff patricia roush appeals from the trial court order denying her motion to disqualify counsel for defendant seagate technology,llc seagate.roush claims that seagate attorneys obtained her confidential information when kristopher kilgore,the plaintiff in a separate case against seagate,settled his suit and agreed to share what he knew about roush case as part of his settlement agreement.according to roush,she had shared confidential information with kilgore at a time when the two were both clients of roush present counsel.we conclude that roush did not meet her initial burden of proving that kilgore possessed any information that roush could claim was confidential.accordingly,we shall affirm.
background 
factual and procedural background 
roush sued her former employer,seagate,and her former manager,defendant kevin scott,alleging sexual orientation discrimination and harassment.roush claimed that,in march,after suffering several slights from scott and receiving what she perceived as a demotion,roush approached kilgore,her immediate supervisor,and asked him why scott was treating her so harshly.kilgore allegedly told her that scott told him that roush problems were the result of her lifestyle,which roush understood to refer to her sexual orientation.
kilgore had his own dispute with seagate.sometime around january,kilgore had spoken to his supervisor about alleged financial improprieties and concerns relating to seagate travel department.he reported these alleged improprieties to higher level management,which,he claimed,resulted in his being reprimanded and suspended for a day.kilgore continued to report concerns to the seagate legal department and to seagate management.among other things,he reported alleged irregularities in contracting and bookkeeping practices,breaches of confidentiality,and scott alleged sexual orientation harassment of roush.all of this,he claimed,resulted in repeated acts of harassment and retaliation against him.he resigned from his employment in october and engaged the markowitz law group,llp markowitz to represent him in connection with his claims against seagate.
meanwhile,roush had been stung by kilgore report of scott lifestyle remark.she informally complained about it,then later made a more formal written complaint.seagate investigated the allegation but could not corroborate it.thereafter,roush continued to receive criticism about her work.she resigned from seagate on february.kilgore introduced roush to markowitz and roush engaged the firm to represent her in this action.
in or about august,kilgore had a falling out with markowitz.kilgore retained new counsel who filed his complaint against seagate in federal court.in that lawsuit kilgore alleged that seagate had violated the act by retaliating against him for being a whistleblower,and that seagate had constructively terminated him in violation of public policy,due to his reports of alleged improprieties,his use of medical leave under the california family rights act,and his report to the seagate human resources department of scott alleged sexual orientation harassment of roush.
markowitz pursued this state court action on behalf of roush after preliminary discovery was complete,defendants filed a summary judgment motion,setting the hearing for november.roush obtained several continuances of the hearing on the ground that there was additional discovery she had not completed.in connection with her last motion for a continuance,filed january,roush counsel stated that he had recently learned through kilgore attorney that kilgore had settled his suit against seagate and,as a result,was unable to talk to roush counsel he would have to be subpoenaed.on january,in response to one of roush discovery demands,seagate produced a copy of its settlement agreement with kilgore.then in february,seagate produced copies of two declarations it had obtained from kilgore following execution of the settlement agreement.on march,roush filed her motion to disqualify seagate counsel morrison and foerster,llp morrison.
b.the disqualification motion 
roush motion was based upon a provision in the settlement agreement between seagate and kilgore by which kilgore had promised to assist seagate as follows kilgore agrees to provide seagate counsel with copies of all documents in his possession,custody,or control related to roush employment at seagate or her claims against seagate.kilgore further agrees to provide all other information requested by seagate counsel concerning roush employment at seagate or her claims against seagate.kilgore further agrees to meet with seagate counsel at reasonable times at their request to review such information or any other information related to roush civil action as they reasonably may request,and to respond to questions,with the first such meeting to occur on or by november.kilgore agrees to notify seagate promptly of any inquiries by roush or her attorneys,and to waive any privilege he otherwise may be entitled to assert with respect to his own discussions and dealings with roush attorneys related to claims or allegations made in roush case.consistent with the foregoing,kilgore agrees to inform seagate counsel,upon request,of any documents he provided to roush attorneys related to claims or allegations made in roush case.kilgore agrees that,if he is subpoenaed as a witness in roush lawsuit,he will promptly notify seagate of the subpoena or court order and meet with seagate designated attorneys prior to the deposition.italics added.
the gist of roush disqualification motion was that roush and kilgore enjoyed a joint privilege that could not be waived absent consent from both of them and,that in extracting the quoted promise from kilgore,morrison improperly obtained roush confidential information.roush counsel submitted a declaration stating that he had previously represented both kilgore and roush.he characterized the representation as a joint representation and stated that he had informed both clients that information could be shared without losing its privileged nature.he also stated that he had shared each client confidential information separately with the other client and that he had one lunch meeting with both clients where the entire time was spent discussing roush case.
defendants opposed the motion,arguing that it was merely a tactical maneuver to gain further delay of the summary judgment proceedings and that,in any event,there was no basis for disqualification.defendants argued that there was no showing that roush and kilgore were,indeed,joint clients or that they otherwise could have shared information without waiving the privilege.defendants also argued that they had no notice that kilgore might have possessed protected information.
david murphy was the morrison partner responsible for the case.murphy declaration explained that roush discovery responses had made no reference to any joint client situation.to the contrary,during a discovery dispute in october,aaron markowitz told murphy that,as to any privilege covering discussions between him and kilgore,o nly kilgore can waive this privilege.
murphy declaration went on to state that as part of the agreement with kilgore,he and other morrison attorneys met with kilgore in november and december.during those meetings counsel asked kilgore whether he had signed any written agreements with markowitz and whether he and roush had ever had any joint discussions with markowitz.kilgore answer to both questions was that he had not.
defendants included with their opposition the two declarations seagate had obtained from kilgore after the settlement agreement had been executed.in those declarations kilgore describes his interactions with roush while they were both employed at seagate.he largely refuted some of the allegations roush had made about her treatment at seagate,although he confirmed that he had heard scott make the lifestyle remark that he recounted to roush in march.murphy represented to the court at the hearing on roush disqualification motion that,aside from the information contained in kilgore two declarations,t here was nothing else that we obtained from kilgore nor that we focused on.
the trial court took the matter under submission and filed a written order the following day,stating simply that the motion is denied.the trial court stayed proceedings pending this appeal.
ii.appealability and standard of review 
the broad issue before us is whether the trial court erred in denying roush motion to disqualify morrison as defendants counsel.an order denying a disqualification motion is appealable either as an order refusing to grant an injunction to restrain counsel from participating in the case code civ,subd.a or as a final order on a collateral matter meehan hopps cal d.
the trial court decision denying a motion for disqualification is usually reviewed for abuse of discretion.rosenfeld construction superior court d.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil.
in the present case,the pertinent facts are not disputed.defendants do not dispute that roush shared the information described in markowitz declaration and roush does not dispute the facts set forth in murphy declaration.the dispute concerns only the legal effect of those facts.accordingly,we treat the question as a matter of law subject to independent review.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d,ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
iii.legal framework for disqualification 
the trial court power to disqualify counsel is derived from the court inherent power t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers.code civ,subd.a comden superior court cal d,fn.disqualification motions implicate several important interests,among them are the clients right to counsel of their choice,the attorney interest in representing a client,the financial burden of replacing a disqualified attorney,and tactical abuse that may underlie the motion.in re complex asbestos litigation d.complex asbestos litigation.the paramount concern in determining whether counsel should be disqualified is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.see also speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d.it must be remembered,however,that disqualification is a drastic course of action that should not be taken simply out of hypersensitivity to ethical nuances or the appearance of impropriety.hetos investments,kurtin th,d.
the classic disqualification case involves the attorney switching sides,so that an attorney who once represented a now seeks to represent b in a matter materially related to the original representation.cooke superior court d.disqualification in such a case is necessary to safeguard the relationship.a client should not fear that confidences conveyed to his attorney in one action will return to haunt him in a later one.richardson hamilton international corporation cir.
in other cases,counsel may be disqualified where counsel has obtained the secrets of an adverse party in some other manner,such as where counsel newly hired paralegal had access to the adversary confidences while working for opposing counsel complex asbestos litigation,supra,d at,or where counsel obtained confidential information from an expert with whom opposing counsel had consulted county of los angeles superior court d.shadow traffic network superior court th,d shadow traffic.disqualification is warranted in these cases,not because the attorney has a direct duty to protect the adverse party confidences,but because the situation implicates the attorney ethical duty to maintain the integrity of the judicial process.complex asbestos litigation,supra,d at.
it is also true,however,that mere exposure to the confidences of an adversary does not,standing alone,warrant disqualification.such a rule would nullify a party right to representation by chosen counsel any time inadvertence or devious design put an adversary confidences in an attorney mailbox.complex asbestos litigation,supra,d at.thus,where the attorney client is the attorney source of privileged information relating to the litigation,courts typically refuse to allow the disqualification,concluding that clients do not act inappropriately in providing information to their own attorney.since the purpose of confidentiality is to promote full and open discussions between attorney and client citation,it would be ironic to protect confidentiality by effectively barring from such discussions an adversary confidences known to the client.a lay client should not be expected to make such distinctions in what can and can not be told to the attorney at the risk of losing the attorney services.id.at.further,in such situations,disqualification would do nothing to protect the privilege because the client still has the information and may pass it on to new counsel,leaving the adversary in same position.neal health net,th,d fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d cooke superior court,supra,d at.
this case does not fit the pattern of any of the foregoing.this is not an case since morrison had no prior relationship with roush.and this is not a case where the alleged disclosure of confidential information was made by the attorney own client.kilgore was not a seagate employee when he negotiated the settlement agreement and,therefore,his communications with morrison were not communications.see chadbourne,superior court cal d.
this case is most similar to the expert witness and prior employee cases described in shadow traffic and complex asbestos litigation.as roush notes,the common thread running through those cases is that the attorney obtained confidential information from a source who could not ethically disclose the information without consent from the adversary.
in the expert witness cases,the party seeking disqualification has the burden to show that the expert possesses confidential information materially related to the proceedings before the court.the moving party initial burden does not require the party to disclose the actual information contended to be confidential.however,the court should be provided with the nature of the information and its material relationship to the proceeding.shadow traffic,supra,th at,d.once this showing has been made,a rebuttable presumption arises that the information has been used or disclosed in the current employment.ibid.the rule for disqualification in the case of former employees is the same.complex asbestos litigation,supra,d at.
adapting this rule to the present situation,we conclude that roush had the initial burden to show that kilgore possessed roush confidential information materially related to these proceedings.as we shall explain,it is not enough for roush to show merely that she shared confidential information with kilgore.she would have to show that the confidential nature of the information survived the disclosure,that roush did not waive her claim of confidentiality by sharing her information with a third party.because we conclude that roush did not carry her initial burden,we need not consider the second step in the analysis.
iv.discussion 
evidence of confidential information shared with kilgore 
in support of her claim that she had shared confidential information with kilgore,roush produced the declaration of her attorney aaron markowitz,who stated,in pertinent part
