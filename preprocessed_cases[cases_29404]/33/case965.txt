tompkins,a prisoner under sentence of death and under an active death warrant,appeals from the trial court orders denying motions to vacate his sentence under florida rule of criminal procedure tompkins also petitions to invoke this court authority to issue all writs necessary to complete the exercise of its jurisdiction,or alternatively to issue a writ of habeas corpus,or both.because the orders concern postconviction relief from a sentence of death,this court has jurisdiction of the appeal under article v,section b,florida constitution.additionally,we have jurisdiction over the petition under article v,sections b and b,florida constitution.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we affirm the trial court orders and deny tompkins petition for all writs and habeas relief.
facts and procedural history 
in,wayne tompkins was convicted of the murder of lisa decarr and was sentenced to death on the recommendation of a unanimous jury.this case has a long procedural history.the conviction and death sentence have been reviewed and affirmed on direct appeal and have been the subject of multiple postconviction proceedings,including five postconviction motions,all of which have resulted in a total of eight opinions issued by this court and federal courts the facts of this case are set forth in this court opinion in tompkins direct appeal of his conviction and sentence 
the victim,lisa decarr,aged,disappeared from her home in tampa on march.in june,the victim skeletal remains were found in a shallow grave under the house along with her pink bathrobe and jewelry.based upon a ligature apparently the sash of her bathrobe that was found tied tightly around her neck bones,the medical examiner determined that lisa had been strangled to death.in september,wayne tompkins,the victim mother boyfriend,was charged with the murder.
at trial,the state three key witnesses testified as follows.barbara decarr,the victim mother,testified that she left the house on the morning of march,at approximately,leaving lisa alone in the house.lisa was dressed in her pink bathrobe.barbara met wayne tompkins at his mother house a few blocks away.some time that morning,she sent tompkins back to her house to get some newspapers for packing.when tompkins returned,he told barbara that lisa was watching television in her robe.tompkins then left his mother house again,and barbara did not see or speak to him again until approximately that afternoon.at that time,tompkins told barbara that lisa had run away.he said the last time he saw lisa,she was going to the store and was wearing jeans and a blouse.barbara returned to the osborne street house where she found lisa pocketbook and robe missing but not the clothes described by tompkins.barbara then called the police.
the state next witness,kathy stevens,a close friend of the victim,testified that she had gone to lisa decarr house at approximately on the morning of march.after hearing a loud crash,stevens opened the front door and saw lisa on the couch struggling and hitting tompkins who was on top of her attempting to remove her clothing.lisa asked her to call the police.at that point,stevens left the house but did not call the police.when stevens returned later to retrieve her purse,tompkins answered the door and told her that lisa had left with her mother.stevens also testified that tompkins had made sexual advances towards lisa on two prior occasions.
kenneth turco,the final key state witness,testified that tompkins confided details of the murder to him while they were cellmates in june.turco testified that tompkins told him that lisa was on the sofa when he returned to the house to get some newspapers for packing.when tompkins tried to force himself on her,lisa kicked him in the groin.tompkins then strangled her and buried her under the house along with her pocketbook and some clothing jeans and a top to make it appear as if she had run away.
after the state rested its case,the trial court denied tompkins motion for acquittal,finding that the evidence was sufficient to prove premeditation and that the state had established a prima facie case.the defense rested after the close of the state case without presenting any additional evidence.the jury found tompkins guilty as charged.
at the penalty phase,the state presented evidence from three witnesses to show that tompkins had been convicted of kidnapping and rape stemming from two separate incidents in pasco county which occurred after lisa decarr disappearance.the defense presented testimony from three witnesses regarding tompkins good work record,shy and nonviolent personality,and honesty.
the trial judge,finding three aggravating circumstances previous conviction of felonies involving the use or threat of violence to the person murder committed while the defendant was engaged in an attempt to commit sexual battery murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel and one statutory mitigating circumstance defendant age at the time of the crime,followed the jury recommendation and sentenced tompkins to death.
tompkins i,so d at footnotes omitted.
the complex procedural history of this case is detailed in our most recent opinion,and we therefore do not repeat it in this opinion.see tompkins vi,so d at.in tompkins vi,we reviewed the trial court denial of tompkins third postconviction motion,in which he alleged that new information provided by james davis,lisa decarr boyfriend at the time of her disappearance,significantly impeached the testimony of kathy stevens and required reversal of the conviction and death sentence.so d at specifically,davis stated that he did not see stevens at the corner store on the morning stevens witnessed tompkins assaulting lisa,contrary to stevens testimony.tompkins vi,so d at.the trial court evaluated tompkins claim as one of newly discovered evidence and denied the claim.id.at.
this court affirmed the trial court denial of the claim.this court concluded that although the impeachment evidence could not be viewed as insignificant,when considered with the other evidence presented at trial,it was not of such nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.id.at citing jones state,so d.this court engaged in an extensive analysis to reach this conclusion 
in this case,davis affidavit contradicts stevens testimony regarding her encounter with davis at the corner store,which stevens indicated was part of the reason she did not call the police.however,his statements do not address stevens testimony that she saw tompkins attacking lisa.
further,stevens,who was fifteen when she witnessed the assault and seventeen at the time of trial,was significantly impeached by defense counsel.she waited almost a year to come forward after lisa body was discovered and made previous statements to the prosecutor and decarr that she had no information about lisa disappearance.the state argument to the jury regarding stevens credibility in the face of this impeachment was that stevens had no reason to lie.the statements in davis affidavit do not provide any new information that suggests that stevens did,in fact,have a motive to lie.
this is also not a case where an important witness has recanted his or her testimony.see lightbourne state,so d,remanding for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether newly recanted testimony,when considered cumulatively with all of the evidence indicated that other witnesses testified falsely,required a new hearing.indeed,none of the state three key witnesses decarr,stevens,or recanted.
finally,even when davis affidavit is considered cumulatively with any favorable evidence the state withheld,as alleged in tompkins prior two postconviction motions,we conclude that the motions,files,and records show that tompkins is not entitled to relief under either the materiality prong of brady maryland,d or the second prong of jones.in tompkins iv,we affirmed the summary denial of tompkins brady claims,concluding that e ither the undisclosed documents are not brady material because they are neither favorable to tompkins nor suppressed,or tompkins has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the lack of disclosure.so d at.we further stated that even if we were to engage in a cumulative analysis and consider the undisclosed,favorable documents in conjunction with tompkins claims raised in his first motion for postconviction relief,our conclusion as to prejudice would not change.id.at.we reach the same conclusion in this case.
tompkins vi,so d at citation and footnote omitted.
on december,tompkins filed a fourth successive amended or revised motion to vacate judgment and sentence,raising two claims the existing procedure that the state of florida uses for lethal injection violates the eighth amendment to the united states constitution because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and newly available information,specifically the aba report,evaluating fairness and accuracy in the state death penalty system the florida death penalty assessment report,issued in september,demonstrates that tompkins conviction and sentence of death constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.the state filed a response.the trial court held a case management conference on february,at which the trial court informed the parties that it determined an evidentiary hearing was not necessary based on the nature of tompkins claims.on march,the trial court issued an order summarily denying tompkins motion.tompkins filed a notice of appeal in this court dated may.
on october,tompkins filed a fifth successive amended or revised motion to vacate judgment and sentence raising six claims deprivation of due process rights under chapter,florida statutes,to access public records the governor failure to comply with section,florida statutes,and reset tompkins execution in following the expiration of a stay precludes his execution the failure to reschedule tompkins execution four years ago violates the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment newly discovered evidence,in the form of an affidavit from kimberly quillin formerly kim lisenby that contradicts stevens testimony,demonstrates that tompkins is innocent and his conviction and sentence violate the eighth amendment collateral counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a legible copy of a police report and tompkins conviction and sentence are unconstitutional because the evidence demonstrates he is not guilty the state filed a response.on october,the trial court issued an order summarily denying tompkins motion.tompkins filed a notice of appeal in this court dated october.
on october,tompkins filed his petition for all writs jurisdiction,or alternatively for writ of habeas corpus in this court,raising the following claims,all of which have been raised in either his fourth or fifth successive postconviction motion the governor failure to comply with section and reset tompkins execution in,following the expiration of a stay,precludes his execution failure to reschedule tompkins execution four years ago violates the eighth amendment collateral counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain a legible copy of the police report tompkins conviction and sentence are unconstitutional because the evidence demonstrates he is not guilty and lethal injection violates the eighth amendment.
we now consider both appeals as well as the petition for all writs and habeas relief.
lethal injection 
we first address and reject tompkins claim that he was deprived of his due process rights of notice,opportunity to be heard,and presentation of evidence on his challenge to florida lethal injection procedures.although tompkins acknowledges that these issues were litigated in the emergency all writs petition filed in lightbourne mccollum,so d,cert.denied,d,he claims that the trial court erred in denying him the opportunity to present his own witnesses in support of his challenge to the procedures specifically,tompkins sought to present the following evidence to the trial court that he claimed was not presented in lightbourne testimony from sara dyehouse concerning the memorandum she wrote in on the revisions to the lethal injection protocol testimony from doc secretary mcdonough regarding the dyehouse memorandum testimony from gretl plessinger concerning the dyehouse memorandum and testimony from david varlotta,an anesthesiologist who was a member of the governor commission on administration of lethal injection the commission that was created after the diaz execution to investigate and make recommendations to the governor.
florida rule of criminal procedure governs the filing of postconviction motions in capital cases.rule d generally prohibits the filing of a postconviction motion more than one year after the judgment and sentence become final.an exception permits filing beyond this deadline if the movant alleges that the facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown to the movant or the movant attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.d a.as the state acknowledges,tompkins challenge to the lethal injection protocol satisfies the rule d exception because it was based on the allegedly botched december,execution of angel diaz.rule also provides certain pleading requirements for initial and successive postconviction motions.e.for example,the motion must state the nature of the relief sought.e c,and must include a detailed allegation of the factual basis for any claim for which an evidentiary hearing is sought.e d.
rule f b permits the denial of a successive postconviction motion without an evidentiary hearing i f the motion,files,and records in the case conclusively show that the movant is entitled to no relief.a postconviction court decision regarding whether to grant a rule evidentiary hearing depends on the written materials before the court therefore,for all intents and purposes,its ruling constitutes a pure question of law and is subject to de novo review.see,rose state,so d.in reviewing a trial court summary denial of postconviction relief,this court must accept the defendant allegations as true to the extent that they are not conclusively refuted by the record.see rolling state,so d.
although tompkins fourth successive postconviction motion met the pleading requirements of rule,we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily denying his lethal injection claims.this court has repeatedly rejected appeals from summary denials of eighth amendment challenges to florida august lethal injection protocol since the issuance of lightbourne.see power state,so d,sexton state.weekly,so d,wl,henyard state,so d,cert.denied,d schwab state,so d,wl.june,petition for cert.filed,june,woodel state,so d,petition for cert.filed,lebron state,so d,schwab state,so d,lightbourne,so d at as this court stated in schwab state,so d,given the record in lightbourne and our extensive analysis in our opinion in lightbourne mccollum,we reject the conclusion that lethal injection as applied in florida is unconstitutional.id.at.moreover,there have been two developments since we issued our opinion in lightbourne that support our conclusion that florida lethal injection protocol does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment.the first development was the decision of the supreme court of the united states in baze rees,d,finding this same method of execution,consisting of lethal injection through the same combination under similar protocols,to be constitutional.moreover,we have rejected contentions that baze set a different or higher standard for lethal injection claims than lightbourne.see,henyard,so d at rejecting henyard argument that baze sheds new light on this court decisions because the standard for reviewing eighth amendment challenges was changed and noting that w e have previously concluded in lightbourne and schwab that the florida protocols do not violate any of the possible standards,and that holding can not conflict with the narrow holding in baze.the second development was the performance of two executions in florida,those of mark dean schwab and richard henyard,with no subsequent allegations of any newly discovered problems with florida lethal injection process,such as the problems giving rise to the investigations following the diaz execution.
further,the trial court did not err in not allowing tompkins to present additional witnesses because the proposed testimony of these witnesses does not support a departure from this court precedent,since it has already been considered by this court.the dyehouse memorandum was addressed by this court in lightbourne 
with regard to the dyehouse memorandum recommending the use of a bis monitor to more accurately assess the level of consciousness of the inmate,it might be beneficial to incorporate a device that could monitor the inmate level of sedation to ensure the inmate will not experience subsequent pain of execution.however,the court role regarding the executive branch in carrying out executions is limited to determining whether the current procedures violate the constitutional protections provided for in the eighth amendment.
so d at.further,as tompkins admits,plessinger already testified in the lightbourne evidentiary hearing and her testimony was before this court in lightbourne.finally,in our previous decisions,we fully considered the report and recommendations of the commission,of which varlotta was a member,and the implementation of the report and recommendations by the doc.see schwab,so d at lightbourne,so d at.based on the foregoing,we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily denying relief on this claim 
aba report 
tompkins next raises a claim of newly discovered evidence based on the aba report issued on september,which he alleges identifies numerous defects and flaws in florida capital sentencing scheme that inject arbitrariness into the process.we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily denying this claim,as this court has repeatedly rejected the claim that the aba report in question is newly discovered evidence.this court most recently addressed this issue in power state,so d 
finally,power argued at the circuit court that the aba report entitled evaluating fairness and accuracy in the state death penalty system the florida death penalty assessment report,published september,constitutes newly discovered evidence proving that imposition of the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.power correctly and candidly acknowledges that we rejected this argument in rolling and rutherford state,so d.in both cases,we concluded that this very same aba report did not constitute newly discovered evidence and that nothing in the report would cause this court to recede from its past decisions upholding the facial constitutionality of the death penalty.rolling,so d at citing rutherford,so d at.furthermore,as in rolling and rutherford,power has not allege d how any of the conclusions in the report would render his individual death sentence unconstitutional.rolling,so d at see also rutherford,so d at.for these same reasons,we affirm the circuit court summary denial of power claim.
power,so d at.
tompkins attempts to differentiate his case from power,rolling,and rutherford by arguing that he can demonstrate that his death sentence was imposed on an arbitrary basis.he contends that when this court reversed the trial court order granting a new penalty phase in tompkins iv it acted arbitrarily in requiring him to show something that had not been required in the prior cases he was required to demonstrate that he was denied a neutral,detached judge or that judge coe failed to independently weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at the time the sentencing order was prepared.tompkins claim fails for two reasons.first,this is merely an attempt to relitigate the issue of whether or not tompkins was denied a fair sentencing proceeding as a result of the ex parte communication between the sentencing judge and the prosecutor.this claim was already decided adversely to tompkins in tompkins iv.see so d at.in diaz state,so d,cert.denied,d,this court rejected a similar attempt to relitigate prior claims under the aba report 
unlike rutherford,diaz did allege that many of the failures of the florida death penalty system cited in the aba report were applicable in his case.however,this does not change the conclusion that the report is not newly discovered evidence.furthermore,the failures that diaz cites as applying to his case either have been or could have been litigated by him in his direct appeal and postconviction proceedings.thus,we affirm the circuit court summary denial of this claim.
the second reason this claim fails is that tompkins iv is distinguishable from roberts,riechmann,and card.in roberts,riechmann,and card,this court determined that the sentencing judge failed to conduct an independent review of the aggravating and mitigating factors by engaging in ex parte communications with the state and adopting the state sentencing order.see roberts,so d at riechmann,so d at card,so d at.in contrast,in tompkins iv,this court concluded,tompkins has not demonstrated that he was denied a neutral,detached judge or that judge coe failed to independently weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances at the time the sentencing order was prepared.so d at.accordingly,we reject tompkins argument.
violation of section,florida statutes 
next,tompkins argues that governor crist action on october,in resetting his execution,violated section,florida statutes specifically,tompkins alleges that governor bush was required to reschedule his execution within ten days of the lifting of the stay of execution after this court decision in tompkins iv became final,and therefore governor crist lacked the authority to reset the execution in october.we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily denying this claim.first,the claim is procedurally barred as untimely.this court recently reiterated in hunter state.weekly,so d,wl,
rule requires motions filed beyond the time limitations to specifically allege that the facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown or could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.d a.furthermore,the rule requires successive motions to articulate the reasons why a claim was not raised previously and why the evidence used in support of the claim was not previously available.e b,e c iv.
tompkins failed in his fifth successive postconviction motion to explain why he could not have raised this claim in,when tompkins iv became final and the governor failed to reschedule the execution date within ten days tompkins attempts to circumvent the argument that he failed to raise this claim in a timely manner by arguing that he was under no obligation to make this claim until the governor actually reset his execution in october.tompkins argument concerning an excuse for his delay fails because he did not adequately assert it in the trial court.see green state,so d,finding a claim procedurally barred because it was neither raised in green motion nor addressed by the trial court.
second,even if tompkins had raised this argument in the trial court,there is no authority that supports a claim that section either explicitly or implicitly provides criminal defendants with any enforceable rights and,specifically,a right to a speedy execution.further,shortly after tompkins iv became final,tompkins filed his third postconviction motion,the summary denial of which was not affirmed by this court until in tompkins vi.
accordingly,the trial court did not err in summarily denying tompkins claim that governor crist violated section in resetting his execution.
length of time on death row 
tompkins next claim is that governor bush failure to reset his execution in resulted in tompkins remaining on death row for such a prolonged period of time,years,that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.we reject this claim as we have repeatedly done in the past.in booker state,so d,this court recognized that no federal or state court has accepted the argument that a prolonged stay on death row constitutes cruel and unusual punishment,especially where both parties bear responsibility for the long delay.id.at see also gore state,so d,holding that years served on death row is not cruel and unusual punishment,cert.denied,d elledge state,so d,finding no merit in constitutional claim predicated on the cruel and unusual nature of prolonged stay on death row lucas state,so d,concluding that years on death row does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment foster state,so d,holding that years on death row is not cruel and unusual punishment.
further,tompkins contributed to the delay of his execution by filing five postconviction motions.he can not now contend that his punishment has been illegally prolonged because the delay in carrying out his sentence is in large part due to his own actions in challenging his conviction and sentence.as explained by this court in lucas 
in the years since he was first found guilty of the murder of jill piper,lucas has exercised his constitutional rights in challenging both the finding of guilt and his death sentence.the finding of guilt was upheld in his first direct appeal in and was not challenged in any of the subsequent appeals.lucas is clearly guilty of the murder of jill piper,and it has been determined that the proper sentence is death.lucas exercise of his constitutional rights has prevented his sentence from being carried out.lucas may not now claim that his punishment has been cruel and unusual as a result of his own actions in challenging his death sentence.lucas claim that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this issue is without merit and is denied.
accordingly,in light of this court precedent,we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily denying tompkins claim that his years on death row constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
newly discovered quillin affidavit 
tompkins argues that the trial court erred in summarily denying his newly discovered evidence claim based on the affidavit of one kimberly quillin.by way of background,kathy stevens testified at trial that she went to lisa decarr house alone at approximately on the morning of march.after hearing a loud crash,stevens opened the front door and saw lisa on the couch struggling and hitting tompkins,who was on top of her attempting to remove her clothing.lisa asked stevens to call the police.at that point,stevens left the house,but did not call the police.stevens testified that she later returned to the house with her friend kim 
on october,tompkins obtained a sworn affidavit from kimberly quillin,formerly known as kim lisenby.in this affidavit,quillin stated 
my name is kimberly quillin and i reside in tampa,fl.
in i went by the name of kim lisenby and attended middleton junior high.
in march i do not remember anyone by the name of kathy stevens aka mamroe aka sample.
in march i do not remember anyone by the name of lisa decarr.
i remember that while attending middleton junior high,a rumor that a body was found under a house.
in school started at am and i would have been on the bus from am to about am.
i do not remember any police officer,investigator or anyone else speaking to me about this matter.
in,i was married and using the name kimberly kuhnie and moved to washington.
in his fifth successive postconviction motion,tompkins alleged that neither he nor counsel were able to locate and speak with quillin previously,despite repeated attempts to find her,because kathy stevens testified that kim lisenby accompanied her to lisa decarr house.tompkins asserted that his counsel exercised due diligence in trying to locate kim lisenby,who is now kim quillin.tompkins contended that quillin affidavit contradicted stevens testimony.
we disagree with tompkins contention that the trial court erred in summarily denying this newly discovered evidence claim,but do so on the basis of the second prong of a newly discovered evidence claim rather than due diligence.to obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence,a defendant must meet two requirements first,the evidence must not have been known by the trial court,the party,or counsel at the time of trial,and it must appear that the defendant or defense counsel could not have known of it by the use of diligence.second,the newly discovered evidence must be of such nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.see jones state,so d,jones iii.newly discovered evidence satisfies the second prong of the jones iii test if it weakens the case against the defendant so as to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his culpability.jones iii,so d at quoting jones state,so d,jones ii.if the defendant is seeking to vacate a sentence,the second prong requires that the newly discovered evidence would probably yield a less severe sentence.see jones state,so d,jones i.
in determining whether the evidence compels a new trial,the trial court must consider all newly discovered evidence which would be admissible,and must evaluate the weight of both the newly discovered evidence and the evidence which was introduced at the trial.id.at.this determination includes 
whether the evidence goes to the merits of the case or whether it constitutes impeachment evidence.the trial court should also determine whether this evidence is cumulative to other evidence in the case.the trial court should further consider the materiality and relevance of the evidence and any inconsistencies in the newly discovered evidence.
jones iii,so d at citations omitted.the summary denial of a newly discovered evidence claim will be upheld if the motion is legally insufficient or its allegations are conclusively refuted by the record.mclin state,so d.
although the trial court found that tompkins claim was untimely because tompkins and counsel were aware of quillin existence,albeit under a different surname,as early as,this court need not address the timeliness of tompkins claim because the trial court properly summarily denied relief based on the second prong of jones.this evidence is not of such nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.jones iii,so d at.the state presented the testimony of three key witnesses at decarr,kathy stevens,and kenneth turco.although tompkins attempts to characterize quillin affidavit as significant new evidence,the affidavit has at best minimal impeachment value.moreover,stevens affidavit does not constitute the type of evidence this court has held requires an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.this is not a case where an important witness has recanted his or her testimony,see lightbourne state,so d remanding for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether newly recanted testimony,when considered cumulatively with all of the evidence that indicated other witnesses testified falsely,required a new penalty phase hearing,or where the defense has credible new evidence that another person may have committed the murder.as this court explained in tompkins vi when evaluating tompkins claim that james davis affidavit was newly discovered evidence n one of the state three key witnesses decarr,stevens,or recanted.so d at.this court also concluded in tompkins vi in affirming the summary denial 
tompkins case is more akin to sims state,so d,in which the court affirmed the denial of a newly discovered evidence claim based on hearsay statements that a person other than the defendant committed the crime.the court noted that the evidence was admissible solely for impeachment purposes,did not place the alternative suspect at the scene of the crime,and did not affect the testimony of the three eyewitnesses who identified the defendant as the perpetrator.see id.at.the court also observed that the defendant had not presented any evidence that directly refuted the state case.see id.at.
tompkins vi,so d at.
tompkins also asserts that when quillin affidavit is evaluated cumulatively with all of the exculpatory evidence learned during collateral proceedings,it is clear that a reasonable juror would have had more than reasonable doubt about tompkins guilt and he would have been acquitted.however,we conclude that the motion,files,and records conclusively show that tompkins is not entitled to relief.see mclin,so d at.as explained in tompkins vi,this court in tompkins iv affirmed the summary denial of tompkins brady claims,concluding that e ither the undisclosed documents are not brady material because they are neither favorable to tompkins nor suppressed,or tompkins has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the lack of disclosure.tompkins iv,so d at see also tompkins vi,so d at.the court further concluded in tompkins iv e ven if we were to engage in a cumulative analysis and consider the undisclosed,favorable documents in conjunction with tompkins claims raised in his first motion for postconviction relief,our conclusion as to prejudice would not change.so d at.in tompkins vi,this court reached the same conclusion as to davis affidavit.so d at.even assuming the truth of each allegation,at the most quillin asserts only that she does not remember anyone by the name of kathy stevens.on its face,it would appear that a possible explanation for quillin lack of memory is that years have passed.however,we need not reach the credibility of the witnesses.notably,none of the three main witnesses have ever recanted or changed their testimony.because quillin affidavit is of marginal weight,it does not alter our prior conclusions that a cumulative analysis of the evidence favorable to tompkins does not entitle him to a new trial.
accordingly,the trial court did not err in summarily denying tompkins claim of newly discovered evidence in the form of quillin affidavit.
ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel 
tompkins next argues that the trial court erred in summarily denying his claim that postconviction counsel rendered ineffective assistance by negligently failing to obtain a legible copy of a march,police report,which tompkins alleges demonstrates that an individual named wendy chancey reported seeing the victim alive and well after the time the state asserted that tompkins had killed her.in an attempt to provide a legal basis for this claim,tompkins contends that this court recent decision in jimenez state.weekly,so d,wl.june,implicitly overturned lambrix state,so d,which held that claims of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel do not present a valid basis for relief.we disagree and reject this claim.
this court did not implicitly overrule lambrix in jimenez.this court has made it clear that it does not intentionally overrule itself sub silentio.state ruiz,so d,quoting puryear state,so d.in fact,this court recognized in jimenez that claims of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel are not cognizable.see.weekly at,so d at concluding that jimenez could not assert in his successive rule motion that postconviction counsel was ineffective citing kokal state,so d,we have repeatedly held that claims of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel are not cognizable.further,this court recently reiterated its holding that ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel is not a cognizable claim in gonzalez state,so d,a case decided after jimenez.see gonzalez,so d at to the extent that gonzalez is making an ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel claim,this court has repeatedly rejected such a claim.citing waterhouse state,so d lambrix.
thus,the trial court did not err in summarily denying this claim.
actual innocence 
in his next claim,tompkins argues that the trial court erred in summarily denying his claim of actual innocence.tompkins urges this court to recognize a freestanding claim of actual innocence and permit him to present all exculpatory evidence as to his innocence.we reject this claim.
in rutherford,this court rejected the claim that florida failure to recognize a freestanding actual innocence claim violates the eighth amendment.so d at.under florida law,this court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal.if new evidence subsequently surfaces,florida law allows a defendant to bring a newly discovered evidence claim,as announced in jones.as explained previously in this opinion,however,tompkins fails to meet the test for newly discovered evidence based on the quillin affidavit.this court also determined in tompkins vi that tompkins failed to meet the newly discovered evidence test when he presented the davis affidavit.so d at.further,to the extent tompkins argues,as he seemingly did in his claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel,that this court should permit him to present the copy of the march,police report,this court and the federal courts have repeatedly rejected tompkins similar arguments related to this report.see tompkins ii,so d at affirming trial court denial of tompkins claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce the testimony of wendy chancey,who claimed to have seen lisa decarr after the time the state contended the murder took place tompkins iii,at affirming federal district court denial of tompkins federal habeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance claim regarding wendy chancey as raised in tompkins ii tompkins iv,so d at affirming the trial court summary denial of tompkins brady claim in his second postconviction motion,alleging that the state withheld the march,police report containing several statements made by chancey.
in fact,the standard in florida for a newly discovered evidence claim is more liberal than the standard for raising an actual innocence claim in federal courts.under federal law,a defendant is required to produce new reliable it be exculpatory scientific evidence,trustworthy eyewitness accounts,or critical physical was not presented at trial for a claim of actual innocence to be considered.house bell,d quoting schlup delo,d.moreover,that new evidence must establish that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in light of all of the available evidence.id.at.quoting schlup,at.a ctual innocence means factual innocence,not mere legal insufficiency.bousley united states,d.moreover,the federal courts have required that defendants asserting actual innocence show that they have been diligent in presenting their claims.see gildon bowen,cir baker norris,cir david hall,cir flanders graves,cir.here,tompkins does not present any new,reliable evidence establishing that he is factually innocent of the crime.at most,the series of postconviction motions he filed attempted to impeach the three main witnesses,none of whom have changed the significant inculpatory aspect of their testimony.turco testimony that tompkins told him he killed lisa and buried her under the house remains unrefuted,as does stevens testimony that tompkins was last seen on top of lisa and barbara decarr testimony that tompkins lied to her and told her that lisa ran away.therefore,tompkins not only fails,and has failed in the past,to meet the newly discovered evidence standard with regard to the allegedly exculpatory evidence he asserts,but he also fails to meet the first requirement of the federal standard as articulated in house 
accordingly,the trial court did not err in summarily denying tompkins actual innocence claim.
public records 
tompkins final argument in his appeal is that the trial court erred in summarily denying his claim that he was deprived of his rights under chapter,florida statutes,and florida rule of criminal procedure,when the trial court granted the objections of fdle and doc to his public records requests.we disagree.
the record conclusively shows that tompkins is not entitled to relief on this claim because the records he requested from doc and fdle were neither relevant nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this case,as required by rule i c the trial court had already rejected tompkins lethal injection claim in his fourth successive motion for postconviction relief,on march.see rutherford state,so d,affirming trial court summary denial of rutherford public records requests in part because the records sought from these agencies are not related to a colorable claim for postconviction relief because the scientific evidence rutherford relies on does not require this court to reconsider our holding that florida lethal injection procedure does not violate the eighth amendment.further,tompkins failed to allege that anything had changed since the time the trial court denied his fourth successive postconviction motion to warrant the court revisiting its decision.see rodriguez state,so d,upholding denial of public records requests where the defendant has not met his burden of showing that the allegedly missing records will lead to new information.as explained previously in connection with our discussion of lethal injection,since the trial court issued its order rejecting tompkins lethal injection claim,this court has repeatedly upheld summary denial of challenges to florida lethal injection procedure.see power,so d at sexton.weekly at,so d at henyard,so d at.moreover,there have been no allegations of any specific problems with florida lethal injection procedures following the schwab and henyard executions that might give rise to a different eighth amendment claim than the one rejected in lightbourne.as we explained in lightbourne,
our precedent makes clear that this court role is not to micromanage the executive branch in fulfilling its own duties relating to executions.we will not the doc personnel decisions,so long as the lethal injection protocol reasonably states,as it does here,relevant qualifications for those individuals who are chosen.
thus,the trial court did not err in summarily denying tompkins claim that he was deprived of his rights under chapter,florida statutes,and rule,when the trial court granted fdle and doc objections to his public records requests.
tompkins motion for relinquishment of jurisdiction for consideration of new evidence 
finally,we address tompkins most recent allegations set forth in his motion for relinquishment filed in this court on november.the motion requested that we relinquish jurisdiction to the trial court so that he could present a rule motion premised on the recent disclosure by the state of a sworn statement of one of the key witnesses,kenneth turco,taken on october,in this statement,turco stated that a defense investigator came to his home in to speak to him regarding this case.turco stated that the defense investigator asked him to sign an affidavit as to what michael bonito sic had to offer in the case.turco stated that he told the defense investigator that he would not sign the affidavit.when asked by the state what the defense investigator was talking about regarding benito and the affidavit,turco replied 
well,michael bonito sic at the time of to the testimony,and naturally we met at the hillsborough county jail,went into a little room and as i was telling him what happened he told told me,he said do forget the purse.she was buried with a purse.make sure you add that in your testimony,and i did.
turco then confirmed that everything he testified to at trial was the truth except for the testimony about the pocketbook,which the state told him to mention.
we denied this motion by order dated november,we also struck two footnotes from the state response suggesting improper investigative tactics on the part of the defense investigator.the dissent states that turco allegations that the state told him not to forget the purse were unrefuted.however,in a separate sworn statement by benito,dated october,also provided by the state,he emphatically denied any wrongdoing.nevertheless,for the purpose of summary disposition,we have evaluated this claim as one brought under giglio united states,d,and also assumed that the defense did not know of this evidence in.we thus have assumed the truth of turco statement that benito told turco to mention the pocketbook in his testimony.in rhodes state,so d,this court explained 
to establish a giglio violation,a defendant must show that the prosecutor presented or failed to correct false testimony the prosecutor knew the testimony was false and the false evidence was material.see guzman state,so d.once the first two prongs are established,the false evidence is deemed material if there is any reasonable possibility that it could have affected the jury verdict.see id.under this standard,the state has the burden to prove that the false testimony was not material by demonstrating it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see also mordenti state,so d.
rhodes,so d at.even assuming the first two elements of the giglio test,as a matter of law,tompkins can not satisfy the third element.even if the state knowingly presented false testimony about tompkins telling turco that he buried lisa decarr pocketbook,there is no reasonable possibility that it could have affected the jury verdict and would thus be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.turco testimony that tompkins told him he killed lisa and buried her under the house remains unrefuted,as do all of the other details of his testimony rather than recanting the details of his testimony,turco was emphatic in his october statement that tompkins had confessed the details of this crime to him 
the state okay.going back to the testimony that you provided at the deposition and then at the trial,did you give the deposition and trial from information that somebody told you other than wayne tompkins 
turco no,sir.the testimony i gave solely came from tompkins himself,and i could live with it on my conscience and i was already going to get two years probation for the charge i was in there for which was escape from a work release center which was no great big thing to me at the time,and that it,you know.
the state and then your testimony regarding who killed the victim when tompkins told you about that 
turco is true.
the state that the truth 
turco yes.the whole testimony is the truth except about the part about the purse.
the state okay.turco,that all the questions i have.is there anything else that you testified to that was not told to you by tompkins or anything else that bonito sic told you that you did tell me or anything like that 
turco shakes head negatively.no.i gave the truth.i told the truth.it that simple.you know,i did do it for any deal.i did it for my conscience more than anything 
thus,tompkins giglio claim fails because the allegedly false testimony does not satisfy the third element of giglio.
conclusion 
for the reasons discussed above,we affirm the trial court summary denial of tompkins fourth and fifth successive motions for postconviction relief and we also deny his petition for all writs jurisdiction,or alternatively for writ of habeas corpus,or both 
it is so ordered.
i can not agree with the majority summary rejection of the defendant unrefuted claim that the state unlawfully manufactured critical evidence against him.it is apparent on the face of the claim that its proper resolution requires evidentiary development before a trier of fact who,among other things,can make credibility determinations.
