on march,a federal grand jury sitting in the southern district of florida issued a superseding indictment alleging that the defendant in this case,juan almeida,committed several crimes when he made arrangements to distribute large quantities of cocaine to new york and russia.almeida was charged in nine of the thirty counts and he was ultimately convicted on count two cocaine conspiracy.the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on the remaining counts,save for those which the government dismissed prior to trial 
the conspiracy to distribute cocaine allegedly encompassed three ventures that were undertaken between and.the first venture,the government contends,took place in the late when almeida,along with fugitive nelson tony yester,coordinated the transportation of several shipments of cocaine from miami to new york the second venture entailed a grandiose scheme to acquire a world war russian submarine for a colombian drug cartel.the third venture involved a plan to conceal cocaine inside shipments of shrimp.the government star witness with respect to the submarine and shrimp ventures was one ludwig tarzan fainberg,a immigrant who was charged in the conspiracy and ultimately pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.
almeida and fainberg each hired their own defense attorneys.they believed,however,that some coordination might be useful in defeating the government since many of the government exhibits were recordings of russian conversations and fainberg was fluent in the language the therefore entered into an oral joint defense agreement.according to almeida counsel,countless volumes of and work product information were shared between the parties and dozens of meetings totaling well over hours were held.
on february,approximately one month before trial,fainberg decided to defect from the united front.in return for his testimony against almeida,the government allowed fainberg to plead to a single count of racketeering in the government view,this change of heart required the district court to address two key,the alleged existence of an privilege and a possible conflict of interest.
during the government case in chief,the prosecutor informed the court in the absence of the jury that fainberg would be her next witness and that she expected him to assert his privilege with almeida counsel.the following colloquy ensued.the prosecutor said that when fainberg spoke to almeida counsel in connection with the joint defense,it was just as if fainberg was talking to his own attorney and t herefore,the attorney client privilege would exist.this,according to the prosecutor,showed that almeida counsel was impaired because of a conflict of interest.how could almeida attorney effectively fainberg when almeida attorney essentially represented almeida and fainberg almeida counsel,the prosecutor asserted,suffered from a classic divided loyalty problem.the prosecutor therefore urged the district court to prohibit almeida lawyers from using any confidential information they had obtained from fainberg during the two years in which the joint defense privilege was in operation and conduct a rule c hearing so that the court could either obtain a conflicts waiver from almeida or else require the withdrawal of almeida counsel for purposes of fainberg.
the court apparently thought that almeida attorney was not laboring under a conflict of interest it was concerned,however,about the possibility that in fainberg,the attorney might elicit or make use of privileged information.the court therefore decided to hear from fainberg fainberg took the stand and almeida attorney asked that fainberg summarize the information that he conveyed to almeida defense team.the prosecutor,assuming the right to act as fainberg attorney,objected on the grounds that such communications could not be repeated,lest a revelation of the confidential communications in open court amount to a waiver.although fainberg acknowledged that the information would be useful both in him and other witnesses and in locating defense witnesses,the court sustained the prosecutor objection.
referring to the prosecutor privilege claim,the court found that a joint defense agreement existed and concluded that this agreement precluded almeida counsel from using any information obtained from fainberg in connection with the joint defense.the court not only barred counsel use of fainberg communications during but also the derivative use of the communications defense counsel response to the court ruling was that the court would be committing error if it severely limited their ability to fainberg.four days later,the court issued a written order hereinafter order that essentially reiterated its ruling from the bench,asserting that i t is a matter of ethics and that i n the absence of fainberg attorney,the government,as a party with an interest,may make objections or arguments to the end of protecting the privilege.faced with the court ruling,almeida counsel advised the court that they had every intention of following the court order and would tend to ask questions that are not within any area that could be privileged.the court did not,however,require the substitution of new counsel as the government urged.indeed,the court never undertook a rule c hearing to ascertain the existence of a conflict of interest.
what testimony would have been presented but for the order ordinarily,such a sweeping order would have prevented any sort of proffer,and a reviewing court could only speculate as to what might have been revealed to the jury.in this case,however,the stage of the litigation provides tremendous insight into the likely effect of the court ruling.after the jury found him guilty of count two of the indictment,almeida moved the court for a new trial.armed with fainberg signed waiver of any privileges,he asked the court to lift the restrictions contained in the order.the court,citing fainberg waiver,lifted the restrictions.the court also indicated that its trial ruling had been mistaken and that once fainberg defected to the prosecutorial camp,he had no privilege with respect to almeida counsel.
our first glimpse into what would have been revealed but for the court exclusionary ruling comes in the form of fainberg recantation.had almeida counsel been able to reveal the statements made by fainberg during the joint defense strategy sessions,fainberg statements might have been similar to the story he told after the jury rendered its verdict.in a deposition,fainberg denied conspiring with almeida to buy or sell submarines.he claimed that almeida was not guilty of the charges and that the government concocted a case based upon fainberg macho talk that nobody believed.fainberg recalled that he related this position to one of almeida lawyers during a joint defense strategy session,but that he had to change his testimony in order to get himself out of the situation.
we also have a glimpse at what sort of evidence was missing from the jury room due to the derivative component of the order.fainberg once advised an investigator that one armando fernandez had information about ricardo olmedo and alexis de la two witnesses instrumental to the government case concerning the alleged new york distribution conspiracy.after the ban on almeida counsel was lifted,almeida team visited fernandez,who claimed that he had seen olmedo and de la nuez colluding to present false testimony about almeida in order to obtain sentence reductions defense counsel further proffered the corroborating testimony of as many as fifteen other inmates who allegedly saw olmedo and de la nuez openly talking about juan almeida,and getting the ir stories straight and later bragging to them about how they lied against almeida.but for the district court exclusionary ruling,the defense might have elicited testimony about possible collusion between olmedo and de la nuez to commit from fernandez or the fifteen other witnesses.
reviewing the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,see united states marshall,cir citation omitted,we hold that the court abused its discretion when it precluded almeida from utilizing the communications that fainberg made to almeida attorneys while operating under the joint defense agreement.we believe that fainberg waived the privilege when he agreed to plead guilty and testify against almeida in exchange for the government dismissal of several counts in the indictment.the district court was correct when it conceded in its order denying a new trial that its exclusionary ruling was erroneous,although the court incorrectly concluded that its error was harmless 
like the government contention at trial,almeida principal argument on appeal focuses upon the conflict of interest that allegedly interfered with the ability of almeida counsel to effectively represent their client.it is true that the sixth amendment right to have the effective assistance of counsel encompasses the right to have counsel untainted by conflicts of interest.see holloway arkansas,d cuyler sullivan,d.but the case law does not address the much more tenuous claim of ineffective representation that arises in the joint defense agreement scenario.in the prototypical case,an attorney initially represents two defendants and is forced to one of them in the same proceeding or a successive proceeding.in such a case,the attorney owes each client a duty of loyalty.the attorney faces an impossible choice he can either vigorously the and thereby violate his duty of loyalty to the client on the witness stand,or he can temper his and risk violating his duty of loyalty to the client on trial 
when enter into a joint defense agreement,by contrast,each defendant retains his own attorney.as we discuss below,confidential communications made during joint defense strategy sessions are privileged.see wilson abraham const.armco steel,cir united states schwimmer,cir.a duty of loyalty,however,does not exist in this situation and it is therefore improper to conclude that all of the attorneys in the joint defense strategy session represent all of the participating defendants.any potential conflict of interest arises solely from the fact that when defendant b becomes a witness for the state,the attorney for defendant a must make sure that the privilege is respected and that confidential communications are not revealed.the mere inability to utilize the privileged communications is not itself a manifestation of a conflict of interest,because no lawyer in the world could utilize those communications rather,the potential conflict of interest stems from the fact that defendant a lawyer might be so due to his fear of revealing the confidential communications made by defendant b that his representation of defendant a suffers since the degree to which defendant a lawyer is impaired may be de minimis,the rules announced by cuyler and holloway might be inapplicable or subject to modification in this scenario.we need not decide the issue,however,because we hold that fainberg waived his privilege when he turned state evidence,thereby entirely removing the possibility of a conflict of interest from the case.
the privilege is intended to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.upjohn united states,d.more broadly,the privilege is grounded in the interest and administration of justice,of the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice,which assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free from the consequences or the apprehension of disclosure.hunt blackburn.
when a defendant conveys information to the lawyer of his,as opposed to his own lawyer,the justification for protecting the confidentiality of the information is weak.the policy of fostering frank communication with an attorney is already facilitated by privileging those communications made to the defendant own attorney little can be gained by extending the privilege to those communications made to attorneys that do not represent the defendant.on the other hand,in light of the vast resources of the government,it is perhaps appropriate that be given the opportunity to collaborate on defense tactics and exchange information in a confidential fashion without forcing the defendants to hire the same situation that is almost always ripe with real conflicts of interest.therefore,many courts have held that the privilege gives rise to a concomitant joint defense privilege which serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to the attorney for another party where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel.schwimmer,at.as the second circuit observed,the need to protect the free flow of information from client to attorney logically exists whenever multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.
the privilege is riddled with many exceptions,two of which are most relevant to this case.many jurisdictions,including the former fifth circuit,have held that where the same attorney acts for two or more parties having a common interest,neither party may exercise the privilege in a subsequent controversy with the other.garner wolfinbarger,cir.a leading treatise further explains that w hen two or more persons jointly consult an attorney and subsequently become engaged in a controversy in which the communications at their joint consultation with the lawyer may be vitally material,then it is clear that the privilege is inapplicable.john strong et,mccormick on evidence ed.the treatise asserts that there are two rationales for the rule 
in the first place the policy of encouraging disclosure by holding out the promise of protection seems inapposite,since as between themselves neither would know whether he would be more helped or handicapped,if in any dispute between them,both could invoke the shield of secrecy.and secondly it is said that they had obviously no intention of keeping these secretes from each other,and hence as between themselves it was not intended to be confidential.
it is also an ancient rule in many jurisdictions that where an accomplice turns state evidence and attempts to convict others by testimony which also convicts himself,he thereby waives the privilege against disclosing communications between himself and counsel.see habeeb,annotation,party waiver of privilege as to communications with counsel by taking stand and testifying.in the nearly case of alderman people,internal citations omitted,for example,the court said as follows 
but there is a broader ground upon which the admission of the excluded evidence may be based,and that is,the witness was an accomplice in the crime for which the defendants,his associates,were on trial.he had been led to give evidence for the people under an express or implied promise of pardon,or that he should not be prosecuted,on condition that he should make a full and fair confession of the truth.it is a rule of law,that no witness shall be required to answer any question that may tend to criminate himself,yet the accomplice,when he enters the witness box with a view of escaping punishment himself,by a betrayal of his in crime,yields up and leaves that privilege behind him.he contracts to make a full statement,to keep back nothing,although in doing so he may but confirm his own guilt and infamy.if he fails to do so in full,if he knowingly keeps back any portion of the history of the crime he undertakes to narrate,he forfeits his right to pardon,and may be proceeded against and convicted upon his own confession,already made.we think an accomplice who makes himself a witness for the people should be required to give a full and complete statement of all that he and his associates have done or said,relative to the crime charged,no matter when or where done,or to whom said.he should be allowed no privileged communications.these he has voluntarily surrendered.the enforcement of such a rule may be the only protection the party on trial has only means remaining to him to meet,it may be,the perjury of the criminal upon the witness stand.
similarly,in the venerable case of jones state,so,internal citations omitted,the court described the waive
