background 
on july,mhc through its midamerican capital company invested million in racom by purchasing preferred stock in racom as part of the stock purchase agreement,mhc gained two of seven seats on racom board.eventually,dennis melstad,mhc president,and ronald stepien held mhc two seats on the board.stepien served as the vice president,and later president,of midamerican energy.
the stock purchase agreement also gave mhc a put on its preferred share,by which mhc could tender the preferred share back to racom for its original price,in addition to any accrued or unpaid dividends,in the event that racom did not meet certain specified financial conditions by july.under this provision,mhc would have until september,to tender the put and then racom was required to meet the obligation with cash within ninety days of receiving mhc notice of exercising its right.
on june,mhc loaned racom million for one year to resolve a dispute with another shareholder.after one year,mhc extended the loan at a higher interest rate.
in january,mhc accepted shares of racom common stock in exchange for its forbearance of certain rights relating to payment of dividends due but not paid.in addition,the common stock agreement also stated that racom would issue an additional shares of common stock should mhc exercise its put right.
beginning in,melstad,on behalf of mhc,began preparing for mhc exit from racom.on september,mhc exercised its put right.mhc estimated that racom was obligated to pay based on accrued and unpaid dividends after mhc exercised its put rights,racom removed melstad and stepien from racom board.
this resulted in mhc filing two lawsuits in november against racom in delaware,racom place of incorporation.in the first lawsuit,mhc and melstad sought inspection of certain corporate books and records of racom.the second lawsuit alleged that racom illegally removed mhc representatives from racom board.a different law firm represented racom in the delaware action.
on december,racom filed a declaratory action in iowa state court,seeking a determination of the validity of certain actions of racom board and the validity of the original stock purchase agreement.mhc removed the case to federal court in iowa 
on december,mhc filed the instant action seeking repayment of the loan and the issuance of additional common stock.before racom had an opportunity to respond,mhc moved for summary judgment on january.
approximately three weeks later,racom deposed melstad,stepien,garry osborn and gregg in the delaware litigation.in addition,mhc produced approximately pages of documents for the delaware litigation,which included a partially redacted mhc exit strategy memo.the parties had not conducted or requested any discovery in the iowa litigation.
on january,shuttleworth filed an answer and counterclaim on behalf of racom to the iowa federal claims.the pleadings asserted compulsory counterclaims of fraud,rico,slander per se,and breach of fiduciary duty.shuttleworth asserted defenses of fraudulent inducement,lack of corporate board authority,and lack of consideration.shuttleworth believed that mhc had committed fraud in order to takeover racom business,that melstad and stepien did not act in the best interest of racom,that melstad and stepien had not been elected by racom shareholders as provided for in racom charter,and that several agreements between mhc and racom were invalid.
on march,mhc filed a motion for summary judgment on racom counterclaims in the iowa case.racom responded by filing for a continuance pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,requesting ninety days to conduct discovery,including the opportunity to depose stepien,melstad,and david sokol after reviewing the delaware depositions,including stepien and melstad delaware depositions,the district court denied racom motion,concluding that further discovery was not likely to uncover any information helpful to racom in defeating the motions for summary judgment.app.at.racom then filed a motion for reconsideration,explaining the discovery conducted in the two delaware lawsuits was unrelated to its counterclaims.the district court also denied racom motion for reconsideration.
as previously stated,the district court ordered a show cause hearing to allow shuttleworth an opportunity to explain why the district court should not impose sanctions against it.at the hearing,shuttleworth called five attorneys as witnesses.four of the witnesses were shuttleworth attorneys kevin collins,the partner responsible for the case sarah gayer,the associate who drafted the resistances to mhc summary judgment motions caroll reasoner,a partner with the firm specializing in corporate law who consulted with collins and gayer on the case and bob houghton,who testified to the prestige of the law firm and the accomplishments of its attorneys.finally,richard dick smith,a long time iowa practitioner,testified that in his professional judgment shuttleworth did not violate rule because they acted reasonably and in good faith.the court determined that shuttleworth and its attorneys violated rule by pursuing frivolous defenses and claims with the purpose of delaying payment to mhc.the court sanctioned shuttleworth in the amount of.shuttleworth timely appeals.
