leamon ray cavitt,appeals the district court denial of his motion to vacate conviction,filed pursuant to.we vacate the judgment of the court below and remand for an evidentiary hearing.
background 
on october,texas state trooper nick granelli granelli or the trooper stopped leamon ray cavitt,cavitt on highway after observing him speeding in a construction zone and failing to signal before changing lanes.a search of the rented dodge grand caravan driven by cavitt revealed five kilograms of cocaine.
on november,cavitt was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of a,and aiding and abetting under.represented at his initial appearance on april,by the federal public defender,cavitt entered an initial plea of not guilty.subsequently,through retained counsel barrett keith brown brown and pursuant to a written plea agreement that included a waiver of all rights to appeal,cavitt changed his plea on the possession charge to guilty.
a video camera mounted inside the patrol car and a microphone attached to trooper granelli clothing recorded the entire encounter between granelli and cavitt,as well as granelli conversations with police detective jon britton britton.after entering his guilty plea,cavitt obtained a copy of the recording.
upon reviewing the video,cavitt concluded that the vehicle search was justified neither by reasonable suspicion nor by consent.he decided to release attorney brown and to retain michael heiskell as counsel.with heiskell assistance,cavitt filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and a motion to suppress.in his motion to withdraw,cavitt argued that although the facts of the case justified the filing of a motion to suppress,brown had refused to file such a motion on the basis that cavitt consented to the search,which,according to brown,vitiated any suppression issue.cavitt motion to suppress included arguments that the search was unconstitutional under the fourth amendment because the detention extended beyond the valid reason for the initial stop,that no reasonable suspicion existed to extend the detention,and that the consent cavitt gave to search the was not an act of free will.
the district court denied the motion to withdraw,but never ruled on the suppression motion.cavitt moved for reconsideration and requested a hearing on the motion,claiming,among other things,that brown had recommended a guilty plea without first viewing a videotape recording of the stop brown refused to permit cavitt to view the videotape until after he entered a guilty plea and brown had failed to advise cavitt that he could enter a conditional plea pursue a motion to suppress without sacrificing a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.without holding a hearing,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and sentenced cavitt to months in prison.
cavitt did not appeal instead,approximately four months after entry of judgment,cavitt filed a motion pursuant to,seeking to vacate his conviction and claiming that the search violated the fourth amendment brown rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue a motion to suppress and the plea was not voluntary due to brown ineffectiveness,including specifically brown failure to advise cavitt of his right to seek a conditional plea agreement.
without holding an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge assigned to handle the motion issued a report and recommendation.the concluded that brown did not render ineffective assistance of counsel because cavitt had not shown that but for brown alleged errors he would have rejected the plea agreement and demanded a trial.the magistrate also determined that seeking suppression would have been a futile effort,as reasonable suspicion justified the search and cavitt consented to the search.accordingly,the magistrate judge reasoned,counsel belief that the motion would do more harm than good was a reasonable one.the also found that brown failure to inform cavitt of the availability of a conditional plea did not compromise the voluntariness of the plea because before cavitt entered the agreement,brown informed cavitt of the maximum possible sentence,and he was sentenced within the statutory sentencing range.the magistrate judge further concluded that cavitt failed to demonstrate harm because neither the government nor the trial court was bound to accept a conditional plea.finding cavitt objections to the without merit,the district court adopted the and dismissed cavitt motion.cavitt filed a timely notice of appeal and sought a certificate of appealability coa from the district court,reurging his previous arguments and asserting that the court erred by dismissing his motion without an evidentiary hearing.the district court concluded that any claims regarding the search and seizure should have been raised on direct appeal pursuant to stone powell,d,and that no evidentiary hearing was required in light of cavitt voluntary guilty plea and absence of ineffective counsel in leading to that plea.accordingly,the court denied the coa.
cavitt then sought a coa from this court,and we certified the following on appeal whether brown failure to file and pursue a motion to suppress constituted ineffective assistance of counsel,whether brown failure to advise cavitt regarding the viability of the fourth amendment claim constituted ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to cavitt decision to plead guilty,and whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing.
as noted above,cavitt relies on a videotape recording of the vehicle stop and the subsequent search.the narrative and dialogue that follow are drawn directly from that recording and from uncontested facts reflected in the record.
on the rainy evening of october,at approximately in the evening,granelli stopped cavitt after observing him speeding in a construction zone and failing to signal before changing lanes on highway.granelli approached the passenger side of the rented and driven by cavitt and leaned into the window.
granelli asked cavitt for his driver license.upon viewing the license cavitt presented,granelli observed that the photo did not closely resemble cavitt boy,you changed a lot in this picture lost a bunch of weight granelli proceeded to question cavitt regarding his itinerary.cavitt informed the trooper that he was traveling back to his home in east louis,illinois after visiting with his daughter in lancaster,texas.granelli requested rental documents for the,which cavitt furnished.
granelli then requested permission to sit in the passenger seat,commenting that he wanted to get out of the wet weathers sic.once inside,the trooper,apparently having noticed some bags inside the vehicle,asked cavitt if he was moving.cavitt explained that he had recently gone shopping.granelli also inquired about cavitt occupation,and cavitt responded that he was a realtor.the trooper next informed cavitt that he would be returning to his patrol car to issue cavitt a warning.granelli indicated that he would return shortly.
as granelli walked back to his car,the rain intensified.inside the patrol car,granelli said to detective jon britton,i sure would love to search this guy.granelli and britton discussed cavitt itinerary and the fact that he was driving a rental vehicle.granelli voiced skepticism of cavitt claim that he had driven to texas to visit his daughter and his statement that he had done some shopping.in particular,the time and place the was,at in east louis,the time it was due back at the,both officers pause.britton remarked of it,that odd,is it granelli responded,yeah,that real sic odd.the trooper also pointed out to britton that,he cavitt do sic look much like that driver license picture.
granelli commented that cavitt did look real sic nervous,though of course he was sitting down.the trooper then proposed a plan i going to tell him we gon na have to get off the road.he radioed cavitt driver license number and tag information to dispatch and mused,i wonder if there some place we can get out of the weather.granelli then remarked again regarding the license photo he looks like a black male,but his driver license britton,apparently still curious about cavitt itinerary,asked granelli to repeat the details of the vehicle rental.
granelli said again,i think i going to see if he follow me up to the texaco station.the rain intensified,and there follows a period of silence during which the officers apparently waited for the storm to abate.after again noting that cavitt had not seemed nervous,granelli resolved i gon na just go if he follow me over there,so i can get my business done without getting everything wet.think that will alarm him too much if i go do that 
once the license check came back negative and the rain died down,granelli exited the patrol vehicle and again approached the.he said to cavitt,i got a warning for you to sign but i ca do it in this weather can you follow me here up the road and we get out of the rain real quick cavitt agreed to follow the officers up to the next exit.upon returning to the car,granelli once again commented that cavitt seemed relaxed.britton asked granelli if cavitt was traveling with any luggage,and the trooper responded that he could tell.
the two cars pulled over at a truck stop approximately six minutes later.when cavitt arrived,the trooper directed him to pull up next to the patrol car,under an overhang both officers approached cavitt vehicle.instead of immediately asking cavitt to sign the warning and returning the driver license,the trooper told cavitt that he was previously unable to examine the rental papers due to the rain and asked to see them again.the officers also had cavitt step outside of the.
granelli proceeded to again question cavitt,this time about his daughter occupation,his itinerary,and where he had stayed in lancaster.in response,cavitt explained to the officers that his daughter was a child and therefore did have a job,and that he had spent the previous night at the home of his daughter mother.the trooper next asked cavitt how long he had lived in east louis and whether drugs were much of a problem there.cavitt initially replied,what but,after granelli repeated the question,cavitt stated that the drug situation in east louis was pretty bad.granelli questioned cavitt about whether he had ever used drugs,and cavitt admitted to having used marijuana about nine years ago.the trooper then said to cavitt,the reason i asking you these questions is that there seems to be a pretty big problem with narcotics here on this highway,especially this time of year we see a lot of it.granelli asked cavitt whether anyone had ever asked him to haul drugs.cavitt answered no and denied that there were any drugs in his van.
detective britton spoke up and questioned cavitt about large trash bags in the van and his lack of luggage.cavitt asked,do you want to take a look at them and explained that they were full of clothes.someone can then be heard removing bags from the van.at that point,granelli asked for permission to search cavitt.cavitt can faintly be heard responding,yeah,sure.a few seconds later,cavitt attempted to flee,at which point a struggle ensued.
in his brief and at oral argument,cavitt represented,and the government did not deny,that the officers did not return the driver license to cavitt prior to their search of the.
iii.discussion 
in the context of,this court reviews a district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see united states edwards,cir.it reviews a district court refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing on a motion for abuse of discretion.see id.
as noted above,cavitt did not directly appeal his conviction.nor did he appeal the district court denial of his motion for reconsideration.the district court correctly concluded that cavitt could not raise a fourth amendment claim on collateral review.order granting coa,citing united states diaz,cir.however,the viability of the fourth amendment claim is inextricably intertwined with cavitt claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in respect to failing to pursue a motion to suppress and in failing to advise him properly regarding the viability of such a claim in connection with pleading guilty.id.accordingly,our inquiry into the errors claimed entails an assessment of cavitt putative fourth amendment claim.revisiting brown decision not to file a motion to suppress on cavitt behalf is critical because e vidence obtained by the government in violation of a defendant fourth amendment rights may not be used to prove the defendant guilt at trial.united states thomas,cir.
fourth amendment analysis 
reasonable suspicion 
pursuant to the supreme court seminal decision in terry ohio,d,we have concluded that t he stopping of a vehicle and detention of its occupants constitutes a seizure under the fourth amendment.united states brigham,cir en banc.under terry,we employ a test to determine the legality of police investigatory stops.we first examine whether the officer action was justified at its inception,and then inquire whether the officer subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop.id.
whether an officer actions are reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop is a question often informed by timing and sequence.id.at.although we have rejected a approach to reviewing the reasonableness of detentions,see,this court frequently concludes that a search is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying a traffic violation stop when the search in question occurs after the time required for an officer to issue a citation or to decide against doing so and to complete a computer check for outstanding warrants and vehicle theft.in united states santiago,we articulated an rule 
during a traffic stop,an officer can request a driver license,insurance papers,and vehicle registration he or she may also run a computer check and issue a citation.the officer may detain and question the subjects of a traffic stop during the time a computer check is being conducted.furthermore,this court usually does not scrutinize the particular questions asked during a stop so long as they tend to relate to the purpose of the stop.
however,a fourth amendment violation occurs when the detention extends beyond the valid reason for the stop.once a computer check is completed and the officer either issues a citation or determines that no citation should be issued,the detention should end and the driver should be free to leave.in order to continue a detention after such a point,the officer must have a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that a crime has been or is being committed.
cir citations omitted see also united states jenson,cir detention may last no longer than required to effect the purpose of the stop.if all computer checks come back clean,then as a general matter reasonable suspicion disappears,and there is no legitimate reason for extending the stop.citations omitted.likewise,in united states dortch,cir,a case that predated santiago,we held that where the evidence plainly reflected that officers completed a computer check before initiating a canine search,it was unreasonable to detain the defendant pending the dog search.
as noted in santiago,in order to prolong a detention after issuing a citation or determining that no citation should be issued,an officer must have a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed.santiago,at.reasonable suspicion exists when the detaining officer can point to specific and articulable facts that,when taken together with rational inferences from those facts,reasonably warrant the search and seizure.united states estrada,cir under brigham,the purpose of the initial stop ended at,when the results of the criminal background check came back negative,unless the officers formed additional reasonable suspicion before that time.accordingly,o nce the purpose of a valid traffic stop has been completed and an officer initial suspicions have been verified or dispelled,the detention must end unless there is additional reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts,that is,of criminal activity additional to the suspicion that justified the initial stop.thus,brown continuing detention of cavitt after the negative computer check came was unconstitutionally prolonged unless additional reasonable suspicion arose in the course of the stop and before the initial purpose of the stop ha d been fulfilled.united states,cir.
reasonable suspicion must be based on more than the officer sense that a detainee appears to have something to hide.in santiago this court rejected the government contention that an officer had reasonable suspicion to continue a detention because the defendant took an unusually long time to pull over,acted nervous,gave seemingly unbelievable answers to various questions,and provided statements regarding the details of his trip that conflicted with the answers provided by the other occupant of the vehicle,who was questioned separately.santiago,at.we held that mere uneasy feelings and inconsistent stories between a driver and a passenger do not constitute articulable facts that support a reasonable suspicion of drug trafficking.estrada,at citing santiago,at.
however,reasonable suspicion may arise when the sort of observations and behavior described above are coupled with more concrete evidence that suggests the commission of a specific offense.for example,in estrada,we concluded that reasonable suspicion was established when an officer noticed fresh marks and scratches around the fuel tank eye piece latches and vehicle frame,which indicated the presence of an adhesive material near the gas tank.id.at.in that case,the court made much of the fact that the officer extensive classroom training and experience,including an occasion at which he found illegal narcotics concealed in a gas tank in a similar fashion,led him to reasonably suspect that a false compartment or container had been built into the fuel tank to conceal contraband a dhesive material is typically used to cover newly created compartments to prevent seepage of fuel and contraband.id.similarly,in united states sanchez,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,we held that reasonable suspicion arose when an officer noticed prior to a search that the wheel rims on the detainee truck had been painted.id.the officer later testified that he knew that drug traffickers often paint their wheel rims to hide marks stemming from alterations they make to tires and rims to conceal contraband.id.
here,granelli initial stop was justified on the basis that cavitt was speeding and failed to signal,a point cavitt does not dispute.see,at.in addition,during the course of the stop,trooper granelli was permitted to examine cavitt driver license and registration and to run a computer check to investigate whether cavitt had any outstanding warrants and whether the vehicle was stolen.see brigham,at.once the computer check had been completed and granelli had prepared the warning,however,the detention could not be prolonged unless additional reasonable suspicion,supported by articulable facts,developed during the stop.see id.at.cavitt claims that no additional reasonable suspicion arose and that the officers continued to detain him because they were simply determined to search him,with or without a valid reason,as evidenced by the trooper statement,i love to search this guy.
the government argues that a number of circumstances that existed or occurred before the computer check came back negative could have led the officers to suspect that cavitt might be involved in criminal activity.first,as recorded on the tape,granelli claimed during the encounter to know that the highway cavitt was traveling was a known drug route,that drug traffic was particularly heavy during that time of the year,and that cavitt home and louis,reputed to be a heavy drug trafficking area.second,as they discussed on tape,the officers found dubious cavitt claim that he had rented a to make a quick trip from illinois alone and for the purpose of visiting his daughter.third,the license photograph that cavitt presented to trooper granelli was not a convincing likeness finally,the government claims that the two officers suspicions were heightened when they noticed a radar detector installed in the rental vehicle and several shopping bags strewn throughout the.
however,as noted above,reasonable suspicion must be based on more than the officer hunches and doubts about cavitt story.see,estrada,at.in order for cavitt continued detention to have been justified by reasonable suspicion,the government must establish some nexus between a specific criminal activity and cavitt questionable license and ambitious itinerary.see jenson,at.in concluding that a search was supported by reasonable suspicion in previous cases,we have relied upon objective evidence of specific criminal activity,interpreted by an officer experienced or educated in detecting that particular sort of activity.see estrada,at sanchez,at.
by way of objective record evidence in this regard,we have only granelli statements to cavitt,made after they had pulled up at the truck stop,indicating that the highway is a known drug trafficking route,that drug activity is particularly heavy on highway during late october,and that east louis is known for its drug activity however,without any extrinsic evidence or testimony from granelli as to his experience and education,we are unable to evaluate the validity,basis,or intent behind his statements.
the government correctly suggests that a comparison of cavitt appearance with the license furnished during the stop might have aided the trier of fact in determining whether reasonable suspicion existed.however,the government response to cavitt motion did not include a copy of the license.neither did it contain a photograph of cavitt.considering the record before us,we are unable to determine whether the search of the was justified by additional reasonable suspicion.
even when reasonable suspicion does not justify a search,however,it does not necessarily follow that a search constitutes a fourth amendment violation.consensual encounters do not implicate fourth amendment concerns,and a consensual interrogation may follow the end of a valid traffic stop.brigham,at.
the videotape reflects that cavitt responded yeah,sure when the officers asked if they could search his vehicle.the government argues,and both cavitt previous counsel and district court agreed,that this statement represented valid consent to the search of the.
we must determine whether cavitt yeah,sure constitutes validly given consent.in doing so,this court asks whether the consent was voluntary,and whether it was an independent act of free will.see jenson,at internal citations omitted.in evaluating the voluntariness of consent,we look to six factors 
the voluntariness of the defendant custodial status the presence of coercive police procedures the extent and level of the defendant cooperation with the police the defendant awareness of his right to refuse consent the defendant education and intelligence and the defendant belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.
id.citations omitted.to determine whether the consent was an act of free will,we scrutinize the record for any break in the causal chain between the constitutional violation and the consent that is to say,consent can not be the product of the illegal detention.id.at citation omitted.
on the record before us,it is difficult to construe cavitt custodial status as voluntary.although cavitt agreed to follow the officers to the truck stop,it appears that the officers failed to issue cavitt the promised warning and to return the driver license before the two cars relocated to the truck stop.consent is valid when offered after a constitutional detainment expires if a reasonable person,at the time the legitimate detainment expired,would have felt free to leave.united states,cir.a reasonable person in cavitt position might not have felt free to leave until he was issued the promised warning and his driver license had been returned.see united states jordan,o nce identification is handed over to police and they have had a reasonable opportunity to review it,if the identification is not returned to the detainee it is difficult to imagine that an
