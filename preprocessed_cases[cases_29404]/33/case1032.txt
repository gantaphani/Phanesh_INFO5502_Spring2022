both the respondent and odc have filed objections to the board factual findings and recommendations.this court has concluded that all of the objections to the board factual findings are without merit.this court has carefully considered the board recommendations on the issue of sanctions.we have concluded that the appropriate sanctions are disgorgement of fees earned by the respondent after the entry of the cease and desist order and a fine for each of the nine counts of the amended petition found to have constituted a contempt of the cease and desist order.
cease and desist order respondent voluntary compliance 
on january,the odc filed a petition with the board alleging that the respondent was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.specifically,odc alleged the respondent was acting in a representative capacity in a delaware legal tribunal or governmental agency b giving legal advice on matters relating to delaware law c drafting legal documents and d holding himself out as authorized to practice law in delaware.board rule provides that any time after a matter is initially docketed by the office of disciplinary counsel,the respondent may voluntarily offer an assurance that the respondent shall not engage in the unauthorized practice of law in the state of delaware.on june,odc and the respondent appeared before the board and jointly submitted a written settlement agreement captioned admitted facts and admissions of conduct constituting the unauthorized practice of law admissions.
in the admissions,the respondent agreed that the drafting of wills and trusts by a who is not authorized to practice law by the delaware supreme court constitutes the unauthorized practice of law the respondent further agreed that acting in a representative capacity in the register of wills,giving legal advice on matters relating to delaware estate law,and drafting legal documents for use in the register of wills by a each constitutes the unauthorized practice of law the respondent agreed that he would not draft wills and trusts,act in a representative capacity in the register of wills,give legal advice on matters relating to delaware estate law,or draft legal documents for use in the register of wills and he would not advertise legal services related to wills,trusts,estate,probate,estate administration,and estate and probate services as services provided by his firm in any manner including print ads,yellow pages,billboards,on his letterhead,or elsewhere.
on july,the board submitted its acceptance of the respondent admissions,voluntary assurances and also submitted a proposed consent decree to this court.we approved the respondent voluntary compliance agreement and entered the cease and desist order as a consent degree.following the entry of this court cease and desist order,the court of chancery appointed peter gordon,esquire,as receiver of the respondent unauthorized law practice

the rules of the board delineate the structure and procedures for a comprehensive regulatory system intended to protect the public from occurrences of the unauthorized practice of law in the state of delaware.board rule provides that this court entry of an order approving the respondent voluntary assurance agreement shall be enforceable through contempt proceedings.board rule authorizes the odc to investigate any alleged violations of this court orders and to petition this court for a rule to show cause why the respondent should not be held in contempt.in accordance with board rule,we directed the board to conduct an evidentiary hearing with respect to the amended petition filed by odc and to submit a report with its factual findings and recommendations.
unauthorized law practice 
the unauthorized practice of law is prohibited so that members of the public will receive legal representation only from a person who has demonstrated his or her competence to practice law by passing the bar examination as well as the character and fitness examination and who is subject to the delaware lawyers rules of professional responsibility.as this court explained fifty years ago 
the profession thus established arose out of a public necessity for the exclusion from the practice of law of unqualified persons.the attorney thus became an officer of the court and an important adjunct to the administration of justice.the profession from the very start was affected with a public interest and was created for the protection of the public.
originally,anyone could practice law,but for the protection of the public it was found necessary to circumscribe that right.the advance of civilization and its material things has done nothing to change that fundamental fact.the existence of the legal profession is continued for the assistance of the public under limitations imposed by the court.violations of those limitations are punished by the court through its process of citation for contempt.
the admission of attorneys to practice,and the exclusion of unauthorized persons from practice lie within the province of this court.a violation of this court exclusive right to license attorneys at law by presuming to practice law without such license is a contempt of its authority and punishable as such 
the issue of what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law frequently arises in this and other jurisdictions in the context of wills,trusts,and estate planning in this case,it is unnecessary for this court to promulgate a comprehensive definition of the practice of law in those subject areas.
our cease and desist order was a consent decree entered as the result of a voluntary agreement between the respondent and the odc that was approved by the board.in that agreement,the respondent defined what conduct by him would constitute the unauthorized practice of law and represented to this court that he would not engage in any of those defined prohibited activities.accordingly,the issue is whether the respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law as defined and agreed to by him in his admissions and voluntary assurances to this court that constituted the basis for the cease and desist order.
board factual findings 
the board findings of fact and recommendations are as follows 
count i of the amended legal the integrity and validity of court orders 
count i of the amended petition avers that respondent was in contempt of the cease and desist order by giving legal advice to his clients in his letter of november.odc further claims that this letter impugned the integrity and validity of orders issued by the delaware supreme court and the new castle county court of chancery respondent denies that his letter contains legal advice or that it impugned the supreme court integrity.
it can not be gainsaid that respondent letter was,misleading and spiteful.despite its offensive tone and distasteful wording,however,the board did not find by clear and convincing evidence that respondent letter impugns the supreme court integrity or the validity of the cease and desist order.
although respondent letter includes several passages that one could construe as rendering legal advice,there was no testimony presented by odc that any of respondent clients construed the letter as giving legal advice or that they relied on the letter for this purpose.absent such testimony,the board does not find clear and convincing evidence that respondent rendered legal advice in his letter.
for these reasons,the board finds that odc fails to meet its burden of proof with respect to count i of the amended petition.
counts ii,iii,iv and count vi of the amended legal advice on estate law drafting of of 
count ii of the amended petition alleges that respondent violated the cease and desist order by rendering legal advice relating to delaware estate law and drafting legal documents for use in the register of wills for easter burch burch.
count iii alleges that respondent violated the cease and desist order by rendering legal advice relating to delaware estate law and drafting legal documents for use in the register of wills for yolanda and william welsh welsh.
count iv alleges that respondent violated the cease and desist order by rendering legal advice relating to delaware estate law and drafting legal documents for use in the register of wills for bruce abbott abbott.
count vi alleges that respondent violated the cease and desist order by rendering legal advice relating to estate law and drafting legal documents for use in the register of wills for vivienne titus titus.
respondent admits meeting with those named individuals to discuss estate planning but denies that he drafted any legal documents or that he rendered any legal advice.
as explained below,respondent routine business practice was essentially the same each time he met with clients to discuss estate planning.as such,unless otherwise noted,the board findings of fact are identical for counts ii,iii,iv and vi of the amended petition.
respondent met with burch and her granddaughter,susan cooper cooper,on november,to discuss estate planning.this consultation was typical of respondent meetings with other estate planning clients.for example,cooper took burch to respondent to draft a will.cooper,her grandmother,respondent and a tall young lady from respondent office were the only people present during the initial meeting.no delaware lawyer was present.after interviewing burch and taking detailed notes during this meeting,respondent provided his notes to leonard kingsley kingsley an attorney admitted in pennsylvania and new jersey.kingsley,who is not admitted to practice law in delaware,then drafted a power of attorney,will and irrevocable trust for burch as directed by respondent.respondent employed largely the same procedure regarding his estate planning work for welsh,abbott and titus.
kingsley maintains an office in west chester,pennsylvania.as part of his practice,he claimed to help respondent with his legal problems,including counseling respondent in terms of how to limit the scope of inquiries from various branches of the delaware government.respondent pays kingsley per month to draft legal documents based on the notes respondent generates as a result of his initial meetings with clients.respondent maintains a master file of form documents for wills,trusts,healthcare directive and powers of attorney and kingsley routinely used these forms to draft the legal documents as directed by respondent.when kingsley drafted the documents,he did so either at his home in wilmington,delaware or at his west chester,pennsylvania office.
the board notes with interest that prior to november of,kingsley was actually an employee of respondent accounting firm,but ostensibly terminated his employment for fear of prosecution by odc.when kingsley was respondent employee,he performed these same services for respondent.
in addition to drafting estate planning documents,kingsley also drafted deeds transferring real estate for respondent clients.kingsley always received instructions from respondent as to what documents to draft.after kingsley prepared the legal documents,he returned them electronically to respondent office.with only two exceptions,kingsley never met with respondent clients the documents were then forwarded to thomas mccracken,esquire mccracken,a member of the delaware bar.kingsley never met with mccracken to discuss the documents.
respondent and mccracken had a business agreement that was memorialized in a memorandum of understanding.respondent testified that mccracken would draft documents,meet with clients and answer questions about the documents.but,respondent testimony on this point was directly contradicted by kingsley and mccracken,both of whom testified that kingsley,not mccracken,drafted the legal documents based on respondent instructions.the board specifically found that kingsley did the drafting,not mccracken.
mccracken received the draft legal documents electronically from respondent but,unlike kingsley,he did not receive respondent personal notes.mccracken played no role in determining what estate planning documents were prepared for respondent clients.indeed,it is uncontroverted that none of respondent clients ever met mccracken before executing their legal documents.their first introduction to their own lawyer was only moments before these documents were signed.
the board found that respondent clients were intentionally misled about mccracken role.when respondent and mccracken met with clients to execute legal documents,the clients were presented a letter prepared by respondent,but printed on mccracken letterhead and signed by mccracken.this letter falsely informed the clients that mccracken prepared the legal documents to carry out the client wishes.it also falsely stated that respondent and mccracken have decided that these documents will effectively carry out your intent from the estate and tax planning consultation you had with respondent.contrary to these representations,mccracken did not prepare the legal documents,nor did he form or express any opinions about whether the legal documents effectively carried out the client intent.
similarly,odc questioned mccracken about deeds that were prepared for respondent clients.mccracken admits he did not prepare the deeds but did review them.the deeds falsely state they were prepared by mccracken.the board finds that the deeds were prepared by kingsley at respondent direction.
welsh consultation with respondent was strikingly similar.welsh contacted respondent because he saw his advertisement in the lawyers section in the yellow pages.on november,at the initial meeting with respondent,welsh wife was not present,nor was mccracken.welsh and his wife returned to respondent office approximately one week later.mccracken was present but said absolutely nothing when welsh and his wife executed the legal documents.all questions posed by welsh were answered by respondent.after executing the documents,welsh had concerns about the documents he executed,so he telephoned mccracken mccracken told welsh that he would need to set up a meeting with respondent to discuss his concerns.thereafter,welsh testified he met with respondent and another lawyer,some guy from around the philadelphia area.he looked to me,he might have been asian of some kind.the board finds that welsh is referring to kingsley.
the board heard similar testimony from titus daughter,eileen wolfe wolfe,who had accompanied her mother to meet with respondent on october.during this meeting,respondent reviewed a will previously prepared by an attorney and rendered legal advice that the will had to be redone,that there are things missing and it was wr
