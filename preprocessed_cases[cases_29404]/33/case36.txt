the efforts of a number of persons to halt the navy use of the island of vieques for bombing and other exercises sometimes have gone beyond what the law permits.these excesses,and the federal courts necessary involvement in bringing lawbreakers to account,have spawned considerable public controversy.this appeal stems from an incident related to that controversy.in it,the appellant,attorney adalina de,asks us to annul sanctions imposed against her by the district court in the course of a vieques protest case.as the recent history of appeals indicates,the district court has done an admirable job in handling a sudden influx of several hundred protesters cases under the microscope of pervasive media attention but in this unusual instance,taking direct account of the need to assure robust advocacy in criminal matters,we find no legally sufficient basis for the imposition of sanctions and,therefore,vacate the challenged order.
the background facts are not disputed.the navy has used vieques for exercises for upward of sixty years.its activities have become increasingly unpopular over that span at least among some groups and protests have erupted from time to time,united states parrilla bonilla,cir.a fatal accident involving an employee of the navy occurred in.this accident drove the dissonance to a new pitch.as a result,the federal district court has been deluged with criminal trespass cases brought against protesters who were arrested after they entered either the naval base situated on the island of vieques or the areas associated therewith.see,united states,cir united states maxwell,cir united states sharpton,cir per curiam.this massive infusion of cases has thronged the already congested docket of a busy court.
after the initial batch of in chief judge of the district court acted quickly to marshal available judicial resources.although the court standard praxis called for the random assignment of criminal cases the chief judge entered an order dated june,the presentment order,which directed that all vieques cases be brought to the chief judge upon filing for assignment by him to available district and magistrate judges in a rotating sequence the mechanics of which were not specified.the presentment order bore only the chief judge signature.
in april of,another wave of protests occurred and an additional criminal trespass cases were filed.the chief judge granted the government ex parte motion to consolidate and the cases were segregated into clusters by arresting officer.the consolidations left some of the judges with multiple groups of defendants and others with few or none.to alleviate this unequal distribution,the senior active judge,temporarily at the court helm in the chief judge absence,ordered groups of cases reassigned to equalize the judges workloads.
although these arrangements proved more efficient in certain respects,they created a number of anomalies.some defendants found themselves lumped with other defendants who had been arrested at different times places.when certain defendants complained that they had not received prior notice of the government motion to consolidate,and that,at any rate,the consolidation order violated the joinder provisions of federal rule of criminal procedure b,the chief judge rejected their importunings.he did,however,issue an order explaining in some detail the rationale for the presentment order,the consolidation order,and the ensuing reassignment of groups of cases.see united states ayala ayala,june,unpublished order.he also explained that the terms of the presentment order were no longer in vogue,but,rather,that vieques cases were being assigned randomly by the clerk office,and then reassigned by him only when necessary to ensure efficient handling.see id.
the appellant represented a codefendant zoraida charged in the very case that yielded the june order.she also represented a second defendant juan who had been charged in another case arising out of the most recent spate of protests.both groups of cases had been shifted to the chief judge calendar by virtue of the consolidation order.on june,the appellant acting on behalf of both clients moved to dismiss the pending charges or,in the alternative,for reassignment noting that the statute authorizing district courts to promulgate local rules,requires that the chief judge respect these rules and assign the cases as provided therein,the motion papers asserted that an assignment system can not deviate from that established by the court local rules without the consent of the judicial council for the circuit in which the district sits.because the presentment order did not explain the source of the chief judge ostensible authority to contravene this statute,the motion argued that the ad hoc assignment system for vieques cases was fatally flawed.the motion elaborated on this thesis,stating in part 
according to the local rules of this court regarding the assignment of cases,rule and rule,civil and criminal case s must be assigned by lot.the chief judge in this case has usurped the authority of his fellow judges and taken control of the assignment system for criminal cases 
the recent order of june,suggests that,contrary to the presentment order,vieques trespass cases are being assigned randomly by the clerk office and then referred to the chief judge for reassignment.either way,the interference with the normal practice of the court regarding case assignments is unlawful and must be voided as the chief judge does not have the authority to alter this practice within the district.
the next day,the appellant appeared before the chief judge for a scheduling conference in the matter.the conference was held in chambers,with a court reporter present.the chief judge expressed concern about the statements contained in the motion,characterizing those statements as an unfair attack on the court.despite the appellant disclaimer of any defamatory intent,the chief judge placed her under oath to inquire into the factual foundation for the statements.the appellant defended her handiwork as a interpretation of the presentment order,the district court praxis,and the governing law.she admitted,however,that she had done no independent investigation into the facts,that she had not contacted the other judges in the district to ascertain whether they had consented to the new system the chief judge took no action at that moment.
four days later,the chief judge denied the pending motion.united states,d.he simultaneously denounced the allegations contained in the motion as unfounded,declared that the appellant had failed to conduct a suitable investigation before making those allegations,and worried aloud that the allegations would lead to the diminution of public confidence in the court as an impartial arbiter of the law,especially when such false allegations find their way into the media.id.at.concluding that the appellant actions constituted misconduct because she had made statements impugning the integrity of a judge in reckless disregard of the truth,the chief judge exercised the court inherent power and ordered her to pay a fine.id.
on july,was convicted on the underlying charge.this timely appeal of the sanctions order ensued.in it,the appellant argues that she did not have adequate notice of the specific charges leveled against her that the colloquy at the status conference did not constitute a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the matter and that,in all events,she did not commit any sanctionable misconduct.
