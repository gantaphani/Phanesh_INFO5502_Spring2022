on habeas corpus.
petitioner henry james koehler became the attorney for wife in the midst of an acrimonious and bitterly contested divorce proceeding.confidential documents that were the property of some third parties had been provided to wife,and she and petitioner refused to return them,even after a court order to do so.third parties obtained an order awarding in discovery sanctions,which were not paid,and third parties initiated proceedings for indirect contempt.petitioner resisted,represented by a attorney,but without success,and was held in contempt and ordered to serve five days in jail,which he did.but he did not pay the.
seven months later,apparently acting on its own and with no initiating affidavit,the superior court issued an order to show cause regarding contempt.petitioner,again represented by counsel,asserted jurisdictional,procedural,and substantive arguments in opposition.the superior court rejected the arguments,and ordered petitioner to serve another five days in jail,which he did.less than two months later,again acting on its own and with no initiating affidavit,the superior court issued yet another order to show cause.following a brief hearing at which petitioner appeared in propria persona,the court again held petitioner in contempt and ordered him to serve another five days in jail.this writ proceeding followed.
the leading expert on california judicial conduct has observed that t he procedures for punishing direct,hybrid,and indirect contempt are different.significant additional due process rights are involved in an indirect contempt that do not come into play in direct and hybrid contempt.for this reason,it is mandatory that judges be familiar with the procedures governing direct contempt.to invoke the power of contempt without knowing or learning the law is misconduct citation.rothman,cal.judicial conduct handbook ed.what happened here did not measure up to that law,not by a long shot.treating the petition as one for prohibition,we grant it,and thus annul the contempt order,bringing an end to a most unfortunate chapter in this family law saga.
background 
husband and wife were embroiled in a vigorously contested divorce case in the san mateo county superior court,which began in august.see in re marriage of papazian,nonpub.opn.petitioner became wife attorney in july.according to petitioner,he became wife attorney late in the proceedings,after wife prior attorney caved in to husband fraud in covering up his assets,and petitioner attempted to set aside various orders.once petitioner entered the fray,numerous charges and countercharges flew between the sides,which included scathing correspondence between petitioner and husband who at times was representing himself.the details of all that occurred are not before us,but suffice to say that what we know was particularly unpleasant.
during the course of discovery,documents containing certain confidential information belonging to lucky strike farms,papazian properties company,and gilbert and margaret papazian collectively,third parties had been provided to wife.on april,third parties filed for a protective order requiring,inter alia,the return of these documents and on august,they obtained an order to that effect,ordering return of the documents by no later than august.the documents were not returned.
on october,third parties moved for an award of discovery sanctions under code of civil procedure sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision a,and for mandatory injunctive relief.they also sought an award of from wife and petitioner,allegedly the attorney fees incurred in pursuing the protective order and in attempting to obtain the return of the documents.
a hearing on this motion was held on november,before the honorable clifford cretan.after considering the arguments presented by both sides,judge cretan ordered both petitioner and wife to pay third parties sanctions in the amount of.with petitioner acting as her attorney,wife filed an appeal from that order.petitioner did not file an appeal on his own behalf.on april,we affirmed both that order and other orders entered by the trial court.in re marriage of papazian,supra.
petitioner never paid the sanctions,and on may,third parties initiated contempt proceedings against him.before turning to a discussion of what thereafter ensued,we set forth some fundamental principles regarding contempt,particularly indirect contempt.
some fundamental principles 
we quoted above from judge david rothman,a recognized expert in the field of judicial conduct.early in his lengthy chapter on chapter replete with warnings and reminders about the necessity of judges being especially vigilant in conducting contempt rothman advises judges about useful resources,including this for a useful and reference on contempt and sanctions,see the courtroom control contempt and sanctions,california judges benchguide revised,produced by the center for judicial education and research of the administrative office of the courts benchguide rothman,supra.
the benchguide is hardly the only readily available judicial resource regarding exercise of the contempt power.another is the california judges benchbook civil proceedings before trial ed.benchbook,which focuses on the judge role,and provides practical working tools to enable a judge to conduct proceedings fairly,correctly,and efficiently.it is written from the judge point of view,giving the judge concrete advice on what to look for and how to respond.benchbook,preface,chapter of the benchbook deals with sanctions and contempt.
both the benchguide and the benchbook set forth in detail both the substantive law of contempt and the procedures to be followed they also provide much practical advice.illustrative is this from the benchguide civil contempt proceedings under ccp,whether punitive or coercive,may arise out of either civil or criminal litigation.furthermore,even though they are denominated civil,these proceedings are criminal in nature because of the penalties that a judge may impose.people gonzalez cal th.the constitutional rights of the accused must be observed.see hicks feiock,guilt in criminal contempt proceeding must be proved beyond reasonable doubt mitchell superior court cal d,when there are punitive sanctions,guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt.citations.benchguide.the benchbook is similar.benchbook.
both books discuss the three types of contempt,direct,hybrid,and indirect,the last of which was invoked here against petitioner.the facts supporting indirect contempt arise outside the judge presence,requiring a more elaborate procedure to notify the person charged and to afford an opportunity to be heard.see ccp arthur superior court cal d.a common example is a party disobedience of a judge order.benchbook.
both books also provide informative discussions of the difference between punitive and coercive forms of punishment.the benchguide makes clear,for example,that i n punitive proceedings,commonly referred to as,the court may impose a fine not to exceed a term of imprisonment not to exceed five days to punish a party for each separate act of contempt.see ccp a fine superior court th,sentence was appropriate punishment for attorney adjudged in contempt for filing false statement of disqualification under ccp.see also ccp b c punishment for failure to comply with family court order.on what constitutes a separate act of contempt,see donovan superior court cal d,four distinguishable violations of injunction warranted multiple fines conn superior court d,contemner repeated failures to turn over documents as ordered constituted single act of contempt.the test is whether there were separate insults to the court authority,several of which may occur on the same day.reliable enterprises,superior court d,multiple fines for separate violations of injunction occurring on different days.benchguide.
in coercive proceedings,the court uses imprisonment to compel performance of some act or duty required of a person that the person has the ability,but refuses,to perform,to answer a question as a witness.ccp a the court must specify the act to be performed in the warrant of commitment.see ccp a morelli superior court cal d,heinz superior court cal d.judicial tip in selecting the appropriate punishment,the court should weigh the effect of any mitigating circumstances.citations.benchguide.
other available practice guides explain not only the general rules and procedures,but precisely what must be proven at an indirect contempt proceeding.for example,one leading practical treatise distills it this way,in bullet point fashion in indirect contempt proceedings based on disobedience of a prior court order,a valid judgment must meet strict requirements.each of the following must be established 
facts establishing court jurisdiction,personal service or subpoena,validity of court order allegedly violated,
defendant knowledge of the order disobeyed 
defendant ability to comply and 
defendant willful disobedience of the order.
wegner,fairbank,epstein,cal.practice guide the rutter group.
the other leading practical treatise lists the same four issues.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,ll.and later elaborating on the third issue,it says this ability to comply is sometimes obvious,particularly where the violation is of a strictly prohibitory injunction.but in any case,it must be proved by competent evidence.weil brown,supra,ll.the burden of proof is on the moving party to prove the respondent ability to comply rather than on the respondent to prove inability.id.at,ll.
the contempt proceedings 
as noted,third parties initiated contempt proceedings on may,by submitting an affidavit of facts allegedly constituting contempt.represented by a major law firm,third parties filed an order to show cause and affidavit for contempt.the factual showing in the affidavit included a lengthy attachment and five exhibits,providing evidence of third parties unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement of the issue,and to recover the sanctions award.
on july,the matter came on for arraignment before judge cretan,the judge who had issued the sanction order.petitioner appeared on his own behalf and requested the services of a public defender.judge cretan paused the proceeding to have petitioner fill out a financial statement,and then questioned petitioner concerning it.petitioner acknowledged that he had social security income,but that that he received very,very little income from his legal practice and had been sick.apparently satisfied with petitioner inability to pay for counsel,judge cretan ruled that it would appoint a private defender to represent petitioner,which he later did.asked how he pled,petitioner reaffirmed he was making a special appearance,so judge cretan entered a denial or not guilty plea on petitioner behalf.this was judge cretan last involvement in any aspect of any contempt proceeding.
petitioner petitioned this court for a writ of mandate or prohibition on july.after full briefing,we denied that petition on august.
third parties resumed the contempt proceedings on july,proceeding under code of civil procedure sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a,and the matter came on for hearing on july.third parties were represented by counsel,as was petitioner,by his counsel.the hearing began with counsel for third parties adverting to an discussion 
there was a pending discussion before your honor on the issue of ability to pay and whether that is an affirmative defense which koehler has to prove or whether that is part of our case in chief.and i believe your honor gave us her tentative thoughts in chambers on that.after brief colloquy,the court responded that,it the court view,and i think i indicated this in chambers,and we can certainly put all the arguments on the record,it is not your burden to prove that.that is an affirmative defense in the court mind,and you will have plenty of opportunity to address that issue,demeester.but it is an affirmative defense if presented by the citee,the defendant,or a lack of ability to pay.and then that becomes a different issue.so that the court view.
third parties presented documents and testimony demonstrating that judge cretan had issued a valid order in november,requiring petitioner to pay as a discovery sanction that petitioner was aware of this order and that he had made no payments in compliance with it.
petitioner cited to a different order issued by judge cretan,this on december,requiring only pay in sanctions under family code section,arguing that that order recited an ambiguity that relieved him of his obligation under the november order.petitioner also argued that it was the burden of the moving parties to establish that he had an ability to pay the sanction,and that they failed to prove that ability or his willful disobedience of that order.the trial court ruled that the december order was irrelevant to the contempt proceedings,as it did not pertain to petitioner,and did not vacate or modify the november order significantly,the trial court also ruled that ability to pay is an affirmative defense that can be presented by defendant,and that has not been done here.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court found petitioner in contempt for failing to comply with the november order.it then considered arguments regarding the appropriate punishment,found that a fine would not likely coerce petitioner into compliance given that he had not paid any part of the sanction specified by the november order,and sentenced him to five days in jail,with a surrender date of august,and with a recommendation that he be able to complete his sentence through a work program in his home county,riverside.
at some point,petitioner applied to the riverside sheriff office to participate in a work release at their jail and on august,was advised to return on tuesday,august,rather than august.in the of august,the day before he was to return to jail,and representing himself,petitioner filed a belated petition for writ of habeas corpus in this court,which we denied the next day.petitioner served the jail sentence.
on february,a second contempt proceeding was initiated via an order to show cause re contempt.the order to show cause has no counsel of record,and is signed by the trial court it is not under oath.the record does not indicate what caused this second contempt proceeding to be generated,and we assume the court generated it on its own accord.
the order to show cause is four short paragraphs,and begins,however imprecisely,as follows on november,discovery sanctions of payable to this court on or before january,were imposed against henry james koehler,counsel for respondent in this matter,by the honorable clifford cretan pursuant to family code section as of february,those sanctions have not been paid.the fourth paragraph concludes with this note that all of the elements of contempt were found true at the contempt proceedings against henry james koehler on july.therefore,there is no need for an initiating affidavit in this new contempt proceeding.the factual findings made at the conclusion of the july,hearing have been substituted for an initiating affidavit for this new order to show cause re contempt.
the contempt hearing was held on march,as ordered.there was no appearance on behalf of third parties.petitioner was represented by new apparently still counsel,who had substituted in and was specially appearing for the purpose of contested sic jurisdiction of this hearing.counsel challenged the court jurisdiction on the basis that the reference to family code section and the statement that sanctions were payable to the court were inaccuracies in the order to show cause,and that petitioner was never properly joined as a party.the trial court responded as follows 
the court well,i mean,koehler knows we had a huge hearing on this where he was found in contempt.so if the court misstated that it was payable to this court or to lucky strikes farm in any event,that that may just does affect these proceedings,counsel.he knows what the issue is before the court.he was ordered to pay a discovery sanction by the trial court.we had a hearing on it.he was found in contempt of court.and he has as yet paid that.so that why we are here today.
petitioner counsel responded that he believed the need for accuracy in the order to show cause re contempt is jurisdictional,and then complained that petitioner was improperly joined in the case.after some colloquy about the joinder issue,the trial court said it would take a brief recess and just look at the complete file that is in chambers.the court returned a short time later,and the following ensued 
the court very well.thank you.the court was just in recess very briefly.counselor,i was taking a look at the file,and unfortunately i think you are incorrect on both issues.according to the minutes of the court on november,the minutes of the court clearly say sanctions in the sum of dollars are imposed against henry james koehler per family code section to be paid to the court on or before january.so that as to the first issue.
cordle i sorry,is only against parties as a matter of law.
the court i am just reading to you the exact language in the minutes which the court adopted in the re contempt.
two pages later the trial court affirmed that we are two years and four months into that order where petitioner was ordered by judge cretan to pay in discovery sanctions pursuant to family code section to be paid to the court 
petitioner counsel pressed on,concluding that there was a defective order to show cause re contempt,and objected to any order for contempt based on payment of sanctions as such sanctions are not enforceable against him as a matter of law.it was all to no avail.
the trial court amended the order to show cause to reflect that the sanctions were payable to third parties.it then found that the elements of contempt were previously established at the july,hearing,and that petitioner had still refused to pay the sanctions award.the trial court again sentenced petitioner to another five days of confinement with a date.petitioner served that second sentence in early april 
on may,another order to show cause re contempt was filed,once again signed by the trial court.as before,the order to show cause appears to be generated by the court itself.as before,it is not under oath.as before,it was four short paragraphs.as before,it in light of all that stating that the trial court had imposed the sanctions pursuant to family code section.and as before,it concludes with this note that all of the elements of contempt were found true at the contempt proceedings against henry james koehler on july.therefore,there is no need for an initiating affidavit in this new contempt proceeding.the factual findings made at the conclusion of the july,hearing have been substituted for an initiating affidavit for this new order to show cause re contempt.
petitioner filed opposition and on may,made a special appearance before the trial court,this time in propria persona.the trial court inquired as to whether petitioner had paid the.petitioner refused to answer,asserting his constitutional rights.petitioner objected to the form of service of the notice of hearing,specifically noting that he had not been personally served.he argued that the matter should be continued to permit him to obtain legal representation and witnesses.and he also argued that the two previous sentences for contempt had been punitive,not coercive.
the trial court explained that the court mailed petitioner a notice of hearing,consistent with its past practice.it also stated that the elements of contempt were established at the july,hearing,and that the time had passed for him to challenge the validity of the november order.petitioner stated that he was tendering to the court a motion to quash based on triple jeopardy and the running of the statute of limitations.the trial court rejected all this,and stated this is a continuing contempt for this court,and again sentenced petitioner to five days in jail.the hearing lasted all of eleven minutes,and generated a transcript eight pages in length.
on may,petitioner filed in this court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.that same day we issued a stay of the trial court contempt order and a request for informal opposition.our request was served on several parties,including third parties as real parties in interest,and the attorney general,whom we customarily serve on all habeas corpus petitions.no opposition was filed,and on july,we issued an order requesting the trial court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.following that order,on august,we received san mateo county superior court return to the order to show cause,filed by a private law firm,not county counsel.we appointed counsel for petitioner,who filed a traverse,following which we heard oral argument.
discussion 
preliminary matters 
as noted,petitioner has filed a petition for habeas corpus.as also noted,the superior court has appeared on its own behalf.this state of affairs leads to two preliminary issues whether in light of petitioner status he has filed the appropriate writ and whether the return has been filed by the proper party.
while habeas corpus is obviously the appropriate remedy for an imprisoned contemnor see in re buckley cal d,petitioner is not imprisoned.however,prohibition lies to determine whether a superior court has imposed an invalid contempt order lister superior court d,hanson superior court th,see generally bellas superior court th,and we will proceed by treating the petition here as one for prohibition.
turning to the return filed by the superior court,there is a real question whether it is proper,and the court opposition properly before us.it has been held that,absent issues which directly impact the efficient operation of the court or the court budget,the respondent court is not justified in taking an adversary role in writ proceedings.howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,fn.this is based on the principle that a superior court generally does not have standing to appear in this court to defend its own rulings.see neblett superior court d,annulling contempt order challenged by petition for writ of certiorari but dismissing petition as to individual judge see also curle superior court cal th,fn.and witkin,cal.procedure ed.extraordinary writs.
although rare,respondent court may oppose the writ petition when the real party in interest did not appear and t he issue involved directly impacted the operations and procedures of the court or potentially imposed financial obligations which would directly affect the court operations.settlemire superior court th.while the setting here meets the first but not the second component of this exception,rather than request further briefing on these cause even further expense to the superior follow the approach in grant superior court th,a judicial disqualification case.there,the court concluded that while the superior court lacked standing to defend itself,because respondent court brief is of assistance to this court and because we recognize the impact of disqualification orders upon the court case management system,we will consider the court return as an amicus curiae brief filed in support of real parties in interest.id.at,fn.
we thus turn to the merits of the conclude that petitioner position is well taken.
the standard of review 
as our supreme court has often noted,in the review of a contempt proceeding the evidence,the findings,and the judgment are all to be strictly construed in favor of the accused citation,and no intendments or presumptions can be indulged in aid of their sufficiency.citation.if the record of the proceedings,reviewed in the light of the foregoing rules,fails to show affirmatively upon its face the existence of all the necessary facts upon which jurisdiction depended,the order must be annulled.hotaling superior court cal,italics added.mitchell superior court,supra,cal d at.thus,there is no presumption of regularity in contempt proceedings in re wells cal d,powers superior court d,in re mancini d,nothing can be implied in support of an adjudication of contempt in re scroggin d,and the record must be strictly construed in favor of petitioner,the one found in contempt.raiden superior court cal d.
