issues presented 
a lawyer goes to the police,tells them her clients are committing a string of crimes,and also tells them where to look for evidence of those crimes.based on that the lawyer learned through her representation of the police obtain a search warrant and find the evidence,leading to criminal charges against the clients.should the search warrant be quashed and all evidence found through the warrant suppressed as a remedy for the lawyer alleged breach of the privilege because the government did not procure or induce the breach,we conclude the answer is when the police use a confidential informant to obtain a warrant,and the defendant seeks to quash the warrant because he believes the informant was his lawyer and the police procured a breach of the privilege,we also conclude that an in camera review is the proper procedure to decide such a motion 
facts and procedural history 
acting on a tip from a confidential informant,los angeles county sheriff deputies obtained a warrant in april to search an auto body repair shop and the homes of several members of the navarro family,including those of brothers alejandro and edward navarro.based on evidence seized from those locations,alejandro,edward,and edward wife,donna navarro the navarro defendants,were charged with various counts related to their alleged operation of a car theft ring 
after reviewing the sheriff affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant,the three navarro defendants became convinced that their sister,elizabeth,had been the sheriff unnamed confidential informant.elizabeth is a lawyer and had previously represented some of the navarro defendants in both civil and criminal matters.donna and alejandro brought motions to order disclosure of the identity of the informant,and quash the search warrant,which they contended would thereby lead to a failure of the search as a fruit of the poisonous tree according to alejandro declaration,he,edward,and donna met with elizabeth in early to get legal advice regarding the circumstances surrounding the charges that were later brought against them.donna,edward,and alejandro asked elizabeth about the law and our rights and we discussed strategy and how to deal with the situation from a legal stand point.donna and alejandro argued that disclosure of the informant identity was important in order to prove that elizabeth had been the informer and had therefore breached the privilege by going to the sheriff.once that was established,quashing the search warrant would be the proper remedy for such a breach,they contended.that motion was heard by judge candace beason and was denied without prejudice on november,on two grounds first,because there was no evidence to show complicity by the sheriff under white cir white and second,because there was insufficient proof of an relationship.
one month later,donna and alejandro filed a supplemental motion to disclose the identity of the confidential informant,which included a more detailed declaration from alejandro concerning the existence of an relationship with elizabeth in connection with the charges against the navarro defendants.judge beason then agreed to hold an in camera hearing concerning the sheriff complicity,if any,in elizabeth supposed breach of the privilege.on march,the sheriff officer who initiated the search warrant testified in camera to the identity of the informant and the circumstances under which the informant contacted the sheriff.after hearing that testimony,the court found no complicity by the sheriff and denied donna and alejandro motion.six months later,donna entered a negotiated plea of guilty to the three grand theft counts,but did so on the condition that she would be able to appeal the issues relating to the supposed breach of her privilege.donna then filed a notice of appeal.
edward was not arrested until december.based on his suspicion that elizabeth had been the sheriff informant,he filed a motion in early january to disclose the identity of the informant,quash the search warrant,and suppress evidence.that motion was denied without prejudice by judge carlos uranga.edward brought a similar motion a few weeks later,which was to be heard before judge clifford klein.judge klein was unsure about the proper procedural vehicle for such a motion,and decided to hear it under evidence code section,which governs foundational challenges to the admissibility of evidence.at the march,hearing,the navarro defendants and friends and family members testified that elizabeth admitted to having supplied the sheriff with information about the navarro defendants alleged car theft ring.
the hearing was continued to march,where the sheriff officer who initially dealt with the informant was called to testify.the deputy first testified in open court about his contacts with the informant.according to the deputy,the informant initiated contact with him.they had from to phone conversations,and,of those,the informant placed anywhere from to percent of the calls.under by edward lawyer,the deputy said he never asked the informant to act as his agent,never asked the informant to get any information for him,and never indicated that it would be helpful to have certain specific information.the court then decided to continue the deputy testimony in camera.after the in camera testimony was over,the court scheduled argument for april.
at the april hearing,the court confirmed that it had earlier held an in camera hearing where the informant testified about the informant contacts with the sheriff.the court also confirmed that the issue it would decide was whether there had been any complicity by the sheriff in violation of white,supra.the court specifically declined to reach the issue of whether any relationship existed,noting that defense counsel had not been given an opportunity to the informant.the court found that the sheriff had not engaged in a knowing procurement of privileged information,had not intentionally or knowingly violated that privilege,and therefore had not been complicit in the breach of any privilege that might have existed.it denied edward motion.
edward petitioned this court for a writ of mandate or prohibition,declaring that he could not be prosecuted based on any evidence found through the search warrant.we stayed proceedings,issued an order to show cause,and directed the parties to brief the issues.we later issued an order stating that we would hear both edward writ petition and donna appeal at the same time.because the factual issues are nearly identical,and because the legal issues are identical,we issue this one decision to resolve both matters 
discussion 
quashing the search warranta.no sixth amendment right to counsel violation occurred 
appellants contend that the sheriff violated their sixth amendment right to counsel by using privileged information from their lawyer to obtain the search warrant for purposes of our discussion,we assume that elizabeth acted as appellants lawyer in connection with this case and that elizabeth breached the privilege when she provided the sheriff with information obtained through her representation.although we assume that state of facts,we do not decide the issue and express no opinion as to whether elizabeth had in fact been the informant.we start our substantive analysis with a short primer on the privilege.
the privilege,which authorizes a client to refuse to disclose,and prevent others from disclosing,confidential communications between lawyer and client,is considered a hallmark of our jurisprudence,et solin myers th,d.the privilege is fundamental to our legal system and furthers the public policy of ensuring every person right to freely and fully confer with and confide in his or her lawyer in order to receive adequate advice and a proper defense.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d.safeguarding a client confidences is one of a lawyer most basic obligations,citing bus,subd.e it is an attorney duty to maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.the privilege applies even where the attorney has not actually been retained.when a person seeks legal assistance from an attorney in anticipation of hiring the lawyer to represent him,any information acquired by the lawyer is privileged even if actual employment does not result.people gionis cal th,d.
appellants contend that because the sheriff utilized privileged information in obtaining the warrant,the warrant should have been quashed and all evidence obtained through it should have been suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree.the privilege is a testimonial privilege.delaney superior court cal d,conc.opn.of mosk.by itself,this privilege is merely a rule of evidence and does not supply a constitutional right.clutchette rushen cir.however,where the government intrudes into the relationship to obtain privileged information,the sixth amendment right to counsel may be violated.this usually involves some type of government misconduct,such as infiltrating the defense by planting informants or intercepting confidential communications.id.at.however,the constitutional right to counsel does not attach until charges are actually brought.moran burbine,d initiation of judicial proceedings fundamental to implication of sixth amendment kennedy cir,kennedy considering privileged information given to prosecutors during investigatory stage see people slayton cal th,d,right to counsel attaches when charges are brought.because elizabeth alleged misconduct prompted the search warrant which thereafter led to charges being brought against the navarro defendants,it is clear that her supposed breach of the privilege came before charges were filed,and before the sixth amendment right to counsel attached.if appellants were entitled to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence,their right to such relief must come from some other source.
absent government misconduct,no due process violation occurred 
although the right to counsel protections of the sixth amendment are limited to governmental misconduct occurring after charges have been brought,the due process protections of the fifth amendment may provide a remedy for misconduct by the government that occurs during the stage.kennedy,supra,at marshank,marshank.appellants have never specified the fifth amendment as a basis for their challenges to the search warrant.however,the decision primarily relied upon below by the prosecutor and the trial,supra,to have been based in part on the due process clause.we will therefore address that issue.
the defendants in white were convicted of bankruptcy fraud.they appealed their conviction,in part based on the claim that the government violated their fifth and sixth amendment rights by inducing their former lawyer to supply incriminating information against them in breach of the privilege.the seventh circuit remanded the matter to the united states district court to make certain factual findings,including whether the government had been complicit in any breach of the privilege and,if so,whether the government made use of any privileged documents.the latter inquiry was aimed at avoiding on appeal the constitutional issues raised by the whites.as a result of the evidentiary hearing held on remand,it appeared that the whites former bankruptcy lawyer mark center center had been convicted of bankruptcy fraud in a case that was unrelated to the whites convictions.center did,however,represent the whites in connection with the matter which led to the charges against the whites.before center was sentenced on his conviction,a federal prosecutor asked center if he wanted to provide information about the whites.center turned over documents obtained through his former representation of the whites and testified before the federal grand jury which eventually indicted the whites.
the seventh circuit began by stating that because the alleged breach of the privilege occurred before charges were brought against the whites,the sixth amendment right to counsel was not at issue.citing to an earlier,related decision which discussed violations of the fifth white cir,court said that the question instead concerned whether center violated his ethical obligations,whether the government had been complicit in that violation,and,if so,whether the whites had been prejudiced as a result.white,supra,at.the court first held that the privilege had not been breached because the documents center gave to prosecutors were not confidential.id.at.the court alternatively held that even if a breach of the privilege did occur,the district court found that the government had not explicitly or implicitly promised center leniency for his cooperation,adding that the whites merely speculated that the government procured a breach of the privilege.combined with the fact that the government did not ask center to obtain copies of any privileged documents,the seventh circuit concluded the government had not been complicit in any breach by center of the privilege.id.at.
thus,according to white,a due process violation for breach of the privilege turns on whether the government helped instigate or orchestrate a breach of the privilege.that is consistent with decisions from other courts which have considered this issue.kennedy,supra,at outrageous government conduct is needed to make out a due process violation for breach of the privilege this requires proof that the government objectively knew a relationship existed between the defendant and its informant,deliberately intruded into that relationship,and defendant was prejudiced as a result voigt cir,no outrageous conduct found in part because there was no proof the acted at the behest of government agents marshank,supra.at outrageous government conduct found,and indictment properly suppressed,where government agents actively collaborated with a lawyer to build a case against the lawyer client,the lawyer participated in the government investigation,the government knowingly assisted the lawyer in violating the privilege,then hid the violation from the court.it also appears consistent with the standards for determining whether there has been improper government intrusion into the privilege for purposes of a sixth amendment right to counsel violation.see clutchette rushen,supra,at where the police were entirely passive,did not initiate contact with the informant,did not encourage her to turn over privileged documents,and the informant acted voluntarily,no sixth amendment violation occurred.
appellants contend that white can not be construed to require evidence of government misconduct because the seventh circuit held that no breach of the privilege occurred.as noted,while that was the court initial holding,it also held that no due process violation occurred because there had been no government complicity in center breach of the privilege.appellants do not address that portion of the white decision.
appellants also contend that white original directions on led to the district court evidentiary indicate that any use of privileged information by the government is enough to make out a constitutional violation.in its remand order,the seventh circuit said it could avoid reaching any constitutional issues if the government did not use any privileged information and directed the lower court to make findings on that issue.the seventh circuit also directed the district court to look into the issues of government complicity and prejudice to the defendants from any breach of the privilege.white,supra,at.appellants have somehow cobbled these statements together to contend that,under white,any use of privileged documents by the government would amount to a constitutional violation.their contention ignores not just white language to the on whether the government procured the breach or directed the lawyer to find certain also the other decisions cited above holding the defendant must show affirmative government misconduct before a due process violation will be found.
synthesizing the federal decisions cited above,we conclude that in order to make out a fifth amendment due process violation against the government for obtaining a search warrant based on privileged information,a criminal defendant must show that the government objectively knew a relationship existed between the defendant and its informant the government deliberately intruded into that relationship and the defendant was prejudiced as a result.kennedy,supra,at.that the police are mere passive recipients of privileged information,then act on that information,is not enough to satisfy the second element of deliberate intrusion instead,some level of outrageous conduct,such as actively instigating or orchestrating a lawyer breach of the privilege,must occur voigt,supra,at white,supra,at.this rule is applicable to our state courts through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.lee city of los angeles cir,morgan woessner cir.
our review of the evidence given both in camera and in open court shows no government misconduct here.the sheriff affidavit of probable cause submitted in support of the search warrant states that the informant contacted the deputies,and that,based on information provided by the informant,they were independently led to other evidence and witnesses.during the march,in camera hearing held in connection with donna motions,a deputy testified that the informant contacted him and provided information.the deputy never directed the informant about how to provide information.during the march,open court hearing on edward motions,the deputy testified that the informant initiated contact with him.they had from to phone conversations,and,of those,the informant placed from to percent of the calls.under by edward lawyer,the deputy said he never asked the informant to act as his agent,never asked the informant to get any information for him,and never indicated to the informant that it would be helpful to have certain specific information.when that hearing continued in camera,the deputy testified that the informant had contacted him,and that he had never spoken with the informant before then.the informant provided him information,which the deputy investigated and corroborated.if that informant were elizabeth,nothing in the record even remotely suggests government misconduct in procuring information from her.see voigt,supra,at no due process violation in part because the did not act at the behest of government agents.instead,the deputies were no more than passive recipients of information that was voluntarily supplied.as a result,no due process violation occurred in obtaining the search warrant or the evidence derived from that warrant.
c.the statutory privilege,standing alone,does not permit the search warrant to be quashed 
finally,appellants contend that the statutory privilege by itself,provides a proper basis for quashing the warrant and suppressing its derivative evidence.we disagree.
as discussed earlier,the privilege is testimonial and evidentiary in nature.such privileges frustrate the fundamental principle that the public has a right to all available evidence and must be strictly construed to the limited extent that excluding relevant evidence serves a greater public good.people thompson d.as a testimonial or evidentiary privilege has no direct bearing on the process by which the police obtain information to support the determination of probable cause,evidence properly considered at the probable cause stage may still be excluded at trial.conversely,it is inappropriate to apply the rules of evidence as a criterion to determine probable cause.brinegar united states,fn.
in people morgan d.morgan,the court affirmed the denial of a motion to suppress an arrest warrant for lack of probable cause based on a claimed violation of the marital communications privilege.relying on brinegar united states,supra,the court held that t he rules of evidence applicable at trial do not apply in determining probable cause for arrest.morgan,supra,at.the court in nickel hannigan cir,applied kansas law to conclude that a violation of that state privilege did not provide grounds to suppress evidence obtained from the violation.a florida state court reached the same result on similar facts in state sandini so d sandini.in that case,the police obtained a search warrant based on information voluntarily provided by a lawyer,in breach of the privilege.the prosecution appealed from a trial court order suppressing the evidence.although the privileged information could be excluded at trial,the sandini court recognized that the privilege should be narrowly construed to prevent obstruction of the truth.therefore,information derived from a breach of the privilege could be used to establish probable cause for a search warrant.the client remedy for that breach was to sue for damages or initiate state bar disciplinary proceedings.if both of those possibilities are insufficient to deter violations of the privilege,certainly a rule of exclusion would have little additional deterrent effect.as a matter of practicality in most cases the attorney will have little interest in whether or not the evidence is excluded.id.at.
we find persuasive the reasoning of sandini,morgan,and the various federal decisions mentioned above.where a search warrant is obtained based on information provided to the police in breach of the privilege,the privilege by itself does not provide a fruit of the poisonous tree type remedy absent the sort of governmental misconduct needed to establish a constitutional violation.see marashi cir,no court has ever applied the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to violations of evidentiary privileges.while appellants contend that tort damages and state bar discipline would provide them with at best a pyrrhic victory from behind bars,that does not justify punishing the public or law enforcement when no constitutional violation has occurred 
an in camera hearing is the proper way to review a motion challenging a search warrant on the grounds the police procured a breach of the privilege 
appellants contend the trial court erred by holding in camera hearings when considering their motions to reveal the informant identity,quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence.resolution of this issue turns on our exegesis of both the statutory law concerning the disclosure of the identity of confidential police informants as well as the common law progenitors of those statutes.after discussing the history and boundaries of the informant privilege,we will then proceed to examine how the privilege applies when a defendant seeks to traverse a search warrant based on privileged information obtained from the defendant lawyer through unlawful police conduct.
a.the common law privilege 
the supreme courts of both california and the united states long ago recognized that the government held a privilege against disclosing the identity of police informants.the primary policies served by this privilege are twofold to encourage citizens to report crimes regardless of their motives for doing so and to avoid inhibiting law enforcement necessary use of professional informants.mccray illinois,d mccray people gonzales d,disapproved on other grounds by people mcshann cal d.the scope of the privilege is limited by its underlying purpose.where disclosure of the contents of a communication will not tend to reveal an informant identity,the contents are not privileged.when the informant identity has been disclosed,the privilege no longer applies.the privilege is also limited by notions of fundamental fairness.where disclosure of an informant identity,or the contents of his communications,is relevant and helpful to an accused defense or to a fair determination of a cause,the privilege must yield.the trial court may order disclosure and,if the government refuses,may dismiss the action.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d,citing roviaro united states,d.whether or not disclosure is relevant to a defense or a fair determination of a cause turns largely on whether the informant is also a material witness on the issue of guilt.hobbs,at,d.
if the informant was not a material witness on the issue of guilt and the defendant seeks to learn his identity in order to challenge the legality of a facially valid search warrant based on information provided by the informant,the informant identity need not be disclosed.the rationale for this exception is based on the fact that a warrant is issued by a neutral magistrate.because the magistrate will issue a warrant only upon a showing of probable cause,and has the power to question the informant if he sees fit,there is adequate protection against police abuse.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d,citing people keener cal d,overruled on another point in people butler cal d.
b.the statutory privilege 
the common law privilege for an informant identity has been codified in evidence code section hobbs,supra,cal th at,d.section provides,in relevant part a public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose the identity of a person who has furnished information in confidence to a law enforcement officer purporting to disclose a violation of a law of the united states or of this state or of a public entity in this state if disclosure of the identity of the informer is against the public interest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of his identity that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice 
if the people successfully invoke the informant privilege,section,subdivision a states that the trial court must then make such order or finding of fact adverse to the public entity bringing the proceeding as is required by law upon any issue in the proceeding to which the privileged information is material.section,subdivision b states,in relevant part w here a search is made pursuant to a warrant valid on its face,the public entity bringing a criminal proceeding is not required to reveal to the defendant official information or the identity of an informer in order to establish the legality of the search or the admissibility of any evidence obtained as a result of it.therefore,this subdivision codifies the common law rule that disclosure of an informant identity is not required to establish the legality of a search made pursuant to a warrant.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d.section,subdivision d provides that if the defendant demands disclosure of the informant identity because the informant is a material witness on the issue of guilt,the court must hold an in camera hearing which excludes the defendant and his lawyer.if nondisclosure is upheld,the transcript of the hearing and any evidence presented at the hearing must be sealed unless,based on that evidence,the trial court concludes there is a reasonable possibility that nondisclosure might deprive the defendant of a fair trial 
development of case law exceptions allowing limited discovery 
a corollary to the informant privilege in sections and is a general ban on the disclosure of communications that might tend to reveal the informant identity.this prohibition constitutes an exception to the general rule that the contents of a search warrant,including its supporting affidavits,become public record.as a means of balancing the people privilege to protect the identities of its informants against a defendant due process right of reasonable access to information that might permit a challenge to the validity of a search warrant,the courts have fashioned several procedures.these include redacting or sealing information from a search warrant that might tend to reveal an informant identity.problems arise when the prosecution tries to extend those procedures to all or most of a search warrant affidavit,leaving a defendant unable to determine whether a probable cause challenge should be made.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d.
in franks delaware,d franks,the united states supreme court held that a defendant may challenge the veracity of the search warrant affidavit due to police misconduct,but only upon a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant lied and that the remaining contentions in the affidavit are insufficient to establish probable cause.people eid th,fn,d.in people luttenberger cal d,luttenberger,our supreme court established a discovery procedure where a defendant seeks to mount a franks challenge to a search warrant obtained through information from a confidential informant.the warrant affidavit in luttenberger was not sealed and the defendant did not seek to learn the identity of the police informant.instead,he wanted to obtain police records concerning the background and reliability of the informant to contest the veracity of the affidavit.
because franks did not involve a confidential informant,the luttenberger court declined to apply the franks requirement of a substantial preliminary showing of material falsity franks,supra,at.as a condition to a hearing on the veracity of a search warrant affidavit where the police used a confidential informant where a confidential informant was involved,absent some sort of discovery on the issue,a defendant would have no meaningful opportunity to mount a franks challenge and would be seriously handicapped in his attempt to obtain an evidentiary hearing.luttenberger,supra,cal d at.in order to accommodate the competing interests of the state and the defendant,the court fashioned a rule that allowed a defendant to obtain limited discovery of police records concerning a confidential informant as part of a franks challenge to a search warrant the defendant must make a preliminary showing that describes the information sought with some particularity and that is supported by a plausible justification.the defendant must offer some evidence casting reasonable doubt regarding either the existence of the informant or the truthfulness of the affiant statements concerning the informant.once that showing is made,the trial court has discretion to order an in camera review of the documents.if the court determines that the defendant challenge is not supported,then the court should report only that.if the court determines that the information it reviewed tends to contradict material representations in the affidavit or constitutes material omissions from it,the court should order disclosure of the documents,but only after excising all information that might reveal the informant identity.luttenberger,cal d at.
the luttenberger rule was applied in hobbs,supra,cal th,d,where,in order to mount a franks challenge to a search warrant,the defendant sought disclosure of a search warrant affidavit that had been sealed to protect the identity of a police informant.after reviewing the common law and statutory bases for the informant privilege,the hobbs court approved of an in camera hearing to review the contents of a sealed search warrant affidavit in order to determine whether there was a reasonable probability that the search warrant affiant made material misrepresentations when obtaining the warrant.if not,the inquiry ends.if so,the prosecution is put to the choice of either consenting to disclosure of the documents as a prelude to a further evidentiary hearing,or to an order granting the defendant motion to traverse the warrant.hobbs,at,d.
the hobbs court specified in great detail the procedure that should be followed before ruling on a franks motion in these circumstances.upon a properly noticed motion to quash or traverse the search warrant,the trial court should conduct an in camera hearing pursuant to section,subdivision b the first step is to determine whether sufficient grounds exist for maintaining the confidentiality of the informant identity,followed by a determination whether the affidavit or any part of it was properly sealed and whether additional portions may be redacted and divulged.the prosecutor may be present,and defendant and his lawyer are excluded unless the prosecutor consents to their presence.defense counsel should be allowed to submit written questions of a reasonable length,which the trial judge will then ask of any witnesses called to testify at the proceeding.because the defendant may be unable to specify what materials the court should review in camera,the court must take it upon itself to examine the affidavit for inconsistencies or insufficiencies regarding the showing of probable cause,and inform the prosecution of the materials or witnesses it requires.these will likely include relevant police reports and other information concerning the informant and the informant reliability.because the defendant access to the essence of the affidavit is restricted,the trial court may also,in its discretion,find it necessary to call other witnesses it deems necessary to rule upon the issues.if the informant is called as a witness,steps may be taken to protect his identity,including holding the in camera hearing away from the courthouse.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d.
the hobbs court cited to people seibel d.seibel,when stating the rule that the documents the trial court reviewed in camera might be disclosed if the trial court found a reasonable probability that the search warrant affiant had made material misrepresentations.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d.the cited portion of seibel endorsed such disclosures,but only after excising all information that might tend to reveal the informant identity.thus,in both hobbs and luttenberger,even though a defendant is entitled to conduct discovery in order to mount a franks challenge,the identity of the confidential informant will still remain hidden,even if a franks violation has occurred.
appellants were entitled to no more than an in camera hearing 
as mentioned at the beginning of this section,we must decide what type of hearing is required when a defendant seeks to traverse a search warrant and learn the identity of a confidential police informant,contending that the police were able to secure that warrant based on information obtained from the defendant lawyer by procuring a breach of the privilege.we hold that the rationale behind the discovery procedures established in hobbs and luttenberger is sufficiently analogous,calling for their application in these circumstances.even though we apply hobbs and luttenberger principles,we are mindful that those cases did not involve a defendant who had sought the identity of an informant 
respondent supplemental briefs on this issue make four separate arguments.first,taking section,subdivision b literally,respondent contends that appellants want to learn official information and the identity of an informer not on the issue of guilt or innocence but in order to establish the legality of the search or the admissibility of any evidence obtained as a result of it.accordingly,respondent argues that for reasons already given the prosecution was not required to reveal any such information.second,the district attorney contends that appellants could have called as witnesses both elizabeth and the police officers involved in obtaining the search warrant,and questioned them about their conduct third,the district attorney says that pursuant to section,subdivision b,an in camera hearing was the proper vehicle by which to examine witnesses on this issue.fourth,the attorney general contends that the in camera review process fashioned by the luttenberger and hobbs courts should apply.
appellants contend that their constitutional due process right against a procured breach of the privilege falls outside the scope and purpose of sections and.decisions such as mccray,supra,at pages,state that the informant privilege is designed to encourage citizens to report crimes.because we should not encourage lawyers to breach the privilege,appellants believe section does not apply here.they contend that section does not apply because that provision is designed for a franks probable cause challenge based on claims that the police lied about material information when trying to get a search warrant issued.here,appellants do not need to show the police lied.
appellants acknowledge that there is no case law precedent on this issue,and ask us to adopt a rule that would permit an in camera hearing on one issue only whether the confidential informant is in fact the defendant lawyer.all other issues must be resolved in open court,they contend,with the witnesses subject to cross examination by defense counsel.they argue that this is required for two reasons first,because such a hearing is the only way to fully explore the other issues and ensure that a defendant rights are fully protected second,because an in camera hearing on the remaining issues would violate public policy by shielding a lawyer from his unethical conduct 
the fault line for our analysis lies between the full and open hearing advocated by appellants and the restrictive approach that respondent advances.we begin with this essential premise if the police obtained a search warrant based on information from a confidential informant that resulted from procuring a breach of the privilege,then the police have violated the defendant due process rights and the defendant is entitled to have the warrant traversed and any resulting evidence suppressed 
we next consider the primary purpose of the rule that requires the courts to traverse a warrant and suppress any evidence obtained because the government procured a breach of the deter and punish police misconduct,not the faithless attorney.see voigt,supra,at noting that the rule against procured breaches of the privilege has its genesis in cases based on outrageous law enforcement investigative techniques united states rogers cir,lawyer failure to abide by his ethical obligations when talking to the police does not transform the police investigation into government misconduct.when the police procure a breach of the privilege,the remedy should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.united states rogers,at suppression of evidence is the preferred remedy,with dismissal of indictment reserved for the most extreme cases.
in this sense,the due process violation at issue here is no different from the fourth amendment violations that motivated the franks court.the essence of a franks motion is to remedy police misconduct.people eid,supra,th at,fn,d under franks,a defendant may attack the veracity of a search warrant affidavit for police misconduct.as the franks court itself said when rejecting the notion that a defendant could never attack the veracity of a facially valid warrant,a flat ban on impeachment of veracity could denude the requirement of all real meaning.franks,supra,at.because warrants must be issued upon probable cause,and be supported by affidavits made under penalty of perjury,that requirement would be reduced to a nullity if a police officer was able to use deliberately falsified allegations to demonstrate probable cause,and,having misled the magistrate,then was able to remain confident that the ploy was worthwhile.luttenberger,supra,cal d at,franks rule was designed to prevent searches based on false allegations by police officers from going unchallenged and unremedied.
the in camera discovery procedures authorized by luttenberger and hobbs were designed to make the franks remedy available in cases where a search warrant was obtained with the help of a confidential informant.hobbs,supra,cal th at,d,luttenberger,supra,cal d at.just as franks did not involve a confidential informant,the defendants in cases such as kennedy,supra,voigt,supra,and white,supra,somehow knew that their lawyers had disclosed privilege information to the police and issues concerning confidential informants were not raised.and just as special discovery proceedings were found essential in both hobbs and luttenberger in order to effectuate a defendant fourth amendment franks rights when the police use a confidential informant,we believe they are essential here as well to protect a defendant due process rights 
luttenberger,involved an in camera review of the police records specified by defense counsel.luttenberger,supra,cal d at.under hobbs,as discussed in detail earlier,the defendant may specify questions to be asked and documents that should be examined,while the court is given the responsibility of conducting a thorough inquiry and examination of any necessary witnesses.in authorizing this procedure,the hobbs court explicitly rejected the contention that the trial courts were ill equipped to conduct such an inquiry and that only an open and fully adversarial hearing would suffice.insofar as use of sealed affidavits is unavoidable,it is not unusual or inappropriate for the burden of protecting citizens rights to fall upon our judiciary,and trial courts,as always,retain broad discretion in weighing th
