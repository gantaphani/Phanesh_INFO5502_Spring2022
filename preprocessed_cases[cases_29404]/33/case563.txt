we we granted review in this case to determine whether the appearance of bias by a judge requires recusal under the due process clause of the federal constitution,amend.while this matter was pending the united states supreme court filed its opinion in caperton massey coal,d.the court exhaustive review of its jurisprudence in this delicate realm of constitutional law compels the following conclusions while a showing of actual bias is not required for judicial disqualification under the due process clause,neither is the mere appearance of bias sufficient.instead,based on an objective assessment of the circumstances in the particular case,there must exist the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker that is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.id.at.at.where only the appearance of bias is at issue,a litigant recourse is to seek disqualification under state disqualification statutes because the codes of judicial conduct provide more protection than due process requires,most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to the constitution.id.at.at.finally,the court emphasized that only the most extreme facts would justify judicial disqualification based on the due process clause.id.at pp.at.
the court of appeal held that the circumstances of this case required the trial judge to recuse himself and his failure to do so violated defendant marilyn kaye freeman due process rights.we conclude,however,in light of caperton,that this case does not present the extreme facts that require judicial disqualification on due process grounds.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
the facts underlying the defendant offenses were succinctly summarized by the court of appeal on september,defendant daughter called the police reporting that her mother had assaulted her that day and had been doing so on a regular basis.was removed from her home and placed in a foster home.defendant,an attorney,then engaged in an aggressive campaign to disrupt the foster placement and terrorize her daughter foster parents in a misguided attempt to monitor and reunite with her daughter.defendant solicited one of her clients to kidnap from the foster parents,burglarized the foster parents home,chased the foster parents at high speeds on the freeway,followed them in her car on city streets,glared at them in an evil manner when she was spotted,spied on them at their residence and elsewhere,took pictures of them,and sprayed her perfume in their vehicle.
the jury found defendant guilty of solicitation to commit kidnapping,residential burglary,stalking,and misdemeanor child endangerment and battery.she was sentenced to prison for six years.
procedural background 
on the morning of december,defendant,then in custody,appeared before judge robert for a hearing pursuant to people marsden cal d,in which she sought to replace her counsel.after the court granted her motion,the issue of bail arose.judge said he would set the matter for bail review before another judge.after some further colloquy,defendant said,i was wanting to bring up at that hearing the possibility of house arrest there is sic rumors that are not really charges that i have been stalking poor judge elias.judge elias was the judge presiding over the dependency court proceeding involving defendant and her daughter.
judge replied that he was aware of the allegation,and commented,judge elias and i worked together in the district attorney office.i have known judge elias for years.he is a friend of mine,and that is another reason i want to set the bail review back in front of judge szumowski who originally set bail.there is no good cause to change bail,and i really think based on what i have been told i would recuse myself from the bail issue.
after further discussion on scheduling matters,defendant again raised the bail issue,telling the court she had been advised at arraignment to seek bail review before someone other than judge szumowski.judge told her she should discuss the situation with her newly appointed counsel in light of the allegations made concerning judge elias.in that situation a judge who is not a member of the bench should hear a bail review.that would be a retired judge or a judge sitting on assignment.defendant observed that judge elias had not recused himself because he made it clear he does think there is any substance to those allegations,and said,do you think in lieu of all this craziness if just house arrest would be a good idea the court replied,in part,what i am doing as to your bail motion,i am recusing myself.i do think i the person that should hear it.
between january,and september,various judges of the san diego superior judge over hearings in defendant case related to appointment of counsel,bail review,discovery,and other matters.on september,defendant case was assigned to retired judge charles jones for all purposes.judge jones presided over defendant preliminary hearing and bound her over for trial.
at a may,status conference,judge jones stated on the record that there was a discussion in chambers about why the matter had been assigned to him.and the district attorney has advised me of how and why that came about and the reason.the reason no longer exists,and it does not look like there been a recusal of the san diego county superior court,so i will put another couple of other matters on the record and transfer the matter back to judge deddeh.
later that day,judge deddeh explained,with regard to the recusal issue,it is my understanding that it was communicated to judge jones that the only reason the bench was being recused is because there is a possibility that on defendant computer there was some indication that she was stalking judge elias.apparently the computer has been reviewed and apparently judge elias is not a victim in this case.and so there is apparently no reason for the bench to recuse itself.ultimately,judge deddeh reassigned the case to judge.defendant reminded the court that he already recused himself.he recused himself because he is a good friend of judge elias.judge deddeh replied,he can do that when i send it up there.defendant said,okay.judge deddeh added,we see whether or not this is going to be an issue for him.when the case reached judge that day,defendant filed a handwritten challenge to him in which her counsel did not join.no action was taken on the challenge on that day.
the may,minute order for judge department states that the matter was sent back to judge deddeh for reassignment that morning but does not reflect what discussion led to this action.judge deddeh declined to consider the disqualification motion on the ground that it was not filed by defendant counsel and returned the case to judge.in judge court,defendant evidently withdrew her challenge.judge returned the matter to judge deddeh for a record to be made re withdrawal of challenge and assignment back to judge.back in judge deddeh court,judge deddeh asked defense counsel,all right.so with regard to the code of civil procedure section challenge is your client withdrawing her challenge defense counsel answered,yes,your honor.the court then posed the same question to defendant all right.so then is that right,miss freeman,you are withdrawing that defendant replied,yes,your honor.judge deddeh then reassigned the case to judge.
on october,the day of trial,during a hearing on another marsden motion,defendant again sought to disqualify judge for cause.defendant claimed she had been bullied by her attorneys into keeping judge but that she believed that he was personally prejudiced and i always have because you told me that in december of.the court responded,freeman,you withdrew your challenge in front of judge deddeh.after the court denied her marsden motion,defendant again claimed the court was prejudiced against her and said,i do believe that once you recused yourself for cause that there was any possible way for that to be overridden.the court responded,freeman,that has been ruled upon.
the matter proceeded to trial and defendant was convicted and sentenced as noted.
the court of appeal reversed defendant conviction on the ground that defendant due process rights were violated by judge failure to disqualify himself when the case was reassigned to him we granted the attorney general petition for review.
ii.analysis 
statutory forfeiture of claim 
before we reach the constitutional issue,we must dispose of a preliminary matter whether defendant forfeited any claim that her statutory right to disqualify a judge for bias,either actual or apparent,was violated in this case.the statutory basis for disqualifying judges is set forth in code of civil procedure section,and other sections outline the procedures for determining the motion and the effect of the disqualification.
relevant here are two provisions contained in code of civil procedure section.subdivision a states that,upon recusal,the recused judge shall not further participate in the proceeding,except as provided in section,unless his or her disqualification is waived by the parties as provided in subdivision b.subdivision d provides in part the determination of the question of the disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal sought only by the parties to the proceeding,subd.d.under our statutory scheme,a petition for writ of mandate is the exclusive method for obtaining review of a denial of a judicial qualification motion.people mayfield cal th,d,italics added.
defendant filed two statutory disqualification motions against judge,one on may,and again on october.she withdrew the first motion.as to the latter motion,defendant asserted both that judge was biased against her and that,having once recused himself from her case,i do believe that there was any possible way for that to be overridden.judge responded that her motion had been disposed of when she withdrew the earlier motion and,in effect,denied the october motion.
defendant failure to seek writ review of that denial forfeits both of her potential statutory claims that judge should have been disqualified for cause and that,having once recused himself,he was statutorily precluded from accepting reassignment of the case.see geldermann,bruner d.the statutes,however,do not permit limited,partial or conditional recusal.accordingly,we address the issue of judicial disqualification solely under the rubric of due process.people chatman cal th,d.
due process violation 
we now turn to the issue on which review was granted does the due process clause require judicial disqualification based on the mere appearance of bias.a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.in re murchison.the supreme court has long established that the due process clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a fair and impartial judge.larson palmateer cir.the operation of the due process clause in the realm of judicial impartiality,then,is primarily to protect the individual right to a fair trial.in contrast to this elemental goal,a statutory disqualification scheme,like that found in our code of civil procedure,is not solely concerned with the rights of the parties before the court but is also intended to ensure public confidence in the judiciary.curle superior court cal th,d.thus,an explicit ground for judicial disqualification in california statutory scheme is a public perception of partiality,that is,the appearance of bias.code civ,subd.a a iii christie city of el centro th,d disqualification is mandated if a reasonable person would entertain doubts concerning the judge impartiality.
by contrast,the united state supreme court due process case law focuses on actual bias.this does not mean that actual bias must be proven to establish a due process violation.rather,consistent with its concern that due process guarantees an impartial adjudicator,the court has focused on those circumstances where,even if actual bias is not demonstrated,the probability of bias on the part of a judge is so great as to become constitutionally intolerable.caperton massey coal,supra,at.at caperton.the standard is an objective one.
caperton both reviewed the court jurisprudence in this area and extended it.the issue in caperton was whether due process was violated by a west virginia high court justice refusal to recuse himself from a case involving a million damage award against a coal company whose chairman had contributed million to the justice election campaign.the justice cast the deciding vote that overturned the award.the united states supreme court held that,under the extreme facts of the case,the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level.caperton,supra,at.at.
as the caperton court noted,in the high court first foray into this area in tumey ohio,it had concluded that the due process clause incorporated the rule that a judge must recuse himself when he has a direct,personal,substantial,pecuniary interest in a case.caperton,supra,at.at.caperton observed,however,that new problems have emerged that were not discussed at common law leading it to identify additional instances which,as an objective matter,require recusal.ibid.tumey itself was such a case.tumey involved a authorized to conduct court trials of those accused of violating a state alcoholic beverage prohibition law if a defendant was found guilty,a percentage of his fine was paid to the mayor and the rest was paid to the village general treasury.the court held that the system violated the defendant due process rights even assuming that the direct pecuniary interest would not have influenced his decision.the tumey court articulated the controlling principle every procedure which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant,or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice,clear and true between the state and the accused,denies the latter due process of law.caperton,at.at.
the caperton court observed that,even in that early case,the high court was concerned with more than the traditional prohibition on direct pecuniary interest.it was also concerned with a more general concept of interests that tempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality.caperton,supra,at.at.the court in caperton reviewed two of its other decisions implicating indirect pecuniary interests that in its view tested the neutrality of the adjudicators in those cases.ward monroeville,d involved another,but in that case the mayor compensation was not tied to his adjudications.rather,the fines the mayor assessed went to the town general fisc.caperton,supra,at.at.nonetheless,the monroeville court found the procedure to violate due process because of the possible temptation the mayor might face to maximize the town revenues at the expense of defendants appearing before him.caperton,at.at.
finally,in aetna life insurance lavoie,d,the court further clarified the reach of the due process clause regarding a judge financial interest in a case.there,a justice had cast the deciding vote on the alabama supreme court to uphold a punitive damages award against an insurance company for refusal to pay a claim.at the time of his vote,the justice was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical suit pending in alabama lower courts.his deciding vote,this court surmised,undoubtedly raised the stakes for the insurance defendant in the justice suit.citation.the court stressed that it was not required to decide whether in fact the justice was influenced.citation.the proper constitutional inquiry is whether sitting on the case then before the supreme court of alabama would offer a possible temptation to the average judge to lead him not to hold the balance nice,clear and true.citation.the court underscored that what degree or kind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting can not be defined with precision.citation.in the court view,however,it was important that this test have an objective component.caperton,supra,at pp.at.
the caperton court then examined another line of cases in which the court had found that the probability of actual bias was so high as to require recusal under the due process clause.the second instance requiring recusal that was not discussed
