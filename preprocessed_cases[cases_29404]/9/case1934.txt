this case presents the question of whether a municipal ordinance,which prohibits individuals from soliciting immediate donations near two streets that run through the downtown mall in charlottesville,virginia,unconstitutionally restricts the free speech of individuals who regularly beg on the downtown mall.we hold that the district court erred by resolving this issue at the pleadings stage,and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the city of charlottesville the city has adopted an ordinance that proscribes soliciting in certain areas of the city.section of the charlottesville city code the ordinance reads in relevant as follows 
a it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit money or other things of value,or to solicit the sale of goods or services 
on the downtown mall within fifty feet in any direction of street west and street east,when those streets are open to vehicular traffic.
solicit means to request an immediate donation of money or other thing of value from another person,regardless of the solicitor purpose or intended use of the money or other thing of value.a solicitation may take the form of,without limitation,the spoken,written,or printed word,or by other means of communication for example an outstretched hand,an extended cup or hat.
c any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a class misdemeanor.
charlottesville city code,as amended.
albert clatterbuck,christopher martin,earl mccraw,john jordan,and michael sloan collectively,appellants are impecunious and reliant to a certain extent on begging to sustain themselves.one of the locations where each appellant begs is east main street in the city,commonly known as the downtown mall.id.the complaint alleges few facts about the downtown mall,other than that it has numerous restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating,and appellants regularly beg within view of those restaurants and cafes.id.
appellants brought this action under against the city to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance,asserting that it violates their first amendment right to beg,impermissibly restraining their protected speech activities and livelihood.the complaint alleges that the city adopted the ordinance in order to restrict the right of the impoverished to solicit funds for their own,and challenges the ordinance as a regulation that criminalizes speech based on the content of the communication.further,the complaint states that a s a direct and proximate result of the conduct of the city in enacting the ordinance,appellants have and will continue to suffer harm,including,but not limited to damages to the right to communicate to the general public as well as emotional distress.id.at.appellants seek declaratory and injunctive relief,damages,and attorneys fees and costs.
the city filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,respectively.the district court found appellants had standing,but dismissed the action for failing to allege a cognizable first amendment violation.the court reasoned that the ordinance constitutes a,permissible time,place,and manner restriction.appellants timely appealed the district court decision to dismiss the action,and the city to challenge the district court determination that appellants have standing to bring their claim.
we first address the city argument that appellants do not have standing to bring this first amendment challenge to the ordinance.finding that they do,we next turn to appellants claim itself,and conclude that it was improperly dismissed at the pleadings stage.
the threshold issue of standing is a legal question that we examine de novo.see benham city of charlotte,cir.as the party asserting federal jurisdiction,appellants bear the burden of establishing they have standing to invoke the authority of a federal court a burden which tracks the manner and degree of evidence required at each successive stage of litigation.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.accordingly,at the present pleadings stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the city conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also bishop bartlett,cir.
in order to possess standing to bring this action in federal court,appellants must show the three familiar elements of constitutional standing,causation,and redressability.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the essence of the standing inquiry is whether the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.baker carr,d.we agree with the district court that appellants have done so here for the purposes of the motion to dismiss.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the speech and expressive conduct that comprise begging merit first amendment protection.the supreme court has held that the solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech.riley fed of the blind of,d.several of our sister circuits have extended that holding to begging,which is simply solicitation on behalf of the speaker.see,smith city of fort lauderdale,cir like other charitable solicitation,begging is speech entitled to first amendment protection.loper new york city police dep t,cir we see little difference between those who solicit for organized charities and those who solicit for themselves in regard to the message conveyed.the former are communicating the needs of others while the latter are communicating their personal needs.both solicit the charity of others.the distinction is not significant for first amendment purposes.we agree that begging is communicative activity within the protection of the first amendment.
the city argues on that appellants lack standing because they failed to allege that they have begged in the past,or wish to beg in the future,specifically within the two buffer zones when those streets are open to vehicular traffic,as prohibited by the ordinance.according to the city,this lack of specificity prevents us from knowing whether appellants are actually harmed by subsection a of the ordinance,whether they can establish an for standing purposes.because we find appellants have pleaded sufficiently specific facts to demonstrate they have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest,white tail park,stroube,cir internal quotation marks omitted,that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,rather than conjectural or hypothetical,lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted,we disagree.
although the complaint does not allege that appellants have begged or plan to beg specifically within the buffer zones,it does,more generally,allege that appellants regularly beg on the downtown mall,and that they suffer harm by being prevented from fully exercising their first amendment rights.these general factual allegations may suffice on a motion to dismiss to allow us to presume that they embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we decline the city invitation to rigidly impose such a precise level of specificity at the pleadings stage.
the ordinance,which prohibits solicitation within a subsection of the mall,actually and concretely impacts appellants general begging activities on the mall as described in their complaint.indeed,the ordinance may constitute a cognizable injury to appellants merely by interfering with or creating the need to plan the substance and placement of their speech.benham,at quoting.soc y for human life,fec,cir.further,the ordinance limits not only the area available for appellants speech activities,but also the audience.a regulation that reduces the size of a speaker audience can constitute an invasion of a legally protected interest.white tail park,at.
for these reasons,we find appellants allegations substantiate their to bring this constitutional challenge.even without specifically alleging they have begged within the buffer zones,appellants allegations that the ordinance restricts and deters their begging activity on the mall form the basis for a cognizable injury under the first amendment at this juncture.
we turn next to examine whether appellants claim that the ordinance violates the first amendment was adequately pleaded in their complaint.we review the district court dismissal of appellants claim de novo,accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint.wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir aziz alcolac,cir.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,a complaint must establish facial plausibility by pleading factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d.at bottom,a plaintiff must nudge its claims across the line from conceivable to plausible to resist dismissal.wag more dogs,at quoting bell atlantic twombly,d.
before determining the sufficiency of appellants allegations,we must first ascertain the appropriate first amendment framework to apply to their claim.
we start with the relatively uncontroversial premise that begging on the downtown mall constitutes expressive activity in a traditional public forum,which garners the full protective force of the first amendment.we then examine the type of restriction imposed by the ordinance,and find that the proper standard can not be determined,or applied,at this stage of the proceedings.
we have already explained that begging constitutes protected speech.additionally,by restricting speech near streets on the downtown mall,the ordinance regulates a quintessential public forum over which the first amendment shield is strongest.
in places which by long tradition or governmental fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate,the rights of the state to limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.although there is very little information about the downtown mall in the record,places such as parks,streets,and sidewalks fall into the category of public property traditionally held open to the public for expressive activity.loper,at see also smith,at iskon of potomac,kennedy,mall in washington,constitutes a traditional public forum.indeed,the supreme court has repeatedly referred to public streets and sidewalks as the archetype of a traditional public forum.snyder phelps,d quoting frisby schultz,d.with this strength of authority,and without any indication to the contrary,we conclude that the downtown mall constitutes a traditional public forum.
because appellants seek to engage in protected speech in a traditional public forum,the government power to regulate that speech is limited,though not foreclosed.the government may impose reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions that are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.ward rock against racism,d.if the regulation is,however,we apply strict scrutiny.perry,at.under that heightened standard,we may uphold the regulation only if it is the least restrictive means available to further a compelling government interest.id.thus,our final step in establishing the appropriate first amendment framework requires us to determine whether the ordinance is or.see schultz,at t he appropriate level of scrutiny is initially tied to whether the statute distinguishes between prohibited and permitted speech on the basis of content.we turn to this inquiry next.
the government restriction of speech is if it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.christian legal soc y martinez,d quoting ward,at.on the other hand,a restriction is if it was adopted because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys.ward,at.in this inquiry,t he government purpose is the controlling consideration.id.
in evaluating challenges to municipal sign ordinances,we have adopted a pragmatic rather than formalistic approach to evaluating content neutrality.see wag more dogs,at brown town of cary,wl,slip op.at cir.under this practical analysis,not every content distinction merits strict scrutiny instead,a distinction is only if it distinguishes content with a censorial intent to value some forms of speech over others to distort public debate,to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.brown,slip op.at internal citations and alterations omitted.
in deciphering censorial intent,brown looked to the relationship or lack thereof between the content distinction and the legislative end.id.at.in so doing,we have examined whether the government justification reasonably comports with the content distinction on the face of the regulation.see turner broad,fcc,d t he mere assertion of a purpose is not enough to save a law which,on its face,discriminates based on content.
here,the district court concluded that the ordinance is because it does not distinguish between favored and disfavored solicitation,clatterbuck city of charlottesville,d,but rather applies to all forms of solicitations,regardless of the solicitor purpose or the content of the solicitor speech,id.at.we can not agree.the ordinance plainly distinguishes between types of solicitations on its face.whether the ordinance is violated turns solely on the nature or content of the solicitor speech it prohibits solicitations that request immediate donations of things of value,while allowing other types of solicitations,such as those that request future donations,or those that request things which may have no value a signature or a kind word,perhaps.
but we do not end our inquiry there.having determined that the ordinance speech restriction is based on a content distinction,our pragmatic approach asks next whether the city has distinguished speech because of its content,and is consequently.brown,slip op.at.in our recent decision in brown,faced with the distinctive problems posed by municipal sign ordinances,we applied this pragmatic inquiry and declined to find a censorial purpose.see id.however,brown reviewed the constitutionality of a different kind of expressive activity at a different procedural posture,when more facts were at play and evidence could be evaluated.in contrast,here we are bound like the district court to evaluate appellants claims based on the sufficiency of their pleadings,not based on the government asserted evidence or our own independent judgment of likely purposes.we find ourselves to reach a conclusion as to censorial purpose,based on the record before us,at this juncture.we are compelled to conclude that the district court erred in finding the ordinance as a matter of law and dismissing the case on a rule b motion to dismiss.
deeming the ordinance a constitutional,time,place,and manner regulation,the district court reasoned that the restrictions at issue in the instant case are limited to situations in which people most likely would feel a heightened sense of fear or alarm,or might wish especially to be left alone.clatterbuck,d at quoting gresham peterson,cir.although the district court purported to reach its conclusion on the face of the ordinance,it indicated in a footnote its reliance on video archives of the charlottesville city council meetings on august and,which the city referenced in its reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss.id.at.stating that the archives are a matter of public record available for viewing at,the district court summarized the information disclosed during these meetings as follows t he foot buffer zone in the vehicular crossings was proposed as absolutely crucial for the safety and security of mall patrons because pedestrians were being distracted in and near the crossings.id in considering these statements as evidence supporting the government purpose,the district court erred by impermissibly reaching outside the pleadings to make findings of fact.
ordinarily,a court may not consider any documents that are outside
