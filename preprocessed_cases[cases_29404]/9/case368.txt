this appeal arises from a complaint filed by david meuser against federal express corporation fedex on february,in the hampshire superior court,in the commonwealth of massachusetts,alleging violation of the massachusetts civil rights act mcra.laws ch,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and discharge in violation of public policy,counts i,ii,and iii,respectively.on march,fedex filed a notice of removal in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on the basis of diversity and federal question jurisdiction.
fedex filed a motion for summary judgment,on all counts,on september,contending that the facts,even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,could not lead a reasonable jury to conclude that any action was taken against plaintiff via threats,intimidation or coercion as required by the mcra,and that plaintiff was not constructively discharged.meuser filed his opposition to fedex motion for summary judgment on october.on december,district court judge michael ponsor,entered a memorandum and order granting summary judgment in favor of fedex,on counts i violation of the mcra and iii wrongful termination in violation of public policy meuser timely filed his notice of appeal on january.
background 
the events underlying this case commenced on october,when appellant,a fedex courier since april,noticed fumes in his delivery truck.thereafter,appellant made a visit to the hospital and was out of work for three days as a result of his exposure to the fumes.consequently,on october,meuser filed a worker compensation claim,and on october,he filed a safety first report with fedex.around that same time meuser,because he was concerned about his exposure and the nature of the fumes,asked his supervisors for the material safety data sheets msds containing the safety information regarding the faulty pump that was believed to have caused the fumes.on october,he requested that the occupational safety and health administration osha perform an investigation regarding the fumes emanating from his delivery truck.appellant further filed a written formal complaint.osha found that the hazard had already been investigated,identified as a leaking pump,and had been corrected on october,osha closed the file.on january,meuser wrote to osha formalizing a complaint as to fedex refusal to provide him the msds sheets.after some time,the msds sheets were obtained from the vendor and provided to meuser on january,after meuser return from a two week vacation.although osha cited fedex for not having the msds on site,no imposition of any monetary penalty was made.
in february,meuser contracted a respiratory illness and received leave under the family medical leave act fmla.later in spring,meuser route was changed as part of a comprehensive overhaul of courier assignments,which had been determined since november,but postponed at the request of the drivers.the new route resulted in a larger geographical area,but nonetheless required from meuser fewer stops per hour.
in april,meuser requested from his supervisor a replacement truck because the vehicle he was driving was too dusty.fedex senior manager,joseph marotta,suspected that this complaint was merely a tactic to have someone deliver to meuser,with the requested replacement truck,a package that he had left behind at the station that morning,enabling meuser to avoid returning to pick up the package being disciplined for leaving the package behind.consequently,appellant was provided online counseling,which constitutes the first step in fedex progressive discipline process,for failing to take the package on his route.
on or about april,meuser used his truck dispatch system to send a female courier a communication dads message in which he accused her of falsifying documents specifically dex scans,which is considered a serious offense by fedex.on april,due to meuser use of the dispatch system to make serious accusations against a courier,he was suspended with pay pending an investigation of the incident by the operations manager,james langone.on april,after completion of langone investigation,meuser received documented counseling for his behavior and was sent a copy of fedex acceptable conduct policy,section in the people manual.
on september,a fedex customer on appellant route,emily robertson,complained to fedex about a late package delivery.meuser admitted that although the package was mislabeled and misaddressed,he knew the correct delivery address.nevertheless,since he noticed the mistake at the end of the day it was too late to deliver the package and therefore he classified the package as a,a code for delivery exception.said codification is only appropriate when the courier has no knowledge of where to deliver the package consequently,there was a delay in the package delivery.after robertson complaint of the of the package,meuser was instructed by his supervisor to deliver the package early the next morning and to smooth over the matter with the customer.fedex considers recipients of packages to be customers.the next morning meuser alleges that he delivered the package,apologized and conversed with robertson in the spirit of trying to establish a rapport with her.meuser further alleges that after he left the customer,he thought he had done a great job and understood that robertson was content.nevertheless,after the delivery,robertson complained to fedex again and stated that meuser comments were unprofessional,that his manner was threatening and that he accused her of possibly causing him to be subsequently fired because of her complaint based on this incident,fedex supervisors shifted meuser to a different route and placed him on paid investigative suspension.as a result of the investigation,fedex issued a warning letter to meuser.appellant proffers that couriers are almost never removed from their routes unless they have been terminated and that he was removed from his route after seven years with just one customer complaint.
subsequent to his assignment to the new route,meuser contacted a number of fedex customers whom he knew personally and asked them to write to fedex complaining about fedex decision to change his route.meuser received a second warning letter on september,for involving fedex customers and for divulging internal fedex confidential information.meuser was further informed that his paid investigative suspension was converted into an unpaid suspension.nevertheless,meuser continued on his new route with no other changes in pay or benefits.
on november,meuser submitted two letters to his supervisor,one requesting his personnel file under.laws ch,and the other asking for a written statement as to why as of that day his personal tuition reimbursement had not been reimbursed.in a meeting held that same day between meuser,james langone and lisa patterson,the recently appointed senior manager who had minimal knowledge of meuser history and no knowledge of the osha complaints,patterson told meuser that the letter regarding his tuition reimbursement was disrespectful in tone.during the meeting patterson leaned across the table,slammed her hands on the table and screamed that this would not be tolerated.appellant further alleges that since he was terrified at patterson reaction,he withdrew his letter 
subsequently,meuser resigned from his position on december.appellant claims that he thought he was on the verge of being terminated anyway and had been told by langone that he would have a positive rehire status.nevertheless,one day after submitting his resignation,meuser learned that he would be ineligible for positive rehire status because of his two warning letters and attempted to rescind his resignation.fedex declined to accept his rescission.consequently,the employment relationship ended.
this suit,the district court summary judgment order and meuser timely appeal followed.

count i violation of massachusetts civil rights act 
we agree with the district court dismissal of appellant claim under the mcra,since there is no evidence in the record to show that fedex violated the mcra by interfering with appellant rights secured by the constitution or laws of either the united states or the commonwealth,by threats,intimidation or coercion.appellant alleges that summary judgment was improperly entered as to count i of the complaint,since the evidence presented demonstrated issues of material fact.we disagree and explain.
the massachusetts civil rights act,requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that his exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of either the united states or the commonwealth,has been interfered with,or attempted to be interfered with,and that the interference or attempted interference was by threats,intimidation or coercion.bally northeastern,quoting.laws ch,see also andresen diorio,cir kelley laforce,cir the mcra provides a cause of action for any person whose rights under the constitution,federal law,or state law have been interfered with by threats,intimidation,or coercion of another.ayasli armstrong,howcroft city of peabody,the mcra creates no substantive civil rights rather,it provides a mechanism for obtaining relief from the interference,or attempted interference,with rights conferred by federal or massachusetts law.the supreme judicial court has held that the interference or attempted interference must be by threat,intimidation or coercion,defined as follows

appellant argues that the district court mischaracterized the incidents as a collection of minor,possibly harassing incidents which can not be sufficient to satisfy the definition of threatening or coercive conduct under mcra,especially where there is little evidence of any intent by appellant superiors to intimidate him.meuser federal express corporation,d.the facts,considered in the light most favorable to appellant based on the record before us,are the following 
appellant alleges that his employment environment began to deteriorate after he filed the two osha complaints relating to the fumes he detected in his truck october,and requested the msds sheets january,for example,in,meuser called marotta,during his morning route,to ask him about the msds sheets.marotta was allegedly abrupt with meuser and told him that he did not have enough work if he had time to call about the msds sheets during his working route hours.marotta further insinuated that meuser had created the whole toxic fumes incident of october,in order to lay the foundation for a later suit against fedex.furthermore,meuser contends that the january osha inspection,which resulted in a citation by osha for not having the required msds sheets on site,fueled marotta retaliatory behavior as evidenced by marotta comment that he marotta did not like to lose.
on january,the same day meuser was provided with the msds sheets,meuser contends that he was subjected to an unscheduled check ride by langone in april,although all of the couriers work days were shortened to eight hours,meuser route was the only one that was altered to cover a larger area.meuser alleges that the enlargement of his route caused service failures,delayed deliveries and rolled delivery freight not delivered as evidenced by robertson delayed delivery.meuser was not given any help notwithstanding his reiterated requests for assistance and despite the fact that it is a known fedex policy to assist couriers when possible on april,due to meuser use of the dispatch system to make serious accusations against deb dahlgren,a female courier,meuser was suspended with pay pending an investigation of the incident by his manager,james langone.on april,after completion of langone investigation,meuser received a documented counseling for his behavior towards deb dahlgren and was sent a copy of fedex acceptable conduct policy,section in the people manual on april,during a meeting with marotta and langone,marotta told meuser,regarding his request for a less dusty vehicle,that everything he was doing was bullshit,app.furthermore,marotta made a comment during the meeting that meuser had somehow made up his february illness on august,meuser filed a request for tuition reimbursement that was not approved until december,on september,meuser received a routine attendance memorandum from jim langone,informing meuser that over the past twelve months his attendance had been marginal and that his absence the day before,had put him below the company acceptable rate of.it was further recommended that necessary steps should be taken in order to avoid this type of situation and that any further violations would result in the issuance of a written performance reminder in september meuser route was changed due to the incident with robertson.on september,meuser was issued a second warning letter for contacting a number of fedex customers,whom he knew personally,and divulging to them confidential information by asking them to write to fedex complaining about fedex determination to assign meuser to another route.finally,on november,meuser met with james langone and the new senior manager,lisa patterson,who had minimal knowledge of meuser history and no knowledge of his osha complaints.patterson told meuser that the letter,allegedly requesting a tuition reimbursement,was disrespectful in tone.during the same meeting,patterson slammed her hands on the table and screamed that this would not be tolerated.appellant alleges that since he was terrified at patterson reaction,he withdrew the letter.meuser resigned from his position on november,effective december,after it had been represented by langone that he was eligible for positive rehire status.however,after learning that having two warning letters in his record made him ineligible for positive rehire status,meuser attempted to rescind his resignation nevertheless,fedex declined to accept the rescission.
after reviewing the aforementioned incidents and the evidence of record,in the light most favorable to the appellant,we find that meuser failed to establish that fedex actions,considered individually or together,constituted threats,intimidation or coercion within the meaning of the mcra.furthermore,we find that the incidents attested to by appellant do not rise to the level of a threat,defined as intentional exertion s of pressure that would make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm,nor can they be considered to rise to the level of intimidation defined as putting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct,or coercion defined as such force,either physical or moral,as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.planned parenthood league,at see also haufler,at.furthermore,even if we disagree with fedex personnel or business decisions,a matter on which we take no view,c ourts may not sit as super personnel departments,assessing the even the employers business decisions.mesnick,at.
moreover,we find that the district court correctly determined that the record is entirely devoid of anything resembling the sort of physical,moral,or economic pressure that courts have found sufficient to support a claim under this statute especially when the exception for claims based on coercion remains a narrow one.meuser,d at citing horne,d at see also kennie natural res.dep t of dennis,buster george moore.
nevertheless,we shall proceed to examine the only incident that the district court found worthy of extended scrutiny.as aforementioned,appellant claims that during his meeting with patterson he was threatened,intimidated,and coerced by her behavior and comments towards him when she slammed her hands on the table and shouted at meuser.furthermore,patterson suggested that his letter had been written by a lawyer,and that if that was the case,he should reflect on it,because his appeal would not be considered.she further explained that if he had acquired an attorney,any further complaints he might have had with fedex would then have to be dealt between his attorney and fedex legal department.consequently,appellant alleges that since he was terrified at patterson reaction,he withdrew his letter requesting his personnel file.appellant br.
applying the objective standard of a reasonable person to determine whether patterson conduct constituted threats,intimidation,or coercion under the act,haufler,at,we agree with the district court finding that this type of behavior,though it approaches the line,fails to constitute the kind of threatening or intimidating behavior the mcra requires.meuser,d at.as aforementioned,the fact that meuser might have found patterson conduct intimidating or threatening in some way,is irrelevant.cignetti,d at.t he state of mind of the person threatened is not controlling,it is whether a reasonable person in appellant circumstance would feel threatened,intimidated or coerced by patterson conduct.commonwealth devincent,see also planned parenthood league,at citing devincent,at.
the legislature explicitly limited the act remedy to situations where the derogation of secured rights occurs by threats,intimidation or coercion.the legislature intended that even a direct deprivation of a plaintiff secured rights would not be actionable under the act unless it were accomplished by means of one of these three constraining elements.
buster,at internal citations omitted.consequently,we find using an objective standard,that patterson conduct of slamming her hands on the desk and allegedly shouting at meuser can not be considered in any way within the context of the act as either a threat,intimidation or coercion.see haufler,at see also cignetti,d at.
moreover,we emphasize that patterson had replaced marotta as the senior manager of hatfield,only two weeks prior to the incident.it is uncontested that patterson had minimal knowledge of meuser employment history at fedex and no knowledge of the osha incident.consequently,there is no evidence that she was tainted by appellant osha complaints,which is the motivating factor alleged by meuser under the mcra.hence,the incident of slamming her hands on the desk,can not be linked with meuser exercise of other statutory rights.see carmack amtrak,d,nothing in the record indicates that amtrak true motivation was to punish carmack for communicating with his union representative or for exercising his right to free speech.fletcher szostkiewicz,d,criticizing a pattern of harassment as a possible basis for a finding of threatening behavior.
therefore,we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing appellant claim under mcra.
count iii wrongful termination in violation of public policy 
we agree with the district court dismissal of appellant common law claim for discharge in violation of public policy.
appellant alleges that the district court improperly entered summary judgment on count iii since the record shows that he was subjected to a sustained campaign of harassment and retaliation from october until his resignation on november.appellant further alleges that although he requested to return to work at fedex,his amenability was predicated upon a future change in management.moreover,meuser avers that his resignation was submitted with the assumption that he was eligible for.
