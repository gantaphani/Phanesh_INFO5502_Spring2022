the plaintiff,cynthia fincher,is an woman who was employed by the defendant,depository trust and clearing corporation dtcc.she first held the position of product manager in the company international tax department.thereafter,she was a senior auditor in the division of the company audit department.she resigned her employment on june.she subsequently brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that she was the victim of racial discrimination with respect to training opportunities,performance evaluations,and salary decisions during her time in the audit department.she also claimed that she was subjected to unlawful retaliation,a hostile work environment,and constructive discharge.central to the latter three claims was fincher contention that dtcc failed to investigate a complaint of discrimination that she allegedly made to the company senior director of employee relations.
upon motion for summary judgment by dtcc,the district court william pauley,judge dismissed all of fincher claims.fincher appeals,arguing that dtcc failure to investigate her complaint of discrimination was itself an act of retaliation for making the discrimination complaint,and that it also contributed to a hostile work environment and her constructive discharge.fincher also challenges the dismissal of her underlying discrimination claims on the ground that the district court improperly disregarded her deposition testimony that her manager at the defendant auditing department told her that she had been given inadequate training because of her race.
accepting as we must at this stage of the proceedings that fincher testimony to the effect that dtcc failed to investigate her complaint of racial discrimination is true,we nonetheless conclude that such a failure does not constitute an adverse employment action taken in retaliation for the filing of the same discrimination complaint.we also conclude that fincher has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to her other claims of retaliation,or her claims of hostile work environment or constructive discharge.and inasmuch as fincher has failed to support her underlying discrimination claims with more than a scintilla of evidence,summary judgment as to those claims was also proper.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
fincher was employed by dtcc from february to june.she worked as a product manager for the company international tax department until that position was eliminated in october.she then moved to the company division of the audit department,where she was a senior auditor despite a lack of auditing experience.between october and may,in order to perform her duties,she relied upon several training courses provided to all auditors in her department,an audit manual,and guidance from.
fincher testified that a on her first assignment worked with an experienced manager.fincher first manager was,by contrast,a consultant unfamiliar with dtcc auditing procedures.and on one occasion,two of fincher underwent unspecified training at a session that fincher was not asked to attend.
in march,fincher received an official performance appraisal for her first two months in the audit department during.it was signed by the audit department manager,mark hudson.it contained a handwritten note addressed to fincher explaining that she had received a good first review but further audit skill development is needed before more indepth sic feedback can be given.keep trying appraisal at.she received a mark of fully competent in every performance category for which she was graded.fully competent was in the middle of the grading scale,which ranged from unacceptable to exceptional.
fincher performance appraisal for,compiled in this instance by fincher supervisor donald simpson,and then approved by hudson on january,reflected a grade of requires improvement for most of the performance categories.for this performance evaluation,managers were instructed to give a grade of requires improvement only to employees in the bottom of the company.fincher review contained several fully competent evaluations,reserved for employees in the middle of the company,but also several unacceptable grades,reserved for the bottom of employees.for example,fincher received a grade of unacceptable under demonstrates the skills to do the job,and under can be counted on to complete assignments with minimal.appraisal at.a concluding section labeled manager comments asserted that fincher frequently failed to meet deadlines and indicated that the department managers had a poor overall impression of fincher work.id.at.
on march,fincher received by email attachment a project evaluation for a particular audit that she had completed.it reflected the grade of requires improvement in every category for which an evaluation was given.
on march,fincher received a written performance warning from hudson.it purported to document various perceived shortcomings in fincher work,including failure to complete tasks within allotted timeframes.it also informed fincher that she was being placed on written warning for poor performance f ailure to immediately improve and sustain an acceptable level of performance,or further performance deficiencies,will result in further disciplinary action,up to and including termination of your employment.memorandum from mark hudson to cynthia fincher,written performance warning.
in late march,fincher had a conversation with charles smith,the senior director of employee relations at dtcc,in the lobby of their office building.they were professional and social acquaintances who occasionally lunched together.according to fincher,she complained to smith that black people were set up to fail at the auditing department because they were not provided and given the same training opportunities as the white employees.fincher dep.smith recollection is different 
about one week later,fincher and smith had another conversation as to which their recollections also conflict.according to fincher,she asked smith whether he or his manager was planning to take action in response to the complaint of discrimination she had made during their first conversation.smith told her that the complaint would not be addressed 
fincher also testified to a conversation she had with her manager,mark hudson,in his office in may.he admitted to me,she said,that he was forced to write me up,and he had informed human resources employee elizabeth baez that i did not receive proper training,and he admitted that i was discriminated against.fincher dep.she said he said that she was not the only one being discriminated against.he allegedly named one herb fray as also having been subjected to discrimination.id 
on june,fincher resigned her employment.in a letter addressed to baez,she said that her resignation was due to racial discrimination,including receiving inadequate training.resignation letter to elizabeth baez,june.the letter concluded i was forced out because of racial discrimination and because i am aware of the fact that the company did not act on racial discrimination complaints brought forth by myself and others.id.
in a second letter,also dated june,addressed to meriam,a vice president in the audit department,fincher announced her resignation,explaining that she had been offered a position as at another firm therefore my last day will be on friday june.resignation letter to meriam,june.
then,without first making a complaint to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,fincher brought this employment discrimination action against dtcc in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.she alleges violations of the civil rights act of,title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii,new york state executive law,and the new york city administrative code the new york state and new york city human rights laws,or the hrl and chrl,respectively.
count i of her complaint alleges that she was subjected to racial discrimination with respect to training opportunities,performance reviews,and salary decisions.count ii alleges that she was the victim of retaliation for making a complaint of racial discrimination to smith,and that she was subjected to a hostile work environment.both the retaliation claim and the hostile work environment claim were based on dtcc alleged failure to investigate fincher complaint of racial discrimination to smith.count ii of the complaint also asserted a claim of constructive discharge based on the allegations of retaliation and hostile work environment made in the same claim for relief.see compl.fincher was compelled to leave the firm for these reasons.the complaint did not indicate which alleged conduct she was challenging under which of the statutes she invoked.
dtcc moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting dtcc motion and dismissing fincher claims in their entirety.fincher depository trust clearing,civ,wl,dist.lexis.the district court dismissed fincher title vii claims for her failure to satisfy the necessary precondition for such claims of filing a complaint with the eeoc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
as to her discrimination claims under,the district court concluded that fincher had failed to show that the circumstances of her training,performance evaluations,or compensation gave rise to an inference of discrimination,and that she had therefore failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in reaching this conclusion,the court appears to have discredited fincher testimony that hudson told her that he thought she had been discriminated against,noting that fincher testimony is not supported by anything other than her ipse dixit,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.hudson denies making such statements and fincher has not offered any direct or circumstantial evidence to corroborate her testimony.id.
turning next to fincher retaliation,hostile work environment,and constructive discharge claims under section,the district court concluded that fincher had failed to show that she suffered any retaliation for complaining of discrimination to smith because dtcc failure to investigate that complaint was not an adverse employment action,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court similarly found that the failure to investigate fincher complaint did not create a hostile work environment,and that fincher had failed otherwise to establish a triable issue of material fact as to the existence of a hostile work environment,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.as a result of the failure of the hostile work environment claim,the court concluded that her constructive discharge claim was also meritless,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
finally,the district court concluded that fincher had failed to establish a claim under the new york state and city human rights laws,because the court was of the view that discrimination claims under those laws were analyzed under the same standards as those used for claims brought under section,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
fincher argues on appeal that dtcc failure to investigate her alleged complaint of discrimination constituted retaliation for her bringing that same complaint.she also argues that the failure to investigate her complaint,in light of the totality of the circumstances,created a hostile work environment,and amounted to a constructive discharge.finally,she argues that the district court did not give sufficient consideration to her testimony about hudson alleged admission to her that she was the victim of racial discrimination

ii.retaliation 
federal retaliation claims 
retaliation claims made under,like those made under title vii,are evaluated using a analysis see,taitt chemical bank,cir.first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation.if the plaintiff succeeds,then a presumption of retaliation arises and the employer must articulate a legitimate,reason for the action that the plaintiff alleges was retaliatory.if the employer succeeds at the second stage,then the presumption of retaliation dissipates and the plaintiff must show that retaliation was a substantial reason for the action.jute hamilton sundstrand,cir.
in this case,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dtcc based on the court conclusion that fincher had failed to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation.in order to establish such a prima facie case,
a plaintiff must adduce evidence sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find that s he engaged in protected activity under the statutes,that the employer was aware of this activity,that the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff,and that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action,that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action.
kessler westchester county dep t of soc,cir alterations incorporated accord lizardo denny,cir 
the district court concluded that fincher had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because even accepting,for purposes of summary judgment,her testimony that she complained of discrimination to smith in late march and that the company failed to investigate that complaint,such a failure to investigate did not constitute an adverse employment action.the law protects an individual not from all retaliation,but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.burlington santa fe ry.white.
a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.we speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted,emphasis in original.
because we must resolve all factual ambiguities against dtcc,we accept for purposes of this appeal that fincher made a complaint of discrimination to smith in late march and that smith was aware that fincher was making a complaint.fincher has thus satisfied the first two elements of her prima facie case.we further accept for purposes of this appeal that the company failed to investigate fincher complaint.we agree with the district court,however,that any such failure did not constitute an adverse employment action against fincher.
we have said that there are no rules with respect to what constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of a retaliation claim,and therefore courts must pore over each case to determine whether the challenged employment action reaches the level of adverse.wanamaker columbian rope,cir.we are of the view nonetheless that,at least in a case such as this one,an employer failure to investigate a complaint of discrimination can not be considered an adverse employment action taken in retaliation for the filing of the same discrimination complaint.we thus adopt the position previously taken by several district courts in this circuit.see,thomlison sharp elecs,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
affirmative efforts to punish a complaining employee are at the heart of any retaliation claim,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.an employee whose complaint is not investigated can not be said to have thereby suffered a punishment for bringing that same complaint her situation in the wake of her having made the complaint is the same as it would have been had she not brought the complaint or had the complaint been investigated but denied for good reason or for none at all.put another way,an employee knowledge that her employer has declined to investigate her complaint will not ordinarily constitute a threat of further harm,recognizing,of course,that it would hardly provide a positive incentive to lodge such a further challenge.
we do not mean to suggest that failure to investigate a complaint can not ever be considered an adverse employment action for purposes of a retaliation claim.it can be if the failure is in retaliation for some separate,protected act by the plaintiff.in rochon gonzales,upon which fincher relies,for example,the circuit concluded that an employer failure to investigate a complaint of a death threat against an employee that followed a complaint of discrimination by the same employee was sufficient to state a claim of retaliation under title vii,id.at.but in rochon,the refusal to respond to the employee complaint of a death threat was allegedly in retaliation for his separate and earlier complaint of discrimination.the employee contended that if he had never complained of discrimination,his complaint of a death threat against him would have been investigated.id.making the initial complaint allegedly resulted in the separate retaliatory failure to investigate a subsequent complaint.see id.at a reasonable fbi agent well might be dissuaded from engaging in activity protected by title vii if he knew that doing so would leave him unprotected by the fbi in the face of threats against him or his family.other cases cited by fincher similarly involve employees who allegedly suffered harms resulting from,but separate from the disposition of,their initial complaints of discrimination.see burlington,at leaving for jury question of whether unwanted reassignment of employee duties following complaint of discrimination was adverse employment action for purposes of retaliation claim washington.dep t of revenue,cir concluding that unwanted alteration of employee work schedule following complaint of discrimination was adverse employment action for purposes of retaliation claim.
here,by contrast,a reasonable employee in fincher place had nothing to lose by bringing this complaint,or another one following it,because the result of bringing the complaint and not bringing the complaint under the conditions alleged was the same the complaint would not be investigated.no action has been attributed to the defendant here except for the lack the same complaint that allegedly provoked the retaliatory response.
a contrary rule could have odd consequences.a person not in fact discriminated against could complain of discrimination nonetheless.if the miffed accused employer were,because of his or her anger,to decline to investigate what was in fact a false claim,the employee might have a viable suit for retaliatory failure to investigate.we do not think that to be the law.
summary judgment dismissing fincher retaliation claims under was therefore proper 
state and city retaliation claims 
the dismissal of fincher retaliation claims must also be affirmed,notwithstanding that it was based in part on the court arguably incorrect view that the claims were to be analyzed under the same standards as.fincher,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing conway microsoft,d.new york state courts and district courts in this circuit have concluded,to the contrary,that the retaliation inquiry under the chrl is broader than its federal counterpart.see williams city hous,dep t.under the chrl,retaliation in any manner is prohibited,and t he retaliation need not result in an ultimate action with respect to employment or in a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.admin.code see also williams,at,at sorrenti city of new york,misc d a,table,unreported decision t he city council enacted a less restrictive standard than the federal and state standard to trigger a chrl violation in that it is now illegal to retaliate in any manner.pilgrim cos,d,the prima facie standard for retaliation claims under the chrl is different from the federal and state standard,in that there is no requirement that the employee suffer a materially adverse action.instead,the chrl makes clear that it is illegal for an employer to retaliate in any manner.
the functional difference,if any,between the chrl standard and that used for federal and state retaliation claims has never been fully articulated.the appellate division,first department,has said that the chrl rejects a materiality requirement,while under burlington,federal retaliation claims must involve an action by the employer that is materially adverse.compare williams,at,with burlington,at.the proper inquiry under the chrl is whether a jury could reasonably conclude from the evidence that the conduct by the employer was,in the words of the chrl,reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity,without taking account of whether the employer conduct was sufficiently deterrent so as to be material.williams,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
it is unnecessary for us to determine on this appeal whether or to what extent the reasonably likely to deter standard of the chrl differs from burlington well might have dissuaded test.fincher has not made any argument touching on the chrl in her brief or at oral argument.thus any assertion that she might have made to the effect that her retaliation claim should survive the arguably broader chrl inquiry has been abandoned.see united states joyner,cir.
iii.hostile work environment and constructive discharge 
in order to establish a hostile work environment claim under u,a plaintiff must show that the workplace was so severely permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that the terms and conditions of her employment were thereby altered.alfano costello,cir see also meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,plaintiff must demonstrate an abusive working environment internal quotation marks omitted.a hostile working environment is shown when the incidents of harassment occur either in concert or with a regularity that can reasonably be termed pervasive.lopez thomas,cir accord whidbee garzarelli food specialties,cir.t he plaintiff must show more than a few isolated incidents of racial enmity,williams county of westchester,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted,although a hostile work environment can also be established through evidence of a single incident of harassment that is extraordinarily severe,cruz coach stores,cir alfano,at.
fincher argues that dtcc failure to investigate her discrimination complaint,considered in light of the totality of the circumstances,created a hostile work environment for her.but the failure to investigate did not by itself alter the terms and conditions of fincher employment rather,it preserved the very circumstances that were the subject of the complaint.therefore the failure to investigate fincher complaint could not itself have contributed to or constituted a hostile work environment.robles argonaut rest.diner,civ,wl at,dist.lexis,at,a hostile work environment claim can succeed only if plaintiff demonstrates that the workplace was so severely permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that the terms and conditions of his employment were thereby altered citing leibovitz city transit,cir.
indeed,although this circuit has not ruled on the question,in the analogous context of hostile work environment claims based on allegations of sexual harassment,federal courts including district courts in this circuit appear to have uniformly rejected the notion that a failure adequately to remediate sexual harassment itself constitutes an act that may contribute to a hostile work environment claim.chan city transit,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.
fincher does not identify the facts to which her phrase,the totality of the circumstances,refers.the evidence that she presented to the district court was to the effect that on at least one occasion,two of her were invited,without her,for unspecified training,and that on at least one occasion,one of her was assigned to work with a supervisor who was better qualified than fincher supervisor.we conclude that these sporadic events,none of which was personally abusive,as a matter of law do not amount to a s
