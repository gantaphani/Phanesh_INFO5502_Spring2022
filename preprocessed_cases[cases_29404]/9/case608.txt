the american common law rule is that generally the filing of a prior judicial action does not toll the statute of limitations.puerto rico has chosen a different rule,permitting such tolling.that rule gives rise to this appeal.
the federal civil rights claims brought by carmen,a terminated public employee,were not timely unless they were saved by tolling based on an earlier complaint that she filed in the courts of puerto rico and later amended.her claims are tolled only if either her original or her amended complaint in the puerto rico courts was timely and stated causes of action identical to those in her later federal complaint.in our federal system of justice built on both federal and state or commonwealth courts,this case raises interesting questions about the meaning of the identicality requirement.given the generalized pleading rules and the latitude of.b,it is not always easy to tell whether identical claims are stated in different complaints.here,the district court thought that the claims were not identical and so dismissed the complaint.mindful of generous pleading rules and puerto rico liberal approach to rules,we reach the opposite conclusion and reinstate the case.
on october,brought suit in puerto rico superior court in caguas against the municipality of caguas,through its mayor william luisa flores,in her capacity as director of the department of beautification,cleaning,and urbanism and in her personal capacity and xyz insurance company.the complaint alleged the following facts.
was an executive secretary at the department of beautification,cleaning,and urbanism of the municipality of caguas in puerto rico.she was assigned to flores,who was the director of the department.flores came under investigation by the office of government ethics,and testified in that investigation.during january and february of,applied to the state insurance fund for medical treatment for an emotional condition caused by flores uncouth and rude behavior toward her.when returned to work on february,wilfredo puig,of caguas,informed her that she had been transferred and ordered her to report to the department of education.he told her that flores was under investigation by the office of government ethics and that was being transferred because flores did not feel comfortable working with her.
on february,reported to the department of education but was told that there was no physical space for her there.she was sent to the human resources office,where director armando meléndez told her to go home until a post was found for her.several days later,meléndez called and instructed her to report to the human resources office and then go to work at the office of federal funds and affairs.on february,when went to the human resources office,meléndez secretary handed her a letter addressed to the director of the office of federal funds and affairs.the letter described placement in that office as temporary and referred to her transfer as a move that she had requested.informed meléndez and puig that she had not requested this transfer.the next day,was nonetheless transferred to the office of federal funds and affairs.no duties were assigned to her there.
on march,attorney sent a letter to mayor requesting that he reinstate to her previous post.in a letter dated march,eileen herrero,director of human resources for the municipality of caguas,replied that if wished to be reassigned to her original post,she would be.but then leslie rodríguez,acting director of the human resources office,met with flores,who refused to reinstate,and was not reinstated.
based on these factual allegations,the complaint asserted that had been transferred in retaliation for her statement before the office of government ethics,and that such a retaliatory transfer violated laws ann,which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees for providing testimony,statements,or information before a legislative,administrative,or judicial forum in puerto rico.the complaint also alleged that plaintiff transfer was illegal,arbitrary,whimsical,violates plaintiff constitutional rights,such as the due process of law,procedural as well as substantive,and violates her record to ownership and to her dignity as a person emphasis added.the complaint did not specify whether these constitutional claims were based on the puerto rico constitution or the united states constitution.nor did the complaint expressly refer to political discrimination or the right to freedom of speech or affiliation.sought damages and injunctive relief reinstating her.
on august,amended her complaint.the amended complaint dropped flores,who had passed away,as a defendant.it also included several new allegations.the amended complaint alleged that the municipality of caguas and mayor refused to reinstate to her position because she had offered information harmful to the popular democratic party pdp.it also alleged that flores remarked that she had no confidence in because was not a member of the pdp and wanted to harm the party.the amended complaint further alleged that was charged of not being a pdp er belonging to the popular democratic party and this constitutes a n act of political discrimination emphasis added.
on november,filed a complaint in federal district court in puerto rico against the municipality of caguas and against mayor and puig in their personal and official capacities.this federal complaint alleged that had been discriminated against because of her political beliefs and in reprisal for providing information to the ethics office regarding an investigation of the municipality political affairs.the complaint sought relief under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution,and article ii,and of the puerto rico constitution the general tort laws of puerto rico,laws ann.and and the public policy exception to laws ann,see negrón caleb brett,cir.the complaint sought injunctive relief,damages,attorneys fees and costs,and a declaratory judgment.in addition to repeating the facts alleged in the amended state complaint,the federal complaint added allegations that the defendants acted intentionally or with deliberate indifference and that mayor and puig approved or ratified the discrimination against under color of law.furthermore,while the original state complaint alleged violations of constitutional rights,such as due process,and her right to record of ownership,the federal complaint replaced this language with allegations that the defendants violated right to freedom of speech and affiliation.
two days after filing the federal complaint,filed a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of her claims in the puerto rico courts.most likely,that was because jury trials in civil cases are available in federal court but not in the commonwealth courts.see american airlines,cir.on october,the defendants moved for summary judgment in the federal case,arguing that the federal complaint was because it was filed after the applicable statute of limitations had expired.they also argued in their motion for summary judgment that had failed to establish a cognizable claim for political discrimination,that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,and that and do not apply to political discrimination.
on march,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment based on the timeliness issue.the court determined that the plaintiff federal claims borrow puerto rico statute of limitations for tort claims and that november,complaint was untimely because it was filed more than one year after her february,transfer.the court held that the limitations period was not tolled by filing of her state complaint on october.the court noted that the federal claims borrow puerto rico law as to tolling,that laws ann.provides that the limitations period is interrupted by the institution of actions before the courts,and that had filed a timely state complaint.quoting fernandez chardon,cir,the court determined that tolls the statute of limitations for claims only when identical causes of action have been filed.the claims in state complaint,the court found,were not identical to her federal claims.the court determined that her state complaint,even after it was amended,never alleged federal constitutional violations.the court noted that the state complaint did not refer to a right to freedom of speech or of political affiliation.although the puerto rico complaint did allege a violation of due process without indicating whether this right was based on the federal or state constitution,the court found that this was not an assertion of a federal constitutional claim.having concluded that the federal claims were untimely,the court then dismissed without prejudice the remaining claims arising under puerto rico law.
appeals from the court grant of summary judgment,arguing that her federal claims were timely and that,in the alternative,the claims arising under puerto rico law were still within the statute of limitations and should not have been dismissed.
when summary judgment has been granted on the grounds that a complaint is,our review is de novo.see villoldo,cir.we hold that the district court erred in dismissing federal claims as untimely.
unless the filing of the state complaints tolled the statute of limitations,the federal claims were not timely.sections,and borrow the forum state statute of limitations for personal injury claims.see goodman lukens steel,d wilson garcia,d chappell rich,cir.
here,the parties agree that the appropriate statute of limitations is puerto rico period governing tort actions,laws ann.see,cir altair pesquera de busquets,cir.federal law determines the date on which the claim accrued,cir.under federal law,the limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis for his claim.rodriguez narvaez nazario,cir.the parties do not appear to dispute that the claim accrued on february,when was transferred to the office of federal funds and affairs.absent any tolling,had to file her federal complaint on or before march.
the issue,then,is whether filing of her state complaint on october,and her later amendment of that complaint on august,tolled the statute of limitations.where suit is brought in puerto rico,federal law under,and borrows puerto rico law on tolling,provided that it is consistent with underlying federal policy.see fernandez,at applying this rule to claims.under laws ann,p rescription of actions is interrupted by their institution before the courts,by extrajudicial claim of the creditor,and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.when a complaint is filed in the commonwealth courts,the statute of limitations begins to run anew from the date on which that action comes to a definite end.weber dental,cir quoting weber dental,offic.trans.here,that date would be november,when voluntarily dismissed her state complaint.see id.voluntary dismissal without prejudice brings action to definite end.
puerto rico complaint must assert causes of action identical to her federal claims in order to toll the statute of limitations as to those federal claims under.rodriguez narvaez,at citing fernandez,at,and ramirez de arellano alvarez de choudens,cir.t he filing of one action does not toll the statute of limitations for all claims arising out of the same facts.fernandez,at.the supreme court of puerto rico has approved this identicality requirement.see cintron estado libre asociado de,offic.trans,holding that a timely filed extrajudicial claim did not toll the statute of limitations for a suit in the puerto rico courts because it did not pursue identical claims.the identicality requirement prevents plaintiffs from circumventing the notice function of the statutes of limitations by asserting different claims in belated federal court complaints.rodriguez narvaez,at statutes of limitations exist to prevent defendants from being surprised by causes of action.
in determining whether causes of action identical to federal claims were brought in her state complaint,the first question is whether the basis for comparison is her original or her amended state complaint.the defendants argue that can not rely on amendments to her state complaint because those amendments were filed on august,after the statute of limitations had already expired.puerto rico law,however,is to the contrary.rule of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure provides that w henever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction or occurrence set forth in the original pleading,the amendments shall relate back to the date of the original pleading.laws.iii.both amendments and her original complaint clearly arose out of the same transaction her involuntary transfer because of her testimony in the ethics office investigation of flores.under rule,her amendments relate back to the october,date of the original complaint and are thus timely.as a result,both the amended complaint and the original complaint are relevant bases for comparison.
the next issue is whether original and amended state complaints contain causes of action identical to her federal claims although the question is close,we conclude that the amended complaint is sufficient to meet the identicality requirement.we hold that in order to be identical under,claims must satisfy several requirements.they must seek the same form of relief.ramirez de arellano,at rodriguez narvaez,at extrajudicial claims,which also trigger tolling under,did not toll the statute of limitations when such claims sought different relief than the federal complaint did fernandez,at same hernandez del valle santa aponte,cir same.the causes of action asserted must be based on the same substantive claims.and,provided that other puerto rico tolling statutes do not rescue the claims on other grounds,they must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities new defendants should not be added.
claims satisfy all of these requirements,with a few wrinkles that we describe in more depth below.she sought the same form of relief in both complaints injunctive relief and money damages.although the amount of damages differs in the two complaints,the allegation of damages in her state complaint gave the defendants the requisite fair notice that they might be called upon to defend a damages suit,with different issues not applicable to a suit for injunctive relief.hernandez del valle,at.
the harder question is whether federal and state complaints assert the same substantive claims,despite differences in wording.we conclude that federal claims and the claims in her state complaint did rely on the same substantive legal ground that she was transferred because she was not a member of the pdp and in retaliation for her testimony in the ethics office investigation of flores and that this constituted political discrimination in violation of her constitutional rights.there are three significant differences in the wording of the legal claims in her state and federal complaints.but,as we discuss below,none of those three differences indicates a change in substantive claim.
first,state complaint,unlike her federal complaint,did not expressly claim a violation of her federal constitutional right to freedom of speech and affiliation.but a freedom of speech and affiliation claim was certainly implied in the state complaint by the allegations of political discrimination in violation of her constitutional rights.the state complaint did not specify whether this claim was based on the puerto rico or federal constitution,and claims based on political discrimination may be brought under both constitutions.see const.art ii,no discrimination shall be made on account of political or religious ideas.mullin town of fairhaven,cir discrimination against public officers based on their speech can violate the first amendment of the united states constitution.in some situations,a plaintiff failure to specify the constitution upon which a claim is based could raise concerns about fair notice.but in this instance,the substantive protections for freedom of speech and association under the puerto rico constitution are at least as broad as the protections under the federal constitution.see empresas puertorriqueñas de desarrollo,hermandad independiente de
