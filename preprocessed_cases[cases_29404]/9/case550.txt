this discrimination case,brought under both federal and state law,involves charges of sexual and retaliatory harassment.faced with a plethora of issues,the district court entered summary judgment for the defendant.on appeal,we must sort out which of the plaintiff claims are timely address whether her timeous claims for retaliatory harassment,cast in the form of a hostile work environment,are legally cognizable and sufficiently supported grapple with her one timely claim of sexual harassment,also cast in the form of a hostile work environment and discuss various aspects of the case relating to employer liability.after careful consideration of these variegated issues,we conclude i that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the retaliation claims,as those claims are timely,cognizable,and supported by sufficient evidence,but ii that the district court correctly entered summary judgment on the sexual harassment claims despite the attempt to recast them in a hostile work environment format,the claim is and its federal analogue runs afoul of an inexpugnable affirmative employer swift,effective,and response to the underlying incident.accordingly,we vacate in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because this appeal follows a grant of summary judgment,we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party here,the plaintiff,consistent with record support.garside osco drug,cir.that approach entails,among other things,giving the nonmovant the benefit of all reasonable inferences that those facts will bear.id.
a.the facts.
while on the job on september,christi noviello,a parking enforcement officer for the city of boston,was riding in a van with her immediate superior,josé ortiz.after first announcing his intentions,ortiz forcibly unhooked the plaintiff brassière,ripped it from her body,hung it on the van outside mirror,and bellowed a crude sexual remark to a fellow employee on the street.over the next few days,the plaintiff reported the incident to a number of municipal hierarchs.they promptly investigated the matter,suspended ortiz a week after the incident,and ultimately cashiered him.
soon after ortiz banishment,coworkers began to subject the plaintiff to sundry indignities,or,in the words of the employees themselves,to bust her chops.the record contains evidence of the following incidents the plaintiff recounts others,but we have omitted those that lack any conceivable probative value 
on october,barbara digirolamo accused the plaintiff of throwing a tampon at a coworker.the charge fizzled out after several witnesses attested to its falsity.
on october,a coworker shouted that the plaintiff was the scum of the earth.another loudly proclaimed,in reference to the plaintiff,i smell a rat,do you smell a rat yet another lamented that the parking enforcement officers good supervisor had been drummed out of office.the plaintiff complained to a senior supervisor,irene landry,who took no action.
on december,a new employee told the plaintiff that although he had no problem with her,other coworkers had advised him to stay away because she was trouble.
on december,the entire department ostracized the plaintiff during a holiday party.consequently,she sat alone for two hours.a deputy commissioner saw her sitting alone,acknowledged the ostracism,and suggested that she change her shift.the plaintiff took the advice,but the harassment continued.
on december,digirolamo informed the plaintiff that all personnel on her shift had to take their dinner breaks separately.the plaintiff later learned that this was not true and that she was the only person who had been told to eat alone.
on december,bernadette gilardi announced in front of the plaintiff that she would be taking up a collection for ortiz.she proceeded to do so during working hours.
on december,the plaintiff attended a holiday party on the department premises.the collection for ortiz was in full flower.coworkers waved the money they had amassed in the plaintiff face,crowing look how much money we have collected one of the plaintiff superiors,kathy,advised her to go to the office about the harassment.there is no evidence,however,that intervened to stop the ongoing conduct.
on december,the plaintiff met with a supervisor,kathleen moccia.she described the toll that the harassment was taking on her and asked moccia why management was tolerating the harassment.moccia did not intervene.moreover,she stated that she did not think that the harassment would stop rather,she forecast that it would become ten times worse with the plaintiff recent shift change.
in january of,a tow truck driver told the plaintiff that gilardi had begun circulating a petition urging management to dismiss the plaintiff,but that he had refused to sign it.
during a snowstorm that month,gilardi refused to pick up the plaintiff from her route.although that refusal,duly reported,was in derogation of departmental policy,there is no evidence that gilardi was sanctioned or punished in any way.
on march,the plaintiff filed a complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad and the federal equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the harassment nonetheless persisted.two examples follow 
in february of,the plaintiff approached a van that was used to transport parking enforcement officers to their posts.gilardi was at the wheel.when she saw the plaintiff approach,she closed the van door,ignored the plaintiff tapping on the window,and drove away,nearly striking the plaintiff.the plaintiff reported the incident and gilardi admitted that she had seen the plaintiff but nonetheless had pulled away.there is no evidence that gilardi was disciplined for this conduct.
in march of,gilardi told a coworker,in reference to ortiz firing,that the plaintiff payday was drawing near.
the plaintiff alleges that,as a result of this steady stream of what she characterizes as retaliatory harassment,she lost weight,experienced nightmares and panic attacks,became anxious at work,and was forced to seek medical care.
travel of the case.
on october,the plaintiff requested withdrawal of her administrative complaint in order to pave the way for the institution of suit.the mcad obliged and the plaintiff commenced a civil action against the city in a massachusetts state court.her complaint,filed on november,charged the city with violations of.laws ch.on april,the plaintiff received a letter from the eeoc.one month later,she amended her state court complaint to include title vii claims.see.at that point,the city removed the case to the federal district court.see.
in due course,the city moved for summary judgment under,arguing i that most of the plaintiff claims under chapter were ii that those which remained were not actionable iii that as to the federal retaliation claims,the evidence,even when interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,did not reveal any actionable conduct and iv that the city could not be held liable for ortiz behavior because it had taken prompt and effective remedial action.the plaintiff opposed the motion.ruling ore sponte,the district court granted summary judgment for the city.the court concluded that there was no timely sexual harassment claim under chapter and that the city response to the ortiz incident foreclosed any sexual harassment claim under title vii.as to the retaliation claims,the court acknowledged that,viewing the proof in the requisite light,the plaintiff had been subjected to a series of distasteful,unpleasant,acts by a series of subordinate officials.nevertheless,the court concluded that the retaliation claims must fail because none of the individual incidents was an adverse employment action that bore directly upon the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiff suit implicates both federal and state and statutes.it requires us to questions of first impression in this circuit.
as framed,all of the plaintiff claims are dependent upon her allegation that the city tolerated a hostile work environment in general,a plaintiff may recover on such a theory when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris forklift,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted accord city of providence,cir muzzy cahillane motors.the plaintiff hostile work environment claims are of two types.
most hostile work environments are bred from an ongoing series of harassing incidents.the plaintiff claim of a hostile work environment,based singularly upon ortiz assault,is not of this ilk.however,a single act of harassment may,if egregious enough,suffice to evince a hostile work environment.see faragher city of boca raton,d title vii gnerre mcad,chapter.the plaintiff claims of a retaliatory hostile work environment are more stereotypical.these claims are based upon the pervasive retaliation that the plaintiff allegedly experienced after complaining about ortiz assault.
with this brief preface,we proceed to explicate the summary judgment standard and then examine the anatomy of the plaintiff claims.
a.the summary judgment standard.
an order granting summary judgment engenders de novo review.serapion martinez,cir.in conducting that review,we must scrutinize the evidence in the light most agreeable to the nonmoving party,giving that party the benefit of any and all reasonable inferences.cox hainey,cir.for her part,the nonmovant bears the burden of producing specific facts sufficient to deflect the swing of the summary judgment scythe.mulvihill golf,cir.those facts,typically set forth in affidavits,depositions,and the like,must have evidentiary value as a rule,e vidence that is inadmissible at trial,such as inadmissible hearsay,may not be considered on summary judgment.vazquez,cir accord garside,at.
most of the facts presented by the plaintiff,as recounted above,satisfy this standard.in large part,the chronicled events are within the plaintiff personal knowledge.the insults and taunting that the plaintiff recounts do not create hearsay problems those statements are not offered for their truth,but,rather,to show that the words were spoken and,thus,contributed to the hostile work environment.they are,therefore,admissible.see mota of.houston health sci,cir.the statements made by supervisors are admissible as statements of the defendant agents made within the scope of their employment.see.d d.
we note,however,that two statements give us pause.the first is a statement from an unnamed coworker that other employees told him to stay away from the plaintiff as she was trouble.insofar as the plaintiff is attempting to introduce this statement as evidence of other coworkers harassing behavior,it is hearsay its probative value ultimately depends on the truth of the declarant own unsworn utterance.it is,therefore,inadmissible see,see also vazquez,at.a similar problem exists with respect to the plaintiff assertion that a tow truck driver said that gilardi had been circulating a petition to have the plaintiff fired.consequently,we can not consider the content of either statement in analyzing the plaintiff claims.see larou ridlon,cir branding incompetent on summary judgment portions of a party affidavit recounting inadmissible hearsay.
timeliness.
the first question that we must answer pertains to timeliness.in order to prosecute a harassment claim under either massachusetts or federal law,an aggrieved party must first file a timely administrative complaint.the time parameters for these filings differ.in,chapter mandated filing with the mcad within six months of the alleged violation.see.laws ch,amended.by contrast,the eeoc filing had to occur within days of the date of the alleged violation.see e see also sabree united of carpenters joiners,cir discussing timely filing of charges of discrimination with the eeoc in deferral states,states such as massachusetts,which have their own civil rights statute and agency.there is no dispute that the plaintiff met these administrative deadlines the earliest incident of alleged harassment occurred on september,and the plaintiff administrative complaint was filed with both agencies on march.
a claimant who wishes to sue under chapter must allow a waiting period to pass,file her suit,and notify the mcad which is then required to dismiss the administrative proceeding.laws ch.this civil suit must be instituted no later than three years after the occurrence of the alleged violation.see id.the federal prototype is different.a title vii claimant may sue only after the eeoc issues a letter.f.once such a letter is received,the claimant must file her suit within ninety days.id.the fact that an analogous state statute of limitations has expired with respect to a parallel state harassment action does not create a temporal bar to a title vii suit.see burgh borough council,cir kirk rockwell int l,cir draper pipe foundry,cir.
here,the plaintiff title vii claims are unquestionably timely she received a letter on april,and added her title vii claims to her pending suit on may.the situation is more tenebrous with regard to the chapter claims.the plaintiff first brought suit on these claims on november.based on the statute of limitations applicable to chapter actions,this would seem to foreclose recovery for any incidents that occurred prior to november,including the original sexual harassment and several of the instances of alleged retaliation.
the plaintiff offers a theory as to why these claims nonetheless are timely.after reviewing her thesis,we conclude that her claims based on the ortiz imbroglio are barred but that her retaliation claims are not.we explain briefly.
massachusetts law recognizes that some claims of discrimination involve a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.cuddyer stop shop supermarket.under this continuing violation doctrine,a plaintiff who ordinarily would be unable to recover damages for discrete acts of discrimination falling outside the limitations period may avoid that bar if those acts are shown to be part of a pattern of discrimination anchored by acts that occurred within the limitations period.id.at.hostile environment claims,by their nature,often fall within this rubric.see id.at clifton.bay transp.in such situations,however,the anchoring event must substantially relate to earlier incidents of abuse and substantially contribute to the continuation of a hostile work environment.cuddyer,at.
the application of the continuing violation doctrine sometimes has the effect of expanding the filing deadline for suits under chapter.see,clifton,at carter comm r of.we thus confront the question of whether the facts in this case,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,make out a continuing violation.
on the one hand,we think that reasonable jurors could find that the distasteful and unpleasant actions undertaken by the plaintiff coworkers before and after november,were part of a pattern of retaliation.for one thing,the harassment began soon after the plaintiff lodged her initial complaint about ortiz boorishness and surfaced most frequently in the first few months after ortiz was dismissed.when harassment follows hard on the heels of protected activity,the timing often is strongly suggestive of retaliation.see oliver digital equip,cir mole of.for another thing,the harassment itself offered circumstantial evidence of causation coworkers referred to the plaintiff as a rat a term that connotes an informer or snitch,lamented the firing of their good supervisor,and took up a collection for his benefit.even as late as,gilardi committed an act of harassment and,shortly thereafter,made reference to the plaintiff upcoming payday.up to that point,we believe that reasonable jurors could deem the listed incidents to comprise a pattern of retaliatory harassment.since this pattern includes events within and without the limitations period,we are free to use incidents from both periods in deciding whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of a hostile work environment under chapter.
that said,we find unpersuasive the plaintiff labored effort to include ortiz solitary act of sexual harassment as part of the pattern of subsequent retaliatory acts.this attempted agglomeration relies heavily,but mistakenly,upon the mcad decision in muise credit,mcad,a case in which the agency said that timely incidents of retaliation may anchor an untimely incident of sexual harassment if the charge of retaliation is inextricably related to the original charge of sexual harassment.id.at.the plaintiff overlooks that in order to invoke this doctrine,a claimant must show at a bare minimum a series of discriminatory acts that emanate from the same discriminatory animus.see provencher cvs pharmacy,cir see also morrisey holiday inn,mcad citing provencher.we explain briefly.
when an individual sexually harasses a victim and then engages in retaliatory harassment,the sexual and harassment arguably may be part and parcel of the same violation,at noting that,in such circumstances,the harassment is still charged with the original animus.but morris oldham county fiscal court,cir refusing to aggregate sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment undertaken by a single supervisor.that was the fact pattern in muise,at.
the majority of cases are not cut from this seamless cloth.even when retaliation is derivative of a particular act of harassment,it normally does not stem from the same animus.most often,retaliation is a distinct and independent act of discrimination,motivated by a discrete intention to punish a person who has rocked the boat by complaining about an unlawful employment practice.see,ruffino state bank trust,tinkham flatley,wl,at mcad july,quoting ruffino.that is a different animus than the sexual animus that drove the original harassment.
this case aptly illustrates the disparity of motives.ortiz attack was a incident of sexual harassment.by contrast,the retaliatory harassment consisted of a series of discrete acts orchestrated by a cohort of different individuals not including ortiz and occurring over a period of many months beginning only after ortiz was suspended.of critical importance,nothing in the record indicates that these retaliatory acts were undertaken for reasons related to the plaintiff gender.as such,the sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment in this case must be viewed for what they are two separate and independent harms.see goguen quality plan adm rs,wl,at holding that sexual harassment by one person and subsequent retaliation by another are not sufficiently related to add up to a single continuing violation sitar.dep of,cir noting generally that retaliation and sexual harassment charges are not like or reasonably related to one another to permit an eeoc charge of one type of wrong to support a subsequent civil suit for another.the plaintiff can not rely on the second to revive the first.
for much the same reason,we decline the plaintiff invitation to treat her case as one involving a claim.in support of this entreaty,the plaintiff relies upon lam of hawaii,cir,and hicks gates rubber,cir.both decisions held,however,that race and sex may be aggregated under title vii where the allegations involved discrimination against a subclass of people sharing both protected traits but not against those sharing only one or the other.see lam,at involving discrimination against a subclass of asian women hicks,at involving discrimination against a subclass of black women.such a claim still involves a single wrong and a single harm,prompted by a single animus.that is clearly not the case here ortiz assault was not directed at the plaintiff due to her status as a complaining woman,as she was not yet a member of that subclass when the assault occurred.lam and hicks are,therefore,inapposite.
to sum up,we find timely the plaintiff title vii sexual harassment claim and her federal and state claims for retaliatory harassment.we find untimely,however,her sexual harassment claim and,therefore,affirm the district court entry of summary judgment for the defendant on that claim.
retaliatory hostile work environment cognizability.
we turn now to the cognizability of the retaliatory harassment claims.both title vii and chapter contain provisions that make it unlawful for employers to retaliate against persons who complain about unlawfully discriminatory employment practices.see a.laws ch.to engage the gears of either statute,a plaintiff must show that i she undertook protected conduct,ii she suffered an adverse employment action,and iii the two were causally linked.see dressler daniel,cir title vii sullivan raytheon,cir chapter.
here,there is no dispute that the plaintiff engaged in protected activity by filing a complaint.the parties instead spar over the second and third elements,which in this instance collapse into a single question did the plaintiff sustain an adverse employment action in the form of a hostile work environment based on retaliation for filing a sexual harassment complaint against ortiz 
typically,an adverse employment action involves a discrete change in the terms and conditions of employment say,a discharge,demotion,or reduction in pay.this case is more nuanced.in order for the plaintiff to survive summary judgment on this record,she must show that,as a legal matter,the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment itself can constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action.she also must show that,as a factual matter,her coworkers actions furnished a sufficient basis to ground a finding that a hostile work environment actually existed.
as to the legal point,the plaintiff maintains that a hostile work environment may constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of both title vii and chapter.the city demurs.it notes that the plaintiff has not been cashiered,demoted,denied promotion,stripped of meaningful duties,or otherwise materially disadvantaged in the terms and conditions of her employment.thus,the city argues,she can not be said to have suffered an adverse employment action.
this precise a hostile work environment can constitute a retaliatory adverse employment never been fully addressed either by this court with regard to title vii or by the massachusetts supreme judicial court with regard to chapter.we look at the federal and state claims separately.
title vii.the weight of authority supports the view that,under title vii,the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment can comprise a retaliatory adverse employment action under a.see,von gunten maryland,cir ray henderson,cir morris,at richardson state dep t of corr,cir gunnell utah valley state,cir wideman stores,cir knox indiana,cir.that view has engendered a circuit split.the fifth circuit has held that a hostile work environment can not constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action instead,retaliation requires an ultimate employment decision such as hiring,granting leave,discharging,promoting,and compensating.mattern eastman kodak,cir see also id.at.the eighth circuit also requires an ultimate employment decision,ledergerber stangler,cir,but defines that term somewhat more elastically,see,scusa nestle,cir.
although this court has never fully analyzed the question,our case law tilts noticeably toward the majority view.the pertinent decisions form a totem pole.at the base of the pole is wyatt city of boston,cir per curiam,where,in dictum,we cited a treatise for the proposition that toleration of harassment by other employees might amount to an adverse employment action.id.at citing arthur larson lex larson,employment discrimination.that led to a series of epibolies in intercontinental trading,cir,we paraphrased the wyatt dictum in white new hampshire department of corrections,cir,we noted the paraphrase with approbation in marrero goya of puerto rico,cir,we approvingly cited white reference and in che massachusetts bay transportation authority,cir,we made a bow in the direction of marrero.this totem pole is highly suggestive.today,we cap it off and hold explicitly that a hostile work environment,tolerated by the employer,is cognizable as a retaliatory adverse employment action for purposes of a.this means that workplace harassment,if sufficiently severe or pervasive,may in and of itself constitute an adverse employment action sufficient to satisfy the second prong of the prima facie case for title vii retaliation cases.
this conclusion is compelled by the statutory text and comports with congressional intent.the operative provision of title vii makes it unlawful to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.given congress intention to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment,harris,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted,it makes sense to construe the qualifier regarding compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment broadly.on that basis,the verb discriminate,as used in section a,logically includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment.see morris,at.
we move next to title vii provision.that provision directs an employer not to discriminate against any employee because the employee has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.a.here,the term discriminate appears without the qualifier.a familiar canon of construction teaches that a term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears.ratzlaf united states,d.we apply that canon here.the result the verb discriminate in the clause includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment.see morris,at see also knox,at nothing indicates why retaliating against a complainant by permitting her fellow employees to punish her for invoking her rights under title vii does not fall within the statute.
our interpretation of the statutory text is shared by the eeoc,which finds the lack of any qualifier on the term discriminate in the context to evince a purpose to prohibit any discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity.eeoc compl.man.cch.this is important because an administrative interpretation of a federal statute by the agency charged with its enforcement,while not controlling upon the courts,constitutes an informed judgment to which some deference ordinarily is due see meritor sav.bank vinson,d.
if more were we doubt that it capacious reading of section a is consonant with its purpose of m aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.robinson shell oil,d.harassment by coworkers as a punishment for undertaking protected activity is a paradigmatic example of adverse treatment spurred by retaliatory motives and,as such,is likely to deter the complaining party or others from engaging in protected activity.ray,at wideman,at.reading the statute to provide a remedy for retaliatory harassment that expresses itself in the form of a hostile work environment thus furthers the goal of ensuring access to the statute remedial mechanisms.
chapter.as for the claim,we believe that,were the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc squarely presented with the question,it would find a retaliatory hostile work environment to be an adverse employment action cognizable under chapter.several factors enter into this determination.
first and foremost,the statute and provisions are very similar to the counterpart provisions contained in title vii.where such linguistic similarity exists,the sjc frequently looks to federal court interpretations of title vii for guidance.see wheatley v.at t,it is our practice to apply federal case law construing the federal statutes in interpreting chapter,div.of interco,mcad,describing federal precedents as helpful.we are,therefore,confident that the sjc,if confronted with this precise question,would quite likely interpret the provision of chapter exactly as we have interpreted the counterpart provision of title vii.
second,to the extent that any ambiguity lurks in the statutory language,massachusetts law explicitly directs that the provisions of chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.laws ch.as with title vii,the purpose of the provision in chapter is to allow parties to seek redress for allegations of discrimination without fear of retaliation for or interference with the exercise of that right.sahli bull hn info.construing chapter s text to protect complaining employees from retaliatory harassment that results in the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment advances that purpose.
third,although the sjc has not spoken directly to the subject,the appeals court has recognized a claim of retaliatory harassment based on a hostile work environment.see clifton,at.while this holding is not indisputably highest court of a state is,after all,the final arbiter of questions,acadia ins.mcneil,cir the decision of an intermediate appellate court of the state generally constitutes a reliable piece of evidence.see west.fortini murphy,cir losacco rich constr,cir.this evidence seems all the more compelling in this case because the decisions construing chapter are ceded some deference by the sjc,cuddyer,at interpreted chapter language to include retaliatory harassment culminating in a hostile work environment.see mcad sexual harassment in the workplace guidelines an employer takes adverse action under when it materially disadvantages the complainant with regard to any of the terms or conditions of her employment.the term adverse action can encompass hostile or abusive workplace treatment.wareing new bedford sch.dep t,wl,at mcad,retaliation may take the form of hostile or abusive workplace treatment.
to say more on this topic would be to paint the lily.for the reasons elucidated above,we hold that,under massachusetts law as under title vii,subjecting an employee to a hostile work environment in retaliation for protected activity constitutes an adverse employment action and,thus,triggers the statutory prophylaxis.
retaliatory hostile work environment sufficiency of proof.
we have established that,as a theoretical matter,subjecting a party to a hostile work environment in retaliation for protected activity may be actionable under both title vii and chapter.that poses the question whether the evidence in this case,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,garside,at,shows that a hostile work environment existed.we turn to that question.
elements of the cause of action.an allegedly retaliatory act must rise to some level of substantiality before it can be actionable.wideman,at maccormack boston edison.the hostile work environment doctrine,as developed in the jurisprudence of title vii,embodies that prerequisite.
in order to prove a hostile work environment,a plaintiff must show that she was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment that materially altered the conditions of her employment.faragher,at.the harassment must be objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.id.at.in determining whether a reasonable person would find particular conduct hostile or abusive,a court must mull the totality of the circumstances,including factors such as the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.at.quoting harris,at.the thrust of this inquiry is to distinguish between the ordinary,if occasionally unpleasant,vicissitudes of the workplace and actual harassment.id.at.
this framework is readily transferable to the retaliatory harassment context.on the one hand,if protected activity leads only to commonplace indignities typical of the workplace such as tepid jokes,teasing,or aloofness,a reasonable person would not be deterred from such activity.after all,an employee reasonably can expect to encounter such tribulations even if she eschews any involvement in protected activity.on the other hand,severe or pervasive harassment in retaliation for engaging in protected activity threatens to deter due enforcement of the rights conferred by statutes such as title vii and chapter.
along this continuum,rudeness or ostracism,standing alone,usually is not enough to support a hostile work environment claim.see manatt bank of,cir gagnon sprint,cir simas first citizens fed.credit union,cir noting,in related context,that social ostracism alone is rarely actionable.the laws were not enacted to create or enforce a general civility code.oncale sundowner offshore,d.so too the laws.
applying the requirements.having sketched the contours of retaliatory hostile work environments in the title vii and chapter milieus,we reach the central question presented in this appeal viewing the totality of the circumstances in the light most flattering to the plaintiff,is the evidence of retaliatory harassment adequate to allow a reasonable jury to find that she was confronted by a hostile work environment 
at the outset,we take note of a unique difficulty posed by allegations of retaliatory harassment.when dealing with discriminatory harassment,harassment based on gender,race,or the like,there is seldom,if ever,a defensible purpose behind the injurious actions.the only question is whether the bad acts,taken in the aggregate,are sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute actionable harassment.see,cardenas massey,cir johnson city of fort wayne,cir.
retaliatory harassment,however,requires a more nuanced analysis.the very act of filing a charge against a coworker will invariably cause tension and result in a less agreeable workplace.von gunten,at.the target of the complaint likely will have who come to his defense,while other coworkers will seek to steer clear of trouble by avoiding both the complainant and the target.although admittedly a source of unpleasantness in the workplace,such behavior should not be seen as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment.id.after all,there is nothing inherently wrong either with supporting a friend or with striving to avoid controversy.we think it follows that those actions that are hurtful to a complainant only because coworkers do not take her side in a dispute may not be considered as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment.it is only those actions,directed at a complainant,that stem from a retaliatory animus which may be factored into the hostile work environment calculus.
even with these nuances in mind,we conclude that the evidence in this case,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,would certainly not reasonable jury to find that the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment.in reaching this conclusion,we take into account the relative ubiquity of the retaliatory conduct,its severity,its natural tendency to humiliate and,on occasion,physically threaten a reasonable person,and its capacity to interfere with the plaintiff work performance.see harris,at.
in the months immediately following the plaintiff initial series of complaints about ortiz actions,she was subjected to a steady stream of abuse.much of this was significant and was of a kind that courts historically have found persuasive as evidence of a hostile work environment.she was falsely accused of misconduct digirolamo levied a baseless charge against her in the incident and the case law recognizes that false accusations of misconduct can contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment.see ray,at aviles cornell forge,cir.digirolamo also interfered with the plaintiff working conditions by falsely informing her that she was required to take her dinner breaks work sabotage,exclusion,and denial of support also may contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment,at.the harassing insults directed at the plaintiff are likewise entitled to some weight in the decisional calculus.see bolden prc,cir noting that even infrequent harassing insults should be considered,along with other instances of harassment.so too the taunting of the plaintiff with the collection on behalf of ortiz marrero,at finding that taunting plaintiff in relation to her filing of an eeoc complaint was evidence of retaliatory harassment oncale,at.noting that open and direct hostility clearly based on protected status is evidence of hostile work environment.
gilardi continued tormenting of the plaintiff is also relevant.soon after the collection incident,gilardi interfered with the plaintiff ability to work by leaving her out in the cold literally,not figuratively.this conduct may be seen as having contributed to the creation of a hostile work environment.see gorski dep t of,cir,at.gilardi later placed the plaintiff at risk of physical harm by coming close to striking her with a van if that was intentional and,for now,we must credit the plaintiff averment that it was,it is a cogent indicator of an adverse change in the conditions of the plaintiff employment.white bfi waste,llc,cir noting that the presence of physical threats undeniably strengthens a hostile work environment claim raniola bratton,cir similar.to cinch matters,the plaintiff offered evidence that these incidents contributed to physical and psychological problems that required treatment,thus underscoring the negative effect on her work performance.
of course,no pat formula exists for determining with certainty whether the sum of harassing workplace incidents rises to the level of an actionable hostile work environment.see harris,at.such a determination requires the trier of fact to assess the matter on a basis,weighing the totality of the circumstances.lipsett of,cir.our function is one of screening,that is,to determine whether,on particular facts,a reasonable jury could reach such a conclusion.frito lay snacks caribbean,cir.taking the aggregate facts of record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we believe that a jury rationally could find that the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment arising out of retaliation for her complaint against a popular coworker.
e.the liability standard.
this conclusion takes us to the liability standard.in importing the hostile work environment doctrine into the context,courts are left to draw the standards for employer liability from the case law involving hostile work environments in the context.the supreme court has divided the universe of employer liability along a line that separates supervisors from.when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment,the employer is vicariously liable for it,subject,however,to a possible affirmative defense.see burlington,ellerth,d faragher,at.
this defense,familiarly known as the defense,consists of two elements which,if proven,permit the employer to avoid liability.first,the employer must show that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly the harassment.ellerth,at.second,the employer must show that the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.id.
as with title vii,chapter makes employers vicariously liable for hostile work environments created by supervisors,at.unlike title vii,however,chapter does not afford employers any affirmative defenses to liability.based on the legislative mandate that chapter must be construed liberally to effectuate its purposes,see.laws ch,the sjc has endorsed a rule that holds employers strictly liable for supervisory harassment.see,at rejecting a reasonable care standard as a defense to a hostile work environment claim see also blockel penney,cir noting that the faragher ellerth defense does not apply to chapter actions.because the reasoning of belies any meaningful distinction between discriminatory harassment and retaliatory harassment where supervisors are concerned,we conclude that no type of affirmative defense is available under chapter to an employer whose supervisors create a retaliatory hostile work environment.
when coworkers,rather than supervisors,are responsible for the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment,title vii and chapter seem essentially coterminous as they relate to employer liability.notwithstanding the absence of a controlling supreme court precedent,several federal courts,including this court,have held that,in such situations,an employer can only be liable if the harassment is causally connected to some negligence on the employer part.see,wyninger new venture gear,cir ocheltree scollon,cir crowley bean,cir.typically,this involves a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment,yet failed to take prompt action to stop it.see crowley,at.similarly,under chapter,employer liability for coworker harassment requires a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment,yet failed to halt it.messina araserve,discussing massachusetts law,at.
at the summary judgment stage,these determinations are complicated.the question of whether an employee is a supervisor in the relevant sense is itself factual in nature.hrobowski worthington steel,cir.here,the lower court found only coworker harassment it declared that the evidence showed that the retaliation had been undertaken by subordinate officials,none of whom had control over terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.
the district court skepticism about the claimed supervisory status of some of the harassers seems.the key to determining supervisory status is the degree of authority possessed by the putative supervisor.joens john morrell,cir parkins civil constructors of,cir.thus,courts must distinguish employees who are supervisors merely as a function of nomenclature from those who are entrusted with actual supervisory powers.parkins,at accord mikels city of durham,cir.having in mind both common law agency principles and the purposes of the and laws,we agree with the seventh circuit that the essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim employment.parkins,at.this authority primarily consists of the power to hire,fire,demote,promote,transfer,or discipline an employee.id.at.without some modicum of this authority,a harasser can not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of imputing vicarious liability to the employer in a title vii case,but,rather,should be regarded as an ordinary coworker see id.at.we think that the same standard applies under chapter.see,at observing that the power wielded by a harassing supervisor may range from discharge to assignment of work,particularly exacting scrutiny,or refusal to protect the employee from coworker harassment.
in this case,the plaintiff has not presented facts sufficient to show that she was harassed at the hands of persons who qualify as supervisors.the deposition of irene landry provides the clearest evidence of the organizational structure of the workplace.the parking enforcement officers are on the lowest rung of the ladder.on the next rung are the shift supervisors,who drive the parking enforcement officers to their assigned routes and pick them up.the third rung is occupied by more senior supervisors,each of whom holds the title senior supervisor ii.the functions of these individuals include dealing with personnel problems.during the time in question,landry held the position of senior supervisor ii.she reported to moccia,a official who held the title of senior supervisor of parking enforcement.moccia had authority to handle a wide variety of employee issues and complaints.
the plaintiff uses the word supervisor indiscriminately,referring to people on the second,third,and fourth rungs as supervisors and making no distinctions among them.that approach elevates nomenclature over actual authority.when we shift the focus to those persons whose actual authority made them supervisors in the relevant sense,a different picture emerges.
landry and moccia each appear to have possessed the requisite authority,but neither of them were guilty of any retaliatory harassment.the only two supervisors whose actions rationally can be said to have contributed to the hostile work environment are gilardi and digirolamo.gilardi was a shift supervisor,and digirolamo level of authority seems no greater the record only permits us to speculate on this point,and the lack of proof counts against the plaintiff.the plaintiff has presented us with no evidence that either woman had the power to terminate,discipline,or otherwise affect the terms and conditions of her employment.in the absence of such evidence,the city can not be held vicariously responsible for their harassment.
the plaintiff claim thus reduces to one of coworker harassment.the viability of that claim depends on whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding that the employer knew or should have known about the hostile work environment,yet failed to stop it.we conclude that sufficient evidence exists.plaintiff complained of the harassment to two senior supervisors landry and moccia.landry did not deal with the plaintiff complaints at all and moccia,rather than rectifying the situation,speculated that the harassment would likely become ten times worse with the plaintiff recent shift change.moreover,the deputy commissioner was aware of the harassment,but did nothing to dispel it.since landry,moccia,and the deputy commissioner were appropriate recipients of the plaintiff complaints,there is enough evidence to allow a finding of actual notice on the city part.see crowley,at breda wolf camera video,cir.
the city only rejoinder is that the supervisors responded to the plaintiff allegations in an appropriate manner.at best,this presents a factual dispute that is not amenable to resolution on summary judgment.consequently,there is a trialworthy issue as to whether the city was negligent in not putting a stop to the harassment.
sexual harassment under title vii.
this brings us to the plaintiff claim that ortiz assault subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex even if the assault was sufficient,in and of itself,to create a hostile work proposition that we regard as highly plaintiff can not prevail.though she refers to ortiz as her supervisor,the record contains a paucity of evidence about his job description and authority.that which does appear indicates that ortiz,like gilardi,was merely a shift supervisor.as the plaintiff provided no evidence that such an employee had the authority to hire,fire,or otherwise dictate the terms and conditions of employment,vicarious liability is off the table.it follows that the plaintiff can survive summary judgment only if she can show that a rational jury could find the city negligent because it knew or should have known of the harassment yet failed to take prompt action to stop it.crowley,at.
the plaintiff can not carry this burden.there is no evidence of any prior misconduct on ortiz part.the first that the city knew or could have known about his assaultive demeanor was when it received the initial report of the attack.the undisputed evidence shows that a mere seven days elapsed between the time of the assault and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings which began with ortiz immediate suspension and culminated in his discharge.between the assault and the suspension,the plaintiff says that she encountered ortiz in the workplace,but there is no evidence that she was forced to work with him or was exposed to further harassment by him.while we leave open the possibility that,under certain extreme circumstances,a delay of seven days in separating a harasser and his victim might evince negligence,there is nothing to indicate that the city acted here in a dilatory manner.on this record,a rational jury could only conclude that,as to the title vii sexual harassment claim,the city acted in a professional and appropriate manner to resolve the problem.no more was exigible.see,reed mbna mktg,cir noting that investigation of sexual assault by employer,quickly leading to malefactor termination,indicates reasonable care on behalf of employer.
that ends this aspect of the matter.one of the main purposes of title vii is to encourage proactive resolution of workplace harassment.we would undermine that purpose were we to subject the city to sexual harassment liability despite its prompt and effective action in investigating the incident and removing the perpetrator from the workplace.
iii.conclusion 
we need go no further.to recapitulate,we hold that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to sur
