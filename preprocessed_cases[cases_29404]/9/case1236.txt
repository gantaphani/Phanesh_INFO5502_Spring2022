plaintiff jennifer arculeo arculeo,who brought this suit alleging prohibited discrimination in employment,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,william conner,judge,granting summary judgment to the defendants on the claims under title vii of the civil rights act of,and dismissing without prejudice the claims under the new york human rights law nyhrl,exec.law.
an employer is not covered by the provisions of title vii,unless the employer has at least fifteen employees.see b.defendants sales marketing,llc and crystal hills,llc crystal hills each moved for summary judgment in part on the ground that it did not have fifteen employees and therefore was not subject to liability under title vii arculeo did not dispute that each of them,if considered as an independent entity,had fewer than fifteen employees during the relevant time period,but argued that they should be deemed to have employed her jointly and that their employees should therefore be aggregated to meet the threshold.the district court concluded that,as a matter of law,employees of joint employers may not be aggregated to meet the minimum.the court therefore granted summary judgment without reaching the question whether the defendants were,in fact,joint employers.
we affirm,on somewhat different grounds.without ruling on the question whether employees of joint employers may be aggregated to meet the minimum of title vii,we conclude that the plaintiff has not shown circumstances that could justify an aggregation of a sufficient number of employees to satisfy the statutory minimum.
background 
in june,plaintiff arculeo began working as a sales assistant for,a marketing and sales services firm.her employment at continued to september.during this period,never had more than fourteen employees.
contracted to perform sales and marketing services for crystal hills,a housing construction company,in connection with a crystal hills development in middletown,new york.assigned plaintiff to work with and under the supervision of crystal hills personnel at the middletown office of crystal hills.throughout the course of her employment at,plaintiff worked at the crystal hills office.during this time,crystal hills never had more than eight employees.
most or all of the alleged abusive conduct was on the part of defendant sanford pankin,who had a supervisory role at crystal hills and allan leeds,an supervisor.the allegations of the complaint with respect to pankin are that he repeatedly forced plaintiff to engage in oral sex with him,that he frequently made lewd comments directed at her,both when they were alone together and in the presence of,and that when she became pregnant,he told her to get an abortion.with respect to leeds,the complaint alleges that,when pankin told plaintiff to get an abortion,leeds volunteered that her medical insurance provided by would cover the abortion that when plaintiff complained to leeds about pankin harassment,leeds,after temporarily reassigning plaintiff so that she would not have to work with pankin,yielded to pankin demand that she be returned to work with him and finally that after her maternity leave,when she refused to resume work with pankin,leeds fired her,saying that if she would not work with pankin at crystal hills,she did not have a job at.
in support of their motions for summary judgment,the defendants showed and plaintiff does not dispute that during the period in question,neither nor crystal hills ever had as many as fifteen employees on its payroll.in response,plaintiff sought to satisfy the requirement by contending that crystal hills supervised employees,that and crystal hills should therefore be deemed joint employers,and that their employees should be aggregated to determine whether the requirement was met.
the district court did not reach a conclusion as to whether and crystal hills were in fact joint employers.it deemed such an inquiry unnecessary because it concluded that the employees of joint employers could not be aggregated to satisfy the requirement id.at.the district court began its analysis of the aggregation question by reviewing three opinions of the district court for the southern district of new york,all of which concluded that the employees of joint employers may not be aggregated for purposes of satisfying the,d,prunella carlshire tenants,d also decided by judge conner,and laurin pokoik,dist.lexis,wl march,same conclusion in dicta id.at.the district court expressed approval of the reasoning behind these holdings,such as the serrano court observation that joint employers retain separate identities,and that potential exposure of small businesses would discourage the informal employment arrangements upon which small businesses often depend.id.at citing serrano,d at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also addressed cases in other circuits that have come to the opposite conclusion that the employees of joint employers could be aggregated for purposes of the threshold,most notably an eleventh circuit case,virgo riviera beach,cir,which relied heavily on the generally broad construction of the term employer in the statute.arculeo,d at.
after reviewing the various authorities,the district court explained that it was loath to depart from the line of southern district cases.id.at.in particular,the district court found the serrano opinion convincing.id.the court also observed that disallowing aggregation best comported with the second circuit discussion of the legislative history and the purpose of the minimum in tomka seiler,cir.see arculeo,d at.the court,therefore,granted summary judgment on the title vii claims.because the federal law claims furnishing the basis of federal jurisdiction were dismissed,the court dismissed the nyhrl claims,without prejudice to the plaintiff seeking relief in state courts 
discussion 
title vii imposes liability for employment discrimination only on an employer,which is defined by the statute as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year,and any agent of such a person.b.the district court opinion below squarely focused on an issue which has never been resolved by this the employees of different employers may be aggregated for purposes of satisfying the minimum required by title vii under on the ground that these employers acted as joint employers.we need not answer this question in order to decide the case before us.even assuming that such aggregation is permitted by law,on the particular facts of this case aggregation would not reach the necessary threshold of fifteen employees.the question is therefore moot.
aggregation under the single employer and joint employer doctrines 
the plaintiff argument for aggregating the employees of and crystal hills builds on recognized doctrines that enable an employee in certain circumstances to assert employer liability against an entity that is not formally his or her employer.these doctrines are sometimes called the single employer or single integrated employer and the joint employer doctrines.the labeling can be deceptive because the terms are used in numerous contexts,such as union representation,responsibility for violations of the fair labor standards act,and,as here,title vii liability.notwithstanding the same label and some core similarities between those contexts,the doctrines might differ significantly in different contexts.
in clinton ditch cooperative nlrb,cir,a suit alleging that a bottling company,which subcontracted with a trucking company,was a joint employer of the trucking company drivers and was therefore obligated to bargain collectively with the drivers union,this court discussed differences between the single employer and joint employer doctrines a single employer situation exists where two nominally separate entities are actually part of a single integrated enterprise id.at citing nlrb indus.of,cir.in such circumstances,of which examples may be parent and subsidiary corporations,or separate corporations under common ownership and management,the nominally distinct entities can be deemed to constitute a single enterprise.see cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir.there is authority under this theory that,in appropriate circumstances,an employee,who is technically employed on the books of one entity,which is deemed to be part of a larger entity,may impose liability for certain violations of employment law not only on the nominal employer but also on another entity comprising part of the single integrated employer.id.
in a joint employer relationship,in contrast,there is no single integrated enterprise.a conclusion that employers are joint assumes that they are separate legal entities,but that they handle certain aspects of their relationship jointly.clinton ditch,at citing,at.where this doctrine is operative,an employee,formally employed by one entity,who has been assigned to work in circumstances that justify the conclusion that the employee is at the same time constructively employed by another entity,may impose liability for violations of employment law on the constructive employer,on the theory that this other entity is the employee joint employer.see clinton ditch,at see also laurin,dist.lexis,wl,at.
this court has never discussed the somewhat different,but related,question whether employees of different entities may be aggregated under either the single employer or the joint employer doctrines to satisfy title vii threshold.district court opinions in this circuit have allowed aggregation of all employees of multiple entities under the single employer doctrine,based upon a finding that those nominally distinct entities should be deemed a single integrated employer for purposes of title vii.see westphal catch ball products,assuming that orange point,gallup and catch ball properly were considered a single employer,the three companies together had employees in at the time plaintiff was terminated.fernot crafts inn,two entities may be given single employer status such that their combined number of employees will be determinative of whether they are subject to title vii requirements.quoting armbruster quinn,cir internal quotation marks omitted.arculeo has not suggested that and crystal hills are part of a single integrated enterprise,and therefore has not argued for aggregation of their employees pursuant to the single employer doctrine.
some authorities have also adopted a rule permitting aggregation so as to satisfy the requirement on the ground that distinct entities have acted jointly with respect to employment.see virgo riviera beach,cir eeoc compliance manual b a iii b may.arculeo claims the benefit of this doctrine.she contends that and crystal hills are her joint employers.she argues for the aggregation of all their employees to determine whether the threshold is satisfied.but the plaintiff misunderstands the doctrine.arculeo urges us to follow the eeoc compliance manual,which supports aggregation in joint employer circumstances,but she misunderstands its terms.
aggregation of employees under the joint employer doctrine would function quite differently from aggregation of employees under the single employer doctrine.in the single employer context,the court draws the conclusion that,although nominally and technically distinct,several entities are properly seen as a single integrated entity.accordingly all the employees of the constituent entities are employees of the overarching integrated entity,and all of those employees may be aggregated to determine whether it employs fifteen employees.in contrast,when the circumstances of one employee employment justify the conclusion that she is being employed jointly by two distinct employers,it does not follow that all the employees of both employers are part of an integrated entity encompassing both.a joint undertaking by two entities with respect to employment may furnish justification for adding to the employees of one employer those employees of another who are jointly employed by the first,but such joint undertaking does not furnish logical justification for adding together all the employees of both employers,unless the circumstances justify the conclusion that all the employees of one are jointly employed by the other.
imagine a company in the clothing business and a temporary agency,which rents office workers on its payroll to business entities.assume that each company has fewer than fifteen employees on its books.the clothing seller contracts with the temporary agency to have three office workers on the agency payroll assigned to work at the clothing seller,under circumstances that might justify the conclusion that all three loaned office workers are jointly employed by their formal employer,the temporary agency,and the clothing seller,which supervises them.such facts might justify adding the three borrowed employees to the employees directly employed by the clothing seller to determine the number of the clothing seller employees for title vii purposes.but these facts would furnish no logical justification for adding the other office temps on the staff of the temporary agency assigned to work for other companies to the number of employees of the clothing company.neither would those circumstances justify adding the employees of the clothing company to those of the temporary agency to determine the number of the temporary agency employees.
as noted,our circuit has as yet taken no position on whether aggregation is appropriate in either the single employer or the joint employer context for purposes of determining whether the title vii threshold is met even assuming that our circuit would allow aggregation in the joint employment context to meet the requirement,arculeo has not shown circumstances that would justify a finding that either or crystal hills should be deemed to have fifteen employees.arculeo claim therefore must fail regardless what position this circuit will ultimately take on the propriety of aggregation in a joint employer situation 
arculeo argues that,under joint employment principles,we should aggregate in accordance with the rules described in the eeoc compliance manual.the manual,however,does not endorse simply adding together all the employees of entities found to be joint employers,as may be appropriate where aggregation occurs under the single employer theory.it rather requires a detailed analysis of the number of employees attributable to each employer,either because they are formally employed or jointly employed by that employer.for example,the manual explains,to determine whether a respondent is covered,count the number of individuals employed by the respondent alone and the employees jointly employed by the respondent and other entities.eeoc compliance manual b a iii b.it goes on to give the following example,which has considerable pertinence to our case 
cp files a charge against abc corp alleging that she was subjected to religious harassment.abc has regular employees and five employees assigned by a temporary agency.abc is covered under title vii because it has employees.
example.it is clear in this example that,if the manual is followed,the employees of a joint employer who can be counted for aggregation purposes are only those employees either directly or constructively employed by it.abc has employees because it has employees formally employed by it and five employees attributable to it on a joint employment theory because their employer has assigned them to work at abc.the analysis is not affected by the number of other persons employed by the temporary agency who are not assigned to work at abc.needless to say,the fact that the number of abc employees is increased by the five temporary employees furnished by the temporary agency would not provide a basis for increasing the number of employees employed at the temporary agency by adding abc regular employees,who are not employed by the temporary agency on any rational theory.
we proceed to examine the facts of this case according to the manual procedure for aggregation on the basis of joint employment because we find that even under the manual aggregation procedure,arculeo has shown no basis for determining that either or crystal hills had fi
