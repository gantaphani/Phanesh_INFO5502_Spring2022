samuel davis appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york kenneth schroeder,magistrate judge,granting summary judgment for appellees and dismissing his complaint,and from interlocutory orders carol heckman,magistrate judge denying davis preliminary injunction motion and motion to file a supplemental complaint.davis filed a complaint against new york state,governor pataki,the new york state department of correctional services the department,glenn goord,its commissioner,the attica correctional facility attica,walter kelly,its superintendent corrections sergeant stachewicz,and corrections officers mcdonald,christen,and barone,and their successors,in their individual and official capacities,alleging that defendants violated his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by exposing him to high levels of smoke.he also alleged that defendants retaliated against him for engaging in constitutionally protected activity.the district court denied his motions for preliminary injunctive relief and to file an amended complaint,and granted summary judgment for defendants.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
davis has been incarcerated at attica since.liberally construing his pro se complaint,davis had been concerned,throughout his incarceration,about his exposure to excessive levels of smoke while housed in various housing blocks.he ultimately filed an inmate grievance in february,complaining that he needed to minimize his exposure to the air by opening the window across from his cell,but stachewicz,mcdonald and barone told him not to open the window,and threatened to move him out of the honor block,where he was housed at the time,if he opened the window.these concerns were also expressed in a letter to goord,which was carbon copied to kelly.
the grievance was dismissed in march,because davis had been moved out of the honor block by that time.davis attempted to appeal.in april,davis was informed that the grievance was not appealable,because it had been dismissed rather than denied.he was further informed that he could request a review of the dismissal,but that the only review available was by the same supervisor who conducted the original investigation into the complaint,and this supervisor had no intention of reopening the complaint.
davis filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of new york in april,alleging that defendants violated his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by forcing him to be exposed to excessive levels of smoke on a daily basis,because he was housed in an area where a majority of the inmates smoked frequently,the ventilation was inadequate,and he was prevented from opening the window.davis claimed that these conditions jeopardized his current and future health.he claimed to suffer from dizziness,blackouts,congestion,difficulty breathing,watery eyes,and other respiratory problems,as a result of his exposure to smoke.davis also alleged that pataki,goord and kelly acted with deliberate indifference to his rights as a because they failed to implement policies to protect health,failed to train and supervise officers regarding the rights of inmates,and failed to remedy the problem after it was brought to their attention.he further alleged that stachewicz,christen,mcdonald and barone retaliated against him,through harassment and threats,for complaining about violations of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.davis alleged that mcdonald harassed and intimidated him,threatened to inflict physical harm,physically assaulted and verbally abused him,and that goord and kelly had been deliberately indifferent to this misconduct.davis sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as monetary damages.
in july,davis moved for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order enjoining named and unnamed defendants from assaulting,harassing,intimidating,threatening and verbally abusing him in retaliation for exercising his constitutional rights.davis alleged that he would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction,because the civilian employees who administered his prison work program and other corrections officers had begun to retaliate against him because of his complaints about excessive smoke exposure.davis alleged that a corrections sergeant filed a false misconduct report regarding an altercation with a fellow inmate,and that he was found guilty of the charges after a biased and procedurally defective hearing,resulting in thirty days of keeplock and loss of his assigned work program.davis also filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint,raising essentially the same allegations as in the motion for preliminary injunctive relief,and seeking to add attica supervisory staff and the parties involved in the misconduct report and hearing as defendants.
the parties consented to have a magistrate judge handle all proceedings,pursuant to c.the magistrate judge denied davis motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order,finding that davis failed to show that he would suffer irreparable harm because he had no liberty interest in his work assignment or in the privileges lost while in keeplock,and that davis would not likely succeed on the merits because he could not show that defendants had a retaliatory motive.see davis state of new york,wl.the magistrate judge also denied davis motion to amend his complaint,holding that davis new allegations failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see davis state of new york,wl.
in september,davis wrote to superintendent herbert,with a carbon copy to goord,complaining about his medical problems due to smoke exposure,and requesting placement in a cell with an individual window.according to davis letter,the only housing blocks at attica that have individual windows in each cell are blocks c and davis explained that on february,he was transferred from the honor block to the c block due to his respiratory problems.thereafter,he was moved to the b block from june until july,and was finally transferred to the a block on july,where he remained on the waiting list to be assigned to work programs that would require him to be housed in blocks c or 
in july,davis moved for summary judgment.he argued that he had demonstrated that his eighth amendment rights were violated when defendants knowingly caused him and other inmates to be exposed involuntarily to excessive levels of smoke without adequate ventilation,jeopardizing his current and future health.davis further contended that he had demonstrated that he was harassed,intimidated,and threatened for exercising his constitutional rights,and that such retaliation was in violation of the eighth amendment.
defendants filed a for summary judgment,arguing that davis eighth amendment rights were not violated because he did not meet the test for establishing an eighth amendment claim based on smoke exposure.defendants noted that,pursuant to helling mckinney,d,where the harm is allegedly due to smoke,the plaintiff must meet the objective prong by showing serious harm resulting from exposure to unreasonably high levels of smoke.in addition,defendants noted that,pursuant to farmer brennan,d,the plaintiff must satisfy the subjective prong of the test by showing that prison officials acted with deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.
defendants contended that davis did not submit evidence to establish serious injuries due to smoke,or that he was exposed to a sufficiently high level of smoke to result in serious injury.in support of their argument that davis had no serious injuries,defendants submitted the affidavit of takos,the health services director of attica.according to takos,davis only complained of symptoms once,in february.takos asserted that davis congestion was due to a deviated septum,which davis had refused to get corrected.in takos opinion,there was no medical evidence that davis exhibited intolerance to smoke,or had a condition that warranted housing in a environment.davis had also complained to health services about experiencing blackouts,but the takos affidavit states that the ambulatory health records had a notation july,that davis complained that said episodes occurred while laughing.a request for consultation of that date recites that there were two such episodes in the past two weeks following laughing episodes.these particular entries contain no mention of exposure to smoke.
defendants also asserted that the exposure to smoke was not substantial.they claimed that davis complaint focused only on the time period during which davis,housed in a single cell honor block,was not allowed to have the window open.although there were no units at attica,defendants claimed that davis should have asked to transfer within the honor block if the smoke in his area was bothering him,and that the transfer would have been granted.
defendants also argued they did not act with deliberate indifference to the effects of tobacco smoke or davis health.they cited attica smoking policy,which prohibits smoking in common areas but permits smoking in residential areas,as evidence of their good faith.they also noted that a new smoking policy was being phased in,and effective in june,it was contemplated that smoking would not be permitted inside any of the department buildings.in addition,defendants claimed that prison officials did not act with deliberate indifference by requiring davis to keep his window closed,because other inmates complained they were cold,and ordering davis to shut the window protected davis from the wrath of other inmates.
in the remainder of their summary judgment brief,defendants argued that pataki,goord,and kelly were not personally involved in the alleged constitutional violations,so they could not be liable in the action davis could not establish the retaliation claim davis physical assault,harassment,and intimidation claims should be dismissed because the alleged conduct did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against agencies of the state of new york and individual defendants in their official capacities,by virtue of the eleventh amendment and the defendants have qualified immunity from liability because the right to be free from smoke is not clearly established,and the defendants actions were reasonable because a the department had a smoking policy that complied with the new york clean air act,and also accounted for the unique nature of the prison environment,in which it is not reasonable to prohibit smoking entirely or have separate,housing units,and b there is no case law supporting an eighth amendment violation based on smoke exposure where an inmate is housed in a single cell.
in opposition to defendants summary judgment motion,davis argued that defendants did not dispute that he had been exposed,in his open cell with only bars as barriers,to the smoke of chain smokers in surrounding cells,without adequate ventilation.davis asserted that the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to him,afforded a rational basis for a factfinder to conclude that his confinement exposed him to unreasonably high levels of smoke.
davis also disputed statements in the corrections officers affidavits regarding the ventilation and degree of smoke in the housing unit,whether the windows were allowed to be kept open on cold days,whether other inmates had complained of being cold,and whether he had always been housed in a single cell.he asserted that from january to march,he was housed in a cell with a cellmate who smoked.davis also disputed the validity of takos findings,asserting that he complained of conditions caused by smoke several times,but not all of the inmates complaints become part of their medical record,and takos is not a specialist in such conditions.davis attacked the viability of the new smoking policy,asserting that it is not effective or enforceable,because officers and inmates continue to smoke inside.
the magistrate judge granted defendants summary judgment motion as to governor pataki based on his lack of personal involvement,then denied davis summary judgment motion,and granted summary judgment for defendants.the magistrate judge concluded that,although the supreme court held in helling that an inmate could state an eighth amendment claim for cruel and unusual punishment by showing unreasonable exposure to smoke,davis failed to provide evidence that was sufficient to prove,as a matter of law,that he was exposed to unreasonably high levels of smoke,or that there were material issues of triable fact regarding his exposure.
the magistrate judge conclusion was based on the following facts davis complaint only specified three instances when his window was closed against his will the time period relevant to the complaint was very limited,spanning from october to february davis was ordered to stop opening the window less than two months before he was transferred out of the housing block davis had applied for and was voluntarily placed in the honor block davis did not request to be transferred to a less smoky cell,even though requests to transfer within the honor block were liberally accommodated davis occupied a private cell during the relevant time period a mechanical ventilation system drew air out of davis cell and davis medical records show only one reference to his complaint about symptoms,and the symptoms were actually related to a previous condition.based on these facts,and davis failure to come forward with enough credible evidence to support a jury verdict in his favor,the magistrate judge disposed of the motions without addressing the other arguments raised by the parties,or the retaliation claim.
ii.discussion 
justiciability and mootness 
we first consider whether davis claim for permanent injunctive relief is justiciable,or whether the claim is moot,as davis was transferred to a different housing block,and attica implemented a new smoking policy.under article iii,section of the constitution,federal courts lack jurisdiction to decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.see defunis odegaard,d per curiam citing north carolina rice,d bragger trinity capital enterprise,cir.a case is moot when it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur,and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.associated contractors of city of new haven,cir quoting county of los angeles davis,d.
here,davis claim for injunctive relief is not moot because davis indicates that his problems with smoke are ongoing.despite defendants contention that davis does not complain of ongoing exposure to excessive amounts of smoke,the most recent information on record indicates that davis is housed in a block without individual cell windows,in conditions similar to those he experienced prior to being transferred out of the honor block.moreover,although defendants have implemented a new,restrictive smoking policy,davis asserts that the policy is not being enforced,and that inmates and corrections officers are still smoking inside.therefore,davis claim for permanent injunctive relief is not moot,and we may consider these issues.
summary judgment 
we review orders granting summary judgment de novo and determine whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see cronin aetna life ins,cir.pursuant to.c,the district court must consider all pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,in determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact.the district court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant.see cronin,at.however,reliance upon conclusory statements or mere allegations is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.see ying jing gan city of new york,cir.e.the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings,and by his or her own affidavits,or by the depositions,answers t
