minerva carrero ojeda carrero says that after she blew the whistle on wrongdoing in her office,her employer and her superiors retaliated against her in myriad ways.they threatened her,unjustly disciplined her,and most relevantly for our purposes deprived her of benefits owed to her under the family and medical leave act fmla,and ultimately fired her.carrero now appeals the district court dismissal of her fmla complaint for failure to state a claim.she also challenges the court failure to grant or,at least,expressly deny her postjudgment request for leave to amend the pleadings.for reasons we explain shortly,we affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b rule b,we take as true the facts alleged in carrero complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor see maloy ballori lage,cir.
a.the facts 
carrero began working for autoridad de energía eléctrica the puerto rico electrical power authority,or prepa in september.at all times relevant to her complaint,carrero held the position of administrative coordinator in prepa aguadilla technical office.víctor ruiz was district engineer of the technical section and carrero immediate supervisor.miguel cordero was prepa executive director.
in august,prepa internal affairs office initiated an investigation of corruption in the aguadilla technical office.carrero supervisor,ruiz,was one of the targets.carrero testified and provided information for the investigation.to get back at her,carrero says,ruiz,in connection and conspiracy with other employees,commenced a pattern of discriminatory acts against her affecting the terms,conditions,benefits,and privileges of her employment.carrero claims t he acts of discriminatory retaliation included denying her job promotions,denying her marginal benefits,submitting her to unjust disciplinary measures,threatening her with dismissal,initiat ing illegal administrative procedures,illegally discharging her from her employment,and violating her rights under the fmla.
specifically,in november,carrero alleges that ruiz commenced an administrative investigation against her for allegedly having photocopied her personnel file without his consent.carrero says this occurred during the period when she was on family leave protected by the fmla for the care of her mother due to a medical procedure she had to undergo.the subsequent investigation led prepa chief human resources officer,alex carvajal to file administrative charges against carrero for violations of prepa rules of conduct and,as well as notes and,on january.carrero does not tell us what these rules prohibit or what the charges stated.from now on,we call them the january charges.
while the january charges were pending,other harassment was underway.for example,in march,prepa labor affairs office refused to pay carrero travel expenses to attend an administrative hearing,though it had always reimbursed her for such travel before.carrero contends that this shows the labor office was in cahoots with ruiz and company.because of the denial,carrero filed an administrative claim before the court of appeals she does not say which one,which ordered a hearing.carrero says prepa did not comply with that court judgment but does not say what the judgment was.
in april,prepa internal affairs office summoned carrero to offer testimony in the corruption investigation of the aguadilla technical office.a few weeks later,ruiz instructed a security guard to withhold a vehicles report from carrero that she usually maintained and that she had planned to give to the investigators.
in june,carrero mother fell and injured herself.carrero requested and was granted leave to care for her.while carrero was away,human resources chief carvajal and two whose roles carrero does not explain promoted three prepa employees to superior positions in the aguadilla technical office without granting carrero the opportunity to interview and knowing she applied for such position.in doing so,carrero says they deprived her of an opportunity for promotion in violation of her fmla rights.in response,carrero filed complaints with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,as well as a grievance with the labor affairs office,none of which were ever resolved.
also while carrero was out on leave,ruiz and two different whose roles carrero likewise does not explain instigated a second administrative investigation of carrero.the ensuing inquiry caused human resources chief carvajal to file a second set of administrative charges against carrero on august,for violations of prepa rules of conduct and.again,carrero does not tell us what these rules prohibit or what the charges stated.we call them the august charges from here on out.in response,carrero filed another complaint with the eeoc against ruiz for violating her fmla rights that was also never resolved.
in september,ruiz tasked carrero with preparing absence letters for employees with unsatisfactory attendance.then,in october,ruiz asked carrero to photocopy the personnel files of every aguadilla technical office employee.carrero complains that both jobs were beneath her managerial status and were better suited to clerical personnel.additionally,she says the assignments amounted to employment harassment because they violated prepa procedures and because she was then under investigation for copying her own personnel file without permission.in response,she filed a union grievance against ruiz,but no resolution was reached.
on january,a hearing officer reviewing the january charges recommended carrero discharge.a few weeks later,an employee acting on ruiz behalf twice attempted to force carrero to receive a copy of the resolution of the charges once at ruiz office and once at carrero office but carrero refused.carrero perceived these attempted deliveries to be acts of intimidation.
in may,ruiz,along with unnamed in prepa labor office,deducted hours and minutes from carrero pay and made her use vacation leave for time spent attending a meeting regarding her eeoc complaints against ruiz and a for violating her fmla rights.later,prepa director of transmission and distribution ordered that carrero be reimbursed for the discounted hours.
on june,though one hearing officer had already recommended carrero termination based on the january charges,cordero then newly appointed as executive director ordered a second hearing on those charges before a different officer.in the meantime,in september,a prepa accounting office employee denied carrero reimbursement request for for travel to san juan for a meeting with the labor affairs office.the office usually paid carrero back promptly for her expenses.
on may,carrero informed cordero by letter that she was a collaborating witness in the internal corruption investigation.shortly thereafter,on june,a second hearing officer recommended carrero discharge based on the january charges.
not much later,on august,carrero again applied for family leave to take care of her sick mother,who was suffering from various serious health conditions which might need emergency treatment and medical care outside and at home.on september,ruiz recommended that carrero request be granted.another employee approved her request that same day,but carrero did not take the leave immediately.
in october,as a result of the administrative investigation of corruption in the aguadilla technical office,the internal affairs office recommended filing charges against ruiz,among others,for embezzlement.thereafter,carrero says she was subject ed to threats and retaliation by ruiz and others under investigation,causing her to fear for her life.
by the middle of october,carrero lawyer received a letter signed by executive director cordero saying that carrero was discharged from her position effective october.carrero lawyer told her about the letter,but carrero herself was not notified by prepa,so she kept working as usual.then,on october,carrero lawyer received a second letter,this time signed by angel rivera another player whose role carrero does not explain on cordero behalf,reiterating that carrero had been discharged but amending the effective date to october.carrero says she did not receive a copy of this letter either.
in the middle of all this,on the night of october,carrero mother fell and injur ed her hip and other parts of her body.the following day,carrero notified ruiz that she needed three months of family leave to take care of her mother and request ed to activate the family leave already approved on september for the time she was going to be absent.carrero does not say whether she in fact missed work to care for her mother that day,but because she says she requested her immediate absence from work after her mother fell,we assume she in fact stopped going to work on october.and because her employment was terminated a few days later,we also assume she did not return to work following this absence,though her complaint does not say so expressly.
on november,a few days after carrero discharge had taken effect carrero lawyer received a letter from prepa labor office stating that prepa would not acknowledge carrero leave activation request.carrero mother passed away on june.carrero says she did not personally receive a letter notifying her of her discharge until july.
travel of the case 
on october,carrero filed a complaint against prepa,ruiz and cordero in their personal and official capacities,and john doe alleging violations of her rights under the fmla,and the puerto rico whistle blower act,as provided by laws ann.tit,and laws ann.tit.
with respect to her fmla claim,carrero said that in october though she qualified for leave,she had given prepa adequate notice that she intended to take leave,and prepa had already approved the leave when she tried to activate the leave,prepa wrongfully denied her the applicable fmla benefits and illegally discharged carrero from her position during the period she was protected by the fmla.by discharging her on october,prepa illegally interfered with,restrained,and denied her the family leave approved on september,and activated on october.there was no justification for discharging her during the period she was under the protection of the fmla,she said,other than to retaliate against her and to deprive her of her right s as part of the pattern of harassment and retaliation she suffered.
on january,defendants filed a motion to dismiss carrero complaint pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.they contended carrero was discharged for disciplinary reasons entirely unrelated to any exercise of her fmla rights.moreover,they argued the fmla did not insulate carrero from adverse employment actions unrelated to her fmla rights.
defendants attached three documents to their motion to dismiss the disciplinary complaint filed against carrero on january,which lays out relevant personnel regulations and details ruiz accusations against her the administrative ruling recommending carrero discharge,dated june,and amended july,and the letter discharging carrero effective october,dated october.carrero had not attached these documents to her complaint,but she did not object to their consideration or challenge their authenticity.rather,she cited the documents in her opposition to the motion to dismiss,saying they serve d to demonstrate the pattern of retaliation perpetuated by defendants.
on june,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.in evaluating the motion,the court considered both carrero complaint and defendants documents.assessing carrero fmla claim,the court found prepa had provided carrero with all required entitlements and discharged her for reasons entirely independent of the fmla,while carrero had fail ed to demonstrate a causal connection between her fmla leave and her discharge.accordingly,the court dismissed carrero fmla claim with prejudice,and,lacking any federal claim upon which to anchor supplemental jurisdiction,dismissed carrero puerto rico law claims without prejudice.
on july,carrero filed a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e rule e.she argued the pleadings adequately supported her allegations that defendants had interfered with her fmla rights.in the alternative,she requested leave to amend the pleadings.the district court denied her motion a few days later.
on august,carrero filed a motion for reconsideration of the order denying her motion.defendants objected because carrero filed the motion without the court leave.the district court denied the motion on august.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
before us,carrero argues the district court erred by finding that her complaint did not state a sufficiently plausible claim for relief to withstand defendants motion to dismiss.in the alternative,she contends the district court abused its discretion by not granting or specifically denying her request for leave to amend the pleadings 
we find carrero arguments unpersuasive.but before we turn to the merits of her claims,we pause to ascertain what materials are properly before us.
configuring the record 
at the stage,our primary focus is on the complaint.see,maloy ballori lage,cir.ordinarily,courts may not consider any documents outside of the complaint,or not expressly incorporated therein,without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.alt.energy,paul fire and marine ins,cir citing watterson page,cir.however,there is a narrow exception for documents the authenticity of which is not challenged that are central to the plaintiff claim or sufficiently referred to in the complaint,even if those documents are not physically attached to the pleading.id.citing watterson,at see also schatz republican state leadership,cir rodi sch.of law,cir beddall state bank trust,cir.
here,when appraising defendants rule b motion,in addition to the complaint,the district court considered three documents submitted by defendants.as a quick refresher,those documents were the january disciplinary complaint filed against carrero the june administrative ruling recommending carrero discharge and the october letter terminating carrero.though carrero had not appended those documents to her complaint,the court said she had ma de explicit reference to them,so it could properly consider them.
it is a close question whether these documents are sufficiently referred to in carrero complaint to warrant consideration at this stage.see alt.energy,at.while carrero mentioned the october letter in her complaint,she did not directly cite the disciplinary complaint or administrative ruling rather,she simply discussed the proceedings memorialized in those documents.
absent any preserved objection by either party,we,like the district court,could choose to regard the documents as part of the pleadings and consider them here.see maloy,at citing watterson,at.but because we find carrero complaint insufficient to surmount defendants motion to dismiss on its own,we feel no need to muddy the waters of our analysis by considering defendants documents.so we move on to the merits,considering carrero complaint alone.
family and medical leave act claims 
carrero main contention on appeal is that her complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to make out a plausible claim for relief under the fmla.accordingly,she says the district court erred by granting defendants motion to dismiss.
standard of review 
we review orders granting motions to dismiss under rule b de novo,applying the same criteria as the district court.schatz,at.our sole inquiry is whether,construing the facts of the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the complaint states a claim for which relief can be granted.ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir citing.b.in other words,we ask whether the complaint contain s sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.rodríguez reyes molina rodríguez,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
we proceed in two steps first,we isolate and ignore statements in the complaint that simply offer legal labels and conclusions or merely rehash elements.schatz,at.second,we take the facts of the complaint as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor,and see if they plausibly narrate a claim for relief.id.
plausible,we have noted,means something more than merely possible.id.and a complaint that pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.ocasio hernández,at quoting ashcroft iqbal.
however,a complaint need not plead facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case,rodríguez reyes,at alteration added,or allege every fact necessary to win at trial,rodríguez vives firefighters corps of,cir,to make out a plausible claim.see also swierkiewicz sorema.the prima facie standard is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading standard,and there is no need to set forth a detailed evidentiary proffer in a complaint.rodríguez reyes,at alteration added.
that said,the elements of a prima face case remain relevant to our plausibility assessment,as t hose elements are part of the background against which a plausibility determination should be made.id.though t here need not be a relationship between any single allegation and a necessary element of the cause of action,reference to the prima facie elements can help a court determine whether the cumulative effect of the complaint factual allegations is a plausible claim for relief.id.at brackets omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
the bottom line is that the combined allegations,taken as true,must state a plausible,not merely conceivable,case for relief.ocasio hernández,at quoting sepúlveda villarini dep t of educ.of,cir souter.having thus described the plausibility bar carrero must overcome,we next provide a basic fmla primer before we consider carrero fmla claims.
fmla primer 
the fmla was enacted to help working women and men balance the competing demands of work and personal life.hodgens dynamics,cir see b.it includes two types of provisions those establishing substantive rights and those providing protection for the exercise of those rights.colburn parker hannifin,cir see.
in terms of substantive rights,the fmla entitles an employee to take twelve weeks of leave during any period for a variety of reasons,including to care for a family member such as a parent with a serious health condition.nagle acton boxbo rough reg l sch,cir hodgens,at citing,inter alia,a c.upon an employee return,her employer must reinstate her to the same or an equivalent position,without any loss of accrued seniority.colburn,at citing,inter alia,a and b.
to protect these rights,the fmla and its accompanying regulations make it unlawful for any employer to,among other things interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of any fmla right,a or retaliate or discriminat e against employees who have used fmla leave,such as by us ing the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as hiring,promotions,or disciplinary actions,c see also a.see colburn,at explaining the origins of and overlap between fmla interference and retaliation claims.
in her complaint,carrero contends that defendants both interfered with and retaliated against her for exercising her fmla rights.we tackle each of her claims in turn,beginning with retaliation for ease of analysis.
retaliation claim 
carrero first alleges that defendants impermissibly retaliated against her for exercising her fmla rights when they fired her while she was under the protection of the fmla in october.she says her termination represented the culmination of a pattern of discriminatory acts by defendants that began after she started helping with the internal corruption investigation in august.to the extent that defendants other acts of mistreatment coincided with or followed carrero use of family leave,carrero says those acts amounted to fmla retaliation as well.
as we pointed out above,the fmla forbids an employer from retaliating against an employee for exercising her fmla rights.henry united bank,cir citing a.thus,for example,an employer may not use an employee fmla leave as a negative factor in deciding to hire,fire,promote,or provide benefits to an employee.c see henry,at.however,while an employee may not be penalized for exercising her rights under the statute,an employee may nevertheless be discharged,not promoted,or denied benefits for independent reasons during or after her taking of fmla leave.see henry,at citing nagle,at finding that employee was discharged for independent reasons.in an fmla retaliation case,the employer intent,why the employer fired or acted against the employee matters.hodgens,at.
to make out a prima facie case of fmla retaliation,an employee must show she availed herself of a protected fmla right she was adversely affected by an employment decision and there was a causal connection between her protected conduct and the adverse employment action.see orta castro merck,sharp dohme química,cir.though,as we set out above,a plaintiff need not plead facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case at the pleading stage,the elements of a prima facie case are useful as a prism to shed light upon the plausibility of a plaintiff claim.rodríguez reyes,at.we view carrero retaliation claims through that lens now,asking whether she has pleaded enough facts in toto to make entitlement to relief plausible in light of the prima facie standard that will pertain at trial.see id.
carrero primary claim is that defendants retaliated against her for exercising her fmla rights when they discharged her after she attempted to take fmla leave in october.we assume for the sake of argument that this claim meets the first two prongs of the prima facie test first,she availed herself of her fmla rights when she took family leave in november and june,and again when she attempted to activate leave in october that was approved in september.second,she was adversely affected by her termination effective october.
however,as to the third prong,carrero offers too little to connect her taking of fmla leave and her termination to push her claim across the plausibility threshold.applying our plausibility analysis,we first set aside carrero conclusory statement that there was no justification for discharging her during the period she was under the protection of the fmla,other than to retaliate against her as part of the pattern of harassment and retaliation she suffered.see schatz,at.calling her discharge fmla retaliation does not make it so.indeed,to the extent the actions about which she complains could be seen as retaliatory,carrero participation in the internal corruption investigation offers a more likely explanation.
next,we look to the facts carrero puts forth,taking them as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.see id.carrero says she was fired during the effectiveness of her fmla leave.she appears to assume that the chronological overlap between her termination and her leave renders the causal connection between the two actions obvious.but while temporal proximity is one factor from which an employer bad motive can be inferred,by itself,it is not enough especially if the surrounding circumstances undermine any claim of causation.see wright compusa,cir finding plaintiff established prima facie case of retaliation under the americans with disabilities act but noting that chronological proximity does not by itself establish causality,particularly if the larger picture undercuts any claim of causation brackets omitted internal quotation marks omitted hodgens,at t emporal proximity may give rise to a suggestion of retaliation,but that suggestion is not necessarily conclusive.brackets omitted citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
carrero gives us no facts beyond the timing of her discharge e,no negative comments,complaints,or expressions of reluctance by her superiors or about her fmla,no discussion of her fmla leave status in performance reviews,that would lead us to think that defendants took her fmla requests or leave status into account when deciding to discharge her.compare hodgens,at finding plaintiff sufficiently showed causal connection between his and his termination where his supervisor warned him he was taking too much time off shortly after he took leave,his performance evaluation advised him to make every effort to have his absenteeism fall within company guidelines,and his employer decided which employees to lay off based on a ranking that considered plaintiff absence rate,with donald sybra,cir finding temporal proximity plus supervisor single negative comment did not establish employer bad motive at summary judgment stage.
instead,carrero complaint provides us with another explanation for defendants decision to terminate her at that time after an investigation of carrero for alleged misconduct,two different officers recommended her termination after two separate hearings,and executive director cordero decided to follow their advice in october whether the investigation was or instead part of a desire to get rid of carrero,the key point is that both the investigation and the alleged animus carrero october attempt to take fmla leave.in this respect,the bulk of the allegations in the complaint relate to her fmla claim only in that they provide a detailed explanation of why she was fired,rightly or wrongly,and cut directly against any conclusion that her firing was related to activity.consequently,considering,as we must,the cumulative effect of the complaint factual allegations,see rodríguez reyes,at,and the larger picture surrounding her discharge,see wright,at,we can not find that carrero complaint plausibly supports a finding that her termination was causally connected to her requests for fmla leave.
carrero also claims that other adverse actions by defendants constituted impermissible fmla retaliation insomuch as they coincided with or followed her use of family leave.for example,in november and june,ruiz initiated misconduct investigations of carrero while carrero was out on family leave.also,while carrero was out on leave in june,carvajal promoted three of carrero without giving carrero an opportunity to interview.
however,even assuming arguendo that this claim meets the first two prongs of the prima facie inquiry,carrero has not put forth sufficient facts to demonstrate a causal connection between her fmla and defendants acts to establish a plausible claim for relief.again,beyond synchronicity,carrero makes no connection between those acts and her.
as for ruiz opening of misconduct investigations,carrero explicitly says ruiz acted as he did because of her participation in the internal corruption investigation.she neither disclaims nor admits any misconduct on her part,and she does not say the accusations were unfounded she simply says ruiz began the investigations during the period when she was on family leave protected by the fmla.again,an employer can take adverse action against an employee while she is on leave for reasons other than her leave status.see henry,at citing nagle,at.thus,this allegation alone,without more,is not enough to support a plausible claim.
as for carvajal promotion of carrero,carrero says only that these actions affected her right to a promotion while protected by the fmla.carrero has no greater or lesser right to promotion by virtue of her status.see a an employee has no greater right to benefits or conditions of employment because she takes fmla leave.c e mployers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as promotions.though carrero says she applied for the open positions and was not given a chance to interview,she asserts no factual allegation as to why her fmla leave had any bearing on carvajal decision not to interview her or award her the position.see orta castro,at finding no proof that defendants took plaintiff absences into account in denying her a higher position,even where plaintiff alleged an unidentified human resources representative told her she was not given the position because of her absenteeism,and affirming dismissal of plaintiff claim.
considering carrero factual allegations as a whole,we again can not say she has stated a plausible claim of fmla retaliation based on defendants adverse actions.as a result,the district court rightly found carrero had not alleged a sufficiently plausible retaliation claim to withstand defendants rule b motion to dismiss.so we journey on.
interference claim 
carrero also says defendants interfered with her fmla rights by terminating her employment while she was out on leave to care for her sick mother.
as we set forth above,the fmla makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of any right.a.we recall that the fmla entitles an employee to twelve weeks leave per year for listed family and medical reasons,such as to care for a parent with a serious health condition.nagle,at hodgens,at citing,inter alia,a c.however,i f an employee is laid off during the course of taking fmla leave and her employment is terminated,the employer responsibility to continue fmla leave,maintain benefits,and restore the employee cease at the time the employee is laid off.a.we remember,of course,that an employer can not discharge an employee because she requests or takes fmla leave,see c,but we dealt with this concern with respect to carrero retaliation claim.
to withstand a motion to dismiss on her interference claim,a plaintiff need only plausibly state that she is entitled to the disputed leave.see coburn,at describing summary judgment standard unlike in a retaliation claim,no showing as to employer intent is required.id.the key issue is simply whether the employer provided its employee the benefits to which she was entitled per the fmla.hodgens,at.
in her complaint,carrero does not assert that defendants wrongfully denied her requests for fmla leave.to the contrary,she says prepa permitted her to take fmla leave both in november and june.ruiz also approved her third fmla leave request in september.instead,carrero says defendants interfered with her fmla rights by terminating her employment once she activated her third leave in october,rather than permitting her to take the three months leave she requested.
carrero admits her lawyer was notified of her discharge originally effective october but amended to october by the middle of october.she claims she was not informed of her termination at that time.rather,she insists that she remained employed when she properly triggered her previously approved fmla leave on october,was entitled to that leave,and was protected by the law at the time she was illegally discharged from her employment.
however,the fmla does not protect an employee from discharge for any reason while she is on leave rather,as we discussed in the retaliation context,it protects her only from discharge because she requests or takes fmla leave.see c.thus,while carrero may have had a claim for leave prior to october,once her discharge took effect,carrero was no longer entitled to fmla leave benefits see a.as a result,she can not state a plausible fmla interference claim,and the district court correctly granted defendants rule b motion to dismiss on this ground as well.
motion to amend the pleadings 
in a effort to save her fmla claims,carrero argues the district court abused its discretion by not granting or explicitly denying her request to amend the pleadings.carrero asked for leave to amend the pleadings as alternative relief in her motion to alter or amend judgment under rule e.the district court did not address carrero amendpleadings request separately from her request rather,it denied the motion altogether,saying only that carrero ha d not demonstrated a clear error of law,a change in the law,or new evidence that she could not have presented previously.
we review the district court denial of relief under rule e for abuse of discretion,mindful that the court enjoys considerable discretion in this area.soto padro pub.bldgs,cir see also markel am.ins.díaz santiago,cir.rule e permits a party to move to alter or amend judgment within days of entry of judgment.e.we generally recognize three valid grounds for rule e relief an intervening change in the controlling law,a clear legal error,or evidence.soto padro,at.
requests to amend the pleadings,on the other hand,are generally governed by federal rule of civil procedure a rule a fisher kadant,cir.rule a says that t he court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a.if,however,a motion
