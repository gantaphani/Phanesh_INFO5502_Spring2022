plaintiff appellant aaron willey alleges that,while incarcerated in new york,he endured a cruel campaign of harassment at the hands of corrections officers in retaliation for his refusal to provide false information against another inmate.the course of retaliatory conduct he alleges included smaller indignities like frequent harassment and a week worth of meals that were nutritionally inadequate.but willey also alleges that he was on three occasions exposed to unsanitary conditions of confinement in violation of the eighth amendment.the most grotesque exposure willey alleges is that officers placed him in solitary confinement with a plexiglas shield restricting the airflow to his small cell and then incapacitated his toilet,so that he was reduced to breathing a miasma of his own accumulating waste.the two other alleged exposures to unsanitary conditions involved willey detention in an observation cell whose walls and mattress were smeared with feces and stained with urine.willey alleges further retaliatory conduct including theft of his legal documents,malicious prosecution,and false imprisonment.
willey proceeded pro se below,naming as defendants several corrections officers and their supervisors at the wende correctional facility,in alden,new york,where willey was incarcerated during the events alleged in his complaint.when these defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,the district court siragusa,denied the motion in its entirety.several years later,the district court telesca,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,deciding in sum and substance that willey amended complaint failed to state a claim.the district court grant of summary judgment in part on grounds not raised by the movants,without notice to willey or an opportunity for him to respond,conflicts with rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.as to those grounds that were raised by the defendants,the district court conclusion that willey complaint failed to state a claim rested on an erroneous legal foundation.
in this opinion,we first reiterate the proper standard for granting summary judgment on grounds not raised by the movant,which was not met here.second,we clarify the standard for a claim for unconstitutional retaliation.third,we disagree with the district court analysis of willey claim for unsanitary conditions.fourth,we revive willey claims for nutritionally inadequate meals,theft of legal documents,harassment,malicious prosecution,and false imprisonment.finally,we suggest to the district court that on remand willey receive appointed counsel,an opportunity to take further discovery,and leave to file a second amended complaint.
background 
willey complaint 
this summary of the relevant factual background we draw principally from the allegations in willey complaint,because,as we will explore further,the defendants motion for summary judgment rested entirely on the legal sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint and not on any evidence.willey,pro se,filed his original typewritten complaint on august,and filed his handwritten amended complaint on april.because they are substantively identical,with one exception discussed below,this recitation cites to allegations in the original complaint,all of which appear also in the amended complaint.compare,with am.
beginning at age,willey was incarcerated at the wende correctional facility in alden,new york,from april until october,although during this period he was housed for five months at the central new york psychiatric facility.the events giving rise to this suit all occurred at wende,and the defendants are wende corrections officers,hearing officers,and their supervisors who were employed there during willey incarceration.willey alleges that,on october,he was approached on his way to evening recreation by sergeant scott lambert,who stopped willey and requested identification.corrections officer taylor roberts then performed a pat frisk of willey,which uncovered nothing unusual.nevertheless,roberts handcuffed willey and escorted him into a room with no cameras or witnesses present.j.in this room,willey alleges,the following took place 
i was questioned by defendant lambert about another prisoner who was supposedly smuggling drugs into the prison.i explained that i had no knowledge or recollection of involvement with this person,nor did i even know who this person was.defendant lambert then opened a desk drawer and pulled out what appeared to be a weapon or piece of metal.defendant lambert placed this piece of metal on the desk between us,and threatened me by stating,either you work with us as an informant or you are going to be charged with a weapon.at this time i stopped talking completely,to which defendant lambert responded,have it your way.corrections officers then took me to the wcf special housing unit solitary confinement where i was in fact falsely imprisoned.
two days later,on october,willey was issued a false misbehavior report alleging false charges that he was in possession of a.id.at a hearing held on october,willey was adjudged guilty of the charge,but he alleges that he was never told that the hearing was to occur nor provided with the opportunity to attend or to present witnesses or evidence.willey appealed internally to the statewide special housing unit director in albany,donald selsky,who reversed the finding of guilt and ordered a new hearing.at the new hearing,willey was allowed to appear,but the hearing officer martain kerney allegedly threatened to beat willey and called him a young punk.id.at.kerney eventually ejected willey and found him guilty in absentia,sentencing him on december,principally to days of solitary confinement also known as special housing unit or the.willey filed another appeal with selsky.
with his appeal pending,willey remained in solitary confinement.willey alleges that he was continuously harassed psychologically,emotionally,verbally,and sexually by corrections officers but particularly by defendant allessandro.id.at.this conduct included,while watching willey shower,sergeant allessandro licking his lips and blowing kisses toward willey.id.just over a month into his time in solitary confinement,on november,willey alleges that he was escorted by allessandro and corrections officer sztuk to the shower,and upon willey return found his cell trashed,toilet flooded,water all over legal paperwork,books,personal letters scattered all over and out of their original places.id.at.that evening,willey asked sztuk for a search contraband slip to document what happened,to which sztuk responded by threatening willey with worse punishments if he persisted.
willey also allegedly learned from other inmates confined near his cell that they had seen sztuk removing willey rolled up legal paperwork.id.at.willey then shouted that he wanted to speak to a supervisor,to which allessandro replied that willey should give it a rest or he would soon be moved to the restricted side of solitary.i not giving it a rest you people stole my legal paperwork,answered willey.id.sztuk then responded,what that willey,you said you are going to shit us down,prison argot for throwing feces or urine at a corrections officer.id.willey denied having made the threat.
because allessandro and sztuk said that willey made this threat against them,he was moved to the restricted side of solitary,and a plexiglas cell shield was placed over the bars,preventing air circulation.in willey complaint,he alleges 
for the entire duration of time i was behind the cell shields,defendant allessandro subjected me to various forms of harassment including turning off my toilet water pressure,so that i could flush my toilet,thereby forcing me to stay in a cell with restricted air circulation and breathe in odors.at all times mentioned defendant jeff jeszorski was the acting sergeant supervising defendants allessandro,sztuk,and overhuff,and allowed them to harass plaintiff,and abdicated his legal duty to stop and prevent defendants from harassing plaintiff defendant jeff jeszorski also participated in harassing plaintiff.
id.at citation omitted.
sztuk issued willey an allegedly false misbehavior report,on november,which stated that sztuk had read willey lips and that willey had mouthed a threat to throw his waste at sztuk.after a hearing at which willey testified and sztuk,willey was found guilty and sentenced principally to days of solitary confinement.willey once again filed an appeal with selsky.
on december,corrections officer overhuff approached willey cell after dinner.willey alleges 
i placed my cups,tray,and utensils on the port so defendant overhuff could see i was turning everything in this was my usual practice.however,defendant overhuff purposely with intent to harass and annoy plaintiff refused to take my garbage.on december,i was issued a false misbehavior report written by defendant overhuff alleging i refused to turn in my garbage on december.
id.at.for the week before the hearing on this misbehavior report,deputy superintendent of security monahan placed willey on a restricted diet that,willey alleges,was most definitely cruel and unusual punishment as per it consists of nothing more than a loaf of bread usually stale and cabbage.id.at.
at the hearing for this misbehavior report on january,hearing officer tom schoellkopfl allegedly refused to permit willey to question a witness and then removed willey from the hearing.schoellkopfl then allegedly told willey,you are going to die in the you young punk.id.at.schoellkopfl found willey guilty and sentenced him on january,principally to days of solitary confinement.as he had with each previous finding of guilt,willey filed an administrative appeal with selsky.
willey left solitary confinement on february,
all of the harassments that i was being subjected to resulted in my becoming severely depressed and attempting suicide by swallowing numerous ibuprofen pills i was taken via ambulance to erie county medical center.while inside the ambulance,i was strapped down to a gurney,handcuffed,and shackled.someone inserted a needle into my arm and someone placed a gas mask over my face.from this point forward i do remember anything until i woke up strapped to a bed in ecmc.
id.at.willey alleges that,before suffering the cruelty of wende officers,he had no significant issues and was not taking any medication.id.he attributes to the officers conduct a significant amount of his problems.id.
when willey returned from the hospital to wende,he was placed into a observation cell that was extremely filthy and smelled of.id.willey remained naked in the observation cell for days before he was transferred to the central new york state psychiatric center for about five months.id.when he returned to wende,on july,willey was once again placed into an extremely dirty observation cell,which had urine stains on the floor and fecal stains on the walls and mattress.the smell in the cell was extremely bad.id.at.willey remained there until august,when he was sent back to solitary confinement.
the final misbehavior report issued to willey was served the next day and alleged that he had kicked a corrections officer while in handcuffs and feet restraints on february,while he was being returned to wende from the hospital.id.following a hearing,schoellkopfl found willey guilty and sentenced him principally to days of solitary confinement.willey once again appealed to selsky.
willey sent a letter to wende superintendent robert kirkpatrick on september,which related willey belief that he had been falsely charged and unfairly sentenced to solitary confinement and also requested his release to the general population within wende.by letter dated october,kirkpatrick declined to take action.willey also filed with the attorney general of the state of new york a notice of intention to file a claim,see.cl.act,concerning willey treatment in custody.finally,on october,willey was transferred from wende to the attica correctional facility.
many of the administrative appeals that willey filed with selsky met with success.in addition to his first appeal,already mentioned,which prevailed on procedural grounds,willey appeal from his conviction for possession of the shank was also successful selsky reversed that conviction on february.that same day,selsky also reversed the conviction related to collection.these decisions arrived a few weeks after willey attempted suicide.selsky did affirm,on february,the conviction for willey threatening to throw feces or urine at sztuk.selsky also affirmed,on december,the conviction for willey kicking an officer,although selsky halved the sentence from six months of punishment to three months.willey served this sentence at attica.
willey learned,on november,after his transfer to attica,that he had been criminally charged in alden town court for the same alleged conduct possessing a shank for which he was originally punished with solitary confinement and on which he prevailed in his first two administrative appeals.the criminal charge was allegedly supported by a deposition from roberts attesting that willey had possessed the shank at wende.willey again denied having ever possessed a shank,both in person and in a lengthy letter to the presiding judge,justice laduca,who dismissed the criminal charges on april.
ii.proceedings below 
all these alleged facts appeared in willey complaint,which the defendants moved to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court siragusa,denied the motion in its entirety,finding that willey allegations stated viable claims and that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.see,decision and order,willey kirkpatrick et,cv.the district court noted that,although false misbehavior reports generally do not give rise to a claim under,they do when combined with a deprivation of due process at the resulting hearing or when done in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right.the district court observed that it is unclear whether there is a constitutional right not to snitch.id.at.
the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge for matters.id.at.the defendants answered on october,denying all of the complaint allegations and admitting only that they were employed at wende in.willey moved for partial summary judgment on january.this motion was denied sua sponte by the district court without prejudice to its reassertion after discovery concluded.willey,with leave from the district court,filed his amended complaint on april,and the defendants filed an identical answer on june.the defendants answered interrogatories but were not deposed.the defendants moved for summary judgment on february.willey opposed that motion and moved for appointment of counsel on march.the district court denied willey motion for appointment of counsel on may.with the motion for summary judgment fully briefed,judge siragusa ordered the case transferred to judge telesca on january.eleven days later,judge telesca granted summary judgment to the defendants in a page decision,the decision from which willey takes this appeal.see,decision and order,willey kirkpatrick et,cv.
the defendants rule statement in support of their motion for summary judgment was unusual,spanning only ten paragraphs of facts about which,they contended,there is no genuine issue to be tried.the first two paragraphs of the rule statement recited that willey was incarcerated at wende and that the defendants worked there.the next seven paragraphs recounted some of the allegations willey made in his complaint,and the final paragraph noted that the defendants denied all the claims in their answer.see id.at.the defendants attached as evidence only willey certified inmate record.see id.at.
the defendants brief in support of their motion for summary judgment was similarly unorthodox.in its telling,the defendants 
move d for summary judgment on a variety of grounds that the plaintiff has nothing more than his own subjective belief that he has been subjected to unlawful harassment stemming from false misbehavior reports,and that the alleged incidents do not amount to a legally cognizable claim upon which relief can be granted as a matter of law.
id.at.in keeping with this framing,the brief argued that various of the claims in willey complaint were legally insufficient,claim s against defendants lambert and roberts fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as a matter of law.id.at.the defendants brief characterized the claims in willey complaint as seeking redress for being placed in mechanical restraints being ejected from a hearing having his cell trash ed and property stolen and being confined behind cell shields,being issued false misbehavior reports,and receiving inadequate nutrition.see id.at.the defendants also urged that respondeat superior was an insufficient basis on which to sustain a constitutional claim against superintendent kirkpatrick.see id.at.
willey opposed the motion with an document that contained both legal arguments and factual averrals.he styled the document as a declaration,writing,i,aaron willey,do hereby declare under penalty of perjury that all of the foregoing information is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.id.at.willey declaration pointed out that the defendants brief covered only some of his claims,stating that there are other events not described by the defendants that constituted violations of the plaintiff constitutional rights,including malicious prosecution and unsanitary conditions of confinement.id.at.
the district court february,decision and order telesca,from which this appeal is taken,began with a recitation of facts drawn from the pleadings and discovery documents on file,and viewed in the light most favorable to willey.id.at.the decision recounted five principal incidents alleged in the complaint the october misbehavior report for possessing a weapon and the resulting solitary confinement the november misbehavior report for threatening to attack officers with human waste and the resulting cell shields and water the december misbehavior report for refusing to turn in a food tray and the resulting restricted diet the harassment in solitary confinement and the resulting suicide attempt and confinements in the observation cells and the august misbehavior report for kicking an officer.see id.at.
in its analysis,the district court first noted that to maintain an actionable claim against correction s officers for filing a false misbehavior report,the inmate must be able to show either that he was disciplined without adequate due process as a result of the report or that the report was issued in retaliation for exercising a constitutionally protected right.id.at.the district court analyzed only the first of these options,stating,willey ha d not alleged that the misbehavior reports were issued in retaliation for his exercise of a constitutionally protected right.id.at.the district court reasoned that although willey exclusion from the disciplinary hearing was violative of willey state regulatory rights,his federal constitutional rights were not violated thereby.id.at.
turning to the alleged destruction of willey property,including legal documents,the district court stated that even the intentional destruction of an inmate property by a prison officer does not violate the due process clause if the state provides that inmate with an adequate remedy.id.accordingly,willey claim that sztuk and allessandro stole legal documents from his cell,and destroyed his personal property failed to state an actionable constitutional claim because new york state law provides him with an adequate remedy,of the court of claims act.id.at.regarding the claim of harassment,the district court reasoned that because willey did not allege uninvited physical or sexual contact by allessandro,his annoying conduct and comments,unaccompanied by physical threats or attacks,do not amount to a constitutional violation.id.at.
the district court then analyzed willey claim for unsanitary conditions of confinement,notwithstanding that the defendants failed to address it in their motion for summary judgment.id.canvassing our precedents and those of sister circuits,the district court discerned a circuit split w here an inmate exposure to waste lasts for three or four days.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found willey allegations insufficient 
especially because willey has adequately pleaded maliciously willful conduct by allessandro,rather than mere negligence,the alleged of the running water to willey toilet for several days places this case on the borderline between the levels of discomfort to be expected in prison and unacceptable,inhumane conditions.after reviewing the cases cited above,however,the court concludes that on the particular facts presented here,willey claim can not withstand summary judgment.first,willey is vague as to the dates that the alleged shutoff occurred,and has made conflicting allegations about the duration extensive lengths of time versus seven days versus the time between december,and january.second,willey has not claimed that human waste from his toilet overflowed into his cell.third,willey has not claimed that he suffered sickness or other ill effects as a result of the malodorous atmosphere caused by the water.
id.at citations omitted.
finally,the district court also found insufficient willey claim for inadequate nutrition while placed on a restricted diet for one week by monahan.courts in this circuit routinely have dismissed claims similar to willey,finding that the inmate failed to establish that he experienced a sufficiently serious deprivation for purposes of the eighth amendment.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed willey amended complaint in its entirety.this appeal timely followed.
discussion 
standard of review and summary judgment 
our standards of review are familiar.we review de novo a dismissal under rule b for failure to state a claim,and we must reverse if the complaint contains sufficient factual matter that,accepted as true,states a plausible claim for relief.see cruz td bank,cir.we employ the same standard of review for a judgment on the pleadings under rule c.see hayden paterson,cir.and we review de novo a grant of summary judgment under rule,construing all evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see ruggiero cty.of orange,cir.we affirm summary judgment only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.because willey was pro se below,we must interpret his papers liberally to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.burgos hopkins,cir see also.e.
the parties disagree about the standard we should use to review the decision below.willey,who is counseled on appeal,argues that we should review the decision as having been made under rule b or rule c because it essentially accepted the facts as alleged in willey complaint,and dismissed each claim for failure to state a claim based on those allegations.appellant br.the defendants,by contrast,urge us to review the decision as a routine grant of summary judgment.the fact that the district court found that certain of plaintiff allegations,even with evidentiary support,failed to state viable claims at all does not alter the procedural context of the court order a duly interposed motion for summary judgment by defendants appellees br.
it is true,as willey contends,that the district court decision rested entirely on its view that willey complaint failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.without engaging in any consideration of facts produced by the limited discovery in this case,the district court nominally granted summary judgment under rule but was in effect granting judgment as a matter of law on the pleadings under rule c.johnson pelker,f d,cir without expressly saying so,the district court by granting summary judgment,effectively on the pleadings,treated the motion as one to dismiss under rule b.but the distinction is immaterial to our standard of review,which we conduct de novo in either case,and we see no reason why legal issues may not be decided at summary judgment.
but a grant of summary judgment must comport with the federal rules of civil procedure.rule does permit a sua sponte grant of summary judgment dismissing a claim but only under certain conditions.entitled judgment independent of the motion,rule f permits a district court to grant summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party.f.but a district court may do so only a fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond.f.because the district court did not provide willey with notice that it would consider grounds not raised in the defendants brief in support of their motion,we must vacate the judgment to the extent that it exceeded the grounds raised in that motion.
the motion was threadbare.the district court itself acknowledged that it was providing more to the defendants than their motion sought,writing that the defendants failed to address this claim in their motion for summary judgment.for this reason alone,we would reinstate willey claim for unsanitary conditions of confinement.some of the claims that the defendants did cursorily address in their motion were nevertheless decided by the district court on grounds not raised in the motion.to do so without notice and an opportunity to respond runs counter to rule f.
the defendants did address,for example,willey claim for theft of his legal documents,but their only argument was a non sequitur willey alleges no facts tending to show that,in an ordinary random cell search,property is not seized and cells are not turned upside down and inside out.the district court wisely declined to dismiss willey claim on that reasoning.instead,the district court held that there could be no claim even for intentional deprivation of property where the state provides an adequate remedy,here,section of the new york court of claims act.even if it were true that this generic law provides an adequate remedy for the theft of legal documents,the district court erred in granting summary judgment on that claim,without notice to willey or an opportunity for him to respond,on grounds that appeared nowhere in the defendants moving papers.
accordingly,we can not affirm the judgment of the district court as to those parts of its decision that rested on grounds not raised by the defendants.those parts include the claim for unsanitary conditions,the claim for theft of legal documents,and the claim for harassment.see.they also include willey claims for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment,which went unmentioned both in the motion and the decision,and which we discuss further below.this conclusion does not end our discussion,because we identify a number of critical legal errors,which the district court,we respectfully conclude,committed in analyzing the sufficiency of several of willey allegations.
ii.retaliation 
the first of the many allegedly false misbehavior reports that willey received charged him with possession of a shank.in general,a prison inmate has no constitutionally guaranteed immunity from being falsely or wrongly accused of conduct which may result in the deprivation of a protected liberty interest.freeman rideout,cir.the district court correctly noted two exceptions to this rule when an inmate is able to show either that he was disciplined without adequate due process as a result of the report or that the report was issued in retaliation for exercising a constitutionally protected right.citing freeman,at,and franco kelly,cir.the district court analyzed only the first of these exceptions,reasoning that willey has not alleged that the misbehavior reports were issued in retaliation for his exercise of a constitutionally protected right.id.at.
in considering whether willey received adequate due process,the district court noted that in new york an inmate has the right to be present at the hearing unless he refuses to attend,or is excluded for reason of institutional safety or correctional goals.id.quoting,tit,a.accordingly,it was violative of willey state regulatory rights to be excluded from the hearings from which he was ejected or of which he was not informed.but a claim under state law does not necessarily provide a viable due process claim under.id.at.the district court stated that willey right to be personally present at the hearing was not guaranteed by the constitution.id.citing wolff mcdonnell.
our reading of wolff does not comport with the conclusion that the constitution permits wholesale exclusion of an inmate from a disciplinary hearing.the plaintiffs in wolff brought a fourteenth amendment challenge to nebraska process.the supreme court sought an accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the constitution that are of general application,rejecting nebraska argument that the interest of prisoners in disciplinary procedures is not included in that liberty protected by the fourteenth amendment.wolff,at.accordingly,serious prison discipline like willey punishment in solitary confinement must meet the minimum requirements of procedural due process appropriate for the circumstances.id.at.
the supreme court elaborated that among those requirements are advance written notice of the claimed violation and a written statement of the factfinders as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.id.at.additionally,the inmate facing disciplinary proceedings should be allowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.id.at.yet the court declined to require the full panoply of procedural protections prescribed for parole revocation by morrissey brewer.specifically,wolff declined to extend to internal hearings the rights of confrontation and,which present greater hazards to institutional interests.at.the court was particularly sensitive to the possible harm that could result from permitting of an,acknowledging that the risks of guards may be less.id.at.the court thus declined to require prisons to permit at the present time,leaving open the possibility that p erhaps as the problems of penal institutions change and correctional goals are reshaped,the balance of interests involved will require otherwise.id.at.
even assuming that the last forty years have not altered this balance to require that an inmate has the right to guards who accuse that inmate of misconduct,we read willey claim to concern those rights that wolff did establish.indeed,willey first administrative appeal prevailed because wende failed to afford him his right to advance written notice of the claimed violation,id.at,and his complaint alleges,i was never informed that a hearing was taking place or ever asked if i wanted to attend.willey further alleges 
in this situation i was never given the opportunity to appear at the tier hearing,or call witnesses,or present rebuttal evidence,nor was i ever made aware that any hearing was being commenced.in addition i was not given a written disposition by the fact finders as to the evidence relied upon for their decision.
these alleged procedural infirmities are,if true,repugnant not only to new york regulations but also to the due process clause as construed by wolff.and although not specifically mentioned in wolff,the threats of physical abuse or new criminal charges allegedly made by hearing officers to willey in an effort to induce him to plead guilty,see id.at,are incompatible with any notion of due process.furthermore,willey ejection from several hearings may be actionable to the extent that it implicates his right to call witnesses and present evidence rather than any right to.the district court conflated these distinct concepts in characterizing willey complaint as alleging a violation of the right to be personally present.id.at.nevertheless,we do not conclude on this record that willey procedural rights were infringed or address whether the administrative appeals process with which he eventually found some success adequately cured any infringements.
an error of omission also affected the district court grant of summary judgment on willey claim for retaliation.the district court acknowledged that a false misbehavior report was actionable if done in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutional right but concluded,without elaboration,that willey has not alleged that the misbehavior reports were issued in retaliation for his exercise of a constitutionally protected right.id.at.this analytical leap is somewhat surprising in light of the previous district judge decision on the motion to dismiss,which noted that it is unclear whether there is a constitutional right not to snitch.id.at.the previous district judge correctly noted that we have previously left unresolved the question of whether such a right the right to not become an informant exists.see allah juchnewioz,cv,wl,at july,holding that the plaintiff claimed conduct his refusal to snitch when asked in the presence of other inmates is protected,aff on other grounds sub nom.allah juchenwioz,app x,cir declining to reach question of whether a prisoner enjoys a constitutional right not to become an informant.
construing willey complaint in its most favorable light,it alleges that the first misbehavior report for possessing a weapon was issued to him in direct retaliation for his refusal to provide false information to roberts and lambert about an inmate whom willey did not know.see.the only inference we need draw to reach this conclusion is that willey was telling the truth when he said he knew nothing about the alleged smuggler of contraband and that the officers pressed him to tell them what they wanted to hear notwithstanding willey actual lack of knowledge.
was this refusal constitutionally protected in the context of deciding whether substantive due process protects a right that is deeply rooted in our traditions,the supreme court has counseled that we should analyze the most specific level at which the asserted right can be identified,michael gerald,plurality opinion,and we have said that the first step is to identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed,pabon wright,cir quoting albright oliver.although the intransitive verb to snitch does not yet merit a mention in black law dictionary,we understand it to signify the act of providing information to a person in authority about another wrongdoing.snitching carries a connotation,if not the denotation,of providing truthful information that inculpates the wrongdoer.accordingly,we think that the right not to snitch,as the previous district court judge labeled it,perhaps misconstrues but certainly fails to identify at its most specific level the right willey allegedly exercised in refusing to tell officers the lies he claims they wanted to hear about his knowledge of a suspected smuggler activities.
on appeal,willey urges that his right to refuse to perjure himself or give false information about another and to testify truthfully,if he testified,is constitutionally protected.appellants br.but it may be that the most specific level at which to identify the putative right protecting willey refusal is the right of an inmate to refuse to provide false information to a corrections officer.jackler byrne,cir identifying as protected by the first amendment a citizen right to reject governmental efforts to require him to make statements he believes are false.in any event,the existence of that specific right is inadequately presented by the briefing,so we decline to resolve it.whether such a right exists under the first,fifth,eighth,or fourteenth amendments,and whether it was not clearly established such that officers who may have violated it should be entitled to qualified immunity,are questions we leave to the district court to decide in the first instance.
iii.unsanitary conditions of confinement 
willey alleged three periods of confinement in unsanitary conditions in solitary confinement with a cell encapsulated by a plexiglas cell shield in a observation cell where he was left naked for two weeks in february and again in another observation cell from july to august.the district court discussed only the first of these in its decision granting summary judgment.the district court found this allegation insufficient for three reasons willey is vague as to the dates that the alleged occurred,and has made conflicting allegations about the duration,from seven days to about seven weeks,willey has not claimed that human waste from his toilet overflowed into his cell,and willey has not claimed that he suffered sickness or other ill effects as a result of the malodorous atmosphere caused by the water.
we reject this constrained conception of the eighth amendment protections against unsanitary conditions of confinement.a brief tour of the applicable case law,as ably canvassed by the district court,will aid our discussion.the eighth amendment does not mandate comfortable prisons,rhodes chapman,but prisons nevertheless must provide humane conditions of confinement,farmer brennan.a claim under for violations of the eighth amendment requires an objectively,sufficiently serious denial of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities and a sufficiently culpable state of mind on the part of the responsible official.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
our most recent opinion in this area is gaston coughlin,cir,which reinstated an inmate eighth amendment claim for exposure to human waste.in that case,the plaintiff had alleged that on several days the area directly in front of his cell was filled with human feces,urine,and sewage water.id.at.the district court found that these conditions were neither severe nor protracted enough to rise to the level of an eighth amendment violation,but we reversed because we were unwilling to adopt as a matter of law the principle that it is not cruel and unusual punishment for prison officials knowingly to allow an area to remain filled with sewage and excrement for days on end.id.at.
this sentiment was in keeping with our decision from a generation earlier,lareau macdougall,cir.there,an inmate spent five days in a cell whose toilet was a hole in the floor,which could be flushed only from outside the cell.causing a man to live,eat and perhaps sleep in close confines with his own human waste is too debasing and degrading to be permitted.the indecent conditions that existed in this cell seriously threatened the physical and mental soundness of its unfortunate occupant.id.at.and even before lareau,we found an eighth amendment violation in part because the cell in which the plaintiff was confined for a month was fetid and reeking from the stench of the bodily wastes of previous occupants which covered the floor,the sink,and the toilet.wright mcmann,cir.
our sister circuits are broadly in accord.see,mcbride deer,cir vacating in part dismissal where the plaintiff alleged that he was forced to live in squalor more specifically,a cell for three days sperow melvin,wl,at cir.june,unpublished opinion reversing dismissal where inmate was subjected to appalling conditions for three full days including feces and urine on the walls and mattress young quinlan,cir it would be an abomination of the constitution to force a prisoner to live in his own excrement for four days in a stench that not even a fellow prisoner could stand,superseded on other grounds by,stat.mccord maggio,cir holding that an inmate sleeping for two years on the floors of,windowless,unlighted cells,into which rain water and sewage leaked on occasion,established claim williams adams,cir reversing summary judgment where verified complaint alleged that during day period the toilet in the cell did not work,and that it continually ran over and leaked onto the cell floor and the floor stayed filthy with its waste internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.but see smith copeland,cir affirming summary judgment to defendants where plaintiff alleged an overflowed toilet in his cell for four days.
from this body of case law,the district court discerned a circuit split w here an inmate exposure to waste lasts for three or four days.internal quotation marks omitted.although locating this durational divide around three or four days exposure to human waste,the district court nevertheless found that willey complaint,which alleged,at a minimum seven days exposure,failed to state a claim.we disagree.
indeed,we find erroneous each of the three apparently independent grounds given by the district court for dismissing willey claim for unsanitary conditions of confinement.the first two aim to set
