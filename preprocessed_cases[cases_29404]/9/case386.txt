background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the,here prescott.see united parcel,cir.prescott has been a city mechanic since.in june,the city posted a position for general maintenance mechanic foreman,in central fleet maintenance,boston public works.four city employees were interviewed for the position,including prescott and ryder.all four candidates were interviewed by four supervisors in the public works department jerry coughlin a white male,maurice smith an male,kathy kelley a white female,and prescott supervisor,david higgins a white male.the interview focused on three main criteria job knowledge,education,and experience.
during the interview,applicants were asked seven objective questions regarding the commercial motor vehicle safety act federal out of service criteria,which delineates the federal standards for when vehicles are unsafe to drive.prescott was unable to correctly answer any of the questions pertaining to the federal guidelines.ryder answered all of the questions correctly.according to prescott there were no questions during the interview that focused on education or instruction in the field of mechanics.he claims that there is no evidence that the city considered his performance evaluations.he contends that the interview process only rewarded those who could provide the right answers to the questions that were asked,questions he claims had no predictive ability for the likelihood of success as a general foreman.
the selection committee determined that prescott and two other white candidates were not qualified for the position.the only committee member who thought that prescott was qualified for the position was smith.smith,however,ranked prescott third out of the four candidates.the unanimous choice of the interview panel was ryder.ryder had ten more years of experience than the other candidates,and he also had more supervisory and administrative experience than them as well.ryder had been the acting general foreman for six months before he was interviewed,and the panel determined that he had better job knowledge than the other candidates.the panel also determined that ryder would have the least negative impact on work product because he was the one most familiar with the position.
prescott filed a complaint with the massachusetts committee against discrimination mcad on october,alleging that he did not receive the promotion because of racial discrimination.prescott does not claim,however,that anyone has ever made,or that he has ever heard,racist or derogatory comments about him or others.he did not make any claims pertaining to disability,retaliation,or lack of accommodation at the time.prescott claims that he was more qualified than ryder for the position and points to his nineteen years of experience as a mechanic and six years as a foreman.he also points to numerous certifications he has obtained during his time in the field.prescott alleges that the city has made unsubstantiated claims that ryder had supervisory experience.prescott also alleges that higgins was not concerned with the backgrounds of employees or their schooling and that he simply did not promote workers.
prescott contends that the selection criteria used by higgins resulted in a less than eighty percent success rate for applicants and that the selection criteria have had a disparate impact on applicants.
prescott also alleges that he was not compensated for serving as acting general foreman in when,maurice garcía,the foreman,was out on.the difference in pay was a week.prescott filed a grievance with the union.prescott also contends that he was required to work on a computer after he had eye surgery,and he was required to lift items,which he was not supposed to do because of his surgery.
mcad dismissed prescott complaint,finding a lack of probable cause.on appeal,the dismissal was affirmed by the mcad investigation commissioner.prescott filed suit in superior court in suffolk county on january,and defendants removed the case to federal district court on february.on march,the defendants filed for summary judgment,and on march,prescott filed a for summary judgment.on august,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and denied prescott.the district court also denied prescott motion to take judicial notice of facts from a pending case and his motion to alter or amend the judgment.prescott now appeals.
ii.summary judgment and for summary judgment 
standard of review 
we review a motion for summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see thompson,cir.we may ignore conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.reynolds tobacco,cir citing rossy roche products,cir.we will reverse only if,after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the party here,prescott,the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.maymí ports,cir quoting amusements,town of dedham,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions on file,and any affidavits.thompson,at citing fed.civ c.a dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the party.id.quoting sánchez alvarado,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.maymí,at.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,evidence offered by the must be significantly probative of specific facts.pérez volvo car,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
discussion 
prescott appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on discrimination claims for disparate treatment,disparate impact,compensation,hostile work environment,tortious interference with a contract,retaliation,and disability.he also challenges the district court denial of his for summary judgment.the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework governs title vii,and massachusetts general laws,chapter claims.see villanueva wellesley,cir.the problem prescott faces is that he is unable to meet the prima facie burden that he is required to establish in the first step of mcdonnell douglas.accordingly,all his discrimination claims must fail.we address each of his allegations in turn.
disparate treatment 
a plaintiff makes out a claim of disparate treatment by showing that he is a member of a protected class he was qualified for the position he sought he was subjected to adverse employment action and the position remained open or was filled by someone else with similar qualifications.kosereis rhode island,cir citations omitted.it is undisputed that prescott is a member of a protected class.for prescott to survive the motion for summary judgment,then,he needed to present evidence that showed that ryder qualifications were similar to his own.see gu boston police dep t,cir.the district court found that he was unable to make that showing.we agree.
prescott was unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the interview panel that he was qualified for the position,and he failed to accurately answer the questions that the panel posed to him during his interview.his answer to several of the questions was that he was not sure.in contrast,ryder was able to provide correct answers to each question,and he had ten years more seniority than prescott.
the district court was not required to consider prescott proffer of evidence of pretext because he was unable to get past the second requirement,that he was qualified for the contested position.mcdonnell douglas made clear that a title vii plaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case.see oliver digital equip,cir.only after prescott has satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case,and the defendants have proffered a reason for not promoting him,would we consider any evidence of discriminatory pretext.see gillen fallon ambulance,cir.the record clearly indicates that prescott was not qualified for the position he sought.prescott was not able to meet his prima facie burden and thus his claim of disparate treatment is legally insufficient.
disparate impact 
d isparate impact claims involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and can not be justified by business necessity.hazen paper biggins,d quoting int l of teamsters united states,d internal quotation marks omitted accord bramble am.postal workers union,cir.prescott alleges that defendants hiring practices have a disparate impact on because defendants use selection procedures that result in a less than eighty percent success rate for applicants,as compared with white applicants.while in his disparate impact claim prescott is not required to show discriminatory motive,see hazen paper,at,he is required to show proof of a disproportionate impact on that.
prescott has not introduced any evidence of disparate impact in this case.rather,his appeal hinges on the district court denial of his motion to take judicial notice of evidence submitted in another case which purports to show disparate impact.we review that evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.see united states bello,cir.the validity of the statistics and whether they showed disparate impact was at issue in that case.therefore,the proof offered was not a matter beyond reasonable controversy,advisory committee note note to subdivision b,and there was no abuse of discretion.
compensation 
federal law claim 
to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in compensation under title vii or,prescott must show that he is a member of a protected class he met his employer expectations he suffered adverse employment action with respect to compensation and employees outside the protected class received more favorable treatment.see white bfi waste,llc,cir citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.prescott claims that he was discriminated against in compensation because he was not paid for the weeks when he served as acting general foreman while others performing the same work received higher compensation.notwithstanding this claim,the evidence is clear that prescott has not proven that he met his employer expectations as an acting general foreman.prescott also fails to meet the fourth prong of the prima facie test because he never put forth any evidence of employees who were given higher compensation.since he has failed to establish a prima facie case,his claim of disparate compensation also fails.
massachusetts state law claim 
in addition to making a complaint under federal law,prescott also claims that he was discriminated against in compensation under massachusetts general laws,chapter.section provides that e very person having employees in his service shall pay such employee the wages earned by him.the purpose of,is to prevent the unreasonable detention of wages by employers.boston police patrolmen,city of boston,citing am.mut.liab.ins.comm r of labor.
defendants acknowledge that when an employee is appointed to a position on an acting basis,that person is normally paid the wages for the higher position.though prescott claims that he served as acting general foreman for four months in maurice garcía absence,garcía employee attendance calendar clearly demonstrates that garcía was not away from work for more than two weeks.kathleen kelley,the principal personnel officer for the city,checked the city records and spoke with managers in central fleet maintenance who confirmed this.serving as acting general foreman in a absence is not the same as being appointed to the position.prescott state law claim fails because he has not demonstrated that he was deprived of wages that he earned.
hostile work environment 
to make out a prima facie case of hostile work environment,a plaintiff must show that he is a member of a protected class he experienced uninvited harassment the harassment was the harassment was so severe or pervasive as to create an abusive work environment and the harassment was objectively and subjectively offensive.douglas penney,cir.under massachusetts law,a hostile work environment is one that is pervaded by harassment or abuse,with the resulting intimidation,humiliation,and stigmatization,such that it poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.thompson,at quoting cuddyer stop shop supermarket.prescott has not shown that he was subjected to conduct that was extreme,humiliating,or that unreasonably interfered with his ability to work.see id.the environment must be sufficiently hostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.quoting faragher city of boca raton,d.in fact,prescott own statements undermine his claim of a hostile work environment.he acknowledges that in over twenty years of work for the city,he never heard a single racist remark or joke he also describes his relationship with his supervisor,higgins,as good.prescott did not put forth any evidence that he was subject to supervisory harassment by any individual that qualifies as a supervisor,an individual with the authority to hire,fire,or demote.see noviello city of boston,cir.we therefore must agree with the district court that his hostile work environment claim is without basis.
tortious interference with contract 
to establish a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract,prescott must show that a business relationship existed a defendant knowingly induced another defendant to break the contract the defendant interference was intentional and improper and he was harmed as a result.see shea emmanuel,citing wright shriners hosp.for crippled children.prescott argument to the effect that higgins,or anyone else,tortiously interfered with a contract lacks legal sufficiency.though prescott does not have a cause of action against the city for interfering with its own contract,there could be one against higgins personally were he to have tortiously interfered with a subordinate employment relationship.see zimmerman direct fed.credit union,cir.under this theory,prescott would have had to show proof of actual malice by higgins,but higgins would be entitled to a qualified privilege in an tortious interference case and,thus,will not be liable for employment decisions that are within the scope of his supervisory duties.id.prescott would have to establish that malice was the controlling factor in the supervisor interference.id.citing alba sampson.there is nothing in the record to support a claim for malice.prescott has thus failed to make out a prima facie case for tortious interference with a contract,and this claim fails as well.
retaliation 
a prima facie case for retaliation is established if prescott shows that he engaged in protected conduct he was subjected to an adverse employment action and the adverse employment action is causally linked to the protected conduct.see noviello,at.for a retaliation claim to survive a motion for summary judgment,the plaintiff must point to evidence in the record that would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the emp
