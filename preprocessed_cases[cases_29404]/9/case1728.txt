in suits under for damages against government officials for violation of constitutional rights,the supreme court recommends that the courts rule on the constitutional issue before reaching qualified immunity.in this case,after hearing all of the plaintiff evidence at trial,the district court assumed,but did not decide whether a constitutional violation had occurred and then granted immunity to a police officer.in the circumstances of this case,we conclude that this procedure was not reversible error and we will affirm on the merits of the immunity ruling.
gilbert carswell,the plaintiff husband,was fatally shot by a homestead borough patrolman in the course of apprehension by the police.plaintiff brought suit pursuant to alleging that her husband death was the result of constitutional violations by officer frank snyder,police chief mark zuger,and the borough of homestead.the district court declined to grant qualified immunity on summary judgment,reasoning that factual disputes existed at that time.at trial,after the plaintiff had rested at the end of her case,the district court granted judgment to the defendants as a matter of law pursuant to.
the tragic death of gilbert carswell was the culmination of months of domestic discord.after three and years of marriage,plaintiff and the became estranged.in july,some four months before the shooting occurred,the plaintiff applied to the state court for a protection from abuse order pfa because her husband presented an immediate and present danger of abuse to her and their children.soon afterward,the homestead police went to the family residence when the husband,despite the pfa,came to the home and punched the plaintiff.
on july,plaintiff applied for a second pfa,asserting that her husband had ripped the telephone from the wall,broken a table,threatened to hit her and sexually assaulted her.in early august,the police were called to the home when the husband struck the plaintiff in the face with his fist.
the plaintiff filed an indirect criminal complaint on october,because her husband threatened to kick her and her brother.one week later,the police were summoned because the husband had once again violated the pfa.in evading apprehension,he rammed a police car.as a consequence,a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.
on the evening of november and the early morning hours of november,the husband entered the home on four separate occasions.he broke a window to gain admittance,ransacked the kitchen,and smashed the television set.on each occasion,the police came to the scene,but were unsuccessful in attempts to capture him.
after the second incident,plaintiff and a teenage girl,who was staying at the house,armed themselves with butcher knives.after the third entry,a patrolman remained in the house for an hour to provide security for the plaintiff.moreover,the police decided that their previous shift would remain on duty together with the oncoming officers because of concern that the husband would return.
after the fourth entry which occurred at,the police again responded,but the husband escaped.to protect plaintiff,officer shipley remained in the home,as he had earlier,while other officers set up a perimeter in the area.
the husband was spotted at by a police officer who radioed the information to the law enforcement personnel in the area.two other officers,responding to the alert,cornered the husband on the porch of a home nearby.one of the policemen drew his gun,confronted the husband,and ordered him to lie on the floor.he raised his hands in a surrender gesture,but then suddenly jumped over the porch railing and ran into the darkness.
on hearing that the husband had been sighted,officer shipley left the family home and joined in the pursuit.he was standing in boone way,a narrow alley,when he saw the husband jump from the roof of a garage on the south side of the roadway.the husband then ran in a westerly direction with shipley in pursuit.
at this point,defendant snyder turned his police car into boone way from an intersecting street west of the garage.he saw the husband some feet away,running toward the cruiser.snyder stopped his car somewhat diagonally across the alley and got out on the left side,leaving the door open.the headlights were on as were the lights in the cruiser overhead bracket directed toward each side of the alley.
snyder then went to the right of his car about feet behind the rear bumper.despite orders to stop,the husband continued to run toward the police car,with hands extended in front of him at shoulder height,the palms pointed forward.snyder could see that the husband hands were empty when he reached the front of the patrol car.
as he took a firing position at the rear of his car,snyder took off the safety on his gun.he fired when,according to the plaintiff expert testimony,the husband chest was inches from the gun muzzle and the palm of his left hand was inches away from the muzzle.the one shot that was fired entered the husband chest in the center,struck the heart and exited on the extreme left of his back.
the borough did not provide snyder with a baton or pepper spray,nor were they required.the use of these nonlethal weapons was permitted,but only after an officer had successfully completed applicable familiarization programs.snyder had not received such training and was armed only with a gun.
plaintiff introduced portions of snyder discovery deposition into evidence,including a statement that he did not know that the husband was unarmed.further,given the facts and evidence that he had at the time,snyder believed the husband may have had a weapon on his person.snyder also said that if he had had weapons in his possession,he would not have pulled his gun from the holster.he further testified that he graduated from the police academy before being hired,and had attended yearly refresher courses provided by the commonwealth of pennsylvania.
plaintiff called mccauley,a criminologist,to describe proper police procedures.he stated that knowing that the guy was unarmed,a police officer should not have drawn his weapon from the holster,but should have pushed,tackled,or tripped the fleeing suspect.
police chief zuger testified that the manual for borough officers cautioned them about the use of deadly force and the continuum that was to be followed.he also explained that there was no requirement that officers become qualified to use pepper spray or a baton.zuger said further that snyder had been an officer for years and that there had never been a complaint against him.
after the plaintiff rested,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under.the district judge,referring to saucier katz,d,stated that in ruling on qualified immunity,he would view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.he therefore assumed that the shooting was intentional and not accidental,but that he was not required to decide whether the officer conduct was right or wrong.rather,the issue was whether it was clear what a reasonable officer would have done and,if that was not established,the policeman was entitled to immunity.in the circumstances present,the court determined that officer snyder was entitled to qualified immunity and entered judgment in his favor.
the court further ruled that there was no evidence to fasten personal liability on defendant zuger.as to him,in his official capacity,the grant of immunity to snyder relieved zuger as well as the borough from liability.in addition,the trial judge found that nothing in the constitution required a municipality,or its police department,to maintain a list of particularized type of equipment that must be furnished to its officers.the failure to provide weapons did not rise to a constitutional level.
on appeal,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in granting judgment for defendant snyder because there were disputes over material facts and questions as to his credibility.moreover,plaintiff asserts that homestead and chief zuger should not have been automatically dismissed because snyder was granted immunity.snyder defends the district court ruling and asserts as an alternate basis for affirmance that the plaintiff failed to establish a violation of a constitutional right.
a provides that during a jury trial,if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue,the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim that can not under the controlling law be maintained without a favorable finding on that issue.in ruling on that motion,the court construes disputed issues of fact in a light most favorable to the.northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.
use of excessive force by a law enforcement officer is considered a seizure under the fourth amendment,which prohibits such unlawful action.graham connor,d tennessee garner,d.the test is an objective one,which scrutinizes the reasonableness of the challenged conduct.the facts to be examined include the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.reasonableness is to be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.id.
in tennessee garner,at,the court phrased the test as follows w here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others,it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.in garner,a fleeing teenage burglar was shot and killed by a policeman who never attempted to defend his action on any basis other than the need to prevent an escape,a justification the court refused to accept.
here,the district court did not make a specific finding that the plaintiff evidence established a constitutional violation,but pragmatically assumed that for purposes of the rule motion such a showing had been made.the court then moved onto the issue of whether officer snyder was entitled to qualified immunity.
the court was fully aware of saucier s explanation of the difference between the determination of excessive force in the constitutional sense and the ruling on qualified immunity.comments made by the trial judge during argument on the rule motion leave no doubt on that score.that he reviewed the evidence bearing on the fourth amendment issue favorably to the plaintiff was apparent.
the judge stated that the constitutional violation requires an intentional deprivation of rights and for these purposes then we are going to assume that the shooting was intentional.later in the colloquy he commented,i not sure that it was a situation where he the officer was justified in using deadly force.
our appellate review of a rule ruling is plenary and is similar to that in a summary judgment appeal.we review the record as would a district court.this scope of appellate review places us in the same position as the district court with respect to the admonition in siegert gilley,d and saucier to decide the constitutional issue before considering qualified immunity.see,bell johnson,cir.
it is quite understandable that the trial judge was hesitant to rule that a constitutional violation had occurred on the facts in the record at that point when the qualified immunity issue offered a more disposition of the rule motion.here,unlike saucier and siegert,the case had already been in trial for a week.consequently,snyder had already lost much of the benefit of qualified immunity freedom from trial.see,bennett murphy,cir.
it is preferable to resolve the qualified immunity issue at the summary judgment,or earlier,stage,but if this is not possible,it remains appropriate to consider the matter in a rule a motion.see,ehrlich town of glastonbury,cir johnson breeden,cir.
the court of appeals in siegert approved the grant of immunity on summary judgment,but the supreme court affirmed by determining that no constitutional violation had occurred.siegert,at.saucier held that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity,and it reversed the court of appeals decision,which had denied qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage because a material factual dispute existed.saucier,at.those procedural differences with the case before us are not dispositive,but they are factors that have some bearing.
we believe that the circumstances here,however,are sufficiently unlike those in saucier and siegert that we may proceed directly to the qualified immunity issue without ruling preliminarily on the constitutional violation claim.see ehrlich,at.we are hesitant to hold that the jury could find excessive force based on the record here.
it appears to us that without the testimony of mccauley,the plaintiff failed to establish a constitutional violation.see cowan ex rel.estate of cooper breen,cir expert opinion was part of plaintiff excessive force record.we have serious doubts about the admissibility of his opinion that snyder should not have drawn his gun based on the expert assumption that the officer knew the husband was unarmed.
we recognize that expert opinions can be redacted from the record on appeal where they are found to be inadmissible and the court may then proceed to enter judgment based on the remaining evidence.weisgram marley,d.in weisgram,however,the admissibility of the expert testimony had been the focal point of appeal and had been thoroughly briefed and argued.in contrast here,the expert opinion issue has not been briefed on appeal.in such a setting we are most reluctant to undertake an analysis sua sponte.see garner,at.as for the policy of the police department,the absence of any discussion of this issue by the courts below,and the uncertain state of the record,preclude any consideration of its validity.accordingly,we assume,but do not decide,that plaintiff established a fourth amendment constitutional violation and proceed to the immunity issue.
an officer sued for a violation of constitutional rights may be entitled to the defense of qualified immunity,that is,an exemption from trial as well as from liability for the alleged wrong.saucier,at.garner,d harlow fitzgerald,d.the formula for analyzing a qualified immunity claim is a several stage process.first,the court is to decide whether a constitutional violation has occurred,and then it must proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.wilson layne,d quoting conn gabbert,d.a defendant may be shielded from liability for civil damages if his actions did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.hope pelzer,d quoting harlow,at.
for a constitutional right to be clearly established,its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.quoting anderson creighton,d.see also groh ramirez,d explaining that whether immunity is available depends on whether the constitutional right was clearly established.saucier,at.noting that the relevant inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.
once these requirements are found to have been satisfied,the inquiry proceeds to another,closely related issue,that is,whether the officer made a reasonable mistake as to what the law requires.saucier emphasized that the inquiry for qualified immunity eligibility is distinct from establishment of a constitutional violation of excessive force.as the court explained,t he concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct i f the officer mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,however,the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.saucier,at.
qualified immunity operates to protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.id.at.quoting priester city of riviera beach,cir.furthermore,in addition to the deference officers receive on the underlying constitutional claim in excessive force cases,qualified immunity can apply in the event the mistaken belief was reasonable.id.we have followed this doctrine in excessive force claims where the police shot a citizen.see,bennett,curley klem,cir henry perry,cir.
the importance of the factual background raises the question of whether the decision as to the applicability of qualified immunity is a matter for the court or jury.the courts of appeals are not in agreement on this point.we held in doe groody,cir,that qualified immunity is an objective question to be decided by the court as a matter of law.see also bartholomew pennsylvania,cir.the jury,however,determines disputed historical facts material to the qualified immunity question.see sharrar felsing,cir.district courts may use special interrogatories to allow juries to perform this function.see,curley,at.the court must make the ultimate determination on the availability of qualified immunity as a matter of law.see curley,at sharrar,at citing hunter bryant,d.several other courts of appeals have adopted a standard similar to ours in contrast,other courts of appeals have held that district courts may submit the issue of qualified immunity to the jury 
all of the events leading up to the pursuit of the suspect are relevant.see abraham raso,cir.the question is whether,in the circumstances here,it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that snyder conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.if it would not have been clear,then qualified immunity is appropriate.
if the wrongfulness of the officer conduct would have been clear,we must then determine whether he made a reasonable mistake.w here there is at least some significant authority that lends support of the police action,we have upheld qualified immunity even while deciding that the action in question violates the constitution.groody,at internal citation omitted quoting leveto lapina,cir.see also in re city of philadelphia,cir.
a survey of the circumstances known to snyder is necessary to properly apply this test.after he arrived on duty as the officer in charge he had been given reports on the events at the plaintiff home.he was aware that the husband had violated the pfa four times within the past several hours and that it was thought prudent to have an officer remain in the house to ease the fears of plaintiff,who had armed herself with a knife.snyder was also in radio contact with the other officers who were in pursuit of the husband.
before the shooting occurred,the husband had escaped from an armed policeman and the chase was still underway with a number of officers in pursuit.the husband was running at full speed directly toward snyder police cruiser.ignoring orders to stop,the husband kept charging at the officer who held his fire until the muzzle of his gun was two feet away from the husband.although after the shooting it was determined that the husband was unarmed,snyder denied that he knew that at the time and there was no evidence to the contrary.
in these circumstances a reasonable officer could believe that firing at the suspect was a proper response.a reasonable officer would not be expected to take the risk of being assaulted by a fleeing man who was so close that he could grapple with him and seize the gun.our recitation of these events is a discussion in slow motion of an incident that took place in a matter of seconds.officer snyder had no time for the calm,thoughtful deliberation typical of an academic setting.
the plaintiff expert,professor mccauley,thought that snyder should not have pulled his gun but rather should have chosen to tackle or otherwise physically subdue the suspect.the expert opinion did not refer to the question of mistake and consequently there is no dispute of fact.curley,at.in any event,this is a question of law to be decided by the court as a matter of law,groody,at,rather than by expert opinion.see peterson city of plymouth,cir expert opinion not fact based but only a legal conclusion.
we conclude that at most snyder conduct was a mistake that was reasonable under the circumstances.as smith freland,cir,said,w e must never allow the theoretical,sanitized world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day.what constitutes reasonable action may seem quite different to someone facing a possible assailant than to someone analyzing the question at leisure.
we are not persuaded that officer snyder made a mistake in the use of his weapon,but even if it was an error,it was such as a reasonable officer could have made.consequently,the district court entry of judgment in favor of defendant snyder will be affirmed.
having held that officer snyder was entitled to qualified immunity,the district court determined that it was obligated to grant judgment as a matter of law in favor of the borough and chief zuger.we reach the same conclusion,but do so for different reasons.
because as a predicate to its decision on immunity,the court had assumed that snyder had committed a constitutional violation,we must determine whether the borough or police chief were liable for that violation.based on our review of the record,we conclude that the plaintiff failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find liability on the part of these defendants.
a municipality can not be responsible for damages under section on a vicarious liability theory,monell of soc,new york city,d,and can be found liable under only where the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation at issue.city of canton harris,d.district courts must review claims of municipal liability independently of the section claims against the individual police officers.kneipp tedder,cir fagan city of vineland,cir.
the plaintiff municipal liability claim can be divided into two categories failure to properly train its police officers in the constitutional use of deadly force and failure to equip police officers with alternatives to lethal weapons.
a plaintiff must identify a municipal policy or custom that amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of people with whom the police come into contact.city of canton,at.this typically requires proof of a pattern of underlying constitutional violations.berg county of allegheny,cir.although it is possible,proving deliberate indifference in the absence of such a pattern is a difficult task.see id.
in addition to proving deliberate indifference,a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the inadequate training caused a constitutional violation.see grazier city of philadelphia,cir.there must be a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation.brown muhlenberg township,cir quoting city of canton,at.
the record here fails to establish deliberate indifference or causation.chief zuger testified that officers attend annual courses,where they study,among other subjects,relevant court opinions.officer snyder testified that he was present at these sessions.zuger updated the homestead police manual in and directed his officers to become familiar with the updated policy manual,which covered the continuum of force.
this evidence did not establish a lack of training on the use of deadly force that amounted to a deliberate indifference,nor does it demonstrate a pattern of underlying constitutional violations that should have alerted homestead to an inadequate training program.the record does not meet the high burden of proving deliberate indifference,nor does it show that homestead actions caused a constitutional violation.we conclude that the plaintiff failed to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find municipal liability.
furthermore,we have never recognized municipal liability for a constitutional violation because of failure to equip police officers with weapons.we decline to do so on the record before us.in plakas drinski,cir,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit rejected the claim that a county had violated a suspect constitutional rights by failing to equip its police officers with alternatives to deadly force.in holding that the constitution does not mandate the types of equipment a police department must provide to its officers,the court explained 
we do not think it is wise policy to permit every jury in these cases to hear expert testimony that an arrestee would have been uninjured if only the police had been able to use disabling gas or a capture net or a taser or even a larger number of police officers and then decide that a municipality is liable because it failed to buy this equipment or increase its police force.there can be reasonable debates about whether the constitution also enacts a code of criminal procedure,but we think it is clear that the constitution does not enact a police administrator equipment list.plakas,at footnote omitted.
see also salas carpenter,cir.
the supreme court has not yet ruled in a case similar to plakas,but language in the cases is pertinent.in city of canton,we read in virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee,a plaintiff will be able to point to something the city could have done to prevent the unfortunate incident.permitting a lesser standard than deliberate indifference would engage the federal courts in an endless exercise of municipal employee training programs.this is an exercise we believe the federal courts are ill suited to undertake as well as one that would implicate serious questions of federalism.city of canton,at.
mandating the type of equipment that police officers might find useful in the performance of their myriad duties in frequently unanticipated circumstances is a formidable task indeed.it is better assigned to municipalities than federal courts.
we conclude that the judgment as a matter of law in favor of the borough and chief zuger as well as that in favor of snyder must be affirmed.
i join parts i,ii and iii of the majority opinion because i agree that officer snyder is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.i also agree that the district court did not err analytically in assuming arguendo that a constitutional violation had occurred however,i must respectfully dissent from part iv of the majority opinion because i think that,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,the evidence establishes a prima facie case of liability against the borough of homestead and against homestead police chief mark zuger in his official capacity collectively hereafter referred to as the borough 
this case illustrates all too clearly the daily reality in which police officers often have to make,decisions.the doctrine of qualified immunity recognizes that reality and protects police from liability that might otherwise arise from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.saucier katz,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we evaluate whether an officer conduct was reasonable,and thus whether the officer is entitled to qualified immunity,based upon the officer perspective at the time acted.graham connor,d.we thereby avoid the inequities that might result from the vision that comes with hindsight.id.
here,however,the usual concerns about judging an officer use of force from the perspective of hindsight are not present because our analysis has the benefit of officer snyder candid testimony.he testified that he saw nothing in carswell hands as carswell ran toward him.app.at he was then asked,had you had weapons,you would not have pulled your gun as carswell ran towards you,am i correct he responded,yes.id.at.that testimony would allow a jury to conclude that officer snyder used excessive force in fatally shooting carswell and that he did so knowingly.
as the majority ably discusses,the fact that a jury could conclude that snyder used excessive force to subdue carswell and thus violated carswell fourth amendment rights is not enough,standing alone,to deprive him of qualified immunity.it is,however,enough to support a finding that the use of excessive force resulted from the borough policy and custom of providing police officers only with guns,lethal weapons the jury could conclude from snyder testimony that,at the very moment he fired the fatal shot,he believed that he was using excessive deadly force where force would suffice.indeed,if the jury accepted his testimony as true,it would have been hard to conclude anything else.the jury could therefore reason that the officer had to resort to excessive force solely because the borough left him no alternative but to use his gun in a situation where force could reasonably have been employed to subdue carswell.
to establish a municipality liability under,the plaintiff must show that plaintiff constitutional rights were violated by the municipality deliberate indifference as reflected in its policy or custom see city of canton harris,d.a municipality can not,however,be held liable for the alleged constitutional deprivation unless there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the deprivation.id.at.my colleagues believe that the record here fails to establish deliberate indifference or causation as a matter of law.op.at.however,whether or not a defendant conduct amounts to deliberate indifference has been described as a classic issue for the fact finder and a factual mainstay of actions under.luzerne cty.juvenile detention,cir internal quotation marks,citation and brackets omitted.given the evidence here,that should have been an issue for the jury to decide and the borough was therefore not entitled to judgment as a matter of law under rule.
in brown muhlenberg township,cir,we quoted city of canton,noting 
in may seem contrary to common sense to assert that a municipality will actually have a policy of not taking reasonable steps to train its employees.but it may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.
i believe that a jury could reasonably conclude that this record establishes such deliberate indifference because the borough training left officer snyder with no reasonable alternative to the use of deadly force.the supreme court elaborated upon this in board of county comm rs of bryan county brown,d.it explained 
in leaving open in canton the possibility that a plaintiff might succeed in carrying a claim without showing a pattern of constitutional violations,we simply hypothesized that,in a narrow range of circumstances,a violation of federal rights may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.the likelihood that the situation will recur and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens rights could justify a finding that policymakers decision not to train the officer reflected deliberate indifference to the obvious consequence of the policymakers choice namely,a violation of a specific constitutional or statutory right.the high degree of predictability may also support an inference of causation that the municipality indifference led directly to the very consequence that was so predictable.
we applied this teaching in berg county of allegheny,cir.there,we reviewed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a suit alleging a violation of civil rights as a result of the plaintiff arrest on an erroneous warrant.plaintiff argued that the defendant county maintained a flawed warrant creation practice and poor training procedures.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.warrants were generated based on a single datum the criminal complaint number with no other information and no check to guard against the kind of mistake that was made.nor were there procedures that would allow an officer who suspects an error to confirm that suspicion.id.we concluded that the failure to provide protective measures and fail safes seems comparable to a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations and reversed the grant of summary judgment for the municipality.id.
