on february,monica guessous filed suit against fairview property investments,llc fairview.she alleged six claims in her complaint pursuant to,guessous asserted claims for race discrimination count i,hostile work environment count ii,and retaliation count iii and pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,e et,she asserted claims for discrimination based on religion,national origin,and pregnancy count iv,hostile work environment count v,and retaliation count vi.on december,the district court granted summary judgment for fairview on all six counts.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the order granting summary judgment on all counts and remand for further proceedings.
we recite the facts drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the,monica guessous.anderson liberty lobby.
fairview manages several real estate properties and engages in real estate leases and sales.guessous is an muslim woman from morocco who worked for fairview from february until march when she was terminated from her position as a bookkeeping assistant.she was terminated by her direct supervisor,greg washenko,who became fairview chief financial officer cfo in october.prior to washenko arrival,guessous had been supervised by peter arey who was fairview vice president at that time.
in deposition testimony,guessous recounted numerous allegations of mistreatment by washenko during the final years of her employment at fairview guessous and washenko met for the first time at a event held in october,shortly after washenko was hired.at that first meeting,washenko asked guessous where she was from and,when she replied that she was middle eastern,he said that in a previous job he had worked with a bunch of middle easterners and they are a bunch of crooks,who will stop at nothing to screw you.from that point forward,washenko exhibited a habit of discussing moroccans,muslims,and middle easterners in disparaging and offensive ways.for example,in january,after reading news reports about islamic terrorism,washenko came out of his office and walked to guessous desk to ask her,why do muslims hate america.guessous replied that she was muslim and did not hate america.she further stated that muslims are not terrorists,to which washenko responded,yeah,sure.like my buddy says not all muslims are terrorists,but most are.guessous testified that washenko body language during that conversation made her feel cornered and intimidated,in particular because he stood over her while she sat at her desk.
on another occasion in may following a series of hamas attacks on israel,washenko again left his office to approach guessous.when he said,i need your intake on this,guessous believed he was bringing her something to work on.instead,washenko proceeded to tell her,i could never understand this whole suicide bomber thing.these poor israelis are being bombed every day by muslim palestinian terrorists.guessous attempted to explain that s uicide is prohibited in the koran and that it specifically says that it does not condone killing innocents.she also told him she was not palestinian and that she ha d no business speaking about the issue.on yet another occasion,in february during the arab spring,washenko again left his office to approach guessous at her desk and ask,what up with egypt and why are the muslims killing people.guessous testified that by this time she had become frustrated with these kinds of inquiries and tried to explain to him that she was not egyptian and had no particular insight into the uprising.
in fact,washenko consistently conflated guessous identity as a moroccan muslim with other middle eastern identities,blurring the lines between race,ethnicity,national origin,and religion.for example,in late,guessous was called to the basement of one of fairview buildings where a restaurant was located.she was then asked to act as a translator for one of the restaurant employees who was a persian iranian.when guessous told washenko that she did not speak farsi,he replied,so you do speak iranian should there be some secret language that you all understand guessous fairview prop.investments,llc,wl,at,
washenko continued to direct these kinds of inquiries at guessous throughout.in august or september of that year,as muamar gaddafi rule in libya was coming to an end,washenko asked guessous to explain the situation in that country to him.again,she responded that she was not libyan and did not have an interest in events going on there.around this time,guessous sent an email to her,a police officer,explaining some of the issues she was having with washenko and asking for his advice.among other complaints,she said,
i am sick and tired of been the for issues relating to a muslim terrorist and or a islamic country national conflicts and or cultural issues or weirdness that he is trying to find out about.i feel targeted for my believes and my ethnicity and culture and for all the year i have been in the good all united stated of america i have never felt so inferior to anyone as i am feeling at this point.
errors in original.
but being dragged into uncomfortable,and often offensive,discussions on current events was hardly the only behavior to which guessous objected.much of washenko conduct was more personal in nature.for example,beginning in early,washenko spent several months referring to guessous by her moroccan name,mounia,instead of her chosen americanized name,monica.guessous,wl,at.while fairview asserts that washenko desisted at guessous request,guessous herself stated in the same email to her that she had struggled for quite some time to have him call me monica instead of mounia,and noted in her complaint that washenko only stopped a fter months of repeated requests and protests.in september of that same year,guessous wished washenko a happy birthday,which happens to fall on september.washenko responded to his sole muslim arab employee well wishes by saying that each year on his birthday he was reminded of the terrorist attacks by the muslims and then walking out of his office.
another of their conversations in turned personal after washenko initiated a discussion on the differences between christianity and islam.first,washenko asked guessous to describe islam to him,and in turn he described christianity to her.guessous then began to explain that judaism,christianity,and islam are all abrahamic religions,that their adherents worship the same god,and that islam treats jesus as a prophet who was raised to heaven by god and who will return to earth.although initially uncomfortable with the conversation,as she explained islam to washenko,emphasizing the similarities between their faiths,guessous testified that she began to feel happy because i was like i doing something good.but washenko was apparently incensed at the suggestion,saying,no monica we are not the same,you might think we are,but we are not we do not believe in the same god and then storm ing away.guessous,wl,at.guessous was hurt by the reaction,recalling in testimony that the statement,we not the same made me feel like i not even a human being.
washenko personal and offensive comments continued into and.in the fall of,washenko was shopping for a new car for his son.guessous suggested he purchase a volkswagen because her mother drove one and it had been reliable.washenko replied,t hat car must have taken a lot of beating from a moroccan driver.guessous testified that she was deeply offended and could believe he was insulting my own mother.also in late,washenko engaged in an extended prank,telling staff members over the course of two weeks that guessous had tried to poison him.in fact,guessous had shared some taco bell with washenko at lunch one day,and that evening washenko had gone to the emergency room with abdominal pain.although he was unable to get a diagnosis at the hospital,washenko told guessous,and apparently others,that the doctor had asked him who gave him the food,that washenko had replied my muslim employee,and that the doctor then responded,well she obviously trying to poison you or kill you.watching washenko tell the story repeatedly around the office,guessous said she just felt like a terrorist.
one of the most offensive episodes began differently than most of the encounters described in guessous testimony.while these conversations were typically initiated by washenko,in this case guessous decided to try to educate her boss about her culture in order to frame it in a more positive light.in late or early,guessous was sent photos from a friend who had moved to dubai.when she received the pictures of the clean and modern city she wanted to show washenko the images to demonstrate we not a bunch of like morons or idiots.rather than being impressed as guessous had hoped,washenko told her that he had a friend who lived in dubai for a year and had hated the experience,and that this friend had told him,despite all the buildings and modern sic,they are just a bunch of camel people.
most of guessous remaining allegations concern what she characterized in her complaint and testimony as washenko intrusive and overbearing approach to managing her as his subordinate employee.after assuming the position of cfo,washenko monitored guessos directly.guessous testified that washenko would often leave his office to stand behind her desk and inquire what she was working on.these inquiries were repeated as many as forty times in a single day.guessous felt that washenko would sometimes badger her in this manner,wait for her to become irritated or overwhelmed,and then accuse her of being overly upset.on at least one occasion,washenko followed guessous into the copy room,asked her what she was working on in there,and then told her,i watching you.this conduct was specifically aimed at guessous and not at other employees.in fact,other employees joked about how,even when washenko was out of the office,he would constantly call guessous to ask her what she was doing and to tell her not to leave early.
washenko once asked guessous just five minutes after she been given an assignment whether it was done.when she said it was not,washenko looked at his watch,snapped his fingers,and said,t his is not morrocan time.this close supervision,combined with the troubling statements washenko had made about muslims,arabs,and moroccans trustworthiness and work ethic,made guessous feel like maybe i a crook.like he made me rethink myself.so now i felt like he is not seeing me as me and what i can bring to the table and my work.now he labeled me as this middle easterner.
in the winter of late or early,another incident occurred which reinforced this link in guessous mind.washenko called guessous into his office in what she described as a secretive manner,asking her to close the door behind her.he proceeded to tell guessous that rashid lakroun,a moroccan restaurant manager in one of farivew buildings,had been fired.guessous was confused as to why she would be informed since she was not involved with the restaurant and had only seen lakroun occasionally when he came into fairview offices.as she expressed this confusion,washenko told her,i just thought you should know since you are both moroccan,adding,he a very bad guy,monica monica,monica,h e a very bad guy.this conversation left guessous feeling targeted,and she testified that after i got fired,when i left,i felt like i was lakroun.because now washenko probably calling somebody in his office telling them that i was bad.
in late,guessous became pregnant.during most of,washenko comments about arabs and muslims apparently slowed.guessous attributed this to her own conduct she said she avoided engaging with him in order to reduce stress during her pregnancy.in july,guessous requested a three month maternity leave.she stated in her complaint that washenko felt this was excessive and that she had to inform him that she was legally entitled to twelve weeks off.guessous was on leave from august until october.when she returned she said washenko largely ignored her,keeping all of her old work duties assigned to other staff members whom guessous described in her complaint as two,christian american females,who also did not seek maternity leave.guessous,wl,at.
on december,guessous initiated a conversation with washenko in which she asked for her old duties back,to be trained for additional duties if needed,and also confronted washenko about his past discriminatory and offensive conduct.guessous testified that she told washenko that,as a new mom,she did not want the stress she had endured in the past.approximately minutes after that conversation ended,mary alexander,fairview president,sent two emails to other employers not associated with fairview.the subject lines of the emails read hiring and alexander asked whether either of these employers had any openings for a wonderful girl that works for me that we simply do not have enough work for right now.
three months later,on march,washenko terminated guessous.guessous was asked to sign a severance agreement that would have waived her employment law rights,but she refused.there is a dispute about whether washenko initially cited a change in fairview financial situation or a lack of work for guessous position.guessous,wl,at.fairview alleges that the issue of insufficient work for guessous position was discussed periodically over approximately two years prior to her termination.but fairview avers that the decision to terminate guessous was made by washenko in late november or early december and that the decision was approved by alexander.in other words,fairview admits the decision was made by washenko at or around the time that guessous confronted him about withholding her job duties and treating her poorly prior to her pregnancy.
guessous position was not filled by any new hire.instead,fairview shifted her work duties to two staff members,kara diaz and tara berger an outside contractor,kurt johnson and to washenko himself.johnson is an accountant who owns his own business and serves multiple clients.he testified,however,that he is in the fairview office three to four days each week and that he spent even more time there in the past.diaz and berger are both administrative assistants.
guessous filed a discrimination charge with the eeoc on march,just a few days after her termination.she filed her civil complaint approximately one year later on february.guessous claims were divided into six counts.counts i,ii,and iii asserted race discrimination,hostile work environment,and retaliation respectively under.counts iv,v,and vi,also asserted discrimination,hostile work environment,and retaliation,but based on religion,national origin,and pregnancy as covered under title vii.
on december,the district court granted fairview motion for summary judgment on all counts.the court first noted that guessous failed to comply with local rule b in her opposition to defendant motion for summary judgement by citing to her own complaint and by failing to cite certain factual allegations at all rather than pointing to evidence in the record to show a dispute of material fact.guessous,wl,at.the court refuse d to consider plaintiff statements as evidence to create a dispute of material fact on these issues.id.the court went on to note that it would be proper to consider the defendant facts as undisputed for purposes of the motion and evaluate the motion as such.id.however,the court decided to nevertheless proceed to assess the merits of plaintiff claims.id.
the district court held that counts i,iii,iv,and vi the discrimination and retaliation claims under both statutes failed because fairview had met its burden to produce a nondiscriminatory reason lack of work for its underlying conduct terminating guessous,and guessous had not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact to show that this reason was a pretext.as to count ii,the court concluded that only one of washenko statements can be construed as a racially derogatory comment,id.at,and held this was insufficient to establish a hostile work environment.finally,as to count v,the court found that the last act contributing to the alleged hostile work environment occurred more than days before guessous filed a complaint with the eeoc and that this claim was therefore.id.at.
guessous timely appealed.
all issues in this appeal arise from an order of summary judgment and are reviewed de novo.pueschel peters,cir.summary judgment is properly granted where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.the burden is on the nonmoving party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.liberty lobby,at.the nonmoving party must do so by offering sufficient proof in the form of admissible evidence rather than relying solely on the allegations of her pleadings.mitchell data general,cir.

the district court granted summary judgment for fairview on the discrimination claims counts i and iv and retaliation claims counts iii and vi under both and title vii by applying the mcdonnell douglas framework.this framework was initially developed for title vii discrimination cases,mcdonnell douglas green,but has since been held to apply in discrimination cases arising under,patterson mclean credit union,murrell ocean mecca motel,cir,and in retaliation cases under both statutes,beall abbott,cir.addressing title vii retaliation claim hawkins pepsico,cir.addressing retaliation claim.the framework applies in employment discrimination and retaliation cases where a plaintiff does not present sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence showing that an adverse employment action was motivated by intentional discrimination aimed at the plaintiff protected characteristic s.foster of shore,cir.this is such a case.
the mcdonnell douglas framework is comprised of three steps the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination or retaliation the burden of production then shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory or reason for the adverse action the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the stated reason for the adverse employment action is a pretext and that the true reason is discriminatory or retaliatory.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,see also reeves sanderson plumbing,holding that the employer burden in step two is one of production,not persuasion.for discrimination claims,the employee must show that the motive to discriminate was one of the employer motives,even if the employer also had other,lawful motives that were causative in the employer decision.of texas sw.med.ctr.nassar.retaliation claims,by contrast,require the employee to show that retaliation was a cause of a challenged adverse employment action.foster,at see nassar,at title vii retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of causation,not the lessened causation test stated in m.this requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.the supreme court has recently reiterated that a cause need not work in isolation to be a cause.burrage united states,thus,if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases,it is a cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise,so long as,without the incremental effect of the poison,he would have lived.as the district court noted,the plaintiff burden to show pretext merges with the plaintiff ultimate burden of persuading the court that she was a victim of intentional discrimination.guessous,wl,at citing burdine,at.
the facts and reasoning supporting our decision on guessous retaliation claims are also essential for analyzing her discrimination claims.as such,we address the retaliation claims first.in count iii,guessous alleges that her conversation with washenko in december in which she asked for her old duties back and confronted washenko about past hostile and discriminatory conduct constituted protected activity under.she further alleges that fairview retaliated against her for engaging in that conduct by deciding within minutes to terminate her,as evidenced by the emails sent by alexander to two outside employers inquiring whether they might hire her away from fairview.in count vi,guessous makes essentially the same allegations but seeks relief under title vii.since the elements of these retaliation claims are identical,honor booz allen hamilton,cir,and because the district court granted summary judgment on both for effectively the same reasons,we review them together.
to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under either statute,guessous must show i that she engaged in protected activity,ii that her employer took adverse action against her,and iii that a causal relationship existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment activity.foster,at alteration in original quoting price thompson,cir.quotation marks omitted.the district court held these elements were met.under the mcdonnell douglas framework,establishing a prima facie case shifted the burden to fairview to produce a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.fairview alleged that guessous was terminated because there was insufficient work to support her position.the burden then shifted back to guessous to show this reason was a pretext to disguise the true retaliatory reason for her termination.
the sole issue on appeal,therefore,is whether guessous met her summary judgment burden of demonstrating a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make fairview proffered justification a triable issue.foster,at see also king rumsfeld,cir.gregory,dissenting to survive summary judgment,however,king need not squarely rebut his employer explanation.instead,king must cast sufficient doubt upon the genuineness of the explanation to warrant a jury consideration of possible alternative and discriminatory motivations for the firing.
rather than engaging in a detailed analysis of the competing evidence proffered by fairview to support its theory,and by guessous to support her retaliation theory,the district court granted summary judgment for fairview for one reason that guessous position remained unfilled.guessous,wl,at.the court offered no elaboration in its opinion,but its logic appears to have been that,because the work was absorbed by fairview other employees,guessous can not show that there was enough work to justify keeping her on staff and she therefore can not prevail.if that is,indeed,the court reasoning it is a fallacy because fairview has shown it could operate without guessous does not mean that it would have done so absent the protected activity.guessous burden is only to show that the protected activity was a cause of her termination,not that it was the sole cause.foster,at see also montell diversified clinical,cir.i n retaliation cases,courts must determine what made the employer fire the employee when it did.emphasis and alteration in original quoting hamilton,cir.
the district court and fairview are both correct that guessous failed to show there was so much work to be done that the bookkeeping assistant position was an absolute necessity.the position was not back filled and guessous acknowledged in her testimony that she was not always busy.a reasonable jury could easily conclude,however,that the termination decision was made only minutes after guessous complained to washenko about past comments and treatment,and that it was therefore motivated by the complaint itself.see okoli city of baltimore,cir.holding that the deeply suspicious fact that stewart fired okoli only hours after she complain ed to the mayor about harassment was sufficient to meet plaintiff burden to show pretext at the summary judgment stage.
the december,emails from alexander are substantial evidence in support of guessous argument that when she complained to her supervisor,who was also her alleged harasser,washenko decided to terminate her and immediately got the decision approved by alexander.fairview counters that alexander did not know about the confrontation.this argument has two problems.first,guessous has presented evidence that a brought the confrontation to alexander attention while it was ongoing because washenko had made guessous cry.this alone would be enough to allow a reasonable jury to conclude alexander knew about the complaint and that the termination decision was made in response.second,fairview has admitted that the decision to fire guessous was made by washenko in late november or early december and that the decision was approved by alexander.this admission is consistent with guessous claim that the termination decision was made on december,that alexander was involved,and that the termination was retaliatory.
the absence of any evidence to support fairview explanation is also important.although fairview claims that washenko and alexander had discussed eliminating guessous position in the past,there is no record evidence to support that claim no emails,no meeting minutes,no performance reviews,nothing.the only thing fairview even points to as evidence is the pair of december,emails from alexander.fairview points out that they explicitly say there was not enough work for guessous.but the fact that these emails came on the heels of the protected activity in this case suggest that the reason given in the emails was a pretextual one.even if a jury accepted fairview argument that it did not need an assistant bookkeeper,based on the record evidence it could still conclude that the protected activity was the final straw that motivated guessous termination.see burrage,at.because guessous evidence puts the validity of fairview explanation in doubt,it is sufficient to survive summary judgment.see hux city of newport news,cir.holding a plaintiff will not survive summary judgment by focusing on minor discrepancies that do not cast doubt on the explanation validity king,at gregory,dissenting because he has made out a prima facie case,if king also has cast doubt upon the real motivations behind his unique treatment,he has adduced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.
we therefore reverse the district court and vacate the order of summary judgment with respect to counts iii and vi.
in count i of her complaint,guessous alleges that fairview treated her differently based on her race,ultimately terminating her and giving her work duties to several employees in violation of.in count iv,she makes the same allegations except that she asserts the discriminatory conduct was based on her religion,national origin,and pregnancy as covered under title vii.as the elements of these discrimination claims are effectively the same and the district court granted summary judgment on both for effectively the same reasons,we review them together.
in a typical discriminatory discharge case,the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that s he is a member of a protected class that s he suffered from an adverse employment action that s he was performing at a level that met her employer legitimate expectations and that the position was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class.king,at.as we have explained,however,the prima facie requirements are not set in stone,and differing factual circumstances may require adaptation.duke uniroyal,cir.an adaptation of the prima facie case is required here,because this is not a typical discriminatory discharge case,where a putatively employee is terminated and replaced by someone outside the protected class.because fairview claims it terminated guessous because it lacked enough work for a bookkeeping position,this case is closer to a case,where unnecessary positions are eliminated,than it is to a typical discharge case.accordingly,adapting the final prima facie requirement to the facts of this case means that guessous was required to show that her job duties were absorbed by employees not in the protected class or otherwise show that fairview did not treat guessous protected characteristics neutrally when deciding to terminate her.see merillat metal spinners,cir.explaining that in a case,which involves the elimination of only one position,t he retention of an employee outside the protected class to perform the plaintiff duties is nothing more than a demonstration of more favorable treatment,particularly tailored to the factual circumstances of a case.given the undisputed evidence that guessous duties were absorbed by,employees,guessous has established a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge.the question,then,is whether guessous met her summary judgment burden of demonstrating a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make fairview proffered justification a triable issue.diamond colonial life accident ins,cir.the district court recognized that guessous offered three arguments,supported by the record,to rebut the proffered justification as pretextual the decision to terminate her was finalized minutes after she engaged in protected activity,no one else was terminated for the reasons provided by defendant,and she was terminated by her aggressor.guessous,wl,at.but the court concluded that n one of these could lead a reasonable jury to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that lack of work was not its true reason for terminating guessous.id.the court did not offer further reasoning in support of this legal conclusion.
as with the retaliation claims,the court observed that guessous position was not filled after her termination.id.as noted above,however,this is not a typical discharge case,so the fact that guessous was not replaced by a new hire does not prevent guessous from establishing pretext and thus is not fatal to her claim.whether or how this played into the court analysis,however,is unclear because replacement by a person outside the protected class is a prima facie element of a discrimination claim.king,at.the district court explicitly found that guessous had established a prima facie case,so to the extent it relied on the fact that the position was never filled to conclude she had not met her burden,the court opinion appears to be internally inconsistent.nor is there anything in the mcdonnell douglas framework that says a plaintiff must always introduce additional,independent evidence of discrimination.reeves,at.to the extent that the evidence supporting a plaintiff prima facie case also undermines the employer justification,that evidence may be called upon by the trier of fact in determining whether or not the proffered justification is pretextual.id.at.it is therefore not clear why the court felt guessous evidence of discriminatory purpose was outweighed by fairview evidence that it had not hired a replacement.
for largely the same reasons discussed in connection with guessous retaliation claims,the evidence in the record is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that fairview claim is a pretext for discrimination.fairview contends that it had been considering the elimination of guessous position for two to three years before she was terminated,but there is no evidence in the record documenting the existence of a evaluation of the need for guessous position.while fairview contends the wonderful girl emails sent by alexander on december,confirm the lack of work,a jury would be entitled to take those emails at less than,given that they were sent so soon on the heels of guessous conversation with washenko about his treatment of her,a conversation about which alexander had contemporaneous knowledge.moreover,the record evidence shows that other employees including those to whom guessous work was redistributed were not busy and yet kept their jobs.kara said to me,oh,my god,monica,i have nothing to do today.and kara like,i browsing pinterest,i just pinning this,pinning this,pinning that.and washenko even confirmed it that kara had nothing to do.more to the point,all of the evidence of washenko disparaging remarks and statements that muslims and middle easterners were crooks and untrustworthy support the allegation that the termination was a continuation of past discrimination,brought to a head by guessous complaint about that very discriminatory conduct.the record establishes a history of discomfort,distrust,and disparaging treatment directed at guessous,and it demonstrates a discriminatory animus on the part of washenko.
at oral argument,counsel for fairview attempted to distinguish between what it admitted were washenko inappropriate comments and guessous allegation that the termination was motivated by animus.oral argument.but guessous burden is only to produce sufficient evidence upon which one could find that the protected trait actually motivated the employer decision.hill lockheed martin logistics,cir.quoting reeves,at.that counsel believes the statements were inappropriate but not indicative of animus is of no moment a reasonable jury would certainly be entitled to reach a different conclusion.as this is the extent of guessous burden at the summary judgment stage,we reverse the district court and vacate the order of summary judgment with respect to counts i and iv.
in count ii,guessous alleges she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her race and seeks to recover under.in count v she makes the same allegation with respect to her religion,national origin,and pregnancy,seeking recovery under title vii.the elements of a hostile work environment claim are the same under either or title vii.spriggs diamond auto glass,cir.to prevail on a hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must show that there is unwelcome conduct that is based on the plaintiff protected characteristic which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiff conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment and which is imputable to the employer.okoli,at quoting city of hagerstown,cir.
because count v squarely presents a statute of limitations issue also implicating count ii,we address it first.the district court granted fairview motion for summary judgment on count v,finding that guessous title vii hostile work environment claim was time barred.to pursue a claim under title vii,a title vii charge must be filed with the eeoc within a statutorily defined period of time of either or days.e see also holland washington homes,cir.the district court found,and the parties agree,that the statutory period for this case is days.
a hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice,and the supreme court has held that such claims are subject to a continuing violation theory in determining whether an actionable hostile work environment claim exists,we look to all the circumstances,and p rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability.passenger morgan,emphasis added.in other words,even if most of the harassing conduct on which a plaintiff relies to establish her hostile work environment claim occurred outside the statutory period,the claim will be considered timely if at least one act continuing the violation occurred within the statutory period.furthermore,the plaintiff may recover for all of the harm resulting from the hostile work environment,not just those contributing acts that occurred during the statutory period.id.at if congress intended to limit liability to conduct occurring in the period within which the party must file the charge,it seems unlikely that congress would have allowed recovery for two years of backpay.
the discriminatory and retaliatory termination claims counts iv and vi survived the limitations inquiry because each of those counts was predicated on the termination itself,which occurred on march,just days before guessous filed her charge with the eeoc.guessous argued to the district court that the termination was also a constituent act contributing to the hostile work environment and that count v was therefore also timely.alternatively,guessous argued that washenko decision to remove her assignments from her in november after she returned from maternity leave was a constituent act supporting the hostile work environment claim and also occurred within the statutory period.
the district court held that d iscrete acts includ ing,inter alia,termination,failure to promote,denial of transfer and refusal to hire,as well as removing work assignments,are different from the hostile work environment claims and that,because such discrete acts are separately actionable,they can not comprise part of a hostile work environment claim.guessous,wl,at.that holding was in error.
in morgan,the supreme court held that a discrete act claim remains even if it is part of a series of related actions,some of which occurred during the limitations period.see id.at d iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.morgan thus establishes that the doctrine can not be used to pursue claims challenging discrete acts.
that,however,is not the issue in this case,as guessous does not rely on the doctrine to revive discrete acts.indeed,there are no discrete acts here the discrete acts about which guessous complains occurred only a few months before she filed her eeoc charge.instead,the issue in this case is whether discrete acts can be considered part of the series of separate acts that collectively create a hostile work environment,id.at,thus rendering a claim timely under the doctrine.
the supreme court has recently explained that in a case,the employee resignation is the culmination of the intolerable discriminatory conduct of the employer,such that the relevant limitation period starts with the employee resignation,not the last act of the employer.see green brennan,wl at may.if a constructive discharge can be part and parcel of a discriminatory pattern of conduct,we see no reason that a discrete act can not.so long as the act is part of the pattern of discriminatory treatment against the employee,then that act should be sufficient for purposes of the doctrine,even if the act would otherwise qualify as a discrete act that is independently actionable.
in green,the supreme court also clarified the holding in morgan to be that a claim includes every act composing that claim,whether those acts are independently actionable or not.wl at emphasis added.it pointed out that even if a claim of discrimination based on a single discriminatory act is time barred,that same act could still be used as part of the basis for a claim,so long as one other act that was part of that same claim occurred within the limitations period.id.at emphasis added citing morgan,at.as such,the district court conclusion that neither the withdrawal of work from guessous nor her termination were facts that could support her title vii hostile work environment claim was erroneous.because the work assignments were withdrawn in november,and the termination occurred in march,both constitute facts within the statutory period which contributed to the hostile work environment and make that claim timely.
with respect to count ii,the district court granted summary judgment for fairview,holding that only one of washenko comments was racially derogatory,that this was the only unwelcome conduct alleged to be based on guessous race,and that this was insufficiently severe or pervasive conduct to support a hostile work environment claim under.
hostile work environment claims under are subject to a four year limitation period.white bfi waste,llc,cir.because guessous filed her complaint in the district court on february,unwelcome conduct occurring on or after february,falls within the statutory period.as already discussed,however,hostile work environment claims under title vii are also subject to the continuing violation theory for establishing limitations periods which can make the defendant liable for conduct occurring prior to the statutory period as well.as there was relevant conduct that occurred before february,this court must decide whether the same continuing violation theory applies in cases.
four of our sister circuit courts of appeal have ad
