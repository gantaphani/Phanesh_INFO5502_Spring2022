after brief stints as the human resources director of two puerto rico governmental agencies,plaintiff appellant rosemarie sued her former supervisors seeking redress under and the laws of puerto rico.the district court dismissed some of her claims at the pleading stage,and the rest at summary judgement.now appeals the dismissal of three of those claims.
specifically,first challenges the dismissal of her first amendment free speech claim,arguing that the district court erred in finding that her speech exclusively revolved around her professional responsibilities as human resources director.second,challenges the dismissal of a claim she made under the puerto rico whistleblowers protection act law,laws ann.tit,and takes issue with the court determination that she never engaged in the kind of whistleblowing activities protected under the statute.third,challenges the judgment on her first amendment freedom of association claim.according to,the court erred in holding the first amendment inapplicable to her position as human resources director.
after careful consideration,we affirm the district court on all fronts.
after the new progressive party npp won puerto rico november general elections,a npp affiliate became the human resources director of the puerto rico permits and regulation administration spanish acronym arpe.shortly thereafter,defendants appellees,humberto marrero recio and jorge garcía faneytti,also npp affiliates,were respectively appointed as the first and second in command at arpe,marrero,and garcía appear to have coexisted without conflict during their first months at arpe.
things changed in may when an npp primary election pitted and marrero candidates against each other.when marrero learned that stood in a different camp for the election,he prohibited her from campaigning in favor of her candidate.marrero also threatened her by stating that he did not want to learn that she voted in the primaries for her candidate.voted for her candidate anyway,and a few days after the election,marrero told that he knew how she had voted and that,from that point on,she was not allowed to engage in any political activities.marrero also enlisted some of his subordinates at arpe to spy on.a clandestine newsletter circulating at arpe stated that was being videotaped and that she held a parallel job.later learned that a subordinate of marrero was responsible for the publication of the newsletter and that marrero exerted control over its content.
and marrero also butted heads when it came time to implement the special act declaring a state of fiscal emergency,also known as law.as arpe human resources director,was responsible for determining and reporting the agency employees years of service to a stabilization board created under law.the board was required to determine the respective seniority of each employee in order to make downsizing decisions.employees could challenge the board determinations within a period of days.
in an attempt to prevent the possible layoff of certain npp employees under law,marrero instructed to falsify their personnel records by increasing their years of service.she refused,and,a few days later,garcía made the same request.but reaffirmed her position and explained that the same employees had failed to challenge the calculated time within the term established by law and t hat it was illegal for her to change the numbers adjudicated by the stabilization board.
unable to impose his will over,marrero entrusted one of his subordinates with reviewing employees challenges to the computations made by the stabilization board.marrero then instructed to certify the work of his subordinate without validating the information provided to her.she refused and told marrero that the internal auditor,the it director,the license supervisor,and human resources personnel would verify the calculations.
and marrero working relationship continued to deteriorate as she consistently refused to follow his politically motivated orders.for example,among other things,refused to acquiesce to marrero wishes to reinstate an npp employee who was previously terminated because of dishonesty ignore an office of government ethics request for information as to possible unethical conduct at the agency disregard personnel related inquiries made by npp employees considered to be traitors because they were friends with employees affiliated with the opposing party and arbitrarily transfer an arpe employee as punishment for supporting the opposing party.in refusing to act as instructed,told marrero that his requests could not be legally justified and would surely bring upon them negative legal repercussions.marrero responded that he was disappointed with her failure to act according to his wishes.and when reinstated the duties of another employee affiliated with an npp opponent,marrero responded by having an employee under his direct supervision threaten her,stating that those who do not follow our instructions gestured by passing a finger across his neck and we know where your husband works and where your daughter studies.
tendered her resignation on october,effective on december.a few days later,however,received an offer to become the human resources and labor relations director for the puerto rico public buildings authority spanish acronym aep under the direction of defendant appellee jesús méndez rodríguez together with marrero and garcía,defendants.she accepted the offer and changed the effective date of her resignation to october.but during first day at aep,méndez summoned her to a meeting and informed her that she was being terminated immediately because marrero had threatened to cause problems if she was employed at the agency.as left the aep building,she came across an edition of arpe clandestine newsletter already in circulation stating that she had been immediately terminated from aep.
filed her complaint on october,and amended it on january.divided count one of her amended complaint into two sections.the first section claimed that she had been constructively discharged at arpe,and then discharged at aep,due to her allegiance with an npp faction disfavored by defendants,in violation of her first amendment freedom of association rights.the second section claimed first amendment free speech violations in the form of retaliation on account of her refusal to partake in the illegal actions requested by marrero and garcía.law claim was pled in count five of the amended complaint,which stated that defendants took an adverse employment action against plaintiff because of her whistleblowing actions.
in due course,defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing first amendment retaliation claim as well as her law claim.in so holding,the court rejected contention that the complaint sufficiently pled retaliation based on the different actions marrero and garcía took upon her refusal to follow orders that she considered illegal and politically motivated.the court reasoned that speech was made in response to marrero orders pursuant to her professional activities and,therefore,d id not fall under the first amendment protections.in connection with law claim,the court agreed with defendants that the complaint failed to allege the misuse of public property or public funds required for a valid whistleblowing claim under that law.
once discovery concluded,defendants moved for summary judgment in connection with first amendment freedom of association claim and the remaining state law claims.as relevant here,they argued that human resources positions at arpe and aep were trust and positions exempted from the protection of the first amendment.in opposition,stated that the responsibilities of her positions resembled those of a technocrat and not a policymaker given that law had stripped her job of any discretion and severely curtailed her supervisory duties.in a thorough,opinion,the district court sided with defendants,and this appeal timely ensued.
ii.discussion 
challenges to the pleading stage dismissals 
we review the district court ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo,accepting all facts in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir gargano liberty int l underwriters,cir.dismissal for failure to state a claim is warranted when the complaint lacks sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.we make this determination through a holistic,analysis of the complaint,which,in some cases,can represent a formidable undertaking.see iqbal,at maldonado fontanes,cir.however,where,as here,a district court accurately takes the measure of a case,persuasively explaining its reasoning,and reaches a correct result,it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length in placing its seal of approval on the decision below.moses mele,cir.we therefore limit our discussion to the bare essentials.
first amendment retaliation claim 
our analysis begins with claim that defendants impinged on her first amendment rights in retaliating against her for refusing to partake in unethical,unlawful and discriminatory practices.she claims that her refusals constituted protected speech.we disagree.
under the test applicable here,the threshold inquiry is whether spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.see decotiis whittemmore,cir citing curran cousins,cir,and pickering bd.of,a dispositive factor in this determination is whether the speech underlying claim was made pursuant to her official duties.garcetti ceballos.if the answer to this inquiry is in the affirmative,then has no first amendment claim,since restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties.id.at.
as the district court correctly held,the speech underlying claim was made pursuant to her duties as arpe human resources director.according to count one of her complaint,alleged protected speech consisted exclusively of several instances in which she communicated to marrero and garcía her reluctance to undertake actions that she deemed either illegal or unethical.in other words,speech solely focused on events at her workplace and was made exclusively to fulfill her responsibilities as arpe human resources director.this type of communication is the quintessential example of speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities and thus is not protected under the first amendment.see,garcetti at finding the first amendment free speech clause inapplicable to prosecutor memo on the proper disposition of a pending criminal case as it was written in conjunction with his professional responsibilities and it was part of what he was paid to do foley town of randolph,cir finding no first amendment protection where the chief of the fire department addressed the media in an official capacity during a press conference when he was on duty,in uniform,at the scene of a fire,and speaking alongside the state fire marshal on matters concerning the fire department funding.for that reason,is unable to state a plausible claim for relief and our decotiis inquiry ends.
contends that the district court disregarded allegations stating that she suffered retaliation for participating in the npp primary election against marrero wishes,however,did not premise her first amendment retaliation claim on those allegations.count one,subsection b entitled retaliation of her first amended complaint makes plain that retaliation claim arose out of marrero and garcía actions in connection with her refusal to go along with their alleged illegal orders 
defendants violated plaintiff first amendment rights as she suffered d efendants retaliation for refusing to follow politically motivated illegal employment actions to favor members of her own party,and for opposing orders from the codefendants to injure members of the opposing party engaged in protected speech while refusing to follow the unethical,unlawful and discriminatory practices ordered by d efendants.
similarly,opposition to defendants motion to dismiss restated that defendants retaliation was due to plaintiff refusal to violate the law and her duties as a public servant in order to accommodate defendants requests to favor their political protegees and to illegally affect others that were not the district court therefore had no reason to factor into its analysis of retaliation claim the allegations concerning her participation in the npp primary elections.see rivera gomez de castro,cir judges are not expected to be mindreaders.consequently,a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly or else forever hold its peace.internal citation and quotation omitted.neither do we.united states slade,cir it is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court,she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.
let us be perfectly clear.we in no way condone conduct of the type that attributes in her complaint to marrero and garcía.but federal law does not provide a remedy for every kind of misfeasance by a local official,no matter how unattractive,and has not plausibly alleged a timely argued violation of any federally assured right.
next,we consider contention that her complaint plausibly pled a law whistleblowing claim.law was enacted to protect 
the rights of public employees and officials who disclose information or testify on alleged improper or illegal acts regarding the use of public property or funds that due to their nature constitute acts of government corruption or fall within the ethical conduct regulated by our legal system.
laws ann.tit.emphasis added.its provisions,among other things,make it illegal to dismiss,threaten,or discriminate against any public employee who discloses or attempts to disclose,before any official or employee with investigative functions or before a state or federal legislative,administrative or judicial forum,the improper or illegal misuse of public funds,acts of corruption,abuse of authority,or other qualified information.laws ann.tit,a,b.therefore,in order to lay out a plausible whistleblowing cause of action under law,the statute plain language calls for a complaint to state three threshold allegations that the plaintiff was aware of qualified information that she reported or attempted to report that information to an investigatory agent or to a forum with administrative,legislative,or judicial authority and that she was retaliated against on account of such reporting or attempted reporting.
in dismissing law claim,the district court held that complaint had not alleged that she ever reported the misuse of public property or public funds disagrees and argues that marrero and garcía orders in connection with the report provided to the stabilization board constituted acts of financial malfeasance directly falling under law purview.she reasons that the stabilization board was to use that report in implementing decisions,and that marrero and garcía orders would have eventually impacted public funds,however,never raised this argument below.in fact,the following sentences encompass the entire extent of memorandum in opposition to the dismissal of her law claim plaintiffs averments amply showed the corrupted conduct engaged by the d efendant s.thus,defendant s law argument is meritless.accordingly,we need not consider contentions at this juncture.slade,at.in any event,even if we were to do so,the fact remains that complaint nowhere alleges that she ever disclosed or attempted to disclose marrero and garcía alleged financial wrongdoing to anybody with investigating authority,or to an otherwise qualified forum,and this in itself is fatal to her contentions under law whistleblowing provisions.
in the alternative,argues that the district court construed law too narrowly in limiting its application to instances of financial malfeasance reporting.in support,she alludes to subsection b of law,which,in pertinent part,provides that n o public employee who has authority to influence,recommend or approve any action,shall make adverse or discriminatory decisions regarding any public official or employee for r efusing to obey an order to carry out an act or omission that would bring about the violation of a law or regulation.law ann.tit,b emphasis supplied.also underscores complaint allegations specifically stating that marrero and garcía discriminated against her because she refused to carry out orders that would have violated the law.
her contentions on this front appear to have some merit.after all,the allegations she brings to our attention seem to depict the exact same conduct prohibited under b.nevertheless,failed to raise this argument during the district court proceedings.in fact,when defendants moved to dismiss her law claim,they argued that she exclusively asserted whistleblowing claims responded with the pair of perfunctory,generic sentences highlighted above,and never argued that b was implicated in this case.is therefore in no position to challenge the application of law on grounds that she failed to raise before the district court,namely,that her claim was premised on subsection b.united states ex rel.estate of cunningham millennium labs.of ca,cir if any principle is settled in this circuit,it is that,absent extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.citations omitted.
challenge to the summary judgment order 
last,we consider argument that the district court erred when summarily dismissing her first amendment freedom of association claim.we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo,wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir,and affirm when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.farmers ins.exch.rnk,cir.even though we are not wedded to the district court rationale,and can affirm on any ground made manifest by the record,town of agawam,cir,when the lower court produces a decision,as in the present case,we generally track the court steps and refrain from writing at length,lawton state mut.life assur.of,cir.
in the first circuit,it is a settled principle that the first amendment does not protect all government employees from layoffs based on affiliation.flynn city of boston,cir.we employ a test to determine whether a particular public employee can be properly terminated on account of affiliation.first,we look to whether the discharging agency functions entail decision making on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.rosenberg city of everett,cir quoting roldán plumey cerezo suárez,cir internal quotations omitted.then we determine whether the particular responsibilities of the plaintiff position resemble those of a policy maker,privy to confidential information,a communicator,or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement for continued tenure.id.
here,on the first prong,we find that both discharging agencies,arpe and aep,are involved in on issues for which there is room for political disagreement.on the one hand,arpe,among other things,is charged with the administration of the permit process for every construction project in puerto rico.we thus agree with the district court in velázquez quiñones,d,that the agency plays a vital role in the implementation of any administration urban planning policies.it is certainly not difficult to fathom how different political factions could disagree on these policies,and it is therefore evident that arpe functions entail on politically contentious issues.
likewise,aep is an agency responsible for implementing politically sensitive policies.the aep is a public corporation whose board includes four people appointed by the governor of puerto rico.soto padró pub.bldgs,cir.the aep directs the preparation of plans for all buildings and other facilities related to the provision of government services,such as schools and hospitals,and is empowered to contract with private entities to own,lease,finance,or repair such facilities.laws ann.tit.in juarbe angueira arias,cir,we held that the aep mission at least potentially concern ed issues and granted aep administrator qualified immunity on plaintiff political discrimination claim.since this decision,we have witnessed a number of developments at the aep and can now firmly state that the agency mission definitely,not merely potentially,concerns politically charged issues.most significant of these developments is a amendment to the agency enabling statute,laws ann.tit,that mandated,as a matter of public policy,all governmental entities to promote and support the contracting of the services of the aep in order to fulfill the design,construction,remodeling,improvements,operations and maintenance needs of the structures needed for rendering their services.as governmental organizations are now obligated to use the aep services,the agency has absolute authority over the amount of money and resources that will be allocated for various repair,construction,and maintenance projects.the political disposition of a given administration may thus greatly factor into the scope of such aep projects.
as it is clear to us that both agencies functions entail on politically charged issues,we move to the second prong of the test that is,to evaluate whether particular responsibilities resembled those of a.jiménez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir citing tomczak city of chicago,cir.in making this determination,we look first to the position job description rather than the employee actual de facto responsibilities,finding this to be the best,and sometimes a dispositive,source for determining the position inherent functions.roldán plumey,at.we also consider the position relative pay,technical competence,power to control others,authority to speak in the name of policymakers,public perception,influence on programs,contact with elected officials,and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders.steeves,cir internal citations omitted.
official job description at arpe called for performing duties related to the direction,coordination,supervision and evaluation of the activities conducted in the various sections of the human resources office ensuring application and compliance of the laws and regulations related to the merit system and to personnel administration and preparing confidential reports and participating in the formulation and implementation of public policy regarding the administration of human resources in the agency as the aep human resources director,she would have been in charge of the enactment and implementation of the labor management policy,as well as the planning,coordination,and supervision of the programs and activities that are developed in the human resources and labor affairs office.
according to both job descriptions,the human resources director positions at the agencies have inherent,or at the very least,policy implementation authority.as noted by the district court,both positions are the highest human resources positions in their respective agencies,and both are trust positions which answer only to the agencies administrators.moreover,the job descriptions either explicitly state or implicitly suggest that the human resources director has access to confidential information.crucially,both positions are the conduit between the agencies administrators and staff.even if the human resources director of either agency only relays policy from the administrator to the staff,she is still in a position to implement policy,which the supreme court has noted is just as important as policymaking.branti finkel.moreover,the human resources director of both agencies has authority to speak on behalf of policymakers,as well as influence to carry out the programs of their superiors.as such it appears evident that the second prong of the rosenberg inquiry is satisfied,and political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for employment,since both human resources director positions clearly resemble top level policymakers in their respective agencies.
attempts to sidestep these realities by claiming that law limited her inherent responsibilities so as to strip her of discretion over any human res
