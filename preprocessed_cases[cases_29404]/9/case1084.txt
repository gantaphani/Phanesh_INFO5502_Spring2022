background 
ruotolo was an nypd sergeant with years service when he retired in.in october,ruotolo was serving as the training and safety officer for the precinct in the bronx.when a local newspaper reported possible contamination and health risks at the precinct from underground gasoline storage tanks,ruotolo was his capacity as safety survey employee illnesses and deaths that might be related to this potential environmental hazard.his report,dated october,the october report,and titled survey pursuant to request,identified a seemingly large number of cancers,miscarriages,birth defects and other health problems afflicting individuals working at the precinct.ruotolo recommended a thorough environmental evaluation,which was done.
the environmental experts reported that leakage from the fuel storage tanks into the soil and air had raised contaminant levels above osha and epa safety standards.at great expense and over many months,the city undertook to abate the hazard.representatives of the patrolmen benevolent association pba came to the precinct in april to sign up potential plaintiffs for a personal injury lawsuit.one of the pba lawyers asked to speak with ruotolo because he was the author of the october report.as ruotolo testified in his march deposition in this lawsuit,he answered the pba questions with the knowledge of his commanding officer,spoke to no one else about the proposed lawsuit,did not himself enlist as a plaintiff,and never learned whether an action was filed.this encounter was not pled in any version of ruotolo complaint prior to dismissal of the action,but it is relevant to our analysis.
ruotolo alleges that he experienced retaliation starting soon after submitting the october report to his commanding officer,and continuing until he retired.the retaliation included frequent reassignments to undesirable shifts and to duties he considered beneath his rank and tenure,denial of use of leave time,transfer to a less desirable precinct,and discipline for trivial or fabricated reasons.after ruotolo alleged those acts of retaliation in the original complaint in this lawsuit,filed in july,ruotolo alleged in amended complaints that the retaliation took additional forms,including verbal harassment by superior officers,denial of overtime assignments,the first negative performance review of his career,and excessive discipline for a minor infraction.as a result of that discipline,ruotolo was put on modified duty,and was stripped of his badge,shield,identification card and weapons.he was still on modified duty when he retired on july,which meant he lost the privilege of carrying a firearm after retirement thus reducing his prospect for future income in the security field.based on these experiences,ruotolo attributed to the city a municipal custom and practice of tolerance of the violation of rights.
as compensatory damages,ruotolo alleges lost income and reduced pension benefits.ruotolo also seeks punitive damages,and an injunction to i expunge from his employment records the retaliatory disciplinary charges and performance reviews,and ii restore impaired retirement benefits and privileges.
the original complaint identified the october report as the single episode of speech underlying his first amendment claim.over the next three years of active litigation,ruotolo was twice given leave to amend his complaint,notably to add the filing of his lawsuit as the only of speech for which ruotolo alleged retaliation.by may,the parties had concluded extensive discovery,narrowed the claims through multiple dispositive motions various state law claims were dismissed on an earlier rule b motion,litigated numerous discovery and motions,and submitted their final joint pretrial order.
trial on ruotolo surviving claims was two weeks away when the supreme court ruled in garcetti ceballos that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline,d.upon the defendants renewed motion to dismiss,the district court ruled that the first amendment claim succumbed to garcetti because ruotolo admittedly wrote the october report in his capacity as safety officer,and because the lawsuit was premised solely on speech.as to the lawsuit,the court explained 
after garcetti,for a lawsuit adequately to charge a first amendment retaliation claim,the lawsuit must be predicated on speech made by a public employee as a citizen,and not pursuant to his or her official duties.to hold filing a lawsuit alleging retaliation for speech would give rise to a first amendment defy logic,allowing a plaintiff to bootstrap a objection to legitimate employer discipline into a valid first amendment claim.
emphasis in original.
in opposing the rule b motion,ruotolo unsuccessfully attempted to rehabilitate his complaint by reference to his deposition testimony about the april conversation with a pba representative.for the first time,ruotolo argued that he was not then speaking in his official capacity as safety officer and author of the october report,but rather was speaking as a private citizen on a health matter of public concern.as ruotolo had as yet never alleged the april pba conversation,the district court decided that the exchange with the pba was outside the pleadings and not properly considered on a motion to dismiss.
final judgment was entered on july.ruotolo moved to vacate the judgment and for leave to file a third amended and supplemental complaint.the district court denied vacatur because ruotolo failed to demonstrate a need to prevent manifest injustice or correct a clear error that would affect the outcome of the case.the district court also denied leave to amend to add the pba conversation because of undue delay,and the undue burden and prejudice that would result to defendants.ruotolo timely appealed these rulings and the final judgment.
discussion

on appeal,ruotolo concedes that garcetti mandates dismissal of the first amendment claim premised on the october report.ruotolo argues,however,that the district court erred in reading garcetti to require dismissal of the claim premised on his filing a federal lawsuit.we hold that ruotolo claim based on his lawsuit must fail because his lawsuit did not address a matter of public concern.
