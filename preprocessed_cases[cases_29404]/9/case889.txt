background 
in reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of rgrta and tiberio,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff s,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in their favor.in re omnicom.sec,cir quotation marks omitted.
lift line is an rgrta subsidiary that provides public transportation services for elderly and disabled persons.rivera,a hispanic of puerto rican descent,started working for lift line as a bus driver in and remained in that position at all relevant times.sometime in,dominic folino,the senior mechanic at lift line,began an affair with rivera,kimberly.kimberly and rivera divorced in or,after rivera learned about the affair,and kimberly married folino.rivera also remarried,in.other than a brief period in,rivera son lived with folino and kimberly from onward.the affair predictably ignited a deep personal conflict between rivera and folino at work.
as relevant to his claims of discrimination,rivera testified that between and folino called him a spic twice and a taco bell at least five times.rivera testified that there were several occasions on which he pulled into the lift line garage to find folino and tim driscoll,another lift line mechanic,chanting what that smell,look at the fat f,there is taco bell.during his deposition,talton confirmed that folino openly referred to rivera as a spic and a nigger spic outside of rivera presence on at least one occasion.talton further testified that folino looked at me and he said,mike,i not talking about you.a nigger can mean anybody.i talking about that spic,ralph rivera.
rivera also presented extensive contemporaneous evidence suggesting that folino and several other lift line mechanics regularly harassed and bullied him throughout this period,but without using ethnic slurs.rivera reported many of these instances of harassment to rgrta shortly after they occurred.for example,on april,rivera filed an incident report in which he asserted that mechanic john stiggins and another employee stopped and confronted him as he was driving out of the lift line parking lot after work.in may he followed up with a letter to lift line human resources department,claiming that folino and another mechanic had cursed and stared at him menacingly.in another letter four months later,rivera complained that folino had cursed at him again and tampered with his time card slot.rivera also alleged that lift line had ignored his complaints of harassment.none of these complaints referred to the use of ethnic slurs or harassment motivated by rivera national origin.
the following year,in june,folino filed an internal complaint of his own,claiming that rivera had threatened him.in september robert bilsky,lift line vice president for human resources,informed rivera that he had become aware of conflicts between rivera and folino due to problems in their personal home lives.bilsky said that he could find no proof of exactly who is right or wrong in this harassment complaint,but that he was extremely concerned about the ongoing hostility between folino and rivera.
although a change in shift times in late apparently reduced the frequency of interactions between rivera and folino at work,the conflicts between the two men resumed in.between march and september,rivera filed seven complaints about folino conduct,again accusing folino of threatening and harassing him.for example,rivera claimed that folino sprayed rivera with paint thinner,posted photos in the workplace of lavish gifts he had purchased for rivera son,stared menacingly at rivera,swerved his car toward rivera in the parking lot,and generally undermined rivera ability to do his job.rivera internal complaints employed the terms prejudice,harassment,and discrimination,but they did not mention or suggest that folino conduct involved ethnic slurs or was otherwise on account of rivera national origin.in his september complaint,rivera attributed folino behavior to their personal conflict,asserting that folino insist ed to bring these very personal issues to work causing a very uncomfortable and hostile work environment.talton testified,however,that it was during this time period that folino referred to rivera as a spic and nigger spic.
rivera first formally accused folino of harassment on account of national origin in march,when he filed a complaint with the new york state division of human rights nysdhr.the nysdhr complaint attributed the harassment to an old boys club,specifically of italian american descent that have a conspiracy against me and are trying to have me fired from lift line.as with rivera earlier internal complaints,the complaint alleged that folino,stiggins,tiberio,and others had engaged in boorish or harassing behavior directed at rivera,but failed to mention the use of ethnic slurs by any of his.
nysdhr notified lift line of rivera complaint by letter dated march.rivera claims that lift line retaliated against him thereafter.he testified that he was disciplined for insubordination twice in approximately or lift line rejected his request for a half day off for a doctor appointment,in violation of a collective bargaining agreement he was assigned particularly dirty buses to drive he once received his overtime pay two weeks late and after he was involved in a minor driving accident,folino unsuccessfully urged the lift line road supervisor to drug test him,even though company policy did not mandate it.
talton was hired by lift line in as a responsible for refueling,cleaning,and servicing the buses when the drivers returned from their runs.talton alleges that taunted him with racial slurs.during discovery,talton testified about two specific incidents in which john stiggins,a white mechanic,called him a nigger.he also presented evidence that his white supervisor,tiberio,used the same racial slur.
in the first of two incidents involving stiggins conduct on the lift line premises,stiggins told talton,i thought you was my boy,and,you know what i talking about,nigger.you were supposed to look out for us.the statement apparently referred to talton failure to cover for stiggins when a lift line dispatcher was looking for him.when talton responded,who are you calling nigger,stiggins aggressively approached talton and said we could do this right here.in the second incident,talton and stiggins were talking casually when stiggins abruptly announced that he had been out drinking with mingo sanhueza,a last night and that sanhueza had started talking about niggers.stiggins claimed that sanhueza had said that he wished all you niggers died.
talton further testified that his supervisor,tiberio,called him a nigger,and also told him to g et over it when he complained that his had used the slur.this testimony is consistent with a charge that talton filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in may,which asserted that his supervisor presumably tiberio responded to talton complaint about racial harassment by laughing and then telling talton that he should just suck it up and get over it,nigger in support of the defendants summary judgment motion,tiberio submitted an affidavit in which he denied that he ever used that or any other racial slur and similarly denied that talton complained to him about racial harassment.
talton also claims that he was racially harassed after he told lift line management that sanhueza,a bus driver,kept a gun on one of the buses.after discovering the gun while cleaning the bus,talton immediately called tiberio,who retrieved the gun and started an investigation.upset by the disciplinary hearing that followed,sanhueza threatened talton by shaping his hand in the form of a gun and saying,i going to kick your ass,nigger.sanhueza was initially terminated as a result of the gun incident.in september,however,sanhueza union settled with rgrta,and sanhueza was reinstated as a rather than a driver.somewhat ironically,talton was made responsible for training sanhueza in his new position.in october talton,tiberio,and sanhueza met to discuss the fact that some of the buses were not adequately cleaned.after the meeting,according to talton,sanhueza threatened talton and again called him a nigger.talton complained to tiberio,who sought disciplinary action,and sanhueza was permanently terminated sometime,it appears,in autumn.
in may talton filed his first charge of discrimination with the eeoc.the charge primarily recounted his encounters with sanhueza,but also reported that other including tiberio,as described above had called talton a nigger.in both his eeoc charge and in his deposition during discovery in this case,talton asserted that he had complained in letters to management about the incidents described above,but that lift line had failed to take remedial action.
after the initial may charge,talton filed two more eeoc charges of discrimination.the first of these charges,filed in august,alleged that tiberio warned talton that he could lose his job for filing the initial eeoc charge.the last eeoc charge was precipitated by internal complaints against talton that were filed by stiggins and edwin ayala,a,claiming that talton had made various menacing comments and false accusations in the workplace.their complaints quickly culminated in talton meeting with rgrta vice president of regional operations,debie himmelsbach,who told talton that she had received reports from several employees regarding behavior he had exhibited which made them uncomfortable and that he needed to be more careful in his relationships with other employees.talton charged that this counseling meeting with himmelsbach was held in retaliation for his first two eeoc charges.
talton also points to at least four other acts of retaliation,not all of which were described in his eeoc charges.first,he testified that he was disciplined three times for insubordination after filing his eeoc charges.second,he claims tiberio distributed copies of at least one of talton eeoc charges to and directed the other not to interact with him.third,talton submitted an affirmation from a asserting,among other things,that talton had been forced to clean buses containing blood and vomit after other employees had refused to do so.fourth,approximately one month after talton filed his first eeoc charge,an unidentified person called him a nigger and threw a brick at him.
district court proceedings 
rivera and talton jointly filed an amended complaint in may and,after discovery,tiberio and rgrta moved jointly for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion as to both plaintiffs,concluding that the harassment that rivera allegedly experienced arose from a personal conflict rather than rivera national origin,and that talton had presented evidence only of isolated incidents of crude and offensive language taking place over a period of several years.rivera rochester genesee reg l transp,d.after concluding that the plaintiffs could not establish adverse employment actions,or a causal connection between those actions and their protected activity,the court also dismissed both plaintiffs retaliation claims.id.
both plaintiffs timely appealed.

hostile work environment 
in order to establish a hostile work environment claim under title vii,a plaintiff must produce enough evidence to show that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.gorzynski,at quoting demoret zegarelli,cir in considering whether a plaintiff has met this burden,courts should examin e the totality of the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with the victim job performance.hayut state of,cir quotation marks omitted.moreover,the test has objective and subjective elements the misconduct shown must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive.alfano costello,cir quotation marks omitted.of course,i t is axiomatic that mistreatment at work,whether through subjection to a hostile environment or through other means,is actionable under title vii only when it occurs because of an employee protected characteristic,such as race or national origin.brown henderson,cir emphasis added.
with these principles in mind,and recognizing that there is no genuine dispute that rivera and talton each subjectively perceived his environment to be hostile and abusive,we review the hostile work environment claims of each plaintiff.
rivera presented evidence that folino,sometimes alone and sometimes with other lift line mechanics,harassed him based on his national origin and in a manner that interfered with his ability to do his job.we therefore disagree with the able and experienced district judge that rivera did not present any genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the mistreatment included ethnic slurs or otherwise reflected ethnic animus.
we recognize,however,that this is a close call.from to,rivera filed several complaints with rgrta human resources department regarding folino conduct,none of which referenced folino use of ethnic slurs or harassment based on national origin.indeed,rivera testimony that folino and others chronically directed ethnic slurs at him is somewhat belied by his early assertions that the hostile work environment he experienced was a result of his personal conflict with folino.for example,one of rivera complaints explicitly attributed folino harassment to their personal conflict,and criticized folino for bring ing these very personal issues to work causing a very uncomfortable and hostile work environment.rivera nysdhr complaint,which,in contrast to prior complaints,asserted that folino conduct constituted national origin discrimination,again made no reference to folino use of ethnic slurs or other ethnically based harassment.if the instances of ethnic were sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of rivera employment and create an abusive working environment,gorzynski,at quotation marks omitted,it is reasonable to expect rivera to have adverted to them at least once in his lengthy correspondence with rgrta human resources department as well as the nysdhr.
still,this issue is left for the jury to decide at trial,since rivera deposition testimony about folino use of ethnic slurs was not conclusory,and a reasonable jury could credit rivera testimony on this point,and discount the evidence demonstrating that folino harassment was not on account of rivera national origin.see redd div.of parole,cir.we arrive at this conclusion for three reasons.
first,rivera testified that folino or driscoll called him spic probably like three times.although rivera was unable to provide information about the specific timing and circumstances of these spic slurs,he testified more specifically that folino and driscoll together chanted another slur what that smell there is taco bell at least once after rivera pulled into a lift line garage.rivera variously testified that he heard the same chant anywhere from e very time he pulled into the garage to about five times.we are obliged to consider the defendants alleged uses of slurs cumulatively in order to obtain a realistic view of the work environment,aulicino dep t of homeless,cir quotation marks omitted,and to determine whether they alter ed the conditions of rivera employment and create d an abusive working environment,gorzynski,at quotation marks omitted.second,rivera testimony was corroborated by talton deposition testimony,and that of other witnesses who provided evidence about ethnically and racially hostile comments made outside of rivera presence,both about rivera and about talton.see schwapp town of avon,cir the district court appears to have reasoned that because only the first four incidents occurred in the plaintiff presence,only those four are relevant to this action.the district court failure to consider the totality of the circumstances in this case,including its selective treatment of the evidence in the record,was in error and necessitates reversal.internal citations omitted perry ethan allen,cir since one of the critical inquiries with respect to a hostile environment claim is the nature of the environment itself,evidence of the general work atmosphere is relevant.third,in addition to the evidence of the use of ethnic slurs,rivera offered detailed testimony about extensive bullying and physical harassment by folino and others that occurred during the relevant period.a reasonable jury could conclude that the alleged incidents of harassment in the record,including the slurs,constituted more than mere offensive utterance s.hayut,at see richardson state dep t of corr,cir,abrogated on other grounds by burlington santa fe ry.white,d burlington northern 
rivera harassment claim does not present circumstances like those found appropriate for summary judgment in jeffreys and rojas.in jeffreys,for example,we held that summary judgment was proper where the plaintiff case relied entirely on testimony and,prior to giving that testimony,the plaintiff made multiple admissions that were inconsistent with his later testimony and that he failed to explain away with any plausible explanation.at quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff,percy jeffreys,brought suit against several police officers who allegedly assaulted him with a flashlight before throwing him out of a window.jeffreys account of the incident at his deposition differed on all points from several accounts that jeffreys gave shortly after the incident happened.on at least three occasions jeffreys confessed to having jumped out of the window,and made no mention of any police misconduct.id.at.similarly,a t his arraignment,guilty plea,and sentencing,jeffreys made no mention of any beating or defenestration,and medical records also appeared to belie his claim,id.at.during his deposition testimony,moreover,jeffreys was unable to provide any specific details about the incident,and the testimony was corroborated only by two family members who submitted affidavits that established,at best,what jeffreys had told them about the incident sometime after it occurred.id.at.we concluded that i n the circumstances presented in the instant case where the district court found nothing in the record to support plaintiff allegations other than plaintiff own contradictory and incomplete testimony,and the district court,even after drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,determined that no reasonable person could believe jeffreys s testimony,the district court did not err by awarding summary judgment.id.at alteration in original quotation marks omitted see also rojas,at summary judgment properly granted to defendants where plaintiff relied almost entirely on her own testimony,which was contradicted by contemporaneous letters and meeting notes suggesting that the plaintiff had complained only of general friction with her supervisor,as opposed to sexual harassment 
here,by contrast,rivera does not allege the occurrence of something that he previously described as not happening.he claimed ethnic discrimination in his complaint to the administrative agency,as was required for purposes of exhaustion.in his administrative and court assertions he has not been inconsistent in claiming that he was subjected to ethnic slurs.any variance in those assertions has been in the number of times he was subjected to such slurs.that rivera did not complain of ethnic slurs to rgrta may lead a factfinder to find that claim not credible,but there is no real,unequivocal,and inescapable contradiction of the sort we contemplated in jeffreys and rojas,and matters of credibility are not to be determined on a motion for summary judgment.in addition,unlike in jeffreys or rojas,rivera testimony was corroborated by other independent evidence,including the testimony of talton.
further,although rgrta and tiberio suggest that rivera lacked detailed direct evidence of a hostile work environment based on his national origin,his testimony and talton testimony provided that evidence.we have cautioned that a hostile work environment claim need not be supported by direct evidence of explicit racial harassment.circumstantial evidence may do.see raniola bratton,cir explaining that a hostile work environment plaintiff may prevail by adducing circumstantial proof that adverse treatment that was not explicitly was,nevertheless,suffered on account of sex.nor was rivera required to demonstrate that his national origin was the only motivating factor.he needed to show only that a reasonable could conclude that race or national origin was a motivating factor in the harassment.see terry ashcroft,cir emphasis added.here,there was barely enough evidence both the use of of ethnic slurs and the broader bullying and physical harassment from which a reasonable jury could find that folino harassed rivera not merely because of their personal history,but also because rivera was puerto rican raniola,at.considering that evidence,together with the evidence of a racially hostile work environment for talton,his,in the light most favorable to rivera,and resolving all ambiguities in his favor,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the rgrta on rivera hostile work environment claim.
talton gave detailed and uncontradicted testimony indicating both that his supervisor directed the word nigger at him,and that directed the word at him in a physically threatening manner.for example,he specifically recounted that his,john stiggins,called him a nigger on at least two occasions,and that both times stiggins threatened him with physical violence,once by saying,we could do this right here,and another time by referencing a statement that he wished all you niggers died.similarly,talton testified that another,mingo sanhueza,called him a nigger and threatened him physically by shaping his hand in the form of a gun.in addition,talton testified that tiberio,his supervisor,called him a nigger,and that tiberio also told him to get over it when talton complained about racial harassment by.the claim involving tiberio was consistent with talton may eeoc charg
