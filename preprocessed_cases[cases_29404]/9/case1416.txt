frederick capps challenges the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of capps former employer,mondelez global,llc mondelez,one of the largest manufacturers of snack food and beverage productions in the united states.specifically,capps argues that the district court erred in granting mondelez summary judgment motion on capps claims that mondelez interfered with his rights under the family and medical leave act fmla,et acted in retaliation to capps proper use of fmla leave and violated the americans with disabilities act,as amended ada,et.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of mondelez.in so doing,we hold that an employer honest belief that its employee was misusing fmla leave can defeat an fmla retaliation claim.we also confirm that,under certain circumstances,a request for intermittent fmla leave may also constitute a request for a reasonable accommodation under the ada,but under the circumstances in this particular case,even assuming,arguendo,such a request was made,there is a lack of evidence that mondelez failed to provide any requested accommodation.
background 
mondelez predecessor,nabisco,hired capps in november.at all relevant times to this action,capps held the position of mixer,which required him to operate a mixing machine that makes dough.
mondelez has maintained a policy that an employee is entitled to fmla leave for a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of position.ja.an employee may use intermittent fmla leave when it is a medical necessity,and the employee must provide notice of the leave as soon as practicable.ja.
any employee who wishes to take fmla leave due to his own serious health condition must provide the company with a certification from his health care provider.company policy also provides as with all communications with the company,the submission of false information to the company regarding the need for fmla leave,or the fraudulent use of fmla leave,may result in discipline,up to and including termination.ja.
mondelez also has a policy entitled dishonest acts on the part of employees dishonest acts policy,which is considered a major rule.ja.violations of major rules are considered inexcusable offenses that will result in immediate suspension pending investigation,which could lead to termination.ja.mondelez dishonest acts policy includes the warning that the company will not tolerate dishonesty on the part of its employees,whether it be committed against the company,another employee,its customers,or others either during or after working hours and that any employee found guilty of a dishonest act would be subject to dismissal.ja emphasis in original.
capps suffers with avascular necrosis avn,which was described by aron guttin,capps treating physician,as a condition in which there is a loss of blood flow,severely limiting oxygen and nutrient delivery to the bone and tissues,essentially suffocating and causing death of those cells.ja.as a result of the avn,capps developed arthritis in both hips which necessitated bilateral hip replacement in or about.
he has experienced severe pain at times in the pelvic region,thighs and hips,sometimes lasting for days or weeks at a time.therefore,he requested intermittent time off from work when occurred.capps was certified for intermittent fmla leave following his hip replacements,and thereafter throughout his tenure at mondelez,he was continuously recertified approximately every six months for intermittent fmla leave for his condition until his employment was terminated in.
the certification supporting capps approved fmla leave covering january,through july,was completed by guttin who certified that capps was unable to perform certain job functions as a result of his condition.where the certification form required guttin to identify the job functions the employee is unable to perform,guttin responded that capps requires full bedrest during exacerbations.ja.
guttin further stated that t his year the episodes have been more severe and more frequent than years prior and that capps experiences temporary periods of inflammation that are debilitating and require medication and rest.ja.mondelez fmla administrator,workcare,approved this request under the fmla,and the approval noted that capps may need to be off work times every month for a duration of up to days per episode for incapacity and treatment appointments.ja.
on monday,february and tuesday,february,capps took fmla leave due to leg pain,and he returned to work for a full shift on wednesday,february.capps was scheduled to work on thursday,february,but he called mondelez phone system and the fmla message line on february th stating he would be late to work because of leg pain.later that day,he again called the fmla message line and mondelez phone system stating that he would be taking a full day of fmla leave since the pain had not subsided.guttin also signed capps fmla certification form dated february.
capps testified at his deposition that his wife was out of the country that week on a business trip and that because he did know how to cook,he had to call out or go out for his meals.ja.capps further testified that at approximately on the he drove to a local pub,which was not more than one and a half miles from his home,to get something to eat ja.according to capps,at the pub he also drank three beers and three shots of alcohol with his friends,and he spent approximately two and a half to three hours at the pub.afterwards,despite feeling too intoxicated to drive,capps attempted to drive home.
capps testified that after leaving the pub,at or around he was stopped by police.the bensalem township police drove capps to the hospital for a blood test,which resulted in a reading of a blood alcohol concentration level of more than four times the legal limit in pennsylvania.capps testified that he was released from jail early the next morning on friday,february.he further testified that he woke up on the probably about,and his legs were bothering him again.ja.he stated that he just hung around the house,just was feeling good and took some aleve again.ja.
capps was scheduled to begin his shift that friday afternoon at on february.however,on the,he called mondelez phone system and the fmla message line indicating that he would be using fmla leave due to leg pain.
capps returned to work on monday,february.upon returning to work,he performed the same work and received the same salary and benefits as before taking fmla leave.he did not report his arrest to anyone at mondelez nor was he required to under mondelez policies.upon recertification,capps was approved for fmla leave from july,through january.
on august,capps pled guilty to the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol dui,and he served hours in jail immediately following the guilty plea hearing.his sentence also included probation,costs and fines,and suspension of his driver license.
in early,william oxenford,a human resources hr manager at mondelez,became aware of capps dui conviction and sentence by finding in oxenford company mailbox a newspaper article reporting the same.oxenford asked barbara mcavoy,an employee in the hr department,and nancy pace,administrative assistant to the plant manager,to investigate capps attendance record to determine if capps had any absences during the time frame of capps arrest and conviction.
although neither oxenford nor mcavoy were attorneys,and they did not understand the meaning of all the docket entries,upon reviewing the criminal court docket related to capps conviction,oxenford and mcavoy noticed that capps arrest date and court dates appeared to coincide with days on which capps had taken fmla leave.for instance,capps arrest date,february,was a day on which capps had called out on fmla leave.he also called out on fmla leave the next day.in addition,he called out of work using fmla leave on other dates that appeared on the court docket june,appearance and waiver of arraignment and october,ard court.
oxenford and mcavoy confronted capps and his union representative with this information at a meeting on february.in response,capps promised to provide documentation to support his fmla leave on the days in question,and capps was suspended pending further investigation.
upon being suspended,capps submitted to mondelez an undated letter from guttin confirming the aforementioned dates capps had taken fmla leave during the week of february,due to his hip pathology ja.the undated letter further stated that capps had taken fmla leave on june and,due to his hip pathology,and also that he had a court date on june,but waived his right for that appearance.ja.oxenford was suspicious of the undated letter which included legal information from guttin regarding scheduled court dates and certain legal rights that capps had waived.mondelez subsequently received a nearly identical letter dated february,from guttin.
capps also submitted to mondelez an unsigned first page only of a letter dated may,addressed to capps from his attorney in the dui matter confirming some of the dates related to his dui action.on april,nearly two months after he was suspended and promised to provide documentation and one month after receiving notice of his termination,capps provided a complete copy of that letter.after capps had been terminated,he presented a second letter from his dui attorney dated march,confirming that capps attended court proceedings on may,and august,and that capps was incarcerated from august,to august.
capps was notified of his termination of employment by letter dated march,effective february.that decision was made by oxenford and the plant manager,rusty moore,in conjunction with mondelez legal department.the letter confirmed that capps termination was based on his violation of the dishonest acts policy.the termination letter further stated you claimed to be out due to fmla related issues on multiple dates.the documentation you produced does not support your claim of fmla related absences.ja.
following capps termination,mondelez retained the services of an investigator.the investigator reported on april,that a detective from the police department indicated that capps had been released from custody from his dui arrest at on the morning following the arrest.
capps completed a grievance form on march,claiming he was unlawfully terminated.ja.mondelez offered capps reinstatement without back pay on april,and capps rejected the offer of reinstatement on may.
capps initiated this lawsuit on july.he filed his second amended complaint on october,alleging claims of interference and retaliation in violation of the fmla,violations of the ada,and violations of the pennsylvania human relations act phra following discovery,mondelez filed a motion for summary judgment on july,and on that same date capps filed a for partial summary judgment on his fmla interference claim.
by memorandum and order filed november,the district court granted mondelez summary judgment motion and denied capps.see capps mondelez global llc,supp d.the district court granted summary judgment on capps fmla interference claim due to capps inability to show that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the fmla.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment on capps fmla retaliation claim because the record evidence showed that mondelez based its decision to terminate capps employment on an honest belief that capps misused that leave id.at.finally,the district court granted summary judgment on capps ada claim because,although capps requested and received intermittent leave under the fmla,he never made a request for an accommodation under the ada.id.at.

a fmla retaliation claim 
capps claims that mondelez discriminated against him in violation of the fmla by terminating his employment in retaliation for his use of fmla leave.since fmla retaliation claims require proof of the employer retaliatory intent,courts have assessed these claims through the lens of employment discrimination law.lichtenstein,at.accordingly,a claim such as capps fmla retaliation claim is assessed under the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,see ross,at citing lichtenstein,at.under the mcdonnell douglas framework,
a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.if the plaintiff succeeds,the defendant must articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the articulated reason was a mere pretext for discrimination.
ross,at citations omitted.
here,the district court found that,when viewing the facts in a light most favorable to capps,he is unable to sustain an fmla retaliation claim.see capps,supp d at.first,the district court found that capps can not establish a prima facie case because h e can not demonstrate that the proper use of his fmla leave a protected activity is causally connected to his termination.id.the court further found that e ven if capps could establish a prima facie case,he has not adduced any meaningful evidence that would allow a reasonable factfinder to find pretext.id.
as the district court found,even assuming,arguendo,that capps could establish a prima facie case of fmla retaliation,mondelez met its burden of demonstrating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory justification for capps discharge with evidence that capps was terminated for his misuse of fmla leave and dishonesty surrounding the leave in violation of mondelez policies.see mcdonnell douglas,at fuentes perskie,cir.fmla retaliation claims require proof of the employer retaliatory intent.lichtenstein,at emphasis added.where an employer provides evidence that the reason for the adverse employment action taken by the employer was an honest belief that the employee was misusing fmla leave,that is a legitimate,nondiscriminatory justification for the discharge.see,kariotis navistar int l transp,cir.quoting gustovich communications,cir.holding,where the employer provided evidence that it fired the employee because of an honest belief that the employee committed disability fraud,that arguing about the accuracy of the employer assessment is a distraction because the question is not whether the employer reasons for a decision are right but whether the employer description of its reasons is honest citation omitted.
in scruggs carrier,cir,where the evidence demonstrated that the employer held an honest suspicion that the employee was misusing his fmla leave at the time it made the decision to terminate the employee,the seventh circuit found that the evidence could not support a conclusion that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee for taking fmla leave.id.at.in affirming the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the employer,the seventh circuit in scruggs pointed out that the employee requested and was granted leave,took his approved leave,and returned to work the following day,and it was not until after the employer had received evidence of misconduct that the employee was terminated.see also arrigo link,cir.t he question is not whether the employer was correct to believe that the employee performed poorly,but rather whether he honestly believed that she did.
similarly,in pulczinski trinity structural towers,cir,the eighth circuit affirmed the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of an employer on an employee fmla discrimination claim on the basis of evidence of the employer honest belief that the employee violated company policy and the lack of evidence showing that the employer explanation was pretextual.id.at.the eighth circuit pointed out that this honest belief was a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the action and that t o prove that the employer explanation was false,the employee must show the employer did not truly believe that the employee violated company rules.id.at.in explaining the honest belief rule,the appellate court in pulczinski stated that the critical inquiry in discrimination cases like this one is not whether the employee actually engaged in the conduct for which he was terminated,but whether the employer in good faith believed that the employee was guilty of the conduct justifying discharge.id.at.the eighth circuit further explained the employee must present sufficient evidence that the employer acted with an intent to discriminate,not merely that the reason stated by the employer was incorrect.taken alone,that the employer belief turns out to be wrong is not enough to prove discrimination.id.at.
in medley polk,cir,an employee claimed that her employer fired her for taking fmla leave.in addressing an issue of first impression,id.at,the tenth circuit held that the trial judge erred in failing to give a requested honest belief defense charge to the jury,since an employer honest,albeit possibly mistaken,belief that an employee had committed fraud,defeats an employee fmla retaliation claim,id.at.in support of its holding,the tenth circuit pointed to the seventh circuit reasoning in kariotis discrimination statutes allow employers to discharge employees for almost any reason whatsoever even a mistaken but honest belief as long as the reason is not illegal discrimination.thus when an employee is discharged because of an employer honest mistake,federal laws offer no protection.id.at quoting kariotis,at 
here,as described above,mondelez provided evidence clearly supporting its legitimate,explanation for why capps was discharged its honest belief that capps misused his fmla leave and was otherwise dishonest in violation of mondelez policies.following capps avn diagnosis in and his bilateral hip replacements in,capps was continuously recertified for fmla leave during his tenure at mondelez approximately every six months through early.there is no indication that any of capps requests for fmla leave were denied or that he was prohibited from returning to work after taking his approved fmla leave.indeed,capps returned to the same position with the same benefits each time he returned from taking his leave,and he continued to take intermittent fmla leave without issue through the remainder of.moreover,there is no indication of any animus on the part of mondelez related to capps taking fmla leave prior to receiving notice of capps arrest and conviction.
it was not until oxenford received the newspaper article in alerting him to capps dui arrest and conviction,that oxenford began to investigate capps attendance record to determine if any of his fmla leave coincided with the dates related to his arrest and conviction.further,the undisputed evidence indicates that when oxenford and mcavoy reviewed the criminal court docket related to capps dui case,the docket reflected that the arrest date and court dates appeared to coincide with days on which capps had taken fmla leave.although capps argues that mondelez was mistaken in its belief that capps misused his leave or was otherwise dishonest with regard to the leave taken,there is a lack of evidence indicating that mondelez did not honestly hold that belief.accordingly,in light of insufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that mondelez legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for terminating capps employment was a pretext,the district court properly granted summary judgment on capps fmla retaliation claim.see mccoy,at t he issue of pretext does not address the correctness or desirability of reasons offered for employment decisions.rather,it addresses the issue of whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers.
b fmla interference claim 
to make a claim of interference under the fmla,a plaintiff must establish 
he or she was an eligible employee under the fmla the defendant was an employer subject to the fmla requirements the plaintiff was entitled to fmla leave the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of his or her intention to take fmla leave and the plaintiff was denied benefits to which he or she was entitled under the fmla.
ross,at citation omitted see also sommer vanguard,cir.observing that an interference claim requires an employee to show that he was not only entitled to fmla benefits but also that he was denied those benefits.unlike an fmla retaliation claim,a n interference action is not about discrimination,it is only about whether the employer provided the employee with the entitlements guaranteed by the fmla.callison city of,cir.see scruggs,at quoting shaffer am.med.ass n,cir.an fmla interference claim does not require an employee to prove discriminatory intent on the part of the employer rather,such a claim requires only proof that the employer denied the employee his or her entitlements under the act.accordingly,b ecause an fmla interference action is not about discrimination,a analysis is not required.sommer,at.
here,the district court found that capps fmla interference claim failed because capps was unable to satisfy the fifth requirement that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the fmla.see capps,supp d at.in support of its decision,the district court cited ross,where we found that b ecause the employee received all of the benefits to which he was entitled by taking leave and then being reinstated to the same position from which he left,and thus can not satisfy the fifth prong of the interference analysis,he fails to make a prima facie showing of interference.see ross,at.capps returned from his fmla leave,including the february and,fmla leave,to the same position and same benefits.ja.
capps argues that his termination amounted to a deprivation of benefits and therefore interference under the fmla.w e have made it plain that,for an interference claim to be viable,the plaintiff must show that fmla benefits were actually withheld.see ross,at citing callison,at.here,capps is unable to show that.under the specific circumstances in this case,since he is unable to point to evidence in the record indicating that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the fmla,mondelez was entitled to summary judgment on the fmla interference claim 
iv.ada claim 
finally,capps claimed in the district court that mondelez failed to accommodate his disability as required under the ada see capps,supp d at.the district court found that this claim fails as a matter of law because capps never made a request for an accommodation.id.
on appeal,capps devotes only one paragraph to his ada claim.specifically,he argues that r equests for intermittent leave may be protected by the ada and that a request for fmla leave does not bar an ada retaliation claim.see appellant br.emphasis added
