omar hoyos,a supervisor working for telecorp communications,was fired on october.the company said he was fired after he violated his superior instructions that he stay away from another employee,nancy alomar,who had complained that he had sexually harassed her.the specific event that precipitated the firing was hoyos decision to approach alomar on october,at a company booth she was staffing at an industry convention at the westin río mar resort.on october,alomar had a written complaint about the incident hand delivered to jaime pontón,a human resources manager at telecorp.alomar letter stated that hoyos had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment and intimidation,and indicated that alomar was considering legal action against telecorp.
hoyos filed suit on october,in a commonwealth court,having concluded weeks after he was fired,when he put together all the pieces and saw it clear ly,that he was fired because of discrimination on his sex.hoyos complaint alleged that his employment had been unlawfully terminated due to his gender in violation of the puerto rico constitution,and that the company had failed to pay him benefits as required by erisa.he also asserted claims that he was terminated without good cause in violation of puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,that he was discriminated against on the basis of his gender in violation of puerto rico law,id,that he was retaliated against in violation of puerto rico law,id.a,and that his termination violated the general torts statute,article of the puerto rico civil code,id.tit.the case was removed to federal district court,and after discovery,the court,on defendant motion,entered summary judgment against hoyos on all of his claims.we affirm.
on appeal,hoyos raises a preliminary issue regarding the effect of puerto rico law,id.tit,on the removed federal case,and then argues that entry of summary judgment was error.
puerto rico law 
hoyos asserts that after he filed his complaint in puerto rico court,telecorp had until november,to file responsive pleadings.telecorp did not do so,but rather on november filed a motion in puerto rico court requesting a extension of time in which to answer the plaintiff complaint.that motion was never acted on.on november,telecorp removed the case to federal court on the bases of diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction.see.thereafter,on december,telecorp asked the federal court for another extension to file an answer,which was allowed.telecorp then filed an answer in federal court on january.
the gist of hoyos argument is that when telecorp did not file responsive pleadings in puerto rico court by the november,due date,the clerk of the puerto rico court was required,under law,to enter a default judgment against telecorp,as hoyos had requested.hoyos argues that the federal court,on removal,was obliged by law to enter such a judgment on hoyos claims,and thus it was precluded from reaching the summary judgment motion.
telecorp brief unhelpfully replies that hoyos has waived the issue by not having moved within thirty days of removal to remand the case to the puerto rico court.see id.c a motion to remand a case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.caterpillar lewis,d once a defendant has filed a notice of removal in the federal district court,a plaintiff objecting to removal on the basis of any defect in removal procedure may,within days,file a motion asking the district court to remand the case to state court.quoting a prior version of c.
hoyos does not argue that a remand was required.instead,he asserts that the district court was obliged to enter a default judgment itself 
telecorp asserts that hoyos never brought the law issue to the attention of the district court.that assertion is not true.the issue was raised,albeit indirectly,in a motion filed eight months after removal and pressed explicitly three months later,on october.the district court never addressed the issue.
we bypass the waiver issue and assume that the law issue has been preserved.both here and in the district court,each side has missed the real issue,which is whether law concerns procedure or substance.
that is because a federal court sitting in diversity or exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims must apply state substantive law,but a federal court applies federal rules of procedure to its proceedings.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d see also erie tompkins.reed,concurring in part n o one doubts federal power over procedure.
law provides 
the clerk of the court shall serve notice on the defendant,with a copy of the complaint,warning him that he shall file his answer in writing,with proof of having served copy thereof on counsel for complainant,or on the latter if he has appeared in his own right,within ten days after said service of notice,if made in the judicial district where the action is instituted,and within fifteen days in all other cases,and also warning said defendant that,should he fail to do so,judgment shall be entered against him,granting the remedy sought,without further summons or hearing.the judge may extend the term to answer only on motion of the defendant,which shall be served on counsel for complainant,or on the latter if he appears in his own right,setting forth under oath the reasons said defendant may have therefor,if from the face of such motion the judge finds just cause.in no other case shall the court have jurisdiction to grant such extension.
laws ann.tit,emphases added.
it is clear that this is a local procedural rule,which does not and can not govern proceedings in federal court.rather,the entry of default judgment in federal court is governed by federal rule of civil procedure.see gasperini,at.it is settled that if a federal rule of civil procedure in point is consonant with the rules enabling act,and the constitution,the federal rule applies regardless of contrary state law.hanna plumer,d similar.the federal court granted defendant an extension of time to answer,and defendant answered within that period.there was no error in not entering default judgment against telecorp.

the district court correctly summarized the undisputed facts.we hold,on de novo review of the undisputed record,that hoyos has not met his burden of showing that he was not fired for good cause and of showing that his dismissal was the result of gender discrimination.that conclusion suffices to uphold summary judgment on all of hoyos puerto rico law claims.hoyos has waived his erisa claim on appeal.see united states zannino,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
hoyos was employed by telecorp from march,to october.he was on notice of telecorp detailed and policy.hoyos was promoted to director of telecorp sales organization on january.during his years of employment,hoyos received excellent evaluations,merit increases,bonuses,and prizes.
on april,hoyos attended a business conference at the intercontinental hotel in isla verde,puerto rico.after the conference,hoyos suggested to a group of employees that they go next door to the san juan hotel for drinks.nancy alomar,who reported directly to hoyos,joined hoyos for drinks.at close to midnight,hoyos walked alomar to her car in the back of the parking lot of the intercontinental.alomar then gave hoyos a ride to his own car.
shortly thereafter,alomar filed an internal company complaint alleging that hoyos had sexually harassed her.alomar initially approached human resources manager pontón to complain about hoyos behavior.as recounted by pontón,alomar described the incident as follows.after hoyos had walked alomar to her car,hoyos got into her car without her having invited him to do so.alomar then drove hoyos to his car.hoyos told her to give him a kiss,and then he grabbed her shoulders with both hands,trying three times to kiss her.alomar moved her face to avoid being kissed on the mouth,and hoyos kiss landed on her cheek.she said she protested,asking hoyos what he was doing and saying that he was her boss and that he should let her go.alomar was asked to keep the complaint and investigation confidential.hoyos was notified of the complaint.he denied the charges but admitted that he had given alomar a goodnight kiss on the cheek.the company investigated the charges the results were inconclusive.
before the incident that precipitated the sexual harassment complaint,hoyos had recommended that alomar be laid off.the decision about whether she would be fired was made in may,after alomar had filed her complaint.alomar was not laid off.
in may,on hoyos recommendation,telecorp restructured the corporate sales area for business reasons.one benefit of the reorganization,in light of the sexual harassment allegation,was that alomar no longer reported to hoyos instead,she reported to luis cruzado,the corporate sales manager.raúl burgos,president and general manager and hoyos direct supervisor,stated that telecorp was hopeful that could provide an adequate buffer between hoyos and alomar to allow them both to work productively.
the company had made a conscious decision to separate alomar and hoyos and to minimize the contact between them.with that in mind,burgos and pontón verbally instructed hoyos to stay away from a telecorp marketing booth at an upcoming july industry convention because alomar would be present in the booth.hoyos was given specific instructions not to be present in the exhibition area where alomar would be located.alomar was similarly instructed to avoid hoyos.both complied with the instruction.
burgos stated that from that point forward,there was coordination of attendance at industry conferences and conventions such that hoyos and alomar would alternate days at telecorp booth as burgos put it i t was agreed between all three parties,the company,alomar,and hoyos,that this will be the days that one will be at the booth,and the other one would not be present.that was the agreement.that was a direct order.
in august,cruzado,to whom alomar reported,resigned for unrelated reasons.in order to keep hoyos and alomar separated,the company told hoyos to funnel all business communications with alomar through pontón.
in september,telecorp restructured its sales organization.the reorganization had grown out of telecorp merger with at t wireless and had been under consideration for some time.after alomar complaint,the company expedited implementation of the reorganization plan.as part of this reorganization,hoyos title and responsibilities changed.previously,he had been the director of telecorp entire sales organization.after the reorganization,the sales organization was split into three channels,each with its own director.hoyos became the director of alternative distribution channels and also was given responsibility for developing two new business channels.hoyos suffered no loss of salary or stock options as a result of the reorganization,and he had a likelihood of earning more money.after the reorganization,alomar reported to josé detres,who was the new director of the corporate channel.
in october,telecorp participated in a sales and marketing executive sme convention.hoyos says he was not specifically instructed to stay away from telecorp marketing booth at the sme convention.he does admit that he was given such specific instructions as to the july trade show.on october,hoyos visited telecorp booth at the sme convention,where alomar was working.alomar contacted pontón to complain pontón called burgos and told him about the complaint.burgos met with hoyos.hoyos admitted that he had stopped by the booth.he said that he had done so because he wanted to visit the people working at the booth.
after learning of alomar complaint about the sme convention,corporate counsel jeanne habib met with alomar in person to confirm that hoyos had visited her at the telecorp booth.alomar said that she was upset that hoyos had been there,contrary to the company instructions to them both,and that he had stared at her in an intimidating fashion.habib observed that alomar was visibly and physically upset,and later stated that alomar had appeared visibly shaken by the event.habib also interviewed another telecorp manager,wency baerga,the director of retail sales,who had visited the booth with hoyos.baerga said hoyos had insisted on going to the booth.habib then called hoyos to confirm that he had visited the telecorp booth at the sme convention.
on october,alomar sent,by messenger,a letter to pontón.burgos and habib were copied on the letter.the letter detailed the problems that alomar had had with hoyos and expressed her feelings that she had suffered both personally and professionally as a result of hoyos behavior towards her.she specifically noted the sme convention incident,stating that when hoyos visited the booth,he stayed close to her with the clear intention of exerting emotional pressure on her performance and of continuing to intimidate her in her vulnerable position.the letter also indicated alomar displeasure with the actions taken by telecorp in response to her complaints.it concluded by noting the legal alternatives available to alomar and by requesting a written response from teleco
