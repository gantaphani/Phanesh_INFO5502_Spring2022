defendants javier velez and james lukeson,officers in the new york city police department nypd,and defendant gary calhoun,an nypd sergeant,appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york following a jury trial before jack weinstein,judge,ordering velez and lukeson each to pay plaintiff leroy davis in compensatory and punitive damages,and ordering calhoun to pay davis in compensatory and punitive damages,on davis claims brought under for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and denial of a fair trial.davis had been arrested by defendants,leading to a federal prosecution on charges of possession of narcotics and a firearm,but he was acquitted on all counts.on appeal in the present case,defendants contend principally that they are entitled to a new trial because of various evidentiary rulings,including the admission of hearsay evidence as to statements by a person who said he had planted the drugs and firearm that defendants claimed to have found in davis possession,and because of improprieties in the jury deliberations.lukeson and calhoun also contend that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law dismissing davis claims against them for malicious prosecution.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that defendants contentions provide no basis for reversal.
background 
the present civil action has its origin in defendants arrest of leroy davis leroy or davis in.the differing versions of that event,and davis evidence as to how the arrest came to pass,are described in the district court opinion denying defendants motions for a new trial,see davis velez,d,familiarity with which is assumed.
defendants arrested plaintiff davis on october.they claimed that one of them saw plaintiff furtively drop a plastic bag on a public sidewalk,heard a metallic clink that sounded like a gun,and found a gun and crack cocaine inside the bag.based on evidence supplied by defendants,plaintiff was indicted by a federal grand jury after spending thirteen months in jail awaiting trial,plaintiff was tried on federal gun and drug charges.he was acquitted of all charges.
d at.after his acquittal,davis commenced the present action pursuant to for,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,false arrest,malicious prosecution,and denial of a fair trial.
defendants version of the arrest 
defendants testified that in the early hours of october,they were in an unmarked car,dressed in plainclothes,on an overnight patrol in brooklyn,new york.see trial transcript tr.as they turned a corner and drove slowly along the block of chauncey street or chauncey,velez,sitting in the back seat of the car,saw a man davis walking down the block,carrying a black plastic bag.velez testified that davis glanced back toward the officers and then dropped the bag,and velez heard what sounded like the metallic sound that a firearm makes when it hits the ground.without saying anything to his colleagues,officer velez jumped out of the slowly moving car and asked the pedestrian what was in the bag.d,d at.when davis responded garbage tr,velez looked in the bag and saw a bottle of soda,a box of chicken and,beneath the box,a firearm and ziplock bags of crack cocaine.
velez and lukeson handcuffed davis and patted him down.they testified that he had no identification.lukeson testified that when davis indicated that he lived in chauncey,lukeson took davis house keys from his pocket or belt and used them to enter chauncey in order to determine whether someone could identify davis or produce identification for him.he knocked on interior doors on the ground floor,got no answer,and left the building.he testified that he was in the house for at most seconds.calhoun testified that lukeson had gone into chauncey and had been inside for seconds.
davis was thereafter promptly taken to the precinct.lukeson did not see the contents of the black plastic bag until he was at the precinct.neither calhoun nor lukeson had seen davis holding the bag.they testified that they first saw it when it was on the ground or when velez was holding it.neither lukeson nor calhoun was asked at trial whether they had heard a metallic clink or sound.see,d at.
davis version of the arrest 
davis testified that on the night in question he had neither been walking down chauncey street nor carrying a bag.rather,he and a friend had just come out of chauncey,where davis lived and davis was about to go next door to chauncey to see his who was living there with her grandmother.davis had just locked the gate to chauncey when he was approached by lukeson and velez,who ordered him to put his hands on the gate and told his friend to leave.
davis testified that he had with him not only the keys to chauncey but also his social security card and a benefit card as identification.either velez or lukeson took the keys from davis pocket.some minutes later,davis heard that officer say put handcuffs on him.tr.he was then taken to the police station.
two other witnesses called by davis testified to their observations of the scene at chauncey on october,around,just after davis arrest.shakima jones or shakima or kima,the sister of layshonna jones who was davis,testified that she was returning from a party to her grandmother house at chauncey and saw davis and his friend sitting on the ground in handcuffs.she saw two police officers with them recognizing them as police officers because they had guns and flashlights and another officer standing on the stoop of chauncey smoking a cigarette.among the officers she saw were velez and lukeson.see tr.shakima and her companion rasheem kelly or rasheem,who was a grandson of mary jackson,the owner of chauncey,then remained across the street from and chauncey and watched.shakima testified that for some minutes there appeared to be a number of officers moving around with flashlights inside chauncey.
after the officers had left,rasheem went into chauncey to check the house.he told shakima that mattresses,drawers,and a stove had been moved around.see id.at see also id.at the next day we went to the house and help ed jackson put a lot of stuff back together.
vincent holmes,who lived at chauncey,testified that he was arriving home from work and saw davis and another man being detained by police just outside the gate to holmes house.after speaking briefly with one of the officers,holmes stood on his front steps for some five minutes and watched.holmes saw another officer exit chauncey carrying a box,show the box to an officer who was smoking a cigarette,and then go back into chauncey.
velez testified that he did not remember seeing shakima jones on the street that night,or seeing anyone go in and out of chauncey,or seeing an officer bringing out a box.see tr,id.at i would not be able to tell you whether it happened or not,i do remember ever seeing it.
c.the role of terrel norman 
davis denied that he had possessed crack or a gun that night and that he had ever had crack or a gun in chauncey.his theory was that he had been framed by terrel norman,a relative of mary jackson,the woman who owned chauncey.davis had moved to chauncey in april,having become a good friend of jackson son,whom davis regarded as a father or an uncle.davis and jackson developed a good relationship he helped her with gardening,baking,and maintenance,and called her grandmother tr.see also id.at shakima heard davis refer to jackson as grandma.jackson bought davis clothes and furniture for his room and gave him money.
norman,a grandson or nephew of referred to as her sometimes stayed at chauncey,became jealous of davis,recognizing that davis was more welcome there than he was see,id.at shakima jones observed many occasions when jackson was upset with terrel norman coming into her house see also id.at shakima observed that davis had keys to jackson house but never observed norman having such keys.pursuant to pretrial rulings see part.below,davis was allowed to present evidence at trial as to statements by norman see part below that supported davis theory that norman had planted the gun and crack in chauncey in order to frame davis the norman confession.
shakima jones testified that on one occasion in may when she was in the front yard of her grandmother house at chauncey,she heard screaming and yelling coming from chauncey.norman came storming out,saying,this is what you want to do to me,grandma t his is how you are going to treat me.i am your flesh and blood.you are going to let a stranger live here before you let us stay in your house.this is wrong.this is wrong.i ca deal with it.tr.
clara jones or clara,the mother of shakima and layshonna jones,testified that sometime before davis october arrest,perhaps in the summer,when clara was in front of her mother house at chauncey,davis and norman emerged from chauncey in the midst of an argument in which each had grabbed the other by the shirt.norman was saying to davis,you getting on my nerves,you make me sick.that all right.i going to get you.i going to get you.id.at.
davis testified that he witnessed quarrels between norman and jackson,in which norman asked jackson why she treated davis better than she did norman see,tr.norman asked jackson,why you always giving leroy money and do give me no money,and jackson asked norman,why you can not be like leroy id.at.on october,when one of these quarrels between norman and jackson became physical and norman lunged toward his grandmother,davis grabbed norman and the two tussled,causing a gun to fall out of norman pants.davis picked up the gun and gave it to jackson jackson gave the gun back to norman and told him to get out of her house.norman said to davis,i going to get you.i going to get you.id.at.hours later,davis was arrested.
d.the norman confession 
shakima jones testified that she had known norman all of his life,as their families were neighbors,and that they frequently socialized.she had conversations with norman a ll the time through the years.tr.on several occasions she had observed norman possessing guns,and she had observed him possessing various controlled substances.some two weeks after davis moved into chauncey,shakima was in the front yard of that house with norman and his cousin rasheem when norman,saying i got some new toys,showed them four guns id.at.on a different occasion,shakima witnessed norman pull out a gun and point it at rasheem during an argument.see id.at see also id.at davis observed norman pointing a gun at rasheem.on another occasion,norman got shakima to let him leave two duffel bags in her house at chauncey norman later took a gun,a package of crack cocaine,and a bag of pills he said were ecstasy out of one of those bags,and shakima saw another gun remaining in the bag.see id.at.and on yet another occasion,when jackson was away and davis would not unlock the gate and door to let him in,shakima observed norman enter chauncey through a window and,after hearing shouting coming from the house,she saw norman run down the block and fire several shots into the air.see id.at,see also id.at davis describing that incident.
shakima testified that in the summer of although she admitted she might be mistaken about the timing see tr.norman had come to brooklyn from somewhere in the south where he was then living,and he and his brother called her to come over to their aunt house for a visit.during that visit,norman brought up the subject of davis and told shakima that he,norman,had put the gun and the bags of crack for which davis was arrested on october,in chauncey.norman said he had done it in order to kill two birds with one stone,to get rid of both leroy davis and that gun.id.at.norman said he wanted davis out of his grandmother house see id.at,and he said i really,really needed to get rid of that gun anyway,kima,you do understand id.at.
shakima testified that norman said that on that night in october,after putting the gun and the crack in chauncey see id,he had called policemen,to whom he referred as the three amigos mentioning the names velez and calhoun and calling them my boys id.at.norman told shakima that he had put the gun and the drugs in a crawl space toward the roof.see id.at.norman said that when he called the three amigos,he called velez but got no answer.so he called calhoun and gave calhoun the information.id.at.norman told her that calhoun had responded,we on our way.id.at.
defendants denied ever having heard of norman and denied receiving a tip related to davis or chauncey.see tr.
e.the verdicts 
the jury returned verdicts in favor of davis against each of the defendants on each of three claims false arrest,malicious prosecution,and denial of a fair trial by providing false information to prosecutors.it awarded compensatory damages against each defendant in the amount of it awarded punitive damages against velez and lukeson in the amount of each and against calhoun in the amount of.
defendants made several motions for a new trial.they argued principally that they were unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the hearsay evidence as to the norman confession and by other evidentiary rulings see parts.and.below and by events during the jury deliberations,most of which came to light after the end of the trial see part.below.the motions were denied,and judgment was entered reflecting the jury verdicts.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,defendants contend principally that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the norman confession and excluding offsetting evidence,and in denying a new trial on the basis of information received as to improprieties in the jury deliberations.for the reasons that follow,we see no basis for reversal.
admissibility of the norman confession under rule b 
hearsay,a statement by a declarant not ma d e while testifying at the current trial or hearing and offer ed in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.c,is generally not admissible unless permitted by an exception provided in the federal rules of evidence rules,see.the rules provide exceptions for,inter alia,a hearsay statement that was against the declarant penal interest if the declarant is unavailable as a witness,see.b.
the exception for a statement against a declarant penal interest applies to a statement that 
a a reasonable person in the declarant position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because,when made,it had so great a tendency to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability and 
b is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness,if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.
b emphasis added.the rule excepting such statements from exclusion on the ground of hearsay is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people,even reasonable people who are not especially honest,tend not to make statements unless they believe them to be true.williamson united states.
to the extent pertinent here,a declarant is unavailable as a witness if he is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of the declarant statement because the court rules that a privilege applies.a.the trial court may permissibly find that a declarant is unavailable on the ground of privilege with or without the declarant being haled into court to invoke the privilege,where,for example,the court reasonably relies on representations of the attorneys for incarcerated declarants concerning their clients intentions to rely on their fifth amendment privileges.united states williams,cir,cert.denied,see id.the law does not require the doing of a futile act.
the trial court ultimate decisions as to the admission or exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion,see,e,united states gupta,cir,cert.denied.healey chelsea resources,cir,and will not be disturbed unless they are manifestly erroneous,sr international business insurance world trade center properties,llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted in re martin trigona,cir internal quotation marks omitted.further,even an erroneous ruling does not warrant a reversal u nless justice requires otherwise.see,lore city of syracuse,cir healey chelsea resources,at.
on this appeal,defendants do not suggest that the norman confession to which shakima testified indicating that norman who was a previously convicted felon had possessed a gun and had conspired with police officers to incriminate and cause the conviction of an innocent man did not consist of statements against his penal interest.rather,defendants contend principally that the district court erred in ruling that norman was unavailable as a witness,and in admitting the confession without corroborating circumstances supporting its reliability.see defendants brief on appeal at.neither contention has merit.
unavailability 
defendants argue principally that it was error for the district court to find that norman was unavailable on the basis of testimony by norman attorney that norman had told her he would rely on her advice and assert his fifth amendment privilege if called to testify defendants brief on appeal at,and that the court erred in failing to make a determination as to whether norman would invoke the privilege with respect to each question defendants wished to pose to him.these arguments do not do the record justice,for although there was such posttrial testimony by norman attorney,the district court ruling that norman was unavailable was made prior to trial,pursuant to a procedure to which defendants had declined to object.
the trial in the present case began on december.in november,defendants moved in limine for rulings that davis would be precluded from offering into evidence,inter alia,any evidence regarding terrell sic norman memorandum of law in support of defendants motions in limine defendants in limine memorandum at i see id.at,including statements made by terrell sic norman id.at xv.at the ensuing hearing on the in limine motions,the district court was informed that norman who had been listed as a potential trial witness by davis more than a year earlier was incarcerated somewhere in the south that neither side intended to seek norman appearance as a witness at trial and that davis sought to have the norman confession admitted as statements against penal interest.the court instructed davis to provide evidence of norman unavailability to testify.see hearing transcript,november,at.
at a hearing on december,the court and the parties were informed by telephone by norman criminal defense attorney paris branch ramadan that she would advise norman to invoke his fifth amendment privilege and to refuse to testify at the trial in the present action.see hearing transcript,december,at.the court instructed branch ramadan that after she consulted with norman,if he indicated that he would nonetheless testify,she should call me back and tell me that.id.at.the court verified that branch ramadan understood that she need not call if norman would follow her advice not to testify and that the effect of her not calling the court would be to signify that norman would refuse to testify id.at.the parties were asked whether they objected to that course of action each side stated that it had no objection.see id.neither side suggested that information must be obtained as to whether norman would refuse to answer.
norman attorney did not call the court.norman was thus found unavailable.defendants having agreed to this process can not complain of it on appeal.
on december,defendants moved for reargument of the unavailability determination on the ground that norman,though incarcerated,had spoken with a defense investigator within the past week and was recorded as having denied planting a gun or drugs against davis.the statements proffered by defendants,read into the record by the court on the morning trial was to begin,quoted norman in part as stating that he did not plant the gun or drugs or set up davis i loved him i would never set him up i had love for him,honestly.tr.the district court granted the motion for reconsideration but adhered to its prior decision that norman was unavailable.the court permissibly concluded that norman making unsworn statements was not sufficient to raise an inference that he would be willing to testify under oath.
defendants argue,relying principally on united states zappola,cir,that the district court could not properly determine that norman was unavailable on the basis of privilege without conducting an inquiry into whether norman would invoke his privilege with respect to each specific proposed question see defendants brief on appeal at,including questions that defendants deemed neutral id.at.defendants reliance on that case is misplaced,for there the subpoenaed witness was a government informant we ruled that the court acceptance of a blanket assertion of the fifth amendment privilege in response to all questions asked of that witness was inappropriate because as to questions with respect to his activities as a government agent he would be protected from criminal prosecution,and his answers thus could not incriminate him,at.as to any relevant questions defendants would pose to norman,however,defendants deny that he was an informant.
further,as to the potential for neutral questions,defendants provided no list of such proposed questions for norman,either in the december conference call with his attorney or in their december motion for reconsideration.they merely stated,in a letter dated the day before the monday december start of trial,that they would proffer such a list upon the court request letter from duane blackman to judge weinstein dated december,defendants december letter,at emphasis added.and in that letter,the example of what defendants apparently viewed as a neutral question claiming that norman could answer it without exposing himself to criminal liability id.at was whether norman was on the sidewalk down the block from chauncey on the night of davis arrest and watched the arrest id.internal quotation marks omitted.this was hardly a neutral question since an affirmative answer would place norman in close proximity to the place where he allegedly admitted putting the gun and the drugs in order to frame davis.a witness is entitled to claim the privilege if his answer could furnish a link in the chain of evidence incriminating him.united states rodriguez,quoting hoffman united states.
defendants alternatively requested a ruling that,if the norman confession was admitted,the newly obtained statements from norman to the investigator too would be admissible.although defendants argue on appeal that the recording was admissible as impeachment evidence under.when a hearsay statement has been admitted in evidence,the declarant credibility may be attacked,and then supported,by any evidence that would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness,they did not cite or advert to this rule in the district court.they asked that the investigator recording be admitted to even the field.tr.the court denied the request,finding the confession and the new statements entirely different in character and reliability id.at,see generally.providing a residual exception for a hearsay statement that is not within rule or,if the statement,inter alia,has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.the district court permissibly found that whereas the confession bore indicia of reliability because it was contrary to norman penal interest,the proffered statements bore no such indicia.
after these rulings,defense counsel suggested having a telephone conference to take norman deposition.the district court stated,set it up.i be glad to hear him,if he wants to,under oath,after the plaintiff puts in a case saying that he admitted that he set the plaintiff up.tr.see also id.at if anybody wants to make him available by bringing him before we have our summations and the evidence closed,i hear him,if he gets here.if you can arrange to do it by video,i take it but i not going to allow him to testify if all he going to say is,i plead the fifth amendment.
we see no indication in the record that defendants ever pursued any of these courses to alter the ruling of unavailability or to procure norman testimony under oath.in light of the record as a whole,we can not conclude that either the procedures or the rulings as to unavailability provide any basis for reversal.
corroboration 
defendants argue that even if norman was properly ruled unavailable,the confession should have been ruled inadmissible under rule b on the ground that it was not supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate d its trustworthiness.b b.see defendants brief on appeal at.although that subpart of the rule requires such special corroboration where the statement against penal interest is offered in a criminal case.b b emphasis added,defendants urge us to apply the requirement to this civil case,arguing that the concerns for potential fabrication warrant such a requirement defendants brief on appeal at.this court has not ruled on whether the special corroboration requirement is applicable in civil cases.on this appeal,defendants argue that we should follow the decisions of the seventh circuit in american automotive accessories,fishman,cir,and the third circuit in in re flat glass antitrust litigation,cir,cert.denied,which applied the corroboration requirement in civil cases.we conclude that this argument is not properly preserved but even if it were,and even if a special corroboration requirement is appropriate for civil cases,there is no basis for reversal here.
in arguing to the district court that the norman confession was not within the rule b exception,defendants argued only that the unavailability requirement was unsatisfied they did not argue that the court was required to find,in this civil case,special corroboration to indicate that norman statement was trustworthy.see,defendants december letter at to the extent plaintiff argues that statements allegedly made by norman to shakima jones should be admitted as statements against penal interest pursuant to rule b,these arguments fail as norman is not unavailable under either a or a.id.at elaborating on the ways in which a witness may be unavailable.defendants also quoted a criminal case that quoted the corroborating circumstances requirement as it appeared in the version of rule b that was applicable in.defendants december letter at quoting united states wexler,cir.that pre version provided that a statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.b b.but rule b b had been amended in.as amended in,the rule states that a statement against the declarant penal interest is admissible within the exception if it is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness,if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.b b emphasis added.
defendants did not quote to the district court the version of rule b b,which introduced the in a criminal case language.davis,in his memorandum to the court in support of admission of the norman confession,argued that the in a criminal case language meant that the corroborating circumstances requirement was not applicable to civil cases.see davis memorandum of law concerning plaintiff use of statements by terrel norman at.defendants did not respond to this contention.they presented no argument to the district court as to why special corroboration should also be required in a civil case.
the seventh and third circuit cases mentioned above,which are relied on by defendants on this appeal,had been decided in and.they too,perforce,dealt with the pre version of rule b but they at least applied the special corroboration requirement in civil cases.defendants did not cite those cases to the district court.
in sum,although the district court performed the usual balancing analysis under.in considering defendants contention that the confession should be excluded as unfairly prejudicial and i n the evidentiary context,fairness is closely related to the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence,felzcerek ins,cir we see no indication that the district court was presented with the contention now advanced by defendants on appeal that in order to apply the rule b exception to the norman confession,it was required to find special corroboration for the confession trustworthiness.
where an alleged error is unpreserved,it will warrant a new trial only if it is so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.marcic reinauer transportation,cir internal quotation marks omitted see appellate court is to ignore errors which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.we see no such error here,for even if the special corroboration requirement is applicable in civil cases,there were in the record sufficient indicia of trustworthiness of the confession statements to which shakima testified.
first,though defendants complain that the court should not have allowed the introduction of other act evidence with regard to norman,such evidence was properly admitted to show that norman had access to guns,to drugs,to the house at chauncey,and to the police all of which bore on the reliability of the confession.see generally united states tubol,cir evidence that defendant possessed a gun when he was arrested was admissible to show that he had the means to commit armed robberies united states robinson,cir en banc evidence that a defendant possessed a firearm some weeks after the armed bank robbery with which he was charged was admissible to show he had the opportunity to commit the crime,cert.denied.
further,in deciding preliminary questions as to the admissibility of evidence,the trial court may consider evidence,other than that subject to a privilege,that itself would not necessarily be admissible at trial.see.a.the record here included not only the testimony about norman that was admitted at the trial in the present case,but also deposition testimony,and testimony from the pretrial and trial proceedings in davis criminal case that had been presented to the district court in this case by defendants in support of a motion for summary judgment.in all,there was evidence consistent with virtually every aspect of the norman confession.
access to guns at trial,shakima testified that in the months prior to davis arrest she had observed norman with numerous guns.he briefly stored at her house at chauncey a bag that contained two guns she saw one when he removed it to take it with him and saw the other when she searched the bag.see tr.at chauncey,norman showed shakima and rasheem his new toys,consisting of four guns.id.at.on another occasion,after leaving chauncey,norman shot a gun in the air when he was angry with davis for not having let him into chauncey.see id.at.three witnesses testified that,during an argument with his cousin rasheem,norman pointed a gun at rasheem.see id.at shakima id.at davis transcript of suppression hearing in united states davis,cr,criminal case hearing,at rasheem see also id.at rasheem testifying that on more than one occasion norman had asked him to hide guns at chauncey.and on the day before davis was arrested,he and norman tussled at chauncey,and a gun fell out of norman pants see tr.at the end of that encounter norman told davis,i going to get you.id.at.there was ample evidence that norman possessed guns through october,increasing the likelihood that he possessed or could obtain one to plant for davis arrest at on october.
access to crack shakima testified at trial that when norman opened one of the duffel bags he briefly stored at her house,he took out a package of crack,saying he had to deliver it around the corner.see tr.davis testified that he had observed norman bagging crack in the basement of chauncey.see id.at.and shakima had testified at davis criminal trial that she had seen norman with crack.see trial transcript in united states davis,cr,at.
access to chauncey shakima testified that norman was often present at chauncey.he came in and out of jackson house with a lot of different females,and she saw jackson upset many times with norman coming into the house.see tr.clara jones testified that she observed norman coming in and out of chauncey in october.id.at.rasheem testified at the suppression hearing in davis criminal case that when davis was living at chauncey,rasheem and norman were very often staying there as well.criminal case hearing at.and as to one occasion when jackson was not at home and davis would not unlock the door or gate for norman,both shakima and davis testified that norman got into chauncey by climbing the canopy structures between and chauncey and entering through a window.see tr.
access to the police velez and lukeson had been partners for some four years before davis was arrested see tr,calhoun was their supervisor in see,id.at and the three were friends deposition of javier velez at deposition of gary calhoun at.the norman confession referred to the policemen whom norman contacted to arrange davis arrest as the three amigos.tr.to contact them,norman said he had tried to reach velez by telephone but had failed and had then tried calhoun successfully.velez testified that he in fact never gave out his telephone number calhoun,however,admitted to sometimes giving his telephone number to citizens who might be able to give him information.and although defendants testified that they did not know and had never heard of norman,rasheem testified at the suppression hearing in davis criminal case that one of norman nicknames in the neighborhood was,which meant a snitch criminal case hearing at.evidence that norman was widely regarded as a snitch could properly be viewed as providing some credence for the proposition that he had covert access to some policemen.
in their motion for summary judgment in this case,defendants had stated as undisputed facts,with citations to,inter alia,sworn testimony in davis criminal case,that terrell sic norman was known in the neighborhood as a snitch defendants statement of undisputed facts pursuant to local civil rule,that terrell sic had been seen with drugs in packaging similar to the drugs allegedly found on plaintiff id.and that d uring the criminal trial,shakima jones recognized the gun allegedly found on leroy davis a s a gun previously belonging to terrell sic id.and in their in limine motion,defendants had noted that shakima jones testified at davis criminal trial that she had heard norman state i told you i was going to get him,yeah,i got him already.cr.trial transcript.defendants in limine memorandum at xv.
if special corroboration is needed for the admission of statements against penal interest in civil actions,there was ample basis for the district court to find such corroboration for the norman confession here.
finally,even if we were to conclude that the court admission of the norman confession was error,we could not conclude that it affected defendants substantial rights.as the district court noted in denying defendants motion for a new trial,although the jury might have been swayed by the evidence of the norman confession,that evidence was not likely to have had a material effect given the multiple implausibilities in defendants own accounts of their actions and their claim that davis had been carrying a bag that contained crack and a gun.for example 
although lukeson and calhoun were in the front seats of the slowly patrolling car allegedly approaching davis as he walked along chauncey see tr,neither lukeson nor calhoun saw davis holding a bag,see,d at.
neither lukeson nor calhoun,riding in the same car as velez,corroborated velez testimony that there was a metallic sound when a plastic bag hit the ground.id.at.
i t might have been seen as unlikely that velez would jump from a moving vehicle to verbally accost plaintiff without explaining to his partners what he had observed.id.
lukeson excuse for taking davis keys and entering chauncey was his and velez testimony that davis was not carrying any identification but the officers could not explain away the fact that davis had such identification when he arrived at the city jail some two days later the theory advanced by velez and calhoun that someone might have brought davis identification to him at the precinct found no support in the precinct records relating to davis detention there,see id.
lukeson,in search of the supposedly missing identification for davis,took the keys carried by davis and entered the dark and unfamiliar house at chauncey see tr,apparently without telling velez that was where he was going see,id.at.even leaving aside the lack of any constitutional justifiability for that unauthorized entry,such an entry was simply reckless lukeson could have been shot by nervous homeowners or attacked by guard dogs.it could have been seen as improbable that lukeson would undertake this dangerous adventure without informing his partner,velez,what he was doing.jurors had reason to doubt lukeson explanation for why he entered the home,and to doubt velez claim that he had no idea lukeson had taken plaintiff keys and was planning to enter plaintiff house,d at emphasis added.
although lukeson and calhoun testified that lukeson was inside chauncey for only about half a minute,shakima testified that she observed reflections suggesting people moving about with flashlights inside chauncey for closer to half an hour.and holmes,who appeared to be a reluctant witness with no apparent motive to lie,observed an officer bringing a box out of chauncey.id.at.
thus,even absent the norman confession,the jurors could have concluded that defendants discovered the gun and drugs in someone else room in chauncey,or that defendants planted the evidence once their possible fishing expedition failed to yield any contraband.id.
in light of the record,we see no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of defendants rule b based motion for a new trial.
jury issues 
defendants also contend that they are entitled to a new trial because of issues.each issue was appropriately dealt with by the district court,and none of these contentions warrants extended discussion.
defendants contend that they are entitled to a new trial on the ground that the district court failed to declare a mistrial when juror,a juror whom we now know was voting in favor of defendants,failed to appear for deliberations.defendants brief on appeal at see also id.at the end of the third day of deliberations,juror,after marching out of the jury room,was heard by defense counsel saying in sum and substance,i hope they never pick me again,i am sick of being here.the following day juror did not appear for deliberations.
