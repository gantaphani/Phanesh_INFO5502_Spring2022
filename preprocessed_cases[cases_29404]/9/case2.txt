in response to the high incidence of domestic violence against native american women,congress enacted a felony offense of domestic assault in indian country by a habitual offender.a.section a provides that any person who commits a domestic assault within indian country and who has at least two prior final convictions for domestic violence rendered in federal,state,or indian tribal court proceedings shall be fined,imprisoned for a term of not more than years,or both having two prior convictions for domestic violence crimes is thus a predicate of the new offense.
this case raises the question whether a inclusion of convictions as predicate offenses is compatible with the sixth amendment right to counsel.the sixth amendment guarantees indigent defendants appointed counsel in any state or federal criminal proceeding in which a term of imprisonment is imposed,scott illinois,but it does not apply in proceedings,see plains commerce bank long family land cattle.the indian civil rights act of icra,which governs proceedings,accords a range of procedural safeguards to defendants similar,but not identical,to those contained in the bill of rights and the fourteenth amendment,santa clara pueblo martinez.in particular,icra provides indigent defendants with a right to appointed counsel only for sentences exceeding one year.c.icra right to counsel therefore is not coextensive with the sixth amendment right.
this court has held that a conviction obtained in state or federal court in violation of a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel can not be used in a subsequent proceeding to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense.burgett texas.use of a constitutionally infirm conviction would cause the accused in effect to suffe r anew from the prior deprivation of his sixth amendment right.ibid.burgett principle was limited by the court holding in nichols united states,that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction,valid under scott because no prison term was imposed,is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction,at.
respondent michael bryant,has multiple convictions for domestic assault.when convicted,bryant was indigent and was not appointed counsel.for most of his convictions,he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment not exceeding one year duration.because of his short prison terms,the prior proceedings complied with icra,and his convictions were therefore valid when entered.based on domestic assaults he committed in,bryant was indicted on two counts of domestic assault by a habitual offender,in violation of a.represented in federal court by appointed counsel,he contended that the sixth amendment precluded use of his prior,uncounseled,misdemeanor convictions to satisfy a element and moved to dismiss the indictment.the district court denied the motion bryant pleaded guilty,reserving the right to appeal.the ninth circuit reversed the conviction and directed dismissal of the indictment.it comprehended that bryant uncounseled convictions were valid when entered because the sixth amendment right to counsel does not apply in proceedings.it held,however,that bryant convictions could not be used as predicate convictions within a compass because they would have violated the sixth amendment had they been rendered in state or federal court.
held because bryant convictions occurred in proceedings that complied with icra and were therefore valid when entered,use of those convictions as predicate offenses in a a prosecution does not violate the constitution.
nichols instructs that convictions valid when entered retain that status when invoked in a subsequent proceeding.nichols reasoned that e nhancement statutes do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction rather,laws penaliz e only the last offense committed by the defendant.at.bryant sentence for violating a punishes his most recent acts of domestic assault,not his prior crimes prosecuted in tribal court.he was denied no right to counsel in tribal court,and his sixth amendment right was honored in federal court.bryant acknowledges that nichols would have allowed reliance on uncounseled convictions resulting in fines to satisfy a predicate.but there is no cause to distinguish for a purposes between convictions and valid but uncounseled convictions resulting in imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.neither violates the sixth amendment.bryant is not aided by burgett.a defendant convicted in tribal court suffered no sixth amendment violation in the first instance,so he can not suffe r anew from a prior deprivation in his federal prosecution.
bryant also invokes the due process clause of the fifth amendment to support his assertion that judgments should not be used as predicate offenses under a.icra,however,guarantees due process of law,accords other procedural safeguards,and permits a prisoner to challenge the fundamental fairness of tribal court proceedings in federal habeas corpus proceedings.because proceedings in compliance with icra sufficiently ensure the reliability of convictions,the use of those convictions in a federal prosecution does not violate a defendant due process right.

in response to the high incidence of domestic violence against native american women,congress,in,enacted a,which targets serial offenders.section a makes it a federal crime for any person to commi t a domestic assault within indian country if the person has at least two prior final convictions for domestic violence rendered in federal,state,or indian tribal court proceedings.see violence against women and department of justice reauthorization act of vawa reauthorization act,pub,stat,respondent michael bryant,has multiple convictions for domestic assault.for most of those convictions,he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment,none of them exceeding one year duration.his convictions do not count for a purposes,bryant maintains,because he was uncounseled in those proceedings.
the sixth amendment guarantees indigent defendants,in state and federal criminal proceedings,appointed counsel in any case in which a term of imprisonment is imposed.scott illinois.but the sixth amendment does not apply to proceedings.see plains commerce bank long family land cattle.the indian civil rights act of icra,pub,stat,et,which governs criminal proceedings in tribal courts,requires appointed counsel only when a sentence of more than one year imprisonment is imposed.c.bryant convictions,it is undisputed,were valid when entered.this case presents the question whether those convictions,though uncounseled,rank as predicate offenses within the compass of a.our answer is yes.bryant convictions did not violate the sixth amendment when obtained,and they retain their validity when invoked in a a prosecution.that proceeding generates no sixth amendment defect where none previously existed.

the complex patchwork of federal,state,and tribal law governing indian country,duro reina,has made it difficult to stem the tide of domestic violence experienced by native american women.although tribal courts may enforce the tribe criminal laws against indian defendants,congress has curbed tribal courts sentencing authority.at the time of a passage,icra limited sentences in tribal court to a maximum of one year imprisonment.a ed.congress has since expanded tribal courts sentencing authority,allowing them to impose up to three years imprisonment,contingent on adoption of additional procedural safeguards.stat.codified at a c,c to date,however,few tribes have employed this enhanced sentencing authority.see tribal law and policy,implementation chart vawa enhanced jurisdiction and tloa enhanced sentencing,online at 
states are unable or unwilling to fill the enforcement gap.most states lack jurisdiction over crimes committed in indian country against indian victims.see united states john.in,congress increased the potential for state action by giving six states jurisdiction over specified areas of indian country within the states and provid ing for the voluntary assumption of jurisdiction by other states.california cabazon band of mission indians,footnote omitted.see act of,pub,stat.codified,as amended,at and.states so empowered may apply their own criminal laws to offenses committed by or against indians within all indian country within the state.cabazon band of mission indians,at see a.even when capable of exercising jurisdiction,however,states have not devoted their limited criminal justice resources to crimes committed in indian country.jimenez song,concurrent tribal and state jurisdiction under public law,am,tribal law and policy,deer,goldberg,valdez singleton,white eagle,final report focus group on public law and the sexual assault of native women,online at.
that leaves the federal government.although federal law generally governs in indian country,congress has long excluded from jurisdiction crimes committed by an indian against another indian.see ex parte crow dog,requiring a clear expression of the intention of congress to confer federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by an indian against another indian.in the major crimes act,congress authorized federal jurisdiction over enumerated grave criminal offenses when both perpetrator and victim are indians,including murder,manslaughter,and felony assault.at the time of a enactment,felony assault subject to federal prosecution required serious bodily injury,a ed,meaning a substantial risk of death,extreme physical pain,protracted and obvious disfigurement,or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty.h incorporated through b in short,when a was before congress,indian perpetrators of domestic violence escape d felony charges until they seriously injure d or kill ed someone.cong.rec.remarks of mccain.
as a result of the limitations on tribal,state,and federal jurisdiction in indian country,serial domestic violence offenders,prior to the enactment of a,faced at most a year imprisonment per offense a sentence insufficient to deter repeated and escalating abuse.to ratchet up the punishment of serial offenders,congress created the federal felony offense of domestic assault in indian country by a habitual offender.a ed.see,july,app.to pet.for cert.owens,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc tailored to the unique problems that american indian and alaska native tribes face,a provides punishment for serial domestic violence offenders,and it represents the first true effort to remove these recidivists from the communities that they repeatedly terrorize.the section provides in pertinent part 
any person who commits a domestic assault within indian country and who has a final conviction on at least separate prior occasions in federal,state,or indian tribal court proceedings for offenses that would be,if subject to federal jurisdiction any assault,sexual abuse,or serious violent felony against a spouse or intimate partner shall be fined,imprisoned for a term of not more than years,or both a 
having two prior convictions for domestic violence crimes including convictions is thus a predicate of the new offense.
this case requires us to determine whether a inclusion of convictions is compatible with the sixth amendment right to counsel.the sixth amendment to the constitution guarantees a criminal defendant in state or federal court the assistance of counsel for his defence.see gideon wainwright.this right,we have held,requires appointment of counsel for indigent defendants whenever a sentence of imprisonment is imposed.argersinger hamlin.but an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to appointed counsel if his conviction results in a fine or other noncustodial punishment.scott,at.
as separate sovereigns the constitution,tribes have historically been regarded as unconstrained by those constitutional provisions framed specifically as limitations on federal or state authority.santa clara pueblo martinez.the bill of rights,including the sixth amendment right to counsel,therefore,does not apply in proceedings.see plains commerce bank,at.
in icra,however,congress accorded a range of procedural safeguards to defendants similar,but not identical,to those contained in the bill of rights and the fourteenth amendment.martinez,at see,at icra modified the safeguards of the bill of rights to fit the unique political,cultural,and economic needs of tribal governments in addition to other enumerated protections,icra guarantees due process of law,a,and allows defendants to seek habeas corpus review in federal court to test the legality of their imprisonment.
the right to counsel under icra is not coextensive with the sixth amendment right.if a tribal court imposes a sentence in excess of one year,icra requires the court to accord the defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel at least equal to that guaranteed by the united states constitution,including appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant at the tribe expense.c.if the sentence imposed is no greater than one year,however,the tribal court must allow a defendant only the opportunity to obtain counsel at his own expense.a.in tribal court,therefore,unlike in federal or state court,a sentence of imprisonment up to one year may be imposed without according indigent defendants the right to appointed counsel.
the question here presented is it permissible to use uncounseled convictions obtained in full compliance with icra to establish the predicate of a it is undisputed that a conviction obtained in violation of a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel can not be used in a subsequent proceeding either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense.burgett texas.in burgett,we held that an uncounseled felony conviction obtained in state court in violation of the right to counsel could not be used in a subsequent proceeding to prove the element of a recidivist statute.to permit such use of a constitutionally infirm conviction,we explained,would cause the accused in effect to suffe r anew from the prior deprivation of his sixth amendment right.see united states tucker,invalid,uncounseled prior convictions could not be relied upon at sentencing to impose a longer term of imprisonment for a subsequent conviction loper beto,plurality opinion use of convictions constitutionally invalid under gideon wainwright to impeach a defendant credibility deprives him of due process of law because the prior convictions lac k reliability 
in nichols united states,we stated an important limitation on the principle recognized in burgett.in the case under review,nichols pleaded guilty to a federal felony drug offense,at.several years earlier,unrepresented by counsel,he had been convicted of driving under the influence dui,a misdemeanor,and fined but not imprisoned.ibid.nichols dui conviction,under the sentencing guidelines,effectively elevated by about two years the sentencing range for nichols federal drug offense.ibid.we rejected nichols contention that,as his later sentence for the federal drug offense involved imprisonment,use of his uncounseled dui conviction to elevate that sentence violated the sixth amendment,at.c onsistent with the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,we held,an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction,valid under scott because no prison term was imposed,is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.at.
respondent bryant conduct is illustrative of the domestic violence problem existing in indian country.during the period relevant to this case,bryant,an enrolled member of the northern cheyenne tribe,lived on that tribe reservation in montana.he has a record of over convictions,including several misdemeanor convictions for domestic assault.specifically,between and,bryant pleaded guilty on at least five occasions in northern cheyenne tribal court to committing domestic abuse in violation of the northern cheyenne tribal code.on one occasion,bryant hit his girlfriend on the head with a beer bottle and attempted to strangle her.on another,bryant beat a different girlfriend,kneeing her in the face,breaking her nose,and leaving her bruised and bloodied.
for most of bryant repeated brutal acts of domestic violence,the tribal court sentenced him to terms of imprisonment,never exceeding one year.when convicted of these offenses,bryant was indigent and was not appointed counsel.because of his short prison terms,bryant acknowledges,the prior proceedings complied with icra,and his convictions were therefore valid when entered.bryant has never challenged his convictions in federal court under icra habeas corpus provision.
in,bryant was arrested yet again for assaulting women.in february of that year,bryant attacked his then girlfriend,dragging her off the bed,pulling her hair,and repeatedly punching and kicking her.during an interview with law enforcement officers,bryant admitted that he had physically assaulted this woman five or six times.three months later,he assaulted another woman with whom he was then living,waking her by yelling that he could not find his truck keys and then choking her until she almost lost consciousness.bryant later stated that he had assaulted this victim on three separate occasions during the two months they dated.
based on the assaults,a federal grand jury in montana indicted bryant on two counts of domestic assault by a habitual offender,in violation of a.bryant was represented in federal court by appointed counsel.contending that the sixth amendment precluded use of his prior,uncounseled,misdemeanor convictions to satisfy a element,bryant moved to dismiss the indictment.the district court denied the motion,app.to pet.for cert,and bryant entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving the right to appeal that decision.bryant was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each count,to be followed by three years of supervised release.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the conviction and directed dismissal of the indictment.bryant convictions were not themselves constitutionally infirm,the ninth circuit comprehended,because the sixth amendment right to appointed counsel does not apply in tribal court proceedings.at.but,the court continued,had the convictions been obtained in state or federal court,they would have violated the sixth amendment because bryant had received sentences of imprisonment although he lacked the aid of appointed counsel.adhering to its prior decision in united states ant,the court of appeals held that,subject to narrow exceptions not relevant here,tribal court convictions may be used in subsequent federal prosecutions only if the tribal court guarantees a right to counsel that is,at minimum,coextensive with the sixth amendment right.at.rejecting the government argument that our decision in nichols required the opposite result,the ninth circuit concluded that nichols applies only when the prior conviction did comport with the sixth amendment,when no sentence of imprisonment was imposed for the prior conviction,at.
judge watford concurred,agreeing that ant controlled the outcome of this case,but urging reexamination of ant in light of nichols,at.this court decision in nichols,judge watford wrote,undermines the notion that uncounseled convictions are,as a categorical matter,too unreliable to be used as a basis for imposing a prison sentence in a subsequent case.at.the court of appeals declined to rehear the case en banc over vigorous dissents by judges owens and.
in disallowing the use of an uncounseled conviction to establish a prior domestic violence conviction within a compass,the ninth circuit created a circuit split.the eighth and tenth circuits have both held that convictions,valid at their inception,and not alleged to be otherwise unreliable,may be used to prove the elements of.united states cavanaugh,see united states shavanaux.to resolve this disagreement,we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
bryant convictions,he recognizes,infringed no constitutional right because the sixth amendment does not apply to proceedings.brief for respondent.those prior convictions complied with icra,he concedes,and therefore were valid when entered.but,had his convictions occurred in state or federal court,bryant observes,argersinger and scott would have rendered them invalid because he was sentenced to incarceration without representation by counsel.essentially,bryant urges us to treat convictions,for a purposes,as though they had been entered by a federal or state court.we next explain why we decline to do so.
as earlier recounted,we held in nichols that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction,valid under scott because no prison term was imposed,is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.at.enhancement statutes,we reasoned,do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction rather,laws penaliz e only the last offense committed by the defendant.at see united states rodriquez,when a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute of the punishment is for the offense of conviction.none is for the prior convictions or the defendant status as a recidivist.nichols thus instructs that convictions valid when entered that is,those that,when rendered,did not violate the constitution retain that status when invoked in a subsequent proceeding.
nichols reasoning steers the result here.bryant sentence for violating a punishes his most recent acts of domestic assault,not his prior crimes prosecuted in tribal court.bryant was denied no right to counsel in tribal court,and his sixth amendment right was honored in federal court,when he was adjudicated guilty of the felony offense for which he was imprisoned.alabama shelton.it would be odd to say that a conviction untainted by a violation of the sixth amendment triggers a violation of that
