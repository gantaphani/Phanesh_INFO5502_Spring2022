plaintiffs appellants are twenty graduates from medical schools outside of the united states who are ineligible to receive a medical license in puerto rico because they failed the puerto rico medical licensing examination the prmle.they challenge the validity of the prmle purportedly arbitrary passing score via this action,alleging that defendants appellees the puerto rico board of medical licensure and discipline the board and eight of its officers the officers,and together with the board,defendants,in their official and individual capacities violated the plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.finding no plausible basis for a claim for relief,we affirm.
background 
in,investigators uncovered a massive medical licensing scandal in puerto rico involving nearly one hundred unqualified doctors who were illegally admitted to practice.in exchange for thousands of dollars in bribes,some former members of the regulatory body that preceded the board allegedly doctored exam scores to grant medical licenses to unqualified applicants.see united states rodríguez torres,d.in the wake of this scandal,puerto rico legislature enacted law of law,which reformed the board authority by adding safeguards such as new oversight procedures and reporting requirements.laws ann.tit,et.under law,the board has broad authority to regulate puerto rico medical profession,including the power to delineate the requirements for medical licenses.id.
despite this latitude,law limited the board powers to control the examinations by requiring it to delegate the preparation,administering,and correction of the local medical licensing exam the prmle to an external organization.id.in compliance with this mandate,the board selected the national board of medical examiners the nbme to prepare the prmle.see regs.salud reg.while the nbme prepares the exam,t he board shall establish the grade required to pass the prmle.id.the board chose a passing score of points for the prmle by issuing a regulation.
as an alternative to the prmle,all applicants for puerto rico medical licenses including plaintiffs may instead take the united states medical licensing examination the usmle.the usmle is also prepared by the nbme.though both the usmle and prmle test similar subject matters,the parties agreed at oral argument that they are substantively different exams.in addition to the differences in content,there are other important distinctions.first,while applicants can take the usmle only in english,the prmle is offered in both english and spanish.id.second,while a passing score on the prmle allows applicants to qualify for a medical license in puerto rico only,a passing score on the usmle allows applicants to qualify for a medical license in both puerto rico and the rest of the united states.third,while the board set the prmle passing score at points,the nbme set the usmle national passing score at points.
plaintiffs voluntarily elected to take the prmle rather than the usmle and failed it.they then opted for this action requesting injunctive relief and damages,arguing that the board arbitrary imposition of a point passing score deprived them of a liberty or property interest in practicing the medical profession in violation of their due process rights since the board accepts both the usmle and the prmle for medical license applications,the difference in the passing scores between the two tests constitutes an equal protection violation and the board and its officers actions violated the puerto rico constitution and puerto rico laws and regulations.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint.first,the district court found that plaintiffs conceded that their constitutional claims are subject to only rational basis review and held that plaintiffs failed to plead facts plausibly demonstrating that the board imposition of a point passing score in the prmle was not rationally related to the legitimate government interest in ensuring that doctors are sufficiently qualified to practice medicine in puerto rico.the district court also concluded that all of plaintiffs constitutional claims against members of the board acting in their official capacities were also barred by sovereign immunity.finally,the district court concluded that plaintiffs constitutional claims for damages against members of the board acting in their individual capacities would also have been barred by qualified immunity.although the district court found that it had discretion to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims,it declined to exercise this jurisdiction because it had dismissed all federal claims over which it had original jurisdiction.

sovereign immunity defense 
plaintiffs challenge the board and the officers compliance with federal due process and equal protection guarantees,arguing that a state can not exclude a person from the practice of any occupation in a manner or for reasons that contravene the due process or equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.schware bd.of bar examiners of the state of,d.they argue that in establishing requirements for professional licenses,a state action must be rationally related to the applicants fitness or capacity to practice in a regulated field.that is,the requirements may not be arbitrarily chosen without connection to the applicant capacity.id.at a state can require high standards of qualification,such as good moral character or proficiency in its law,before it admits an applicant to the bar,but any qualification must have a rational connection with the applicant fitness or capacity to practice law.consequently,plaintiffs request that we enjoin the board from penalizing plaintiffs because they failed the prmle.see dkt.at,pls.first am.compl.they ask us to order the officers to retroactively apply a point passing score to plaintiffs preexisting prmle scores.see id.at.
in response,defendants contend that we must affirm dismissal of all claims under federal and state law against the board and its members in their official capacity based on plaintiffs failure to state a plausible claim,and on our lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the eleventh amendment.they allege that plaintiffs request for injunctive relief prospectively ordering the board to change the passing score of the prmle to points violates the commonwealth sovereign immunity.in support of this,defendants point to pennhurst state school hospital halderman,which held that an unconsenting state is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another state,d quoting emps.pub.health welfare dep t,d.
in this case,we can bypass sovereign immunity issues because plaintiffs amended complaint lacks any merit on its face.eleventh amendment questions are often labeled jurisdictional,parella ret.bd.of rhode island employees ret,cir,and generally,jurisdictional issues must be resolved before analyzing dismissals under rule b,ne.erectors ass of btea sec y of labor,osha,cir.but it is under first circuit precedent that federal courts may resolve a case on the merits in favor of a state without first resolving any eleventh amendment issues the state raises.brait builders,div.of capital asset,cir citing parella,at.see also redfern napolitano,cir bypassing jurisdictional question entirely because claims became moot dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,cir.therefore,we examine plaintiffs claims directly under a rule b analysis.
rule b plausibility analysis 
plaintiffs will survive a rule b motion to dismiss their federal constitutional claims based on equal protection and substantive due process in this action only if their pleadings plausibly establish that the board or its members violated their federal constitutional rights.see rodríguez reyes molina rodríguez,cir.
similarly situated and the equal protection claim 
the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause prohibits a state from treating similarly situated persons differently because of their classification in a particular group.see const.amend.xiv,tapalian tusino,cir.generally,for an equal protection claim to survive a motion to dismiss,a plaintiff must allege facts plausibly demonstrating that compared with others similarly situated,the plaintiff was selectively treated based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir second alteration in original emphases omitted quoting rubinovitz rogato,cir.
here,however,because the plaintiffs concede there is no implication of a fundamental right being affected,and,since they do not claim to belong to a suspect classification the defendants are correct to argue that their medical licensing decisions require only rational basis review.see gonzález droz gonzález colón,cir citing medeiros vincent,cir.defendants add that,even assuming that plaintiffs alleged a plausible prima facie equal protection violation,the board action is rational to the extent that it intended to require aspiring doctors to demonstrate a minimum level of knowledge.
having carefully examined their complaint,as amended,we find that plaintiffs,as prmle examinees,have failed to plead that they are similarly situated to usmle examinees or that any alleged classification violates their equal protection rights.instead of alleging that the usmle and the prmle are equivalent exams,plaintiffs admitted at oral argument that these are different exams.despite this admission,plaintiffs make the implausible assertion that the board arbitrary imposition of a point passing score on the prmle,when compared to the point passing score on the usmle,automatically constitutes an equal protection violation.but,if the prmle and the usmle are two different exams,comprising different questions,the fact that they use two different passing scores is insufficient to demonstrate a plausible equal protection violation.takers of one exam are not equally situated with takers of the other exam.
the formula for determining whether individuals or entities are similarly situated is not always susceptible to precise demarcation.the line between sufficient facts and insufficient conclusions is often blurred.barrington cove,at alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,the standard is whether a prudent person,looking objectively at the incidents,would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated.id.quoting dartmouth review dartmouth,cir,overruled on other grounds by educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.
thus,we conclude that plaintiffs comparison,even when read in the light most favorable to them,does not pass rule b muster.plaintiffs,as prmle takers,failed to plead an indicia of being similarly situated to takers of the usmle.see rodríguez cuervos wal mart stores,cir the comparison cases need not be perfect replicas but,in offering comparative evidence,a plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the individuals with whom he seeks to be compared have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
rational basis and the equal protection and substantive due process claims 
plaintiffs pleadings also fail to establish why such classification would be necessarily irrational,either for equal protection or substantive due process purposes.because the analysis required for those two claims is the same,we examine them together.gonzález droz,at medeiros,at.for both equal protection and substantive due process,when plaintiffs do not allege that a fundamental right is affected,they are required to show that the governmental infringement is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.id.
here,plaintiffs do not allege that they belong to a suspect category or that obtaining a license to practice medicine is a fundamental constitutional right.see medeiros,at the right to make a living is not a fundamental right,for either equal protection or substantive due process purposes.quoting state trawlers ass jorling,cir.therefore,their claim is within an area of social and economic policy,where a legislative classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.fcc beach commc ns,d.we need not examine what such reasonably conceivable state of facts may be because r emedial choices made by regulatory bod ies are rebuttable only where the party challenging the regulation can establish that there exists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the challenged classification and the government legitimate goals.medeiros,at citing wine and spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.plaintiffs bear the burden of negat ing any conceivable basis which might support that set of fairly conceivable facts.donahue city of boston,cir quoting beach commc ns,at.
as we discussed above,plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that the prmle and usmle are substantively different tests,such that a point difference in the minimum passing score could be rationally related to the substantive difference.and even though plaintiffs do not take issue with the goals of law,do not dispute that the state had a legitimate government purpose in enacting the law,plaintiffs alleged nothing that would indicate that this point difference is so extreme as to be unjustified by the unspecified substantive differences between the two tests.plaintiffs thus fail to allege facts that could possibly negate the rational justification for the difference in scores.
plaintiffs complaint seemingly alleges an alternate classification.their complaint could reasonably be read to argue that the board selected a different passing score on the basis that it knows that applicants tend to take the prmle,rather than the usmle,treating them differently from applicants,who tend to take the usmle.see dkt.at,pls.first am.compl.applicants for a medical license that study in medical schools located in puerto rico usually take a test different than that required of applicants like the plaintiffs that study in international schools.emphases added.that is,the board meant to discriminate on the grounds that its officers know that applicants will normally choose the prmle.even assuming that plaintiffs had carefully alleged that the board intentionally discriminated against them for the sole reason of being applicants,classifying them on that basis,plaintiffs pleadings fail to establish why such classification would be necessarily irrational,either for equal protection or substantive due process purposes.as the district court suggested,the board might have decided to impose a higher score to applicants because foreign schools may be subject to less demanding accreditation requirements.with a rigorous standardized test requirement,the state would not have to independently determine that every international medical school had accreditations or curricula equivalent to that of a domestic school.plaintiffs do not negate these reasonings,which would be rational justifications.it suffices to say that plaintiffs did not establish that under no conceivable set of c
