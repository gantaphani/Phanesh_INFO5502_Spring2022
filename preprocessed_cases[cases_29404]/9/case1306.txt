myra anthony is an adult woman with down syndrome.magdalene wright is anthony and legal guardian.on march,officers from the new york city police department nypd responded to a call that originated from wright apartment,in which a female caller reported that she was being attacked by a man with a knife and gun.the police entered wright apartment,found anthony alone,and were unable to locate anthony caretaker.the police then transported anthony to the psychiatric ward of kings county hospital,a municipal hospital owned and operated by the new york city health and hospitals corporation hhc,where she was detained overnight and given blood and urine tests as well as medication.anthony was released from the hospital the next morning.
plaintiffs brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,alleging violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments,violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,and various tort claims against the city of new york,hhc,and several nypd officers both individually and in their official capacities.the parties for partial summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants motion in its entirety.plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their remaining claims with prejudice in order to pursue this appeal.
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on all claims that plaintiffs have asserted on appeal.there is no individual liability pursuant to anthony claims based on alleged fourth amendment violations we hold that the warrantless entry was justified by exigent circumstances and did not violate the fourth amendment,and we find it unnecessary to decide whether the warrantless seizure was a fourth amendment violation because the officers involved are entitled to qualified immunity.nor can anthony recover on her claims against the city of new york and the officers in their official capacities,because there is no evidence that the warrantless seizure assuming it was unconstitutional was conducted pursuant to an official governmental policy or custom.anthony argument that the city of new york violated the ada also fails,because there is no evidence that the warrantless seizure was motivated by discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
in addition,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against anthony on her claims against hhc for violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments,holding that hhc actions did not violate anthony constitutional rights.finally,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against wright on her familial association claim,as we hold that anthony seizure and confinement did not constitute a substantive due process violation.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
myra anthony is a woman with down syndrome and a citizen of the commonwealth of dominica,west indies.ja the abilities of individuals with down syndrome vary anthony is able to clean and dress herself,cook meals,and clean the house ja anthony speaks a dialect of english colloquially referred to as jamaican speech,common in the west indies.ja at the time of the events at issue in this case,anthony was in the united states on a valid medical visa to receive treatment for a hearing problem,and was staying with her and legal guardian,magdalene wright.ja 
factual background 
on march,a call was placed from wright apartment in brooklyn.ja the sprint report,a document that records the notes taken by a operator during a call,memorializes the call as follows 
fc female caller spks connctd to by bell still on line unable to understand unk sounds edp emotionally disturbed person feml at on line ramblin sts she is yo years old fc sound older thn on line w sts she spks sts husb told her he does not like sts husb beat on sts a knife a wpns at feml on line heard someone knockin on are inside 
ja several nypd officers responded to a subsequent dispatch,including officers richard collegio and gerald migliaro.officers collegio and migliaro were not the first officers on the scene,and it is unclear from the record how the officers entered wright was no property damage or other evidence of forcible entry,but neither is there evidence that anthony affirmatively consented to the officers entry.
officers collegio and migliaro have significantly different recollections of anthony conduct while the police were in the apartment.officer collegio testified in his deposition that anthony did not appear to be,and she was not acting rationally she was crying,she was screaming and she was not calm.ja officer migliaro,by contrast,testified in his deposition that anthony was sitting calmly in a chair while the police were in the apartment,and that he did not hear her speaking to any of the officers.ja construing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,as we must in reviewing this grant of summary judgment against them,we will assume that anthony was sitting quietly and calmly while the police searched the apartment,and that she did not communicate with the officers or explain why a call was made.
while the police were inside,a neighbor arrived and told them that wright was the lessee of the apartment.ja the officers searched the house for information they could use to contact wright but were unable to get in touch with her after trying half a dozen phone numbers they had found.the officers discussed the situation,and a superior officer,sergeant mendez,ordered officers collegio and migliaro to seize anthony and take her to the hospital.ja,anthony was handcuffed and transported by ambulance to kings county hospital.ja the officers left a note at the apartment for wright that stated magdalene precinct responded to you r house and took anthony to kings county hospital to be checked out.ja 
wright returned home that afternoon,saw the note,and attempted to contact the police and kings county hospital.ja about half an hour later,an officer called wright at home and told her that she could find anthony in the psychiatric ward of kings county hospital.ja wright immediately went to the hospital and was allowed to visit anthony but not to take her home wright states that an unidentified hospital employee told her it was normal procedure to keep anthony for observation.ja on wright request,she was allowed to spend the night with anthony in anthony hospital room.ja 
hospital documents describe the hospital staff evaluations of and responses to anthony behavior.the ambulance call report indicates that anthony was very aggressive in transport to the hospital,but was able to be calmed.ja she was admitted to the hospital under a diagnosis of unspecified psychosis after an initial exam,the principal diagnosis was listed as down syndrome,with secondary diagnoses of unspecified mental retardation and unspecified hearing loss.ja anthony was given a psychiatric evaluation,which described her as fearful,anxious,delusional,and paranoid.ja the hospital took blood and urine samples from anthony to test for drug use,and also administered sedatives and medication.ja she was discharged the next morning with no scheduled.ja 
ii.the district court proceedings 
in june,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court against the city of new york,hhc,officers collegio and migliaro,and several john doe officers,and sought damages based on alleged violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments and,violations of the americans with disabilities act ada,stat.codified at et,and various tort claims.after discovery,the parties for partial summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants motion in full.see anthony city of new york,wl july.plaintiffs agreed voluntarily to withdraw their remaining claims,and those claims were dismissed with prejudice.spa 
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to this court.subsequently,however,plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court pursuant to.b and a,requesting that the district court vacate the final judgment and seeking leave to amend the complaint to add a new claim.the district court denied both motions in a written opinion.see anthony city of new york,wl.plaintiffs then appealed the final judgment to this court.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all factual inferences in plaintiffs favor as the party.see weinstock columbia,cir.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
ii.anthony claims stemming from the events at wright home 
anthony raises a number of claims on appeal stemming from the conduct of the police officers who responded to the call from wright apartment.she first alleges that the warrantless entry into wright apartment violated the fourth amendment,and that this constitutional violation supports a claim for damages against officers collegio and migliaro in their individual capacities.anthony next alleges that the warrantless seizure for the purpose of involuntarily hospitalizing her also violated the fourth amendment,and that this constitutional violation supports a claim for damages against officers collegio and migliaro individually,the city of new york,and the named and unnamed police officers in their official capacities.finally,anthony claims that she is entitled to damages under title ii of the ada,arguing that by seizing and involuntarily hospitalizing her,the city of new york intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of her disability.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the warrantless claim against officers collegio and migliaro individually 
section exposes any person acting under color of law to liability for money damages if he or she subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.anthony raises a claim against officers collegio and migliaro in their individual capacities,based on the allegedly unconstitutional warrantless entry into wright apartment.
the fourth amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures.see const.amend.iv.to be reasonable under the fourth amendment,a search of a home must either be conducted pursuant to a warrant or meet an exception to the warrant requirement.see kyllo united states,d.among the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement is the presence of exigent circumstances 
the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment guarantees the fundamental right to be free from government intrusion into the privacy of one home.it is,however,that the warrant requirement must yield in those situations where exigent circumstances demand that law enforcement agents act without delay 
the essential question in determining whether exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry is whether law enforcement agents were confronted by an urgent need to render aid or take action.
united states macdonald,cir in banc citations omitted quoting dorman united states,in banc.
in granting summary judgment for defendants on this claim,the district court found that no reasonable jury could conclude other than that exigent circumstances existed sufficient to justify the warrantless entry.anthony,wl,at the issue of whether exigent circumstances existed is quickly resolved.because it was reasonable for the officers to believe that there was an armed man in wright apartment who was committing a violent crime against the caller,exigent circumstances justified the officers warrantless entry into wright apartment.in its later ruling on plaintiffs rule b motion,the district court further explained that the substance of the plea for help from a terrified woman who claimed to be under exigent circumstances justifying,and indeed requiring,an immediate response.anthony,wl,at.the district court thus found that the substance of the call provided the exigent circumstances that justified the warrantless entry as a matter of law.
on appeal,anthony argues that the district court conclusion contravenes our recent holding that the police may not rely solely on an anonymous and uncorroborated call to justify a warrantless entry into a private dwelling.kerman city of new york,cir.the facts of the instant case are different from those of kerman,however.the call in kerman came from an anonymous caller who directed the police to a different location than that from which the call was placed,without verification or corroboration of the connection between the caller and the location to which the police responded.see id.at.in the instant case,the call came from the same location to which the police responded,and more importantly,the caller described an immediate and deadly threat of harm to which she herself was being exposed at that location.the concern we expressed in kerman regarding the reliability of anonymous and uncorroborated is,calls reporting an emergency at a different location and involving someone other than the not implicated here,where the caller expressed an immediate risk of harm to herself,and where the address from which the call was placed was verified see florida,d kennedy,concurring noting that instant caller identification can provide a check against unreliable anonymous calls.we hold that the substance of this call thus created exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless entry and we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on the claim based on the warrantless entry 
b.the warrantless seizure 
it is undisputed that anthony was seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment when she was handcuffed and taken to kings county hospital.see appellees brief at.it is also undisputed that the officers did not have a warrant for her seizure.anthony alleges that the seizure and subsequent hospitalization violated the fourth amendment,and that this constitutional violation supports her claim for damages against officers collegio and migliaro individually,the city of new york,and the named and unnamed police officers in their official capacities.
anthony claim against officers collegio and migliaro individually 
a warrantless seizure for the purpose of involuntary hospitalization may be made only upon probable cause,that is,only if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person seized is dangerous to herself or to others.glass mayas,cir quoting villanova abrams,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord monday oullette,cir the fourth amendment requires an official seizing and detaining a person for a psychiatric evaluation to have probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to himself or others.
reading the facts in the light most favorable to anthony,we credit that part of the officers deposition testimony that described her as sitting calmly and quietly although uncommunicatively in wright apartment while the officers searched the apartment and attempted to contact wright.ja we reiterate as well,however,that the facts also showed that officers collegio and migliaro knew they were responding to a call from a woman inside the apartment who claimed to be at risk of immediate physical injury,requested assistance,and was potentially emotionally disturbed.ja,
on this factual record,we decline to determine as a matter of law whether officers collegio and migliaro had probable cause to seize anthony and transport her to kings county hospital.we do not,however,disturb the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on this claim,because even if the seizure did violate anthony fourth amendment rights,officers collegio and migliaro are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions.
police officers are immune from liability for money damages in suits brought against them in their individual capacities if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.we have explained that e ven where the plaintiff federal rights and the scope of the official permissible conduct are clearly established,the qualified immunity defense protects a government actor if it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.lennon miller,cir quoting anderson creighton,d see also weyant okst,cir p ublic officials are entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights,or it was objectively reasonable for them to believe their acts did not violate those rights.a police officer actions are objectively unreasonable,and therefore are not entitled to immunity,when no officer of reasonable competence could have made the same choice in similar circumstances.lennon,at citing malley briggs,d.
we hold that officers collegio and migliaro are entitled to qualified immunity for their seizure of anthony.in addition to the circumstances of which officers collegio and migliaro were aware from their receipt of the dispatch and their personal observations inside the apartment,it is undisputed that officers collegio and migliaro were responding to the order of a superior officer,sergeant mendez,to seize anthony and remove her to the hospital.plausible instructions from a superior or fellow officer support qualified immunity where,viewed objectively in light of the surrounding circumstances,they could lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the necessary legal justification for his actions exists a warrant,probable cause,exigent circumstances.bilida mccleod,cir varrone bilotti,cir holding that subordinate officers who carried out the apparently valid order of a superior officer were entitled to hav e the same qualified immunity that the superior officer had diamondstone macaluso,cir holding that an officer was not entitled to qualified immunity for his reliance on the advice of his superiors because that advice was not plausibly valid.sergeant mendez order to seize anthony was an apparently valid order in light of the substance of the call and all of the surrounding circumstances known to officers collegio and migliaro.officers collegio and migliaro therefore reasonably could have concluded,given sergeant mendez order,that probable cause existed to seize anthony.they are thus entitled to qualified immunity from anthony claim against them in their individual capacities based on the warrantless seizure 
anthony claim against the city of new york and the officers in their official capacities 
anthony next asserts claims against the city of new york and the named and john doe police officers in their official capacities based on the allegedly unconstitutional warrantless seizure.assuming,arguendo,that the warrantless seizure and involuntary hospitalization did violate the constitution,the city and the officers sued in their official capacities are liable under only if the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement,ordinance,regulation,or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body officers or is conducted pursuant to governmental custom even though such a custom has not received formal approval through the body official decisionmaking channels.monell dep t of soc.servs.of city of new york,d.anthony claims that there is a custom or policy of arresting and restraining disabled persons regardless of their need for assistance.appellants brief at.the existence of an official policy of seizing and hospitalizing disabled persons,anthony argues,is shown here in two ways first,through the actions of sergeant mendez,as an individual with final authority and second,through a city policy of inadequate training or supervision.
actions by an individual with final authority in a municipality constitute official policy for purposes of a claim.see pembaur city of cincinnati,d.the individual must be responsible for establishing final government policy in order for municipal liability to attach.id.at.anthony argues that sergeant mendez was such an individual,and that his order to officers collegio and migliaro to seize and hospitalize her thereby constituted a municipal policy of arbitrarily committing disabled individuals.
in applying the pembaur standard,we have explained that w here an official has final authority over significant matters involving the exercise of discretion,the choices he makes represent government policy.an official has final authority if his decisions,at the time they are made,for practical or legal reasons constitute the municipality final decisions.rookard health hosps,cir footnote and internal citation omitted.thus,in rookard,we held that the executive director of harlem hospital and the vice president for corporate affairs at hhc which ran harlem hospital were final with respect to personnel decisions at the hospital,because their authority over personnel decisions was final.id.similarly,in jeffes barnes,cir,we found,based on an analysis of a sheriff authority under state law,that an elected sheriff in charge of the county jail had final authority over personnel decisions at the jail.id.at.
anthony likens sergeant mendez to the county sheriff in jeffes,arguing that sergeant mendez had authority over the conduct of the officers at the scene.we think,however,that an elected county sheriff has significantly more responsibility in creating official policy than does a police sergeant in the nypd.anthony does not provide any analogue to the authority that a county sheriff possesses,and instead argues only that sergeant mendez is a final because he had discretion to determine how to handle the particular situation at wright apartment.but in jeffes,we explicitly rejected the view that mere exercise of discretion was sufficient to establish municipal liability.see id.at it does not suffice for these purposes that the official has been granted discretion in the performance of his duties.citing louis praprotnik,d.we accordingly reject anthony argument that sergeant mendez order constitutes an official municipal policy.
the existence of an official municipal policy or custom can also be demonstrated by establishing a deliberate government policy of failing to train or supervise its officers.see city of canton,ohio harris,d.municipal liability attaches only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.id.at.
this standard is not met in the instant case because anthony has not shown that there exists a deliberate city policy of failing to train its police officers in how to interact with disabled individuals.anthony argues only that i t is apparent from the actions of the officers and the testimony of migliaro that there was no special training in place regarding the treatment of disabled persons.appellants brief at.to the contrary,when asked about his training,officer migliaro expressly stated that the nypd did have a training policy in place to instruct officers in how to interact with what the nypd terms emotionally disturbed persons edps,and that the policy distinguished between edp emergencies involving someone who was violent or dangerous and edp emergencies involving someone who was not violent or dangerous.ja we thus reject anthony argument that an official policy can be established using a failure to train theory,because the evidence made available through discovery shows that the city did have training procedures in place to assist its officers in interacting with disabled individuals 
because anthony has not shown that there is an official policy or custom of arbitrarily seizing and hospitalizing disabled individuals,we reject her claims for damages against the city and against the named and unnamed police officers in their official capacities.
anthony ada claim against the city of new york 
in addition to her claims based on the warrantless entry and warrantless seizure,anthony also claims that she is entitled to damages from the city of new york pursuant to title ii of the ada anthony argues that in seizing and involuntarily hospitalizing her,the city intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of her disability.
title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected t
