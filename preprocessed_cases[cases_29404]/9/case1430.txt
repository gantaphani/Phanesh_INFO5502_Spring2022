the age discrimination in employment act adea protects only those individuals who are at least forty years of age.the question in this case is whether a claim is cognizable where a subgroup of employees at the upper end of that range in this case,employees aged fifty and older were alleged to have been disfavored relative to younger employees.
we answer in the affirmative.our decision is dictated by the plain text of the statute as interpreted by the supreme court.in particular,the adea prohibits disparate impacts based on age,not identity.a rule that disallowed subgroups would ignore genuine statistical disparities that could otherwise be actionable through application of the plain text of the statute.although several of our sister circuits have ruled to the contrary,their reasoning relies primarily on policy arguments that we do not find persuasive.
we will therefore reverse the judgment of the district court based on its interpretation of the adea.we will also vacate the district court order excluding the testimony of plaintiffs statistics expert and remand for further daubert proceedings.we will affirm in all other respects.

in,the automobile industry began to falter.pgw engaged in several reductions in force rifs to offset deteriorating sales.the rif of relevance to this case occurred on march,and terminated the employment of approximately one hundred salaried employees in over forty locations or divisions.individual unit directors had broad discretion in selecting whom to terminate.pgw did not train those directors in how to implement the rif.nor did pgw employ any written guidelines or policies,conduct any analysis,review prospective rif terminees with counsel,or document why any particular employee was selected for inclusion in the rif.
plaintiffs rudolph karlo,william cunningham,jeffrey marietti,david meixelberger,mark mclure,benjamin thompson,and richard csukas worked in pgw manufacturing technology division.they were terminated as part of the march rif by their supervisor,gary cannon.each was over fifty years old at the time.
in january,plaintiffs filed charges of employment discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.thereafter,they received a dismissal and notice of rights from the eeoc,and this lawsuit followed.plaintiffs brought a putative adea collective action,asserting three claims disparate treatment,disparate impact,and retaliation as to only karlo and mclure.
on plaintiffs motion for conditional certification,the district court ruled that adea subgroups are cognizable,and conditionally certified a collective action to be comprised of employees terminated by the rif who were at least fifty years old at the time.see karlo pittsburgh glass works,llc,supp.in addition to the named plaintiffs,eleven individuals opted in.three voluntarily dismissed their claims and four settled.four remained michael breen,a former production supervisor at a plant in crestline,ohio matthew clawson,a former project engineer in evansville,indiana stephen shaw,a former marketing manager in pittsburgh,pennsylvania and john titus,a former area services manager in irving,texas.
on june,the case was transferred to another district judge.pgw filed a motion to decertify the collective action.on march,the district court granted the motion,concluding that the collective action should be decertified because the plaintiffs claims are factually dissimilar from those of the named plaintiffs.see karlo,wl.
pgw then filed motions to exclude plaintiffs experts.of relevance to this appeal,pgw sought to exclude three areas of expert testimony.first,michael campion was prepared to offer statistical evidence in favor of plaintiffs claim.second,campion intended to offer his expert opinion on reasonable practices during a rif.and third,anthony greenwald proposed to testify as to studies.by order dated july,the district court excluded the testimony of each.see karlo,wl.
pgw moved for summary judgment on each claim.on september,the district court ruled on the motions,granting them in part and denying them in part.see karlo,wl.as to plaintiffs claims,the district court granted summary judgment on two grounds plaintiffs fifty claim is not cognizable under the adea and plaintiffs lack of evidence to support their claim of disparate impact following the exclusion of campion testimony.the district court also granted summary judgment as to plaintiffs claims.that ruling has not been appealed.finally,the district court denied summary judgment as to karlo and mclure individual retaliation claims.
on october,the district court certified the and claims for final judgment pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see karlo,wl.this appeal followed.plaintiffs seek reversal of the district court summary judgment decision and daubert ruling regarding their claims.plaintiffs also appeal the district court other daubert rulings and its order decertifying the collective action.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the parties dispute whether our jurisdiction extends to one or all named plaintiffs.pgw concedes that karlo perfected an appeal,but argues that the other remaining named plaintiffs cunningham,marietti,and meixelberger were not identified in the notice of appeal,and therefore did not preserve their appellate rights under rule c of the federal rules of appellate procedure.see torres oakland scavenger,we conclude that plaintiffs complied with rule c with respect to all named plaintiffs.
rule c a requires a notice of appeal to specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice,but that rule is relaxed where an attorney is representing more than one party.fed.app.c a.the attorney may describe those parties with such terms as all plaintiffs,the defendants,the plaintiffs a,b,et,or all defendants except id.
the notice of appeal here states,plaintiffs in the case hereby appeal an order entering judgment against plaintiffs on plaintiffs discrimination claims emphases added.the use of plaintiffs is equivalent to the defendants in the example provided by the rule we have observed that t he purpose of rule c identification requirement is to provide notice to the court and the opposing parties of the identity of the appellants.in re cont l airlines,cir.because all of the remaining named plaintiffs were identically situated as to this appeal,were represented by the same counsel,and were each identified by name in the district court order entering judgment against all named plaintiffs,as referenced on the face of the notice,rule c purpose is amply served,and the intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.fed.app.c see united states carelock,cir.the supreme court has stated that courts should liberally construe the requirements of rule.quoting smith barry.
the central question in this case is whether subgroup claims are cognizable under the adea.we hold that they are.
claims in adea cases ordinarily evaluate the effect of a facially neutral policy on all employees who are at least forty years old that is,all employees covered by the adea.in this case,plaintiffs claim to have identified a policy that disproportionately impacted a subgroup of that population employees older than fifty.but because the policy favored younger members of the protected class,adding those individuals to the comparison group washes out the statistical evidence of a disparity.
plaintiffs claim is cognizable under the adea.specifically,we hold that an adea claim may proceed when a plaintiff offers evidence that a specific,facially neutral employment practice caused a significantly disproportionate adverse impact based on age.plaintiffs can demonstrate such impact with various forms of evidence,including comparisons,subgroup comparisons,or more sophisticated statistical modeling,so long as that evidence meets the usual standards for admissibility.a contrary rule would ignore significant disparities.where such disparities exist,they must be justified pursuant to the adea relatively broad defenses.
we begin with an overview of the statutory scheme.the age discrimination in employment act of,stat,as amended,et,makes it unlawful for an employer 
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age 
to limit,segregate,or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual age or 
to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.
a.except for substitution of the word age,for the words race,color,religion,sex,or national origin,the language of that provision in the adea is identical to that found in a of the civil rights act of title vii.smith city of jackson.but unlike title vii,which protects individuals of every race,color,religion,sex,and national origin,the adea protection is limited to individuals who are at least years of age.a.
adea claims may proceed under a or theory.see smith,at.disparate treatment is governed by a disparate impact is governed by a.id.at plurality opinion watson fort worth bank trust,connecticut teal.
the theory of recovery was first recognized in griggs duke power,a title vii case.unlike claims of disparate treatment,claims do not require proof of discriminatory intent.disparate impact redresses policies that are fair in form,but discriminatory in operation.id.at.to that end,claims usually focus on statistical disparities watson,at.
to state a prima facie case for disparate impact under the adea,a plaintiff must identify a specific,facially neutral policy,and proffer statistical evidence that the policy caused a significant disparity.naacp hudson reg l fire rescue,cir.once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,an employer can defend by arguing that the challenged practice was based on reasonable factors other than age commonly referred to as the rfoa defense.f.
t he scope of liability under the adea is narrower than under title vii because of t wo textual differences between the statutes.smith,at.first,the rfoa defense imposes a lighter burden on the employer than its title vii counterpart,the business necessity defense.under the adea,the employer only needs to show that it relied on a reasonable factor,not that there are no other ways for the employer to achieve its goals smith,at.congress decision to impose a relatively light burden on employers is consistent with the fact that age,unlike race or other classifications protected by title vii,not uncommonly has relevance to an individual capacity to engage in certain types of employment.id.at.the second textual difference requires adea plaintiffs to isolat e and identify the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.id.at quoting wards cove packing atonio.congress stripped that requirement from title vii when it amended the statute in,but it remains operative under the adea.id.at see k.
the adea provision makes it unlawful for an employer to adversely affect an employee status because of such individual age.a.this plain text supports the viability of subgroup claims.see hardt reliance standard life ins,we must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory language according to its terms.two aspects of the text guide our decision in this case the focus on age as the relevant protected trait,as interpreted by consolidated coin caterers,and the focus on the rights of individuals,as interpreted by connecticut teal.our interpretation is further supported by the adea remedial purpose.
we begin with the supreme court unanimous opinion in consolidated coin caterers,an adea case.clarified that the adea proscribes age discrimination,not discrimination.the same interpretation applies to identical operative language in the adea provision.
the plaintiff in was years old when he was fired and replaced with a younger worker.at.the plaintiff replacement,however,was over the age of forty,and therefore within the class of individuals protected by the adea.id.the fourth circuit held that the adea prima facie case requires the replacement to be younger than forty years old.id.at.the supreme court reversed.
the supreme court began its analysis with the plain text of the statute the discrimination prohibited by the adea is discrimination because of an individual age,though the prohibition is limited to individuals who are at least years of age.at alteration in original citations omitted.on the basis of that text,the court held that the adea 
does not ban discrimination against employees because they are aged or older it bans discrimination against employees because of their age,but limits the protected class to those who are or older.the fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant,so long as he has lost out because of his age.
id.although the adea protects a class of individuals at least forty years old,it prohibits discrimination on the basis of age and not class membership id.at.it is therefore utterly irrelevant that the beneficiary of age discrimination was also over the age of forty.id.at.accordingly,the proposed limitation on the prima facie case replacement by an employee younger than forty lacked a logical connection to the plain text of the adea.id.at.as the supreme court later reaffirmed,it is beyond reasonable doubt that the adea was concerned to protect a relatively old worker from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young.dynamics land,cline.
the supreme court reasoning ineluctably leads to our conclusion that subgroup claims are cognizable.simply put,evidence that a policy disfavors employees older than fifty is probative of the relevant statutory question whether the policy creates a disparate impact because of such individual s age.a.requiring the comparison group to include employees in their forties has no logical connection to that prohibition,at.
the key insight from is that the forty line drawn by a constrains the adea general scope it does not modify or define the adea substantive prohibition against discriminat ion because of such individual age.a.the adea protects against age discrimination as opposed to or over discrimination,at.
the provision uses the same operative phrase,because of such individual age.a.our interpretation of it,therefore,should be consistent with our interpretation of the provision,a.see,dep t of revenue of or.acf,i dentical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.thus,adversely affect because of such individual age must mean adversely affect based on age,not adversely affect based on status 
applicability is not diminished by the fact that it addressed a claim.as demonstrated by the identical operative phrasing of a and a,the two types of claims share the same ultimate legal issue watson,at see also teal,at discussed infra section.claims are primarily distinguished by the factual issues that typically dominate namely,whether a facially neutral policy is discriminatory in operation.watson,at emphasis added see.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine.a disparate impact may in operation be functionally equivalent to intentional discrimination.watson,at see.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive cmtys.project,d liability plays a role in uncovering discriminatory intent.our holding restores the parity described in watson.under the adea,both disparate impact and disparate treatment address the same ultimate legal issue age discrimination.
we conclude that the supreme court analysis in answers the question now before us.a specific,facially neutral policy that significantly disfavors employees over fifty years old supports a claim of disparate impact under the plain text of a.although the employer policy might favor younger members of the cohort,that is an utterly irrelevant factor,at,in evaluating whether a company oldest employees were disproportionately affected because of their age.
our decision is further supported by the supreme court opinion in connecticut teal,a title vii case.teal confirms that,even under a theory,the plain text of the statute is designed to protect the rights of individual employees,not the rights of a class.
in teal,a connecticut state agency used a process to determine eligibility for promotions.first,connecticut required applicants to take a written test.second,connecticut selected the employees for promotion out of the pool of candidates that passed the test.id.at.black applicants who failed the test sued,advancing evidence that black employees failed the written test at a significantly higher rate than white employees.in response,connecticut argued that,at the second step of the process,the black employees who passed were given preferential treatment through an affirmative action program,counterbalancing the discriminatory effect of the written test.connecticut argued that its process promoted black employees at an overall higher rate than white employees.id.at.
the supreme court rejected this defense and held that the purpose of title vii is the protection of the individual employee,rather than the protection of the minority group as a whole.id.at.f avorable treatment of members of these respondents racial group did not justify discrimination against other members of the protected class.id.at see el se.transp,cir.title vii operates not primarily to the benefit of racial or minority groups,but to ensure that individual applicants receive the consideration they are due.
this case presents a similar issue.the adea,like title vii,protects individuals who are members of a protected class,not a class itself.see a proscribing forms of discrimination because of such individual age id.a same id.a limiting the adea scope to individuals who are at least years of age.such protection under the statute does not disappear when a plaintiff advances a claim.teal prohibits the use of a statistic to justify ignoring a disproportionate impact against individuals that would otherwise be actionable under the plain text of the statute.that is precisely the problem subgroups are meant to address here.
as a result,teal answers pgw argument that employees older than forty were,as a class,favored to keep their jobs.that is equivalent to connecticut argument that black employees were collectively favored for promotions.the supreme court rejected that argument in teal,and we reject it here.
similar to the position of pgw and its amici in this case,the dissenting justices in teal accused the majority of confus ing the distinction uniformly recognized until today between disparate impact and disparate treatment.at powell,dissenting.the majority responded as follows 
the fact remains that irrespective of the form taken by the discriminatory practice,an employer treatment of other members of the plaintiffs group can be of little comfort to the victims of discrimination.title vii does not permit the victim of a facially discriminatory policy to be told that he has not been wronged because other persons of his or her race or sex were hired.that answer is no more satisfactory when it is given to victims of a policy that is facially neutral but practically discriminatory.every individual employee is protected against both discriminatory treatment and practices that are fair in form,but discriminatory in operation.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the same reasoning applies to this case.the adea does not permit the victim of a facially discriminatory policy to be told that he has not been wronged because other persons aged forty or older were preferred.id.at.that answer is no more satisfactory when it is given to victims of a policy that is facially neutral but practically discriminatory.id.
pgw and its amici maintain that claims generally rely on comparisons between entire classes.even in teal,for example,plaintiffs evidence showed that the written test caused a disparate impact on black employees as a class.at.that general focus on groups,however,is explained by the fact that title vii protects group identities like race and sex.the trait protected by the adea,age,is qualitatively different.
the term age employed by the adea is not comparable to the terms race or sex employed by title vii.cline,at.age is a continuous variable,whereas race and sex are treated categorically in the of title vii cases.see bienkowski am.airlines,cir.the adea does not lend itself to a age rule and in this respect differs from racial or sex discrimination cases goldstein manhattan,cir.observing that age discrimination is qualitatively different from race or sex discrimination because the basis of the discrimination is not a discre te and immutable characteristic of an employee which separates the members of the protected group indelibly from persons outside the protected group.
on account of that difference,the statistical techniques common in title vii cases are not perfectly transferable to adea cases.if,for example,the comparison group in teal omitted some black employees who took the written test,the statistics would likely have failed to address whether there was a disparate impact because of race a see also id.k a i.it would be unclear whether the test effects fell more harshly on individuals of a particular race without looking at how the test affected all members.but with the adea,by contrast,a comparison group that omits employees in their forties is fully capable of demonstrating disparate impact because of age.a.
the line established in a does not convert age into a binary trait.by its own terms,it imposes a limit ation on the individuals covered by t he prohibitions in this chapter a.it simply establishes the age at which adea protection begins.maxfield sinclair int l,cir.the appropriate statistics should be guided by the trait protected by the statute,not the population of employees inside or outside the statute general scope.in fact,when the supreme court recognized adea liability in smith,nothing in its reasoning turned on the existence or purpose of a.that provision was not cited once 
pgw and its amici would have us rewrite a to proscribe adverse effect s because of such individual membership in the class.that interpretation would bring the adea closer to more familiar title vii territory,but w e have to read it the way congress wrote it.meacham knolls atomic power.the continuous,nature of age can not be adequately addressed by simply aggregating employees.more exacting analysis may be needed in certain cases,and subgroups may answer that need.
finally,our decision is supported by the adea remedial purpose.refusing to recognize subgroup claims would deny redress for significantly discriminatory policies that affect employees most in need of the adea protection.
mandating a comparison group would allow an employer to adopt facially neutral policies which had a profoundly disparate impact on individuals over age or,so long as younger individuals within the protected class received sufficiently favorable treatment.finch hercules,supp.such policies reflect the specific type of arbitrary age discrimination congress sought to prohibit,but would nonetheless evade judicial scrutiny.see also graffam scott paper,supp,me.
we have also acknowledged in the context that i f no group protection were provided by the adea,it would be of virtually no use to persons at the upper ages of the protected class maxfield,at.the same rationale applies to the context.the older the employees affected by a policy,the more confounding favoritism would be included in the rigid sample.thus,an impact on employees in their seventies may be easier to average out of existence compared to an impact that also affects younger employees.mandating comparisons would predominantly harm those most in need of the statute protection.lowe commack union free sch,cir.pierce,dissenting in relevant part.i t would indeed be strange,and even perverse,if the youngest members of the protected class were to be accorded a greater degree of statutory protection than older members of the class.id 
accordingly,our interpretation of the adea is supported not only by the statute text and supreme court precedent,but also by the adea purpose.
our holding in this case is at odds with decisions from three of our sister circuits.see lowe commack union free sch,cir.smith.valley,wl cir.table opinion mcdonnell douglas,cir.those decisions have primarily relied on policy considerations that we do not find persuasive.in short,they are contradicted by and teal,confuse evidentiary concerns with statutory interpretation,and incorrectly assume that recognizing subgroups will proliferate liability for reasonable employment practices.
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit addressed subgroups in lowe commack union free sch,cir.see also criley delta air lines,cir.because lowe predates,it gives improper significance to the forty line drawn by a,and fails to compare the textual similarities between a and a.lowe also rejects subgroup claims because specific types of evidence could be misleading.we do not find lowe persuasive.
the second circuit legal analysis begins with the premise that analysis in title vii cases generally has focused on the protected group of which plaintiff is a member.lowe,at.but lowe does not address the text of a.divorced from that text,the second circuit allows the general focus of a different statute to limit what this statute plainly permits.lowe does not,and can not,explain why group membership is utterly irrelevant to discrimination based on age,at,but is the sine qua non of an adverse effect based on age 
lowe is primarily concerned with the practical implications of subgroup claims its main objection is evidentiary any plaintiff can take his or her own age as the lower end of a group and argue that said is disparately impacted.lowe,at.here,pgw and its amici similarly argue that plaintiffs will be able to gerrymander arbitrary age groups in order to manufacture a statistically significant effect.we disagree.
essentially,pgw and its amici argue that a particular form of evidence carries such a high risk of manipulation that we should interpret the adea to preclude the entire claim.that is a thoroughly unsatisfactory justification for ignoring statutory text and supreme court precedent our interpretation of the adea is based on text,not evidentiary gatekeeping.that function is capably performed by district judges who routinely apply the federal rules of evidence and daubert jurisprudence.we consider that to be a sufficient safeguard against the menace of unscientific methods and manipulative statistics.
preliminarily,pgw gerrymandering objection only applies to the kind of statistical studies that compare subgroups selected by an expert.some scholars have proposed the use of statistical models that treat age as a continuous variable and thus avoid the need to draw arbitrary age groups.options discussed in the literature include proportional hazards models and logistic regression.see ramona paetzold steve willborn,the statistics of discrimination using statistical evidence in discrimination cases,at ed.hereinafter paetzold willborn see also,george woodworth joseph kadane,age and proportional hazards models for employment discrimination,annals applied statistics michael finkelstein bruce levin,proportional hazard models for age discrimination cases,jurimetrics.
we have no need today to bless any one approach.statistics come in infinite variety and their usefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.watson,at quoting teamsters united states.our purpose is rather to demonstrate that the gerrymandering objection exposes a weakness in one particular research method,not a cause of action.the continuous nature of the age variable need not be a statistical problem under analysis existing statistical procedures can be adapted to the specific needs of analysis.paetzold willborn,at.
even if the statistical evidence in an adea case uses age groups selected by the expert,pgw and its amici overstate the risk of manipulation.the claim can be analyzed,of course,to determine if the result is robust across various age breaks and whether the age breaks can be justified independently of the data id,at.in fact,some courts have long permitted statistical subgroup evidence in the context of claims.see,barnes gencorp,cir.we see no reason why that same evidence would be any less workable in a case.see macnamara korean air lines,cir.t he statistical evidence supporting a claim of disparate impact often resembles that used to help establish disparate treatment.
analysis has limitations.see paetzold willborn,at.for example,if an expert does not devise the age breaks independently of the data,and instead groups to manufacture a particular result,that may invalidate the usual tests of statistical significance.id.at.in addition,the appropriate inference for plaintiffs near a selected age break is always likely to be problematic.id.at.without more,this challenge may undermine the claims of plaintiffs who take their own age as the lower end of a group and argue that said is disparately impacted.lowe,at see also finch,supp.at if a plaintiff attempts to define the subset too narrowly,he or she will not be able to obtain reliable statistics upon which to prove a prima facie case.
the eeoc and plaintiffs have only argued in favor of subgroups with lower boundaries,not upper boundaries.oral arg.tr.that rule would preclude,for example,a banded subgroup.we think that limitation is well founded.a plaintiff would benefit from introducing an upper boundary if a policy favored employees older than that limit.but in cline,the supreme court interpreted the term age in a to mean old age.at.under cline,the adea protects only relatively old worker s from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young.id.at.if a facially neutral policy systematically favors a company oldest employees that fact may be fatal to a claim that members of a younger subgroup were disparately impacted because of their old age.id.at see.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive cmtys.project,describing the importance of a robust causality requirement in cases gross fbl fin.thus,a banded subgroup would be under cline,further limiting plaintiffs ability to gerrymander age groups.
we reject the notion that the risk of gerrymandered evidence is so great that it can override what the text of the statute otherwise permits.district courts should,as in any other case,ensure that plaintiffs evidence is reliable under daubert and provides more than the mere scintilla of evidence needed to survive summary judgment.ex rel.durrell lower merion sch,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting jakimas roche,cir.accordingly,we are not persuaded by lowe legal or practical groundings.
the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit addressed subgroups in a opinion,smith tennessee valley authority,wl cir.table opinion.this decision also predates.its reasoning contradicts both and teal,and conflicts with a precedential sixth circuit opinion that allows subgroup analysis in cases.
in smith,the sixth circuit asserts by citation to lowe that a plaintiff can not succeed under a disparate impact theory by showing that younger members of the protected class were preferred over older members of the protected class.id.at.as we have discussed,lowe reasoning is explicitly rejected by and teal.teal held that a plaintiff can succeed under a theory if other members of the protected class were preferred,at,and held that status is irrelevant to evaluating the application of a protection based on age,at.
as we have also noted,the sixth circuit has long recognized statistical subgroup evidence in claims.in a precedential opinion,barnes gencorp,cir,the sixth circuit specifically rejected the defendant argument that the only valid statistics would necessarily divide the employees into groups age and those under.id.at.the sixth circuit suggests in a footnote,by citation to lowe,that s uch analysis may not apply to discriminatory impact cases.id.at.with the exception of that speculative footnote,we find the sixth circuit decision in barnes more persuasive than its decision in smith.
finally,the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit addressed subgroups in mcdonnell douglas,cir.the eighth circuit analysis is also unpersuasive because it contradicts teal and ignores important limitations on the scope of claims.
first,the eighth circuit argued that if subgroup claims were cognizable,
a plaintiff could bring a claim despite the fact that the statistical evidence indicated that an employer rif criteria had a very favorable impact upon the entire protected group of employees aged and older,compared to those employees outside the protected group.we do not believe that congress could have intended such a result.
id.at.this is no more than an endorsement of the defense that the supreme court rejected in teal.the state of connecticut tried a similar argument by suggesting that black employees were favored for promotions as an overall class.but that outcome concealed individual rights violations.far from being a result congress could not have intended,the supreme court ruling in teal vindicated title vii plain text and purpose.the same applies to the adea.
second,the eighth circuit panel wrote 
t he consequence would be to require an employer engaging in a rif to attempt what might well be impossible to achieve statistical parity among the virtually infinite number of age subgroups in its work force.adoption of such a theory,moreover,might well have the anomalous result of forcing employers to take age into account in making layoff decisions,which is the very sort of that the statute proscribes.
mcdonnell douglas,at 
even without the prospect of subgroups,it has always been the case that a completely neutral practice will inevitably have some disproportionate impact on one group or another.dibiase smithkline beecham,cir.quoting city of,dep t of water power manhart.that is precisely why deviating from statistical parity is not,by itself,enough to incur liability.just last term,the supreme court recognized that liability has always been properly limited in key respects so that it is not imposed based solely on a showing of a statistical disparity.inclusive cmtys.project,at see also wards cove,at showing a statistical disparity alone will not suffice to make out a prima facie case of disparate impact watson,at plurality opinion p laintiff burden in establishing a prima facie case goes beyond the need to show that there are statistical disparities in the employer work force.
to make out a prima facie case,plaintiffs must first identify a specific employment practice that causes the disparity.see wards cove,see also smith,at noting that the wards cove holding remains in effect under the adea.the supreme court has recognized that this requirement guards against the myriad of innocent causes that may lead to statistical imbalances.smith,at quoting wards cove,at.identifying a specific practice is not a trivial burden meacham knolls atomic power,see inclusive communities project,at a claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff can not point to a defendant policy or policies causing that disparity.
furthermore,not just any disparity will make out the prima facie case the disparity must be significant.see watson,at s tatistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an inference of causation.teal,at t he facially neutral employment practice must have had a significantly discriminatory impact.wards cove,at requiring a significantly disparate impact hazelwood sch.dist.united states,requiring gross statistical disparities.we have not adopted a uniform rule for what this requirement entails it must be evaluated on a basis.watson,at.
finally,even if plaintiffs make out a prima facie case,the rfoa defense imposes a relatively light burden on employers.see smith,at.if a company oldest employees are inadvertently disadvantaged by a policy,for example,the rfoa defense is designed to address just such a scenario.see id.at observing that congress included the rfoa defense because age not uncommonly has relevance to an individual capacity to engage in certain types of employment.but if an employer can provide no reasonable justification for a policy that creates a significant disparity,the adea prohibits that policy.
in sum,the limitations applicable to any adea claim preclude liability for reasonable employment practices,regardless of subgroups.nonetheless,as amici argue,our decision may very well require employers to be more vigilant about the effects of their employment practices.but at the end of the day,amici concerns have to be directed at congress,which set the balance where it is we have to read it the way congress wrote it.meacham,at see watson,at plurality opinion explaining why disparate impact theory need not have any chilling effect on legitimate business practices.
we conclude that adea claims are not limited to comparisons.while claims based on subgroups present unique challenges,the limitations applicable to any other case evidentiary gatekeeping,the prima facie case,and affirmative defenses are adequate safeguards.accordingly,we will reverse the district court determination that pgw is entitled to summary judgment on this ground.
we now address the district court second ground for granting summary judgment in favor of pgw the exclusion of plaintiffs statistics expert under daubert and rule of the federal rules of evidence.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate and remand for further daubert proceedings regarding plaintiffs statistical evidence.we then turn to plaintiffs other expert reports,concluding that the district court did not err in excluding each.
pursuant to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,district courts perform a gatekeeping function to ensure that expert testimony meets the requirements of federal rule of evidence.that function extends not only to scientific testimony,but also to other forms of technical or specialized knowledge.fed evid.a kumho tire,carmichael.rule embodies three distinct substantive restrictions on the admission of expert testimony qualifications,reliability,and fit.elcock kmart,cir.this case presents issues of reliability and fit.

first,the district court concluded that campion report should be excluded because it is not based on reliable data,contrary to federal rule of evidence b.specifically,campion dataset included certain evart terminees who were not part of the agreed data set to which the parties stipulated.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion to the extent that it excluded campion testimony on this basis because the district court ignored,without explanation,campion subsequent analysis.
plaintiffs argue that campion cured this deficiency,and the district court opinion provides no reason to doubt their argument.specifically,plaintiffs claim that campion excluded the evart terminees and determined that it did not affect his conclusions.at oral argument,plaintiffs explained that the evart terminees skewed the data actually in favor of more of the defendants,oral arg.tr,whereas pgw insists that the evart terminees skewed the data to favor plaintiffs theory of the case.br.appellee.
it is appropriate for the district court to address this issue in the first instance.but the district court noted plaintiffs counterargument without addressing it.to the extent that the district court excluded campion testimony based on problems that were cured by subsequent analysis,it abused its discretion.to the extent that the subsequent analysis was deficient,the district court also abused its discretion because it failed to provide any justification for discrediting that analysis.because we will remand for further daubert proceedings,as described below,the district court will have the opportunity to revisit this issue.
next,the district court determined that campion does not apply any of the generally accepted statistical procedures,the bonferroni procedure to correct his results for the likelihood of a false indication of significance.this sort of subgrouping analysis is,plain and simple.karlo,wl,at.we conclude that the district court applied an incorrectly rigorous standard for reliability.
the bonferroni procedure makes it more difficult to find statistical significance where a researcher tests multiple comparisons using the same data.in theory,a researcher who searches for statistical significance in multiple attempts raises the probability of discovering it purely by chance,committing type i error,finding a false positive.see ballew georgia,describing type i and type ii errors.the bonferroni procedure adjusts for that risk by dividing the critical significance level by the number of comparisons tested.in this case,pgw rebuttal expert,james rosenberger,argues that the critical significance level should be p,rather than the typical p,because campion tested five age groups once the bonferroni adjustment is applied,campion results are not statistically significant.thus,rosenberger argues that campion can not reject the null hypothesis and report evidence of disparate impact 
campion responds that adjusting the required significance level is generally required in a data snooping scenario where a researcher conducts a huge number of analyses of all possibilities to try to find something significant.in contrast to data snooping,campion calls his methodology hypothesis driven he evaluates the likelihood of termination on a small number of groups based on logical increments in age to discover evidence that increasing age relates to increased likelihood of termination.he also points out that nearly all the tests are significant,which makes his method analogous to the relationship between age and termination at different,or replication with different samples.and finally,campion includes supplemental results that he claims control for the error rate by conducting only one analysis.
we conclude that the district court erred by applying a merits standard of correctness,a higher bar than what rule demands.tmi,at.after identifying a potential methodological flaw,the district court did not proceed to evaluate whether campion opinion nonetheless rests on good grounds.instead,it applied a exclusionary rule,zf meritor,at,based on campion failure to perform a specific arithmetical adjustment.as we have observed,there could be good grounds for an expert conclusion even if the judge thinks that a scientist methodology has some flaws such that if they had been corrected,the scientist would have reached a different result.paoli ii,at.
in certain cases,failure to perform a statistical adjustment may simply diminish the weight of an expert finding.see paetzold willborn,at describing the bonferroni adjustment as good statistical practice,but not widely or consistently adopted in the behavioral and social sciences autozone,wl,at,t he court does not have a sufficient basis to find that the of the bonferroni adjustment makes the expert results unreliable.the question of whether a study results were properly calculated or interpreted ordinarily goes to the weight of the evidence,not to its admissibility.see leonard stemtech int l,cir.vigorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.daubert,at bazemore friday,normally,failure to include variables will affect the analysis probativeness,not its admissibility.
that is not to say that a significant error in application will never go to the admissibility,as opposed to the weight,of the evidence.in re scrap metal antitrust,cir.an expert failure to use a statistical adjustment may,in certain cases,present a flaw large enough that the expert lacks good grounds for his or her conclusions.paoli ii,at see erica john fund,halliburton,applying a less conservative adjustment,based on the substantial number of comparisons made by the expert,and citing an article explaining that the risk of finding false significance is prevalent where at least twenty to forty comparisons are tested.nonetheless,t he grounds for the expert opinion merely have to be good,they do not have to be perfect.paoli,at.so long as the expert testimony rests upon good grounds,it should be tested by the adversary process rather than excluded from jurors scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its complexities or satisfactory sic weigh its inadequacies.tmi,at quoting ruiz troche pepsi cola of bottling,cir.accordingly,we will remand for further daubert proceedings as to campion testimony to allow the district court to apply the correct standard for reliability.
finally,the district court determined that campion statistics lacked fit to the case.t he subgrouping analysis would only be helpful to the factfinder if this court held that plaintiffs could maintain an disparate impact claim.karlo,wl,at.having held that plaintiffs claim is cognizable,we conclude that this ground for exclusion fails as well.because each ground fails,we will vacate the district court order excluding campion testimony and remand for further daubert proceedings 
campion offered a second expert report on a different subject reasonable hr practices.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this testimony.
campion intended to testify as to twenty reasonable hr practices that pgw could have,but did not,employ when conducting its rifs.plaintiffs aver that this testimony is necessary to rebut pgw rfoa defense.the district court disagreed.it concluded that campion hr testimony lacked relevance to the case because plaintiffs c ould rebut defendants rfoa defense only by demonstrating that the factors offered by defendants we re unreasonable.karlo,wl,at quoting powell dallas morning news,supp,aff app x cir.alterations in original.
we agree.when a defendant proffers a rfoa,the plaintiff can rebut it by showing that the factor relied upon is unreasonable,not by identifying twenty other practices that would have been reasonable instead.see smith,at while there may have been other reasonable ways for the city to achieve its goals,the one selected was not unreasonable.
plaintiffs also argue that pgw proffered rfoa fails as a matter of law.if true,that would eliminate the need for campion hr testimony under plaintiffs own explanation for its relevance.but because the district court did not grant
