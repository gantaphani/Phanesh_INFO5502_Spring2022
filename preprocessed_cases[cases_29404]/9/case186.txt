thomas gianfrancesco,the former proprietor of a bar and restaurant in wrentham,massachusetts,sued the town of wrentham and a number of town officials,claiming federal civil rights violations and unfair trade practices he alleges that the defendants maliciously imposed excessive regulatory requirements on his restaurant in retaliation for his opposition to certain town policies.the district court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
we draw the following facts from gianfrancesco amended complaint.see katz pershing,llc,cir.from to,gianfrancesco owned and operated tom tavern,a restaurant and bar in wrentham.at various times,gianfrancesco appeared before local governmental bodies including the board of health,the planning board,the zoning board of appeals,and the board of selectmen to voice his opinion most often critical of the town regulations and enforcement of various rules and code provisions concerning local businesses.in,he openly and publicly defied the town smoking ordinances,which resulted in state court litigation the outcome of which is not described in the complaint.
gianfrancesco alleges that,during and after the state court proceedings,the defendants subjected tom tavern to a pattern of deliberate and selective application and enforcement of town regulations.this pattern included repeated inspections aimed at ferreting out violations repeated requests for information and a series of unjustified orders requiring improvements,additions,and renovations,including septic and sprinkler system upgrades.gianfrancesco alleges that all of these actions were deliberately directed at tom tavern and not at other similarly situated establishments,and that they were undertaken in direct retaliation against gianfrancesco for the exercise of his first amendments rights of expression and speech in criticizing town government and defying the smoking.he also alleges that during a meeting regarding the sprinkler system requirements,the town administrator made remarks to the effect that tom tavern should be shut down.indeed,in early,tom tavern was forced out of business,allegedly due to the deliberate and intentional misconduct of the defendants.
gianfrancesco on his own behalf and as trustee of the shears street realty trust,which apparently owned the land where tom tavern was located,along with lindy a massachusetts corporation whose role here is not clear,brought a welter of claims against the defendants in norfolk superior court.the defendants removed the case to the district court.after much procedural skirmishing,two sets of claims remained.the first set alleged violations of gianfrancesco free speech,due process,and equal protection rights under.the second set alleged violations of.laws ch,the state law.the district court dismissed the claims on the grounds that they were vague,failed to connect any of the alleged harms to any particular defendant,and did not establish a basis for municipal liability.gianfrancesco town of wrentham,rwz,wl,at.the court jettisoned the state law claims on the basis that chapter does not apply beyond the business context,and the amended complaint does not even suggest any business context nor does it allege any unfair act or deceptive practice.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
although the defendants wholeheartedly endorse the district court dismissal of gianfrancesco amended complaint for failure to state a claim,they also offer another basis for affirmance that gianfrancesco lacks standing to bring his claims.the gist of the defendants argument is that gianfrancesco who is the sole remaining plaintiff in the lacks standing to sue them for harms inflicted on his business,tom tavern.this argument invokes the rule,under which a corporate shareholder even a sole shareholder may not sue in his own name to redress injuries suffered solely by the corporation.see pagán calderón,cir charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.
standing doctrine has two elements an irreducible constitutional minimum,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and a prudential component,see allen wright,d.the former requires that a plaintiff allege a concrete injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.daimlerchrysler cuno,d lujan,at.the latter has various aspects,including a requirement that a party assert his own legal rights and interests,not those of third parties.warth seldin,d.the rule is a species of prudential limitation,not a component of the core constitutional standing requirement.see franchise tax bd.of cal.alcan aluminium,d.
here,the ownership structure of tom tavern is actually unclear.the amended complaint lists gianfrancesco as tom tavern in the caption,but elsewhere alleges that he is the owner and operator of tom tavern.the complaint also says that lindy is tom tavern and is a massachusetts corporation.it is unclear from these descriptions whether tom tavern is some separate corporate entity or is simply a business name for lindy,or is something else entirely.of course,if tom tavern whatever its formal designation is not a corporation in which gianfrancesco has an interest,the rule likely does not apply to him.but,in light of this confusion,we think it prudent to bypass the issue in favor of a more straightforward resolution on the merits.we are able to do so because,although we may never bypass a question of constitutional standing to reach the merits of a case,see steel citizens for a better env t,d,the same is not true of prudential standing limitations like the rule,see grubbs bailes,cir collecting cases.
for example,in franchise tax board,a pair of foreign parent companies challenged the constitutionality of taxes imposed on their subsidiaries the defendants disputed their standing to do so.the supreme court found that the parent companies had article iii standing,but assumed without deciding that they could duck the rule and thus show prudential standing because a statute barred their claim anyway.see at.following the court example,we need not decide whether the rule bars gianfrancesco claims because we conclude that,under any construction of the allegations in his complaint,see allen,at,he does have article iii standing and,as explained below,his claims fail on the merits.
if tom tavern is simply the name under which gianfrancesco personally does business,then he has article iii standing because he suffered direct financial harm as a result of the defendants alleged conduct.see danvers motor ford motor,cir noting that economic harm is a paradigmatic for standing purposes.and if tom tavern is a separate corporate entity of some sort,he has article iii standing for the same reason the parent companies had it in franchise tax board the defendants actions,although taken against his business rather than against gianfrancesco himself,caused him actual financial injury by driving tom tavern out of business.see at see also sbt holdings,llc town of westminster,cir plaintiffs suffered article iii by virtue of actions taken against their business,which caused them direct and consequential financial harm.at the pleading stage,when general factual allegations may suffice to show standing,lujan,at,no more is required,see franchise tax,at.
failure to state a claim 
to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,a complaint need not present detailed factual allegations,bell atl.twombly,d,but it must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,ashcroft iqbal,d quoting twombly,at.the precise parameters of the plausibility standard are still a work in progress,menard csx,cir,but,at bottom,a complaint factual content must allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,iqbal,at.an unadorned,accusation will not do.id.at.we review the district court dismissal de novo,construing the complaint and drawing any reasonable inferences in gianfrancesco favor.harron town of franklin,cir.
