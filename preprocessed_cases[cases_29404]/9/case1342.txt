defendant jared katz,an officer in the colchester,vermont police department,challenges so much of an order of the united states district court for the district of vermont,william sessions iii,judge,as denied his motion pursuant to.for summary judgment dismissing the claims of plaintiff dean kent brought under and state law for false arrest,on the ground that katz has qualified immunity from suit on those claims because a state court found probable cause for kent arrest,thereby collaterally estopping kent from proving an essential element of his false arrest claims.in the district court,katz had moved to dismiss all of kent claims the district court denied the motion in part,stating that as to certain claims,including the claims of false arrest,the presence of genuine issues of material fact precluded the granting of summary judgment.
after katz filed a notice of appeal,kent moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.this court granted the motion in part,noting that we have jurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal from the denial of summary judgment based on an immunity defense only to the extent that the defense can be decided as a matter of law.see,behrens pelletier,d johnson jones,d in re state police litigation,cir.accordingly,we dismissed so much of the appeal as dealt with a kent claims other than those for false arrest,and b the false arrest claims themselves except to the extent that katz asserted qualified immunity as a matter of law on the basis of collateral estoppel as to the issue of probable cause.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that kent contention that he was arrested without probable cause is not precluded by collateral estoppel,and that katz has not shown that he is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.we therefore affirm the denial of summary judgment.
background 
except as indicated,the following facts pertaining to the claims of false arrest are essentially undisputed.on the afternoon of june,kent and two assistants,keith shappy and aaron sterling,were clearing brush and burning it on kent property in the town of colchester,chittenden county,vermont.at some point,kent drove off on an errand,leaving shappy and sterling to tend the fire.while kent was gone,katz arrived,responding to a complaint of a fire on the property.kent shortly returned,parked his jeep,and walked toward katz.
katz informed kent that there had been a complaint kent asked who had complained.this exchange occurred several times.katz asked whether kent had a permit for the fire.kent said they had been burning brush for days,and he shrugged the parties differ as to the meaning of the shrug.
at some point,katz stated that kent eyes were red,and he asked whether kent had been drinking.kent said he had not,but his response included the statement,n ot very much.according to kent,his first response was no when he was asked how much alcohol he had drunk,he said n ot very much sarcastically and he reiterated to katz that he had not been drinking that day.
katz also asserts that kent was walking unsteadily as he approached katz that kent swayed as he stood before katz that kent speech was slurred and that there was a strong odor of intoxicants on kent breath.disputing these assertions,kent submitted affidavits from shappy,sterling,and others who had been with kent on june,stating that kent had not been drinking alcohol that day.shappy sterling,both of whom witnessed the encounter between katz and kent,stated that kent had not staggered,swayed,appeared intoxicated,or smelled of alcohol.
there is no dispute that katz asked kent to take a sobriety test and that kent refused kent argued that he was on his own property and not driving.katz arrested kent for suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol dwi in violation of.katz asked kent to turn around and place his hands behind his back kent complied.katz attempted to force kent hand and wrist up behind his back and eventually kicked kent feet out from under him.at some point,kent wrist was broken.
on june,in connection with a state of vermont state summary procedure for civil suspension of the driver license of a person whom a law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe was violating,see,katz filed an affidavit in the state district court for chittenden county,giving his version of the june events and stating that he ha d probable cause to believe that kent had driven while intoxicated,in violation of.affidavit of jared katz dated june,affidavit,at.the affidavit was submitted ex parte and although c requires that the accused be given prompt notice of the summary civil suspension and a copy of the officer affidavit,kent apparently did not receive katz notice and affidavit until much later.
on july,the state filed an information against kent.it alleged that kent,in colchester on the day of june did then and there operate a motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,to wit a jeep,on macrae road,in violation of vsa a.information dated july,original information or information.on july,a chittenden county district judge subscribed to the following statement at the foot of the information this information has been presented to me and i have found probable cause,this day of july.see generally.c if the defendant was arrested without a warrant and the prosecution is upon information,the judicial officer shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the defendant has committed it.see also.h allowing the defendant to challenge such a finding.
kent was arraigned on the dwi charge on july.he pleaded not guilty and subsequently moved for a good cause hearing on that charge.kent motion was adjourned several times and was never heard because in january,he and the state agreed to settle the case.the state reduced the charge against kent from dwi,a,to careless and negligent operation of a motor vehicle,in violation of a c n or negligent operation and kent pleaded nolo contendere to the negligent operation charge.in addition,the state agreed not to pursue the civil suspension of kent driver license under.the agreement was reflected in the following colloquy before the state court 
state judge,we have a resolution in this case.the state going to amend the dwi to a c n and we are going to concede the civil to the defendant.and we going to recommend a three hundred dollar fine.the state entering this agreement after reviewing it s case.as the court knows,the defendant arm was injured in this incident and the state is not taking that into consideration.what we taking into consideration is the evidence we would have if went we to trial 
court i would understand the state going to reduce the charge to careless and negligent driving,the court is going to enter judgment for the defendant in the civil matter and the defendant will pay a three hundred dollar fine.

the state informed the court that it would submit an affidavit from someone other than katz to support the negligent operation charge,because the conduct underlying that charge had not been observed by katz 
state your honor,the state going to provide the court with an affidavit because we are basing this on the operation which officer katz did not view,but somebody else did,so i will be providing you with an affidavit on that.
court today 
court along with the amendment 
court all right,the state attorney has amended the information and reduced the charge so that the information reads as follows,kent.that dean kent at colchester on the day of june,did then and there operate a motor vehicle on a public highway in a negligent manner,to wit,a jeep on the macrae road by turning his steering wheel back and forth within his lane.
state tr.the charge against kent was duly amended.the original information,the state crossed out the words while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,inserted instead the words in a negligent manner by turning his steering wheel back forth within his lane,and changed the statutory section under which kent was charged from a to a.information as amended on january,amended information.
after reading the amended information to kent and noting the statutory penalties associated with the substituted charge,the court determined that kent understood the amendment,and it accepted kent plea 
court do you understand the amended charge 
kent no contest,sir.
court and you wish to plead no contest to that.and to support that charge,i have an affidavit of robert miller which does contain some facts regarding the turning of the steering wheel back and forth a few times.so unless there anything further you want to say or your attorney wants to say,i accept your plea.
all right,the court will enter a finding and judgment of guilty on defendant no contest plea of careless and negligent driving.
the state concession with respect to the civil suspension of kent license was apparently made in recognition that the license had been summarily suspended even though notice of the proceeding was sent to kent belatedly,if at all.see state tr.defense counsel t he notification never got through.id.at defense counsel i t just kind of never made it.state right.court it just never got addressed until a later date.the court stated that the state concession resulted in a finding for the defendant.id.
in june,kent commenced the present action in state court against katz and others,principally asserting claims for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and use of excessive force in violation of his rights under the first,fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and in violation of state law.the defendants removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment.
to the extent pertinent here,the district court denied katz motion with respect to kent claims for false arrest and excessive force and his claims for false arrest,assault,and battery.the court ruled that there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to whether katz was entitled to qualified immunity with respect to those claims.
katz appealed.as set forth above,this court dismissed part of the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction,leaving only the question of whether katz was entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law on the false arrest claims,on the basis that the vermont district court july,finding of probable cause constituted collateral estoppel,precluding kent from establishing an essential element of a claim for false arrest.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that katz was not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on his defense of qualified immunity.
ii.discussion 
a qualified immunity defense is established if a the defendant action did not violate clearly established law,or b it was objectively reasonable for the defendant to believe that his action did not violate such law.see,anderson creighton,d harlow fitzgerald,d.the objective reasonableness test is met if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of the defendant actions.malley briggs,d.since the principle that a warrantless arrest without probable cause violates the fourth amendment was clearly established prior to katz arrest of kent in,katz may be found entitled to qualified immunity only if he actually had probable cause to arrest kent for driving while intoxicated or if it was objectively reasonable for him to believe he had probable cause for that arrest.the question for this appeal is whether,on the present record,such an entitlement can be determined as a matter of law.we conclude that it can not.
katz claim of qualified immunity via collateral estoppel 
a claim of false arrest based on the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures may not be maintained if there was probable cause for the arrest.see,weyant okst,cir singer fulton county sheriff,cir there can be no federal civil rights claim for false arrest where the arresting officer had probable cause,cert.denied,d.it appears to be undisputed that this principle applies as well to a claim of false arrest under vermont law.where a court has already determined the issue of probable cause to make an arrest that is the subject of a claim of false arrest,a party may,in appropriate circumstances,be estopped from relitigating that issue.see generally golino city of new haven,cir,cert.denied,d.
in considering katz claim of qualified immunity based on the contention that kent is collaterally estopped because of the vermont district court july,finding of probable cause,we look to vermont law and give that court finding whatever preclusive effect it would be given under vermont law.see,migra warren city school district board of education,d kremer chemical construction,d.under vermont law,collateral estoppel is not appropriate unless,inter alia,an issue was actually litigated and was necessary to the final judgment in the prior case,and the party against whom estoppel is asserted had adequate opportunity and incentive to litigate the issue 
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,bars the subsequent relitigation of an issue that was actually litigated and decided in a prior case between the parties,so long as there was a final judgment on the merits and the issue was necessary to resolution of the action the elements of issue preclusion are the following 
preclusion is asserted against one who was a party or in privity with a party in the earlier action the issue was resolved by a final judgment on the merits the issue is the same as the one raised in the later action there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier action and applying preclusion in the later action is fair.

in determining whether collateral estoppel should apply,courts must look to the circumstances of each case,including,among other things,the incentive for the party against whom estoppel is claimed to litigate the issue.
bull pinkham engineering,at,at.
applying these principles to the present case,we conclude that collateral estoppel is inapplicable for several reasons.first,the vermont judge july finding of probable cause inscribed on the original information was not a final judgment.such a finding was required as a threshold matter in order to permit the prosecution to proceed because there had been no warrant and no indictment,see.c but that finding was open to reconsideration,see.h upon request of the defendant,the judicial officer shall review the finding of probable cause.
second,although there eventually was a final judgment in the criminal proceeding against kent,that judgment did not decide the issue of whether katz had probable cause to arrest kent for dwi.the dwi charge was changed by the state to one of negligent operation,alleging simply that kent had turn ed his steering wheel back and forth within his lane amended information kent pleaded nolo contendere to the latter charge and negligent operation,not dwi,is the charge that was resolved by the final judgment.further,the affidavit of kent friend robert miller,submitted by the state to support the negligent operation charge,could not have supported a finding of dwi.miller indicated that he and kent had been on macrae road driving toward each other on june,and that kent had turned his steering wheel back and forth a few times to signal miller to slow down and stop for a quick chat see affidavit of robert miller dated september,but miller also stated that,in that chat,kent had appeared normal and that miller did not detect any alcohol on his breath.id.in sum,there was no final judgment that decided the question of probable cause to believe that kent had driven while under the influence of alcohol.
nor,given the amendment of the information to charge kent with negligent operation rather than with dwi,could it be said that a decision as to whether katz had probable cause to arrest kent on suspicion of dwi was necessary to the resolution of the criminal case.intoxication is not an element of the offense of negligent operation.
further,the issue of probable cause to arrest kent was not actually litigated.as discussed above,the vermont judge initial finding of probable cause was,un
