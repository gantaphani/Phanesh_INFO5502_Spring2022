this is an employment discrimination action brought by david bennett against his quondam employer,corporation,and two of its executives,john mesher and timothy feagans.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of all the defendants.
in this appeal,the plaintiff assigns three broad categories of error.first,he asserts that the district court improperly excluded certain evidence that he proffered at the summary judgment stage.second,he asserts that the court erred in determining that he failed to raise genuine issues of material fact sufficient to ward off brevis disposition on one or more of his causes of action.third,he asserts that the court should not have disregarded a further evidentiary proffer made in connection with his motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment order.discerning neither an error of law nor an abuse of discretion,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the district court aptly summarized the facts of the case and the history of the relationships among the protagonists.see bennett,d.we assume the reader familiarity with that exegetic account and,accordingly,rehearse here only the essence of what transpired.we supplement that recital in our later discussion of the issues on appeal.
the plaintiff was hired by as a patent attorney in.when acquired the predecessor,he remained aboard.in,he began reporting to feagans,the company deputy general counsel.like the plaintiff,feagans was based at the company plant in worcester,massachusetts.feagans reported to mesher,the general counsel,who worked at the company united states headquarters in valley forge,pennsylvania.
the plaintiff proved to be a competent attorney.he nevertheless had trouble interacting with management.on several occasions,supervisors spoke to him about his attitude and demeanor.in addition,mesher,feagans,and other company personnel exchanged emails at various times regarding the plaintiff conduct.
in june of,the years with other members of the law department intellectual property ip group to file internal age discrimination grievances against feagans.the grievances included references to statements allegedly made by feagans to the effect that he wanted to get rid of older members of the group.such a statement allegedly was made to one of the grievants,mary porter.
the company took the grievances seriously the for human resources undertook an investigation.he met with the complainants,interviewed employees,and reviewed written documentation related to the grievances.after concluding this limited probe,he found that a formal investigation was unwarranted and recommended that the company dismiss the grievances as unfounded.that was the end of the matter.
according to,the plaintiff thereafter engaged in various acts of insubordination.yet,in,he earned a higher performance rating than in the previous year and was rewarded with a salary increase.
in september of,consulting plans to close the law department worcester satellite operation and move those jobs to valley forge.he gave the staff in worcester the option either of migrating or of accepting a generous severance package.within a month,however,mesher reversed his field he abandoned the consolidation plan and rescinded the special severance offer.
on or about october,the plaintiff for the first time expressed an interest in accepting the special severance package.since the offer had been withdrawn three weeks earlier,his interest went unrequited.
for reasons that shortly will become apparent,we turn for a moment to the plight of another employee,diana henchey.between the fall of and the fall of,henchey on four occasions reported receiving anonymous,sexually tinged poems while at work.the poems were both unwanted and discomforting.the company reasonably concluded that this harassment was in all probability the work of a fellow employee.
the poems themselves offered a clue to the author identity certain words were spelled in a distinctively british fashion.based on that fact and on her short encounters with the plaintiff who is british,henchey suspected that he might be the anonymous poet.she voiced this suspicion to the company.
at that point,the human resources office contacted robert wilk,an employee in the company security department.wilk conducted an investigation and retained an outside handwriting expert to assist in determining authorship.wilk kept mesher apprised of the status of the probe.
in due course,the handwriting expert concluded that it was highly probable that the plaintiff had written the poems.when notified of the expert opinion,mesher contacted feagans.he told feagans that he wanted to make sure that the plaintiff would be available for a meeting in worcester on a day certain.he did not say why.without knowing the purpose of the meeting,feagans ensured the plaintiff availability.
the meeting took place on october.wilk,the plaintiff,and an outside consultant were in attendance.the plaintiff was asked whether he had written the poems.he not only denied their authorship but also denied that he had ever composed any poems.however,a search of the plaintiff office revealed copies of other poems that he had written.
at one point during the session,the plaintiff was asked to spell meager a word that appeared,spelled,in one of the poems sent to henchey.the plaintiff complied.he used the same distinctively british spelling that the poet had used.
wilk advised mesher of the results of the interview and search.mesher concluded that the plaintiff had sent the poems and decided to discharge him.there is no evidence that mesher consulted feagans with respect to this decision.
following his discharge,the plaintiff sued.he alleged,among other things,age discrimination,retaliation,aiding and abetting,and tortious interference with contractual relations.in due season,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion,see bennett,d at,and thereafter denied the plaintiff motion for reconsideration.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we begin our trek through the record with the preliminary question of whether the lower court acted appropriately in rejecting certain evidence that the plaintiff sought to have considered on summary judgment.we then address the court summary judgment ruling,subdividing that discussion into four segments to correspond with the four causes of action pressed by the plaintiff at the hearing on summary judgment.finally,we deal with the denial of the motion for reconsideration.
a.the evidentiary proffer.
at the summary judgment hearing,the district court ruled inadmissible statements contained in the internal age discrimination grievances filed by members of the ip group.these unsworn grievances referenced remarks allegedly made by feagans to porter and another who recounted them to porter.the district court ruled that the unsworn grievances constituted inadmissible hearsay.bennett,d at citing cloutier costco wholesale,cir.the plaintiff argues that the court improperly excluded this evidence both because the defendants admitted that the grievances had been filed and because the crucial statements fall within any of several possible exceptions to or exclusions from the hearsay rule.in that regard,he mentions the exclusion for prior inconsistent statements.d the exclusion for admissions by a,id.d a the exclusion for admissions by an employer agent acting within the scope of employment,id.d d and the exception for statements concerning state of mind,id.he also mentions the exceptions for business records,id,and for operative facts,id.he also makes a curious argument that feagans alleged comment is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted in which event it would fall outside the hearsay definition altogether,see id.c.
we review claims relating to the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.see united states brown,cir rullán,cir.that same standard applies to a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence at the summary judgment stage.see joiner,d merck,sharp dohme química,cir.
the plaintiff initial argument assumes too much.although the defendants admitted that the grievances were in fact filed,that admission does not equate to an admission that feagans made the statements attributed to him in the grievances.as the plaintiff acknowledges,see appellant br.at,the defendants consistently have denied that any such comments were made.
our decision in dávila corporación de puerto rico para la difusión pública,cir,largely disposes of the plaintiff next argument.there,the plaintiff relied on an affidavit stating that others had told him that his supervisor considered him too old for his job.id.at.but the plaintiff did not offer an affidavit from any person who actually had heard the alleged statement.given this omission,we ruled that the statement was hearsay under federal rule of evidence c and reiterated that i t is law that hearsay evidence can not be considered on summary judgment.dávila,at.
the scenario here demands the same result.the plaintiff had no knowledge of feagans alleged remarks,nor did he tender an affidavit from porter or any other percipient witness attesting to them.thus,the comments attributed to feagans in porter grievance were hearsay.
the plaintiff sundry attempts to avoid the hearsay bar do not call for a different result.indeed,because porter grievance was unsworn,her narrative about feagans comments comprised hearsay within hearsay and,thus,confronted a doubled hearsay bar.see.see,united states patrick,cir.
the plaintiff efforts either to characterize these comments as nonhearsay or to fit them into a hearsay exception are unavailing.while the plaintiff lists a litany of hearsay exceptions and exclusions,most of these references are unaccompanied by developed argumentation and,accordingly,need not be addressed.see united states zannino,cir.the remainder are easily dispatched.see,united states millán,cir holding statement inadmissible under exception to hearsay rule absent proof of personal knowledge ricciardi children hosp.med,cir requiring a showing of personal knowledge before evidence may be admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.and,finally,the plaintiff never explains how the admission of the grievances other than for the truth of the matter asserted would advance his cause.
we add,moreover,that even if the grievances did not comprise hearsay,they would not have had a decisive bearing on the issues before the district court.after all,feagans was not the decisionmaker here.thus,whether or not he made discriminatory comments would not have affected the outcome which turned on whether person responsible for the decision to terminate the plaintiff out of a discriminatory animus.put another way,since feagans had no part in the adverse employment decision,his comments,even if made,would constitute nothing more than stray remarks.as such,they would be insufficient to block summary judgment.see,ramírez rodríguez boehringer ingelheim,cir holding stray remarks by nondecisionmakers insufficient to prove pretext rest.metropol,cir similar gonzález el día,cir similar.
b.the age discrimination claims.
having demarcated the boundaries of the summary judgment record,we turn next to the district court disposition of the plaintiff age discrimination claims.we review de novo a district court entry of summary judgment.iverson city of boston,cir.in conducting that tamisage,we consider the evidence in the light most congenial to the nonmoving party here,the plaintiff and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.id.only record,viewed in that light,discloses no genuine issue as to any material fact and reveals that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,we will affirm the summary judgment order.see.c.
in an employment discrimination case,a plaintiff ability to survive summary judgment depends on his ability to muster facts sufficient to support an inference of discrimination.he can not rely exclusively on bald assertions,unsupported conclusions,or optimistic surmises.see reynolds tobacco,cir.where,as here,the has the burden of proof,the evidence adduced on each of the elements of his asserted cause of action must be significantly probative in order to forestall summary judgment.anderson liberty lobby,d dávila,at.
in this instance,the plaintiff brought age discrimination claims against under both the federal age discrimination in employment act of adea,and a counterpart state statute.laws ch.the tests under these two sets of statutes are substantially similar and in all events,the plaintiff has relied upon a unitary standard.thus,we set out the adea paradigm with the understanding that,for present purposes,that paradigm applies to all of the plaintiff age discrimination claims.
under the adea,an employer is prohibited from taking an adverse employment action against an employee who is forty years of age or older because of the latter age.see a,a.when no direct proof of discrimination exists,the employee may rely on circumstantial evidence to prove discrimination.see dávila,at.a prima facie case of discrimination may be established through the framework first limned by the supreme court.see mcdonnell douglas green,d.
an employee who claims to have been cashiered in violation of the adea must carry the ultimate burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge,that is,that he would not have been fired but for his age.mesnick,cir quoting freeman package mach,cir.the framework may help an employee to carry this burden.
that framework requires the employee,in the first instance,to make out a prima facie case.to accomplish this modest task,the plaintiff must adduce evidence showing four facts i that he is a member of the protected group that is,that he was at least forty years of age when dismissed from his employment ii that his job performance met or exceeded his employer legitimate expectations iii that his employer actually or constructively discharged him and iv that his employer had a continuing need for the services that he had been rendering.see dávila,at nce foods,cir.
once the plaintiff makes out his prima facie case,the burden of production but not the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the dismissal.see mesnick,at.if and when the defendant satisfies its burden of production,the plaintiff no longer can rest on the initial inference of discrimination but,rather,must show that the defendant articulated reason is pretextual.see dávila,at mesnick,at.at summary judgment,this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age.dávila,at.
actionable discrimination can not exist in a vacuum.rather,the discriminatory intent of which a plaintiff complains must be traceable to the person or persons who made the decision to fire him.see,at,at.
in this instance,the parties agree that the plaintiff made out his prima facie case.they also agree that articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff employment a belief that he had authored the harassing poems,transmitted them to henchey,and lied about it when confronted.the crux of the parties dispute on the age discrimination claims is whether the plaintiff adduced any significantly probative evidence of pretext.we think he has not.
when assessing a claim of pretext in an employment discrimination case,an inquiring court must focus on the motivations and perceptions of the actual decisionmaker.dávila,at.statements made by those who are not involved in the decisional process normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus,at internal citation omitted.
in the absence of some other proof that the decisionmaker harbored a discriminatory animus,it is not enough that his perception may have been incorrect.see dávila,at mesnick,at.rather,the plaintiff must show that the decisionmaker did not believe in the accuracy of the reason given.ronda pérez banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria,cir gray new engl,cir.
the plaintiff argument runs afoul of these tenets.his evidentiary proffer centers on a discriminatory animus that he attributes to feagans.that proffer does not take the plaintiff very far what is conspicuously missing is evidence either that feagans had something to do with the discharge decision or that actual feagans sentiments.for aught that appears,mesher made the decision to fire the plaintiff based on wilk investigation and without ever consulting feagans.
to be sure,the plaintiff speculates that mesher must have been influenced by his subordinate.but conjecture can not take the place of proof in the summary judgment calculus.see,at.nothing in the record supports an inference of complicity.indeed,the record reveals that feagans was deliberately kept in the dark about the purpose of the climactic october meeting.
the plaintiff has a second string to his bow.he attempts to persuade us that he did not compose the poems.that issue is largely beside the point what counts is whether the the plaintiff to be the author and,if so,whether he acted on that belief in deciding to send the plaintiff packing see,dávila,at ronda pérez,at.here,the plaintiff offered no evidence to show that mesher believed that the poems were written by someone else.
the short of it is that courts,in employment discrimination cases,may not act as super personnel departments,substituting their judicial judgments for the business judgments of employers.mesnick,at.in the absence of any evidence that an employer decision was pretextual or motivated by discriminatory intent,a court has no right to supersede that decision.because this is such a case,we uphold the district court entry of summary judgment on the plaintiff age discrimination claims.
c.the retaliation claims.
as an alternate theory,the plaintiff asserts that unlawfully retaliated against him in violation of both the adea,d,and state law.laws ch,by terminating his employment because he had filed an internal grievance against feagans.in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,an employee must show that he engaged in a protected activity and that he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of his participation in that activity.see ramírez rodríguez,at maccormack boston edison.at a bare minimum,this requires an employee to make a colorable showing of a causal connection between his protected activity here,the filing of the grievance and the adverse employment action here,the dismissal.the plaintiff has failed to cross that threshold.
as explained above,the grievance filed by the plaintiff was directed at feagans,not mesher.feagans was at best a manager,and the plaintiff has offered nothing that would ground a reasonable inference that either mesher or the company would be moved to retaliate on feagans behalf.
here,moreover,sixteen months passed between the filing of the grievance and the plaintiff subsequent ouster.this temporal gap is sufficiently large so that,without some corroborative evidence,it will not support an inferred notion of a causal connection between the two.see,bishop bell atl,cir finding gap between protected activity and adverse employment action insufficient to support a reasonable inference of causation mesnick,at holding that a time lapse of nine months between the filing of a formal grievance and the adverse employment action undercut any inference of causation.
we add that what evidence does exist is not corroborative of,but tends to refute,an inference of retaliation.for example,any suggestion of a connection between the grievance and the plaintiff ouster is undermined by the fact that the plaintiff received a more favorable performance review in the year after he filed the grievance than in the year preceding the filing.along the same line,he also received a raise.logically,such positive developments cut against any plausible inference of retaliation see,freadman metro.prop.cas.ins,cir finding interim salary increase and improved performance review,among other facts,sufficient to break causal chain as to retaliation claim houser sears,roebuck,cir finding no age discrimination when employee was promoted just days before being discharged for violating company policies.
d.the aiding and abetting claims.
in addition to his claims against his employer,the plaintiff trains his sights on mesher and feagans.he asserts that they transgressed a massachusetts statute.laws ch,by aiding and abetting in its unlawful age discrimination and retaliation.
we need not linger long over these claims.we agree with the district court,bennett,d at,that because the age discrimination and retaliation claims were appropriately resolved in favor,see supra parts ii b c,the attendant aiding and abetting claims necessarily fail.see beasley aramark unif.career apparel,d,ligenza genesis health ventures of.after all,it stands to reason that one can not aid or abet a wrong that never occurred.
e.the tortious interference claims.
the plaintiff further asserts that mesher and feagans tortiously interfered with advantageous contractual relations specifically,his employment these are claims cognizable under state law.see,blackstone cashman,bray cmty.newsp.
to survive a motion for summary judgment on such a claim,a plaintiff must make out a genuine issue of material fact with respect to each of the elements of the tort.under massachusetts law,the elements of the tort,in the employment context,are i the existence of a business relationship between the plaintiff and a third party,ii of which the defendant is aware and iii with which he intentionally and improperly interferes,iv causing an impairment of the business relationship,to the plaintiff detriment.see zimmerman direct fed.credit union,cir applying massachusetts law.in this context,actual malice must be shown to prove improper motive or means.blackstone,at.to establish that element of the tort,the plaintiff must show more than hostility or personal incompatibility.see zimmerman,at king driscoll.in addition,malice must have been more than a mere concomitant of the parties relationship it must have been the controlling factor in the offending conduct.zimmerman,at.
in this case,it is undisputed that the plaintiff had a business relationship with,that mesher and feagans knew as much,and that mesher actions in terminating the plaintiff employment disrupted that relationship and caused the plaintiff harm.feagans took no action in that regard,so the claim against him is a work of fiction.this leaves only the claim against mesher.
that claim dissolves when scrutinized.the plaintiff simply has not pointed to any evidentiary predicate on which a rational jury could find that mesher acted with malice in discharging him.even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the record shows that mesher acted strictly and solely out of a reasonable belief that the plaintiff had composed the harassing poems and delivered them to henchey.the fact that an employer may have breathed a sigh of relief when showing the door to a gadfly or a nettlesome employee does not transform a founded dismissal into a malicious act.see gram liberty mut.ins,holding supervisor dislike of employee insufficient to support a finding of malice mesnick,at finding evidence that employer may have been glad to relieve itself of employee bad behavior did not translate into evidence of animus for purposes of discrimination claim.
for these reasons,we conclude that the plaintiff claims for tortious interference with contractual relations were properly disposed of by summary judgment.
f.the motion for reconsideration.
the plaintiff last remaining assignment of error concerns the district court denial of his motion to reconsider the entry of summary judgment.we review a district court decision on such a motion for abuse of discretion.dimaio family pizza,charter oak fire ins,cir rodríguez fullerton tires,cir.
the relevant facts are as follows.after the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,the plaintiff tried to salvage his case by submitting additional evidence on a motion for reconsideration.these submissions comprised i an affidavit from porter attesting that feagans had stated to her that he wanted to be rid of older members of the ip group and ii a supplemental affidavit from the plaintiff
