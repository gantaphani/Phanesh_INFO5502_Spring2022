rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides for cost shifting where a defendant offers to settle,the offer is rejected and the plaintiff thereafter prevails but recovers less than the offer.the difficult question in this case is how the rule should be read and applied in cases where multiple defendants make a joint offer to settle the whole situation that the rule drafters may not have thought through and certainly did not explicitly resolve.
in the underlying case,antonio king sued seven new hampshire corrections officers and employees in federal district court in new hampshire,alleging constitutional violations while king was a pretrial detainee in the hillsborough house of corrections.the gist of the claims was that he had been falsely accused of threatening a guard and was thereafter mistreated during his confinement.the complaint charged procedural due process and eighth amendment violations,varying with the defendant.
according to king later testimony,on july,while the inmates were out of their cells for recreation,cesar rivas,an corrections officer in a medium security wing of the jail unit,radioed for assistance,falsely reporting that he was in jeopardy of being taken hostage.rivas identified king,along with eight other inmates,as having threatened him.three other corrections officers then took king to the jail segregation unit unit,known as the hole.
soon after he was taken to the hole,a disciplinary officer charged king with disciplinary violations based on rivas report.after a hearing,which took place on july,king was sentenced to thirty days in segregation beginning august.after king thirty day sentence was complete,a classification officer placed him in administrative segregation,which resulted in his spending his remaining time at hillsborough in the hole.he was released on december.
while in the hole,king was allowed only a mattress,sheet,pillow,and prison uniform everything else was forbidden including personal hygiene products and toilet paper.king had to ask guards to turn on the water to flush the toilet,drink,or wash his not always satisfied promptly.he was allowed out of his cell only once every three days,shackled,in order to shower and was subject to frequent strip searches.these conditions remained throughout his time in segregation.
this description does not fully capture the grim and unsanitary circumstances of the confinement.a more complete description is provided in decisions stemming from the litigation that followed.see,surprenant rivas,cir.although not involving direct brutality,the conditions were of a kind that might a jury to take a harsh view of the defendants,particularly rivas if the jury concluded that he had falsely reported the events.
after king filed his law suit,the defendants,jointly represented,invoked rule and made an offer on january,to settle with king for a single payment of,together with attorney fees and costs as determined by the court.the rule,in pertinent part,provides 
at any time more than days before trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against him for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.
by its terms,the defendants offer was one to settle the entire law suit for a fixed sum and did not apportion the sum among the seven defendants.the offer expired under the rule when king did not respond within ten days.on january,king voluntarily dismissed his claims against four of the seven defendants.after a five day trial involving the remaining three,a jury found only rivas liable and awarded king in nominal damages and in punitive damages.
on king motion,the trial judge ordered a new trial on compensatory damages the judge agreed that because the jury had necessarily found that rivas had falsely accused king and led to his wrongful punishment,the nominal damage award was contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence.in the new trial on damages,the newly selected jury awarded king in compensatory damages,giving him a total award of.
other inmates have brought their own law suits based on the same incident.in surprenant rivas,wl,aff,decided prior to king trial,a jury found that rivas and two other defendants also named by king had violated jason surprenant constitutional rights,awarding nominal and punitive damages against both rivas and another defendant,but only nominal damages against a third,totaling surprenant also recovered in attorney fees and in costs.id.at.
in paladin rivas,wl,which followed king trial,a jury found that two other not violated inmates paladin and west constitutional rights.the jury awarded the plaintiffs nominal damages against both liable defendants and each in punitive damages against one of the defendants it also awarded paladin alone in compensatory damages against the other defendant.id.at.plaintiffs received in attorney fees and in costs.id.at.in other cases,the settled before trial.
after king second trial on compensatory damages,he moved as the prevailing party for attorney fees and costs under.rivas objected,arguing that the plaintiff judgment was less than the offer,and that rule therefore shifted costs to king accordingly,rivas sought to recover his attorney fees and costs.the district court held that rule did not apply because the offer had not been apportioned among the defendants,and it awarded king attorney fees and costs for his claims against rivas under section.king rivas,wl,at.
rivas has now appealed,arguing that the district court misconstrued rule,and our review of such a question is de novo.see nepsk,houlton,cir.rivas position is straightforward the defendants offer to king for a joint settlement is deemed to have been rejected king ultimate recovery from all the defendants named in his suit was only thus,costs shift to king.
king responds that the offer was not apportioned and therefore did not allow him to determine how much rivas was offering to settle the claims against rivas alone,so the rule is not triggered.but the offer was hardly ambiguous by its terms it was an offer to settle the whole case,and only the whole case,for costs and attorney fees to date.so king is saying either that a package offer alone does not trigger the rule or,in the alternative,must be accompanied by nominal allocations.
rule was written in the to liability of one party to another and nowhere explains how a joint offer by several defendants should be treated.but federal law provides,in line with common sense,that unless the context indicates importing the singular include and apply to several persons,parties or things.see johnston penrod drilling,cir.compare duke cochise county,finding use of singular unambiguous in cost rule,rendering it inapplicable to joint offer.
in addition,rule purpose of encouraging settlements strongly supports its adaptation to cases,and courts have so assumed.marek chesny,d joint offer by three delta air lines,august,d assuming rule applicability to litigation.but how to apply the rule to joint offers is not addressed by the rule and is ultimately a matter of judicial adaptation of the rule in light of policy.
of course,tactically a plaintiff would prefer an apportioned set of offers that would allow him to pick and choose indeed,an offer judged ample as to one defendant could provide resources to continue the litigation against others.and plaintiffs will often gain valuable bargaining information by learning which defendants are most eager to settle.
but in cases where a single employer is likely to pay the bill such as one against a company and several of its officers,a full settlement will often be the only one that makes sense for the likely the only one that will be forthcoming.as the supreme court noted in marek,i f defendants are not allowed to make offers that would,if accepted,represent their total liability,they would understandably be reluctant to make settlement offers.at.
often,where there is one harm or a related set of harms,a
