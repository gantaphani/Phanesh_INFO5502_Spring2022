via various state statutes and a state constitutional amendment,virginia prevents couples from marrying and refuses to recognize marriages performed elsewhere.two couples filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of these laws,alleging that they violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted the couples motion for summary judgment and enjoined virginia from enforcing the laws.this appeal followed.because we conclude that virginia marriage bans impermissibly infringe on its citizens fundamental right to marry,we affirm.
this case concerns a series of statutory and constitutional mechanisms that virginia employed to prohibit legal recognition for relationships in that state virginia enacted the first of these laws in virginia code section,which provides that marriage between persons of the same sex is prohibited.after the supreme court of hawaii took steps to legalize marriage in the mid,virginia amended section to specify that a ny marriage entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in virginia and any contractual rights created by such marriage shall be void and unenforceable.in,virginia added civil unions and similar arrangements to the list of prohibited relationships via the affirmation of marriage act.see ann.
virginia efforts to ban marriage and other legally recognized relationships culminated in the amendment to the virginia constitution 
that only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this commonwealth and its political subdivisions.
this commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design,qualities,significance,or effects of marriage.nor shall this commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another union,partnership,or other legal status to which is assigned the rights,benefits,obligations,qualities,or effects of marriage.
const.art.i,a.the virginia constitution imposes two hurdles that a potential amendment must jump before becoming law the general assembly must approve the amendment in two separate legislative sessions,and the people must ratify it.const.art.xii.the general assembly approved the amendment in and.in november,virginia voters ratified it by a vote of percent to percent.in the aggregate,virginia code sections and and the amendment prohibit marriage,ban other legally recognized relationships,and render marriages performed elsewhere legally meaningless under virginia state law.
couples timothy bostic and tony london and carol schall and mary townley collectively,the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of virginia code sections and,the amendment,and any other virginia law that bars marriage or prohibits the state recognition of marriages from other jurisdictions collectively,the virginia marriage laws.the plaintiffs claim that the inability to marry or have their relationship recognized by the commonwealth of virginia with the dignity and respect accorded to married couples has caused them significant hardship and severe humiliation,emotional distress,pain,suffering,psychological harm,and stigma.
bostic and london have been in a,committed relationship with each other since and have lived together for more than twenty years.they desire to marry each other under the laws of the commonwealth in order to publicly announce their commitment to one another and to enjoy the rights,privileges,and protections that the state confers on married couples.on july,bostic and london applied for a marriage license from the clerk for the circuit court for the city of norfolk.the clerk denied their application because they are both men.
schall and townley are women who have been a couple since and have lived together as a family for nearly thirty years.they were lawfully married in california in.in,townley gave birth to the couple daughter.schall and townley identify a host of consequences of their inability to marry in virginia and virginia refusal to recognize their california marriage,including the following 
schall could not visit townley in the hospital for several hours when townley was admitted due to complications.
schall can not legally adopt,which forced her to retain an attorney to petition for full joint legal and physical custody.
virginia will not list both schall and townley as.parents on her birth certificate.
until february,schall and townley could not cover one another on their health insurance.townley has been able to cover schall on her insurance since then,but,unlike an spouse,schall must pay state income taxes on the benefits she receives.
schall and townley must pay state taxes on benefits paid pursuant to employee benefits plans in the event of one of their deaths.
schall and townley can not file joint state income tax returns,which has cost them thousands of dollars.
on july,bostic and london sued former governor robert mcdonnell,former attorney general kenneth cuccinelli,and george schaefer,iii,in his official capacity as the clerk for the circuit court for the city of norfolk.the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on september.the first amended complaint added schall and townley as plaintiffs,removed mcdonnell and cuccinelli as defendants,and added janet rainey as a defendant in her official capacity as the state registrar of vital records.the plaintiffs allege that the virginia marriage laws are facially invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and that schaefer and rainey violated by enforcing those laws.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the plaintiffs also requested a permanent injunction in connection with their motion for summary judgment and moved,in the alternative,for a preliminary injunction in the event that the district court denied their motion for summary judgment.the district court granted a motion by michele prince william county clerk of intervene as a defendant on january.two days later,new attorney general mark rainey a formal change in position and refused to defend the virginia marriage laws,although virginia continues to enforce them.mcquigg adopted rainey prior motion for summary judgment and the briefs in support of that motion.
the district court held that the virginia marriage laws were unconstitutional on february.bostic rainey,d.it therefore denied schaefer and mcquigg motions for summary judgment and granted the plaintiffs motion.the district court also enjoined virginia rainey and her schaefer,mcquigg,and their officers,agents,and employees from enforcing the virginia marriage laws.id.at.the court stayed the injunction pending our resolution of this appeal.id.
rainey,schaefer,and mcquigg timely appealed the district court decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.on march,we allowed the plaintiffs from harris rainey a similar case pending before judge michael urbanski in the western district of intervene.judge urbanski had previously certified that case as a class action on behalf of all couples in virginia who have not married in another jurisdiction and all couples in virginia who have married in another jurisdiction,excluding the plaintiffs.harris rainey,cv,wl,at.
our analysis proceeds in three steps.first,we consider whether the plaintiffs possess standing to bring their claims.second,we evaluate whether the supreme court summary dismissal of a similar lawsuit in baker nelson,mem,remains binding.third,we determine which level of constitutional scrutiny applies here and test the virginia marriage laws using the appropriate standard.for purposes of this opinion,we adopt the terminology the district court used to describe the parties in this case.the plaintiffs,rainey,and the harris class are the opponents of the virginia marriage laws.schaefer and mcquigg are the proponents.
before we turn to the merits of the parties arguments in this case,we consider schaefer contention that t he trial court erred as a matter of law when it found all plaintiffs had standing and asserted claims against all defendants.we review the district court disposition of for summary its determinations regarding novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.libertarian party of judd,cir covenant media of,llc city of charleston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.libertarian party of,at quoting.a.
to establish standing under article iii of the constitution,a plaintiff must allege an injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.lujan defenders of wildlife,quoting allen wright,internal quotation marks omitted.the standing requirement applies to each claim that a plaintiff seeks to press.daimlerchrysler cuno.schaefer premises his argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims on the idea that every plaintiff must have standing as to every defendant.however,the supreme court has made it clear that the presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy article ill requirement.rumsfeld forum for academic institutional rights,see also dep t of commerce house of representatives,holding that a case is justiciable if some,but not necessarily all,of the plaintiffs have standing as to a particular defendant vill.of arlington heights metro.housing dev.corp,same.the plaintiffs claims can therefore survive schaefer standing challenge as long as one couple satisfies the standing requirements with respect to each defendant.
schaefer serves as the clerk for the circuit court for the city of norfolk.in virginia,circuit court clerks are responsible for issuing marriage licenses and filing records of marriage.ann.although schall and townley did not seek a marriage license from schaefer,the district court found that bostic and london did so and that schaefer denied their request because they are a couple bostic,d at.this license denial constitutes an injury for standing purposes.see blasting,wilkes,cir explaining that the plaintiffs had not suffered an injury because they had not applied for,or been denied,the permit in question scott greenville,cir holding that denial of building permit constituted an injury.bostic and london can trace this denial to schaefer enforcement of the allegedly unconstitutional virginia marriage laws and declaring those laws unconstitutional and enjoining their enforcement would redress bostic and london injuries.bostic and london therefore possess article iii standing with respect to schaefer.we consequently need not consider whether schall and townley have standing to sue schaefer.see horne flores,declining to analyze whether additional plaintiffs had standing when one plaintiff did.
the registrar of vital tasked with developing virginia marriage license application form and distributing it to the circuit court clerks throughout virginia.ann.a,e.neither schaefer nor rainey response to the first amended complaint disputes its description of rainey duties 
defendant rainey is responsible for ensuring compliance with the commonwealth laws relating to marriage in general and,more specifically,is responsible for enforcement of the specific provisions at issue in this amended complaint,namely those laws that limit marriage to couples and that refuse to honor the benefits of marriages lawfully entered into in other states.
in addition to performing these functions,rainey develops and distributes birth certificate forms,oversees the rules relating to birth certificates,and furnishes forms relating to adoption so that virginia can collect the information necessary to prepare the adopted child birth certificate.id.a,a.
rainey promulgation of a marriage license application form that does not allow couples to obtain marriage licenses resulted in schaefer denial of bostic and london marriage license request.for the reasons we describe above,this license denial constitutes an injury.bostic and london can trace this injury to rainey due to her role in developing the marriage license application form in compliance with the virginia marriage laws,and the relief they seek would redress their injuries.bostic and london consequently have standing to sue rainey.
schall and townley also possess standing to bring their claims against rainey.they satisfy the injury requirement in two ways.first,in equal protection as this case w hen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group,t he injury in fact is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier.ne.chapter of associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville.the virginia marriage laws erect such a barrier,which prevents couples from obtaining the emotional,social,and financial benefits that couples realize upon marriage.second,schall and townley allege that they have suffered stigmatic injuries due to their inability to get married in virginia and virginia refusal to recognize their california marriage.stigmatic injury stemming from discriminatory treatment is sufficient to satisfy standing injury requirement if the plaintiff identifies some concrete interest with respect to which he or she is personally subject to discriminatory treatment and t hat interest.independently satisf ies the causation requirement of standing doctrine.allen,at,abrogated on other grounds by lexmark int l,static control components.schall and townley point to several concrete ways in which the virginia marriage laws have resulted in discriminatory treatment.for example,they allege that their marital status has hindered schall from visiting townley in the hospital,prevented schall from adopting and subjected schall and townley to tax burdens from which married couples are exempt.because schall and townley highlight specific,concrete instances of discrimination rather than making abstract allegations,their stigmatic injuries are legally cognizable.
schall and townley injuries are traceable to rainey enforcement of the virginia marriage laws.because declaring the virginia marriage laws unconstitutional and enjoining their enforcement would redress schall and townley injuries,they satisfy standing doctrine three requirements with respect to rainey.in sum,each of the plaintiffs has standing as to at least one defendant.
having resolved the threshold issue of whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue schaefer and rainey,we now turn to the merits of the opponents fourteenth amendment arguments.we begin with the issue of whether the supreme court summary dismissal in baker nelson settles this case.baker came to the supreme court as an appeal from a minnesota supreme court decision,which held that a state statute that the court interpreted to bar marriages did not violate the fourteenth amendment due process or equal protection clauses.baker nelson.at the time,required the supreme court to accept appeals of state supreme court cases involving constitutional challenges to state statutes,such as baker.see hicks miranda.the court dismissed the appeal in a opinion for want of a substantial federal question.baker.
summary dismissals qualify as votes on the merits of a case.hicks,at quoting ohio ex rel.eaton price,internal quotation marks omitted.they therefore prevent lower courts from coming to opposite conclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided.mandel bradley,per curiam.however,the fact that baker and the case at hand address the same precise issues does not end our inquiry.summary dismissals lose their binding force when doctrinal developments illustrate that the supreme court no longer views a question as unsubstantial,regardless of whether the court explicitly overrules the case.hicks,at quoting port auth.bondholders protective comm.port of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court determined that doctrinal developments stripped baker of its status as binding precedent.bostic,d at.every federal court to consider this issue since the supreme court decided united states windsor,has reached the same conclusion.see bishop smith,wl,at cir.july,kitchen herbert,wl,at cir.june,love beshear,cv h,wl.july,baskin bogan,cv rly tab,cv rly tab,wl,at.june,wolf walker,cv bbc,wl,at.june,whitewood wolf,cv,wl,at.may,geiger kitzhaber,cv mc,cv mc,wl,at.may,latta otter,cv cwd,wl,at may,deboer snyder,d,de leon perry,d,mcgee cole,wl,at.
windsor concerned whether section of the federal defense of marriage act doma contravened the constitution due process and equal protection guarantees.section defined marriage and spouse as excluding couples when those terms appeared in federal statutes,regulations,and directives,rendering legally married couples ineligible for myriad federal benefits.at.when it decided the case below,the second circuit concluded that baker was no longer precedential,windsor united states,cir,over the dissent vigorous arguments to the contrary,see id.at straub,dissenting in part and concurring in part.despite this dispute,the supreme court did not discuss baker in its opinion or during oral argument 
the supreme court willingness to decide windsor without mentioning baker speaks volumes regarding whether baker remains good law.the court development of its due process and equal protection jurisprudence in the four decades following baker is even more instructive.on the due process front,lawrence texas,and windsor are particularly relevant.in lawrence,the court recognized that the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments afford constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage,procreation,contraception,family relationships,child rearing,and education persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes,just as heterosexual persons do.id.at.these considerations led the court to strike down a texas statute that criminalized sodomy.id.at.the windsor court based its decision to invalidate section of doma on the fifth amendment due process clause.the court concluded that section could not withstand constitutional scrutiny because the principal purpose and the necessary effect of section are to demean those persons who are in a lawful marriage,the unmarried couple in lawrence have a constitutional right to make moral and sexual choices.at.these cases firmly position relationships within the ambit of the due process clauses protection.
the court has also issued several major equal protection decisions since it decided baker.the court opinions in craig boren,and frontiero richardson,identified classifications as,causing them to warrant intermediate scrutiny rather than rational basis review,see craig,at rehnquist,dissenting coining the term intermediate level scrutiny to describe the court test internal quotation marks omitted.two decades later,in romer.evans,the supreme court struck down a colorado constitutional amendment that prohibited legislative,executive,and judicial action aimed at protecting gay,lesbian,and bisexual individuals from discrimination.the court concluded that the law violated the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause because its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects,causing the law to lack a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.id.at.finally,the supreme court couched its decision in windsor in both due process and equal protection terms.at.these cases demonstrate that,since baker,the court has meaningfully altered the way it views both sex and sexual orientation through the equal protection lens.
in light of the supreme court apparent abandonment of baker and the significant doctrinal developments that occurred after the court issued its summary dismissal in that case,we decline to view baker as binding precedent and proceed to the meat of the opponents fourteenth amendment arguments.
our analysis of the opponents fourteenth amendment claims has two components.first,we ascertain what level of constitutional scrutiny applies either rational basis review or some form of heightened scrutiny,such as strict scrutiny.second,we apply the appropriate level of scrutiny to determine whether the virginia marriage laws pass constitutional muster.
under both the due process and equal protection clauses,interference with a fundamental right warrants the application of strict scrutiny washington glucksberg,zablocki redhail.we therefore begin by assessing whether the virginia marriage laws infringe on a fundamental right.fundamental rights spring from the fourteenth amendment protection of individual liberty,which the supreme court has described as the right to define one own concept of existence,of meaning,of the universe,and of the mystery of human life.planned parenthood of se.casey.this liberty includes the fundamental right to marry.zablocki,at loving virginia,see griswold connecticut,placing the right to marry within the fundamental right to privacy see also skinner oklahoma ex rel.williamson,characterizing marriage as one of the basic civil rights of man maynard hill,calling marriage the most important relation in life and the foundation of the family and of society,without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.
the opponents and proponents agree that marriage is a fundamental right.they strongly disagree,however,regarding whether that right encompasses the right to marriage.the opponents argue that the fundamental right to marry belongs to the individual,who enjoys the right to marry the person of his or her choice.by contrast,the proponents point out that,traditionally,states have sanctioned only marriages.they contend that,in light of this history,the right to marry does not include a right to marriage.
relying on washington glucksberg,the proponents aver that the district court erred by not requiring a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest,at internal quotation marks omitted,which they characterize as the right to marriage to another person of the same sex,not the right to marry.in glucksberg,the supreme court described the right at issue as a right to commit suicide with another assistance.id.at.the court declined to categorize this right as a new fundamental right because it was not,objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.see id.at quoting moore city of cleveland,internal quotation marks omitted.the proponents urge us to reject the right to marriage for the same reason.
we do not dispute that states have refused to permit marriages for most of our country history.however,this fact is irrelevant in this case because glucksberg analysis applies only when courts consider whether to recognize new fundamental rights.see id.at,identifying the above process as a way of expand ing the concept of substantive due process beyond established fundamental rights,such as the right to marry quoting collins city of harker heights,internal quotation marks omitted.because we conclude that the fundamental right to marry encompasses the right to marriage,glucksberg analysis is inapplicable here.
over the decades,the supreme court has demonstrated that the right to marry is an expansive liberty interest that may stretch to accommodate changing societal norms.perhaps most notably,in loving virginia,the supreme court invalidated a virginia law that prohibited white individuals from marrying individuals of other races.at.the court explained that t he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men and that no valid basis justified the virginia law infringement of that right.id.at.subsequently,in zablocki redhail,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of a wisconsin statute that required people obligated to pay child support to obtain a court order granting permission to marry before they could receive a marriage license.at.the statute specified that a court should grant permission only to applicants who proved that they had complied with their child support obligations and demonstrated that their children were not likely to become public charges.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that the statute impermissibly infringed on the right to marry.see id.at.finally,in turner safley,the court determined that a missouri regulation that generally prohibited prison inmates from marrying was an unconstitutional breach of the right to marry.
these cases do not define the rights in question as the right to interracial marriage,the right of people owing child support to marry,and the right of prison inmates to marry.instead,they speak of a broad right to marry that is not circumscribed based on the characteristics of the individuals seeking to exercise that right.the supreme court unwillingness to constrain the right to marry to certain subspecies of marriage meshes with its conclusion that the right to marry is a matter of freedom of choice,zablocki,at,that resides with the individual,loving,at.if courts limited the right to marry to certain couplings,they would effectively create a list of legally preferred spouses,rendering the choice of whom to marry a hollow choice indeed.
the proponents point out that loving,zablocki,and turner each involved couples.they contend that,because the couples in those cases chose to enter marriages,we can not use them to conclude that the supreme court would grant the same level of constitutional protection to the choice to marry a person of the same sex.however,the supreme court decisions in lawrence and windsor suggest otherwise.in lawrence,the court expressly refused to narrowly define the right at issue as the right of homosexuals to engage in sodomy,concluding that doing so would constitute a failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.at.just as it has done in the arena,the court identified the right at issue in lawrence as a matter of choice,explaining that gay and lesbian all people enjoy the right to make decisions regarding their personal relationships.id.at.as we note above,the court reiterated this theme in windsor,in which it based its conclusion that section of doma was unconstitutional,in part,on that provision disrespect for the moral and sexual choices that accompany a couple decision to marry.at.lawrence and windsor indicate that the choices that individuals make in the context of relationships enjoy the same constitutional protection as the choices accompanying relationships.we therefore have no reason to suspect that the supreme court would accord the choice to marry someone of the same sex any less respect than the choice to marry an individual who is of a different race,owes child support,or is imprisoned.accordingly,we decline the proponents invitation to characterize the right at issue in this case as the right to marriage rather than simply the right to marry.
of course,b y reaffirming the fundamental character of the right to marry,we do not mean to suggest that every state regulation which relates in any way to the incidents of or prerequisites for marriage must be subjected to rigorous scrutiny.zablocki,at.strict scrutiny applies only when laws significantly interfere with a fundamental right.see id.at.the virginia marriage laws unquestionably satisfy this requirement they impede the right to marry by preventing couples from marrying and nullifying the legal import of their marriages.strict scrutiny therefore applies in this case.
under strict scrutiny,a law may be justified only by compelling state interests,and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.carey population servs.int l.the proponents bear the burden of demonstrating that the virginia marriage laws satisfy this standard,see fisher of at austin,and they must rely on the laws actual purpose s rather than hypothetical justifications,see shaw hunt.the contend that five compelling interests undergird the virginia marriage laws virginia interest in maintaining control over the definition of marriage within its borders,the history and tradition of marriage,protecting the institution of marriage,encouraging responsible procreation,and promoting the optimal childrearing environment.we discuss each of these interests in turn.
federalism 
the constitution does not grant the federal government any authority over domestic relations matters,such as marriage.accordingly,throughout our country history,states have enjoyed the freedom to define and regulate marriage as they see fit.see windsor.at.states control over marriage laws within their borders has resulted in some variation among states requirements.for example,west virginia prohibits first cousins from marrying,but the remaining states in this circuit allow first cousin marriage,see,fam.law.ann.ann.states power to define and regulate marriage also accounts for their differing treatment of couples.
the windsor decision rested in part on the supreme court respect for states supremacy in the domestic relations sphere the court recognized that section of doma upset the status quo by robbing states of their ability to define marriage.although states could legalize marriage,they could not ensure that the incidents,benefits,and obligations of marriage would be uniform within their borders.see windsor.at.however,the court did not lament that section had usurped states authority over marriage due to its desire to safeguard federalism.id.t he state power in defining the marital relation is of central relevance in this case quite apart from the principles of federalism.its concern sprung from section creation of two classes of married couples within states that had legalized marriage couples,whose marriages the federal government recognized,and couples,whose marriages the federal government ignored.id.the resulting injury to couples served as the foundation for the court conclusion that section violated the fifth amendment due process clause.id.at.
citing windsor,the proponents urge us to view virginia interest in defining marriage as a suitable justification for the virginia marriage laws.however,windsor is actually detrimental to their position.although the court emphasized states traditional authority over marriage,it acknowledged that s tate laws defining and regulating marriage,of course,must respect the constitutional rights of persons.id.at citing loving,see also id.at the states interest in defining and regulating the marital relation is subject to constitutional guarantees.windsor does not teach us that federalism principles can justify depriving individuals of their constitutional rights it reiterates loving admonition that the states must exercise their authority without trampling constitutional guarantees.virginia interest in defining marriage therefore can not justify its encroachment on the fundamental right to marry.
the supreme court recent decision in schuette coalition to defend affirmative action,does not change the conclusion that windsor dictates.in schuette,the court refused to strike down a state constitutional amendment that barred public universities in michigan from using preferences as part of their admissions processes.id.at.the court declined to closely scrutinize the amendment because it was not used,or likely to be used,to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.see id.at.instead,the court dwelled on the need to respect the voters policy choice,concluding that i t is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds and the judiciary role was not to disempower the voters from choosing which path to follow.id.at.
the proponents emphasize that virginia voters approved the amendment.like the michigan amendment at issue in schuette,the amendment is the codification of virginians policy choice in a legal arena that is fraught with intense social and political debate.americans ability to speak with their votes is essential to our democracy.but the people will is not an independent compelling interest that warrants depriving couples of their fundamental right to marry.
the very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy,to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.one right to life,liberty,and property,to free speech,a free press,freedom of worship and assembly,and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote they depend on the outcome of no elections.
state bd.of educ.barnette,footnote added see also romer,at invalidating a amendment to colorado constitution lucas forty fourth assembly of,a citizen constitutional rights can hardly be infringed simply because a majority of the people choose that it be.accordingly,neither virginia interest in defining marriage nor our respect for the democratic process that codified that definition can excuse the virginia marriage laws infringement of the right to marry.
history and tradition 
the proponents also point to the history and tradition of marriage as a compelling interest that supports the virginia marriage laws.the supreme court has made it clear that,even under rational basis review,the a ncient lineage of a legal concept does not give it immunity from attack.heller doe ex rel.doe.the closely linked interest of promoting moral principles is similarly infirm in light of lawrence the fact that the governing majority in a state has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.at quoting bowers hardwick,stevens,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at scalia,dissenting but preserving the traditional institution of marriage is just a kinder way of describing the state moral disapproval of couples.preserving the historical and traditional status quo is therefore not a compelling interest that justifies the virginia marriage laws.
safeguarding the institution of marriage 
in addition to arguing that history and tradition are compelling interests in their own rights,the proponents warn that deviating from the tradition of marriage will destabilize the institution of marriage.the proponents suggest that legalizing marriage will sever the link between marriage and procreation they argue that,if coupleswho can not procreate allowed to marry,the state will sanction the idea that marriage is a vehicle for adults emotional fulfillment,not simply a framework for parenthood.according to the proponents,if adults are the focal point of marriage,then no logical grounds reinforce stabilizing norms like sexual exclusivity,permanence,and monogamy,which exist to benefit children.
we recognize that,in some cases,we owe substantial deference to the predictive judgments of the virginia general assembly,for whom the proponents purport to speak.turner broad,fcc.however,even if we view the proponents theories through glasses,we conclude that they are unfounded for two key reasons.first,the supreme court rejected the view that marriage is about only procreation in griswold connecticut,in which it upheld married couples right not to procreate and articulated a view of marriage that has nothing to do with children 
marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,hopefully enduring,and intimate to the degree of being sacred.it is an association that promotes a way of life,not causes a harmony in living,not political faiths a bilateral loyalty,not commercial or social projects.yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.
at see also turner,at describing many purposes of marriage.the fact that marriage stabilizing norms have endured in the five decades since the supreme court made this pronouncement weakens the argument that couples remain in monogamous marriages only for the sake of their offspring.
second,the primary support that the proponents offer for their theory is the legacy of a wholly unrelated legal change to marriage divorce.although divorce certainly altered the realities of married life by making it easier for couples to end their relationships,we have no reason to think that legalizing marriage will have a similar destabilizing effect.in fact,it is more logical to think that couples want access to marriage so that they can take advantage of its hallmarks,including faithfulness and permanence,and that allowing loving,committed couples to marry and recognizing their marriages will strengthen the institution of marriage.we therefore reject the proponents concerns.
responsible procreation 
next,the proponents contend that the virginia marriage laws differentiation between and couples stems from the fact that unintended pregnancies can not result from unions.by sanctioning only marriages,the virginia marriage laws provid e stability to the types of relationships that result in unplanned pregnancies,thereby avoiding or diminishing the negative outcomes often associated with unintended children.the proponents allege that children born to unwed parents face a significant risk of being raised in unstable families,which is harmful to their development.virginia,of course,has a duty of the highest order to protect the interests of minor children,particularly those of tender years.palmore sidoti.however,the virginia marriage laws are not appropriately tailored to further this interest.
if virginia sought to ensure responsible procreation via the virginia marriage laws,the laws are woefully underinclusive.couples are not the only category of couples who can not reproduce accidentally.for example,couples can not procreate unintentionally if they include a woman or an individual with a medical condition that prevents unassisted conception.
the proponents attempt to downplay the similarity between couples and infertile couples in three ways.first,they point out that sterile individuals could remedy their fertility through future medical advances.this potentiality,however,does not explain why virginia should treat and infertile couples differently during the course of the latter group infertility.second,the proponents posit that,even if one member of a couple is sterile,the other member may not be.they suggest that,without marriage monogamy mandate,this fertile individual is more likely to have an unintended child with a third party.they contend that,due to this possibility,even couples who can not procreate need marriage to channel their procreative activity in a way that couples do not.the proponents argument assumes that individuals in relationships never have sexual partners,which is simply not the case.third,the proponents imply that,by marrying,infertile couples set a positive example for couples who can have unintended children,thereby encouraging them to marry.we see no reason why committed couples can not serve as similar role models.we therefore reject the proponents attempts to differentiate couples from other couples who can not procreate accidentally.because couples and infertile couples are similarly situated,the equal protection clause counsels against treating these groups differently.see city of cleburne,at explaining that the equal protection clause is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.
due to the virginia marriage laws underinclusivity,this case resembles city of cleburne cleburne living center.in city of cleburne,the supreme court struck down a city law that required group homes for the intellectually disabled to obtain a special use permit.id.at.the city did not impose the same requirement on similar structures,such as apartment complexes and nursing homes.id.at.the court determined that the permit requirement was so underinclusive that the city motivation must have rest ed on an irrational prejudice,rendering the law unconstitutional.id.at.in light of the virginia marriage laws extreme underinclusivity,we are forced to draw the same conclusion in this case.
the proponents responsible procreation argument falters for another reason as well.strict scrutiny requires that a state means further its compelling interest.see shaw,at although we have not always provided precise guidance on how closely the means must serve the end the justification or compelling interest,we have always expected that the legislative action would substantially address,if not achieve,the avowed purpose.prohibiting couples from marrying and ignoring their marriages does not serve virginia goal of preventing births.although couples can not procreate accidentally,they can and do have children via other methods.according to an amicus brief filed by gary gates,as of the census,more than couples were raising more than children under the age of eighteen in virginia.the virginia marriage laws therefore increase the number of children raised by unmarried parents.
the proponents acknowledge that couples become parents.they contend,however,that the state has no interest in channeling couples procreative activities into marriage because couples bring children into their relationship s only through intentional choice and action.accordingly,t hose couples neither advance nor threaten society public purpose for marriage stabilizing parental relationships for the benefit of children in the same manner,or to the same degree,that sexual relationships between men and women do.
in support of this argument,the proponents invoke the supreme court decision in johnson robison.johnson concerned educational benefits that the federal government granted to military veterans who served on active duty.id.at.the government provided these benefits to encourage enlistment and make military service more palatable to existing servicemembers.id.at.a conscientious refused to serve in the military for religious suit,contending that the government acted unconstitutionally by granting benefits to veterans but not conscientious objectors.id.at.the court explained that,w hen,as in this case,the inclusion of one group promotes a legitimate governmental purpose,and the addition of other groups would not,we can not say that the statute classification of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously discriminatory.id.at.because offering educational benefits to conscientious objectors would not incentivize military service,the federal government was constitutional.johnson,at.the proponents claim that treating couples differently from couples is equally justified because the two groups are not similarly situated with respect to their procreative potential.
johnson applied rational basis review,id.at,so we strongly doubt its applicability to our strict scrutiny analysis.in any event,we can easily distinguish johnson from the instant case.in johnson,offering educational benefits to veterans who served on active duty promoted the government goal of making military service more attractive.extending those benefits to conscientious objectors,whose religious beliefs precluded military service,did not further that objective.by contrast,a stable marital relationship is attractive regardless of a couple procreative ability.allowing infertile couples to marry does nothing to further the government goal of channeling procreative conduct into marriage.thus,excluding couples from marriage due to their inability to have unintended children makes little sense.johnson therefore does not alter our conclusion that barring couples access to marriage does nothing to further virginia interest in responsible procreation.
optimal childrearing 
we now shift to discussing the merit of the final compelling interest that the proponents invoke optimal childrearing.the proponents aver that children develop best when reared by their married biological parents in a stable family unit.they dwell on the importance of parenting and argue that sanctioning marriage will deprive children of the benefit of being raised by a mother and a father,who have distinct parenting styles.in essence,the proponents argue that the virginia marriage laws safeguard children by preventing couples from marrying and starting inferior families.
the opponents and their amici cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the proponents contentions.for example,as the american psychological association,american academy of pediatrics,american psychiatric association,national association of social workers,and virginia psychological association collectively,the apa explain in their amicus brief,there is no scientific evidence that parenting effectiveness is related to parental sexual orientation,and the same factors including family stability,economic resources,and the quality of relationships are linked to children positive development,whether they are raised by heterosexual,lesbian,or gay parents.according to the apa,the parenting abilities of gay men and lesbians and the positive outcomes for their children are not areas where most credible scientific researchers disagree,and the contrary studies that the proponents cite do not reflect the current state of scientific knowledge.see also deboer,d at making factual findings and reaching the same conclusion.in fact,the apa explains that,by preventing couples from marrying,the virginia marriage laws actually harm the children of couples by stigmatizing their families and robbing them of the stability,economic security,and togetherness that marriage fosters.the supreme court reached a similar conclusion in windsor,in which it observed that failing to recognize marriages humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by couples and makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.at.
we find the arguments that the opponents and their amici make on this issue extremely persuasive.however,we need not resolve this dispute because the proponents optimal childrearing argument falters for at least two other reasons.first,under heightened scrutiny,states can not support a law using overbroad generalizations about the different talents,capacities,or preferences of the groups in question.united states virginia,rejecting inherent differences between men and women as a justification for excluding all women from a traditionally military college see also stanley illinois,holding that a state could not presume that unmarried fathers were unfit parents.the proponents statements regarding couples parenting ability certainly qualify as overbroad generalizations.second,as we explain above,strict scrutiny requires congruity between a law means and its end.this congruity is absent here.there is absolutely no reason to suspect that prohibiting couples from marrying and refusing to recognize their marriages will cause couples to raise fewer children or impel married couples to raise more children.the virginia marriage laws therefore do not further virginia interest in channeling children into optimal families,even if we were to accept the dubious proposition that couples are less capable parents.
because the proponents arguments are based on overbroad generalizations about parents,and because there is no link between banning marriage and promoting optimal childrearing,this aim can not support the virginia marriage laws.all of the proponents justifications for the virginia marriage laws therefore fail,and the laws can not survive strict scrutiny.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the virginia marriage laws violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the extent that they prevent couples from marrying and prohibit virginia from recognizing couples lawful marriages.we therefore affirm the district court grant of the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and its decision to enjoin enforcement of the virginia marriage laws 
we recognize that marriage makes some people deeply uncomfortable.however,inertia and apprehension are not legitimate bases for denying couples due process and equal protection of the laws.civil marriage is one of the cornerstones of our way of life.it allows individuals to celebrate and publicly declare their intentions to form lifelong partnerships,which provide unparalleled intimacy,companionship,emotional support,and security.the choice of whether and whom to marry is an intensely personal decision that alters the course of an individual life.denying couples this choice prohibits them from participating fully in our society,which is precisely the type of segregation that the fourteenth amendment can not countenance.
to be clear,this case is not about whether courts favor or disfavor marriage,or whether states recognizing or declining to recognize marriage have made good policy decisions.it is much narrower.it is about whether a state decision not to recognize marriage violates the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.thus,the judicial response must be limited to an analysis applying established constitutional principles.
the commonwealth of virginia has always recognized that marriage is based on the mutual agreement of a man and a woman to marry each other,burke shaver,and that a marriage purposes include establishing a family,the continuance of the race,the propagation of children,and the general good of society,alexander kuykendall,s.in recent years,it codified that understanding in several statutes,which also explicitly exclude from the definition of marriage the union of two men or two women.moreover,in the people of virginia amended the commonwealth constitution to define marriage as only between one man and one woman.const.art.i,
the plaintiffs,who are in relationships,are challenging the constitutionality of virginia marriage laws under the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution.the district court sustained their challenge,concluding that the plaintiffs have a fundamental right to marry each other under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and therefore that any regulation of that right is subject to strict scrutiny.concluding that virginia definition of marriage failed even to display a rational relationship to a legitimate purpose and so must be viewed as constitutionally infirm,the court struck down virginia marriage laws as unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement.bostic rainey,d.
the majority agrees.it concludes that the fundamental right to marriage includes a right to marriage and that therefore virginia marriage laws must be reviewed under strict scrutiny.it holds that virginia has failed to advance a compelling state interest justifying its definition of marriage as between only a man and a woman.in reaching this conclusion,however,the majority has failed to conduct the necessary constitutional analysis.rather,it has simply declared syllogistically that because marriage is a fundamental right protected by the due process clause and marriage is a form of marriage,virginia laws declining to recognize marriage infringe the fundamental right to marriage and are therefore unconstitutional.
stated more particularly,the majority approach begins with the parties agreement that marriage is a fundamental right.ante at.from there,the majority moves to the proposition that the right to marry is an expansive liberty interest,ante at,that is not circumscribed based on the characteristics of the individuals seeking to exercise that right,ante at.for support,it notes that the supreme court has struck down state restrictions prohibiting interracial marriage,see loving virginia,prohibiting prison inmates from marrying without special approval,see turner safley,and prohibiting persons owing child support from marrying,see zablocki redhail.it then declares,ipse dixit,that the fundamental right to marry encompasses the right to marriage and is thus protected by the substantive component of the due process clause.ante at.in reaching this conclusion,the majority decline s the proponents invitation to characterize the right at issue in this case as the right to marriage rather than simply the right to marry.ante at.and in doing so,it explicitly bypasses the relevant constitutional analysis required by washington glucksberg,stating that a glucksberg analysis is not necessary because no new fundamental right is being recognized.ante at.
this analysis is fundamentally flawed because it fails to take into account that the marriage that has long been recognized by the supreme court as a fundamental right is distinct from the newly proposed relationship of a marriage.and this failure is even more pronounced by the majority acknowledgment that marriage is a new notion that has not been recognized for most of our country history.ante at.moreover,the majority fails to explain how this new notion became incorporated into the traditional definition of marriage except by linguistic manipulation.thus,the majority never asks the question necessary to finding a fundamental right whether marriage is a right that is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it was sacrificed.glucksberg,at quoting moore east cleveland,plurality opinion palko.connecticut,internal quotation marks omitted.
at bottom,in holding that marriage is encompassed by the traditional right to marry,the majority avoids the necessary constitutional analysis,concluding simply and broadly that the fundamental right to marry by everyone and to anyone may not be infringed.and it does not anticipate or address the problems that this approach causes,failing to explain,for example,why this broad right to marry,as the majority defines it,does not also encompass the right of a father to marry his daughter or the right of any person to marry multiple partners.
if the majority were to recognize and address the distinction between the two relationships the traditional one and the new one as it must,it would simply be unable to reach the conclusion that it has reached.
i respectfully submit that,for the reasons that follow,virginia was well within its constitutional authority to adhere to its traditional definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman and to exclude from that definition the union of two men or two women.i would also agree that the constitution does not prohibit a state from defining marriage to include marriage,as many states have done.accordingly,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and uphold virginia marriage laws.
as the majority has observed,state recognition of marriage is a new phenomenon.its history began in the early with the recognition in some states of civil unions.see.stat.ann.tit,effective in cal.stat.ann.a.ann,invalidated by kerrigan comm r of pub.health.and the notion of marriage itself first gained traction in,when the massachusetts supreme judicial court held that the commonwealth prohibition on issuing marriage licenses to couples violated the state first decision holding that couples had a right to marry.see goodridge dep t of pub.health.in,vermont became the first state to enact legislation recognizing marriage,and,since then,other states and the district of columbia have also done so.see.to ann.tit.comp.stat.tit.a,a,fam.law to.ann.to.ann.to dom.rel.law a laws et.stat.ann.tit.to.moreover,seven other states currently allow marriage as a result of court rulings.see hollingsworth perry.varnum brien,iowa goodridge,garden state equality dow,griego oliver,geiger kitzhaber,d,cv mc,wl.may,whitewood wolf,d,cv,wl.may.this is indeed a recent phenomenon.
virginia only recognizes marriage as between one man and one woman,and,like a majority of states,it has codified this view.see ann.prohibiting marriage and declining to recognize marriages conducted in other states id.prohibiting civil unions and similar arrangements between persons of the same sex.the bill originally proposing what would become noted the basis for virginia legislative decision 
h uman marriage is a consummated two in one communion of male and female persons made possible by sexual differences which are reproductive in type,whether or not they are reproductive in effect or motivation.this present relationship recognizes the equality of male and female persons,and antedates recorded history.
affirmation of marriage act,assembly,reg.sess.the bill predicted that the recognition of marriage would radically transform the institution of marriage with serious and harmful consequences to the social order.id.virginia also amended its constitution in to define marriage as only between one man and one woman and to prohibit a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design,qualities,significance,or effects of marriage.const.art.i,a.the plaintiffs commenced this action to challenge the constitutionality of virginia marriage laws.
plaintiffs timothy bostic and tony london have lived in a committed relationship since and have lived in virginia since.the two desired to marry in virginia,and on july,when they applied for a marriage license at the office of the clerk of the circuit court for the city of norfolk,they were denied a license and told that couples are ineligible to marry in virginia.in their complaint challenging virginia marriage laws,they alleged that their inability to marry has disadvantaged them in both economic and personal ways it has prevented them from filing joint tax returns,kept them from sharing health insurance on a basis,and signaled that they are less than other couples in virginia.
plaintiffs carol schall and mary townley likewise have lived in a committed relationship since and have lived in virginia throughout their year relationship.in,townley gave birth to a daughter,whom schall and townley have raised together,and in,the two traveled to california where they were lawfully married.they alleged in their complaint that because virginia does not recognize their marriage as valid,they have been injured in several ways.schall is unable to legally adopt,and the two are unable to share health insurance on a basis.the two also claimed that they and.have experienced stigma as a result of virginia nonrecognition of their marriage.
the plaintiffs complaint,filed in july,alleged that virginia marriage laws violate their constitutional rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.they named as defendants george schaefer,iii,clerk of court for the norfolk circuit court,and janet rainey,the state registrar of vital records.a third virginia official,michele mcquigg,clerk of court for the prince william county circuit court,was permitted to intervene as a defendant.as elected circuit court clerks,schaefer and mcquigg are responsible for issuing individual marriage licenses in the localities in which they serve.and rainey,as the state registrar of vital records,is responsible for ensuring compliance with virginia marriage laws,including the laws challenged in this case.
after the parties filed for summary judgment,virginia underwent a change in administrations,and the newly elected attorney general of virginia,mark herring,filed a notice of a change in his office legal position on behalf of his client,defendant janet rainey.his notice stated that because,in his view,the laws at issue were unconstitutional,his office would no longer defend them on behalf of rainey.he noted,however,that rainey would continue to enforce the laws until the court ruling.the other officials have continued to defend virginia marriage laws,and,for convenience,i refer to the defendants herein as virginia.
following a hearing,the district court,by an order and memorandum dated february,granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denied virginia.the court concluded that partners have a fundamental right to marry each other under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,thus requiring that virginia marriage laws restricting that right be narrowly drawn to further a compelling state interest.it concluded that the laws did not meet that requirement and,indeed,fail ed to display a rational relationship to a legitimate purpose,and so must be viewed as constitutionally infirm under even the least onerous level of scrutiny.bostic,d at.striking down virginia marriage laws,the court also issued an order enjoining their enforcement but stayed that order pending appeal.this appeal followed.
the plaintiffs contend that,as partners,they have a fundamental right to marry that is protected by the substantive component of the due process clause of the constitution,const.amend.xiv,prohibiting any state from depriving any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law,and that virginia laws defining marriage as only between a man and a woman and excluding marriage infringe on that right.the constitutional analysis for adjudging their claim is well established.
the constitution contains no language directly protecting the right to marriage or even traditional marriage.any right to marriage,therefore,would have to be found,through court interpretation,as a substantive component of the due process clause.see planned parenthood of southeastern casey,although a literal reading of the clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a state may deprive persons of liberty,for at least years the clause has been understood to contain a substantive component as well.
the substantive component of the due process clause only protects fundamental liberty interests.and the supreme court has held that liberty interests are only fundamental if they are,objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.glucksberg,at citation omitted quoting moore,at plurality opinion palko,at.when determining whether such a fundamental right exists,a court must always make a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.id.at emphasis added quoting reno flores.this careful description involves characterizing the right asserted in its narrowest terms.thus,in glucksberg,where the court was presented with a due process challenge to a state statute banning assisted suicide,the court narrowly characterized the right being asserted in the following manner 
the court of appeals stated that p roperly analyzed,the first issue to be resolved is whether there is a liberty interest in determining the time and manner of one death,or,in other words,i s there a right to die similarly,respondents assert a liberty to choose how to die and a right to control of one final days,and describe the asserted liberty as the right to choose a humane,dignified death,and the liberty to shape death.as noted above,we have a tradition of carefully formulating the interest at stake in cases the washington statute at issue in this case prohibits aid ing another person to attempt suicide,and,thus,the question before us is whether the liberty specially protected by the due process clause includes a right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so.
glucksberg,at alterations in original emphasis added citations omitted.
under this formulation,because the virginia laws at issue prohibit marriage between persons of the same sex,ann,the question before us is whether the liberty specially protected by the due process clause includes a right to marriage.glucksberg,at see also jackson abercrombie,d,m issing from plaintiffs asserted right to marry the person of one choice is its centerpiece the right to marry someone of the same gender.
when a fundamental right is so identified,then any statute restricting the right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.flores,at.such scrutiny is extremely difficult for a law to withstand,and,as such,the supreme court has noted that courts must be extremely cautious in recognizing fundamental rights because doing so ordinarily removes freedom of choice from the hands of the people 
w e ha ve always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and.by extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest,we,to a great extent,place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.we must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,lest the liberty protected by the due process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court.
glucksberg,at second alteration in original emphasis added quoting collins city of harker heights.
the plaintiffs in this case,as well as the majority,recognize that narrowly defining the asserted liberty interest would require them to demonstrate a new fundamental right to marriage,which they can not do.thus,they have made no attempt to argue that marriage is,objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.glucksberg,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,they have acknowledged that recognition of marriage is a recent development.see ante at see also united states windsor,until recent years,many citizens had not even considered the possibility of marriage emphasis added id.at alito,dissenting noting that it is beyond dispute that the right to marriage is not deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition baehr lewin,haw w e do not believe that a right to marriage is so rooted in the traditions and collective conscience of our people that failure to recognize it would violate the fundamental principles of liberty and justice that lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions.
instead,the plaintiffs and the majority argue that the fundamental right to marriage that has previously been recognized by the supreme court is a broad right that should apply to the plaintiffs without the need to recognize a new fundamental right to marriage.they argue that this approach is supported by the fact that the supreme court did not narrowly define the right to marriage in its decisions in loving,at turner,at or zablocki,at.
it is true that,in those cases,the court did not recognize new,separate fundamental rights to fit the factual circumstances in each case.for example,in loving,the court did not examine whether interracial marriage was,objectively,deeply rooted in our nation history and tradition.but it was not required to do so.each of those cases involved a couple asserting a right to enter into a traditional marriage of the type that has always been recognized since the beginning of the union between one man and one woman.while the context for asserting the right varied in each of those cases,it varied only in ways irrelevant to the concept of marriage.the type of relationship sought was always the traditional,relationship to which the term marriage was theretofore always assumed to refer.thus,none of the cases cited by the plaintiffs and relied on by the majority involved the assertion of a brand new liberty interest.to the contrary,they involved the assertion of one of the oldest and most fundamental liberty interests in our society.
to now define the previously recognized fundamental right to marriage as a concept that includes the new notion of marriage amounts to a dictionary jurisprudence,which defines terms as convenient to attain an end.
it is true that and relationships share many attributes,and,therefore,marriages involving those relationships would,to a substantial extent,be similar.two persons who are attracted to each other physically and emotionally and who love each other could publicly promise to live with each other thereafter in a mutually desirable relationship.these aspects are the same whether the persons are of the same sex or different sexes.moreover,both relationships could successfully function to raise children,although children in a relationship would come from one partner or from adoption.but there are also significant distinctions between the relationships that can justify differential treatment by lawmakers.
only the union of a man and a woman has the capacity to produce children and thus to carry on the species.and more importantly,only such a union creates a biological family unit that also gives rise to a traditionally stable political unit.every person identity includes the person particular biological relationships,which create unique and meaningful bonds of kinship that are extraordinarily strong and enduring and that have been afforded a privileged place in political order throughout human history.societies have accordingly enacted laws promoting the family as those relating to sexual engagement,marriage rites,divorce,inheritance,name and title,and economic matters.and many societies have found familial bonds so critical that they have elevated marriage to be a sacred institution trapped with religious rituals.in these respects,the traditional relationship is unique.
thus,when the supreme court has recognized,through the years,that the right to marry is a fundamental right,it has emphasized the procreative and social ordering aspects of traditional marriage.for example,it has said marriage is an institution,in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested,for it is the foundation of the family and of society,without which there would be neither civilization nor progress,maynard hill,emphasis added marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man.marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race,skinner oklahoma ex rel.williamson,it is not surprising that the decision to marry has been placed on the same level of importance as decisions relating to procreation,childbirth,childrearing,and family relationships marriage is the foundation of the family in our society,zablocki,at.
because there exist deep,fundamental differences between traditional and marriage,the plaintiffs and the majority err by conflating the two relationships under the loosely drawn rubric of the right to marriage.rather,to obtain constitutional protection,they would have to show that the right to marriage is itself deeply rooted in our nation history.they have not attempted to do so and could not succeed if they were so to attempt.
in an effort to bridge the obvious differences between the traditional relationship and the new relationship,the plaintiffs argue that the fundamental right to marriage has always been based on,and defined by,the constitutional liberty to select the partner of one choice.emphasis added.they rely heavily on loving to assert this claim.in loving,the court held that a state regulation restricting interracial marriage infringed on the fundamental right to marriage.loving,at.but nowhere in loving did the court suggest that the fundamental right to marry includes the unrestricted right to marry whomever one chooses,as the plaintiffs claim.indeed,loving explicitly relied on skinner and murphy,and both of those cases discussed marriage in traditional,procreative terms.id.
this reading of loving is fortified by the court summary dismissal of baker nelson,appeal dismissed,just five years after loving was decided.in baker,the minnesota supreme court interpreted a state statute use of the term marriage to be one of common usage meaning a union between persons of the opposite sex and thus not including marriage.id.at.on appeal,the supreme court dismissed the case summarily for want of a substantial federal question.at.the court action in context indicates that the court did not view loving or the cases that preceded it as providing a fundamental right to an unrestricted choice of marriage partner.otherwise,the state court decision in baker would indeed have presented a substantial federal question.
in short,loving simply held that race,which is completely unrelated to the institution of marriage,could not be the basis of marital restrictions.see loving,at.to stretch loving holding to say that the right to marry is not limited by gender and sexual orientation is to ignore the inextricable,biological link between marriage and procreation that the supreme court has always recognized.see windsor.at recognizing that throughout history,marriage between a man and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term and to its role and function.the state regulation struck down in loving,like those in zablocki and turner,had no relationship to the foundational purposes of marriage,while the gender of the individuals in a marriage clearly does.thus,the majority errs,as did the district court,by interpreting the supreme court marriage cases as establishing a right that includes marriage.
the plaintiffs also largely ignore the problem with their position that if the fundamental right to marriage is based on the constitutional liberty to select the partner of one choice,as they contend,then that liberty would also extend to individuals seeking state recognition of other types of relationships that states currently restrict,such as polygamous or incestuous relationships.romer evans,scalia,dissenting.such an extension would be a radical shift in our understanding of marital relationships.laws restricting polygamy are foundational to the union itself,having been a condition on the entrance of arizona,new mexico,oklahoma,and utah into statehood.id.while the plaintiffs do attempt to assure us that such laws are safe because there are weighty government interests underlying them,such an argument does not bear on the question of whether the right is fundamental.the government interests would instead be relevant only to whether the restriction could meet the requisite standard of review.and because laws prohibiting polygamous or incestuous marriages restrict individuals right to choose whom they would like to marry,they would,under the plaintiffs approach,have to be examined under strict scrutiny.perhaps the government interest would be strong enough to enable such laws to survive strict scrutiny,but regardless,today decision would truly be a sweeping one if it could be understood to mean that individuals have a fundamental right to enter into a marriage with any person,or any people,of their choosing.
at bottom,the fundamental right to marriage does not include a right to marriage.under the glucksberg analysis that we are thus bound to conduct,there is no new fundamental right to marriage.virginia laws restricting marriage to relationships must therefore be upheld if there is any rational basis for the laws.
under review,courts are required to give heavy deference to legislatures.the standard 
simply requires courts to determine whether the classification in question is,at a minimum,rationally related to legitimate governmental goals.in other words,the fit between the enactment and the public purposes behind it need not be mathematically precise.as long as the legislature has a reasonable basis for adopting the classification,which can include rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data,the statute will pass constitutional muster.the rational basis standard thus embodies an idea critical to the continuing vitality of our democracy that courts are not empowered to sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.
wilkins gaddy,cir emphasis added citations omitted quoting fcc beach commc ns,city of new orleans dukes.statutes subject to review bear a strong presumption of validity,and those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support them.beach commc ns,at emphasis added citation omitted quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts.
in contending that there is a rational basis for its marriage laws,virginia has emphasized that children are born only to one man and one woman and that marriage provides a family structure by which to nourish and raise those children.it claims that a biological family is a more stable environment,and it renounces any interest in encouraging marriage.it argues that the purpose of its marriage laws is to channel the presumptive procreative potential of relationships into enduring marital unions so that if any children are born,they are more likely to be raised in stable family units.emphasis omitted.virginia highlights especially marriage tendency to promote stability in the event of unplanned pregnancies,asserting that it has a compelling interest in addressing the particular concerns associated with the birth of unplanned children c hildren born from unplanned pregnancies where their mother and father are not married to each other are at significant risk of being raised outside stable family units headed by their mother and father jointly.
virginia states that its justifications for promoting traditional marriage also explain its lack of interest in promoting marriage.it maintains that a traditional marriage is exclusively an institution inextricably linked to procreation and biological kinship,windsor.at alito,dissenting,and that marriage prioritizes the emotions and sexual attractions of the two partners without any necessary link to reproduction.it asserts that it has no interest in licensing adults love.
the plaintiffs accept that family stability is a legitimate state goal,but they argue that licensing relationships will not burden virginia achievement of that goal.they contend that there is simply no evidence or reason to believe that prohibiting gay men and lesbians from marrying will increase responsible procreation among heterosexuals.
but this argument does not negate any of the rational justifications for virginia legislation.states are permitted to selectively provide benefits to only certain groups when providing those same benefits to other groups would not further the state ultimate goals.see johnson robinson,when the inclusion of one group promotes a legitimate governmental purpose,and the addition of other groups would not,we can not say that the statute classification of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries is invidiously discriminatory.here,the commonwealth goal of ensuring that unplanned children are raised in stable homes is furthered only by offering the benefits of marriage to couples.as virginia correctly asserts,the relevant inquiry here is not whether excluding couples from marriage furthers virginia interest in steering couples into marriage.rather,the relevant inquiry is whether also recognizing marriages would further virginia interests.with regard to its interest in ensuring stable families in the event of unplanned pregnancies,it would not.
the plaintiffs reply that even if this is so,such only makes sense if the resources at issue are scarce,justifying the state limited provision of those resources.they argue that because m arriage licenses are not a remotely scarce commodity,the done by virginia marriage laws is irrational.but this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of marriage benefits.when the commonwealth grants a marriage,it does not simply give the couple a piece of paper and a title.rather,it provides a substantial subsidy to the married couple economic benefits that,the plaintiffs repeatedly assert,are being denied them.for example,married couples are permitted to file state income taxes jointly,lowering their tax rates.see ann.although indirect,such benefits are clearly subsidies that come at a cost to the commonwealth.virginia is willing to provide these subsidies because they encourage couples to marry,which tends to provide children from unplanned pregnancies with a more stable environment.under johnson,the commonwealth is not obligated to similarly subsidize marriages,since doing so could not possibly further its interest.this is no different from the subsidies provided in other cases where the supreme court has upheld,such as medicare benefits,matthews diaz,u,or veterans educational benefits,johnson,at.
as an additional argument,virginia maintains that marriage is a c omplex social institution with a set of norms,rules,patterns,and expectations that powerfully albeit often unconsciously affect people choices,actions,and perspectives.it asserts that discarding the traditional definition of marriage will have consequences that can not easily be predicted,including sever ing the inherent link between procreation and marriage and in turn powerfully convey ing that marriage exists to advance adult desires rather than to serv e children needs.
the plaintiffs agree that changing the definition of marriage may have unforeseen social effects,but they argue that such predictions should not be enough to save virginia marriage laws because similar justifications were rejected in loving.the loving court,however,was not applying review.see loving,at.we are on a different footing here.under review,legislative choices may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.beach commc ns,at.sound policymaking often requires legislators to forecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on de
