shortly after christina returned from her maternity leave in to her job as director of services at cooley dickinson hospital,she was laid off.based on comments she overheard,the timing of her dismissal,a comparison of her credentials with those of her replacement,and both a hearsay statement that her supervisor said to her replacement that leave caused her to lose her job and her supervisor silence in the face of accusations,she believed that she was terminated because of her maternity leave.she brought suit under title vii,and the provisions of the family and medical leave act.
the hospital denied any discrimination or retaliation.it explained that was laid off as part of a reorganization of management,and that there were legitimate reasons another employee had been retained instead of in the new position.it argued that neither the alleged statement nor the silence was admissible,because both were hearsay.
on the hospital motion for summary judgment,the district court agreed that all reasonable inferences from the evidence supported the hospital position,and entered judgment for the hospital.specifically,the court ruled that the statement was inadmissible double hearsay,cooley dickinson,d,that it was doubtful the silence was admissible and that it certainly did not amount to direct evidence of discrimination,id.at and further that had failed to meet her burden to show the hospital explanation was pretextual,id.at.we affirm our analysis of the questions presented on appeal largely mirrors that of the district court opinion.
we take the facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to position.reckitt colman,cir.we sketch only the basic facts details may be found in the district court opinion.we give a fuller description only of the portions of the facts needed for our decision.
cooley dickinson hospital hired christina in april as its director of services in that position,she managed the treatment of patients before and after surgery,as well as the administration of surgical services themselves.she reported to donna bowles,the hospital vice president of nursing.did well at her job and received good,sometimes excellent,performance evaluations.in april,took maternity leave,scheduled to last until august she returned to her position part time in may.she testified at deposition that while working part time,she overheard two doctors complaining about her inaccessibility during her maternity leave.
in august,after the formal end of maternity leave,craig melin,the hospital president and ceo,met with her.melin informed that the hospital was eliminating her position as part of a reorganization.a new position,surgical program director,would perform many of the same tasks as well some additional ones,and would report directly to him rather than to bowles.also testified that she was told not to apply for the new position.after terminating,melin offered the new position to cathryn neumann,formerly the hospital clinical coordinator and subordinate.neumann accepted.
came to suspect,based on the conversation that she had overheard between the doctors and on the timing of her layoff,that melin decision was motivated at least in part by her absence during her maternity leave.according to her deposition testimony,neumann told her that bowles had said that maternity leave had indeed played a part in the layoff decision.some time later,bowles invited to lunch.regarding that lunch,testified at deposition 
donna bowles invited me out to lunch at the northampton brewery and i asked her at that time,during that luncheon which she invited me to,because i had a lot of questions,what was going on,why was i laid off.i asked her about the conversation she had with cathy neumann,about the fact that cathy had told me that the reason i was laid off,i mean that,you know,she had a conversation with donna about the conversation that donna and cathy had had and that cathy had related that information to me and i asked her about why donna had said that about the fact that i had been laid off because of my maternity leave and when i asked her that question,when i asked donna that question at that luncheon,she clearly looked extremely uncomfortable and did answer.she sat there and turned color,you know,turned bright red and did answer the question,you know,he she sic evaded the issue,tried to talk about something different.i tried to bring her back to that question,i wanted to have the answer,but she body language told me that she was well aware of what i was talking about,but she did not answer the question in words.
bowles denied at deposition that she ever said anything to neumann regarding the reasons was laid off.neumann also denied that bowles ever said anything of this kind,or that neumann ever had a conversation on this topic with.own testimony is therefore the primary evidence that she claims entitles her to a jury trial,although she also makes other arguments that we address in the course of this opinion.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,at.
some years ago the supreme court set up two different models for analysis of employment discrimination cases,depending on whether an employee presented direct evidence of discrimination or relied solely on circumstantial evidence.see price waterhouse hopkins,d,concurring describing the direct evidence model mcdonnell douglas green,d describing the circumstantial evidence model.like the parties,we apply the distinction drawn by these cases as the supreme court has recently reemphasized,however,the mcdonnell douglas framework is a flexible evidentiary standard whose requirements vary depending on the context it is a method for proving cases rather than the definition of a cause of action.swierkiewicz sorema,d holding that a title vii plaintiff need not plead the elements of a mcdonnell douglas prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss.
direct evidence 
it is generally to an employee benefit to show direct evidence of discrimination rather than relying on the inferential model set forth in mcdonnell douglas.if an employee makes a sufficiently strong showing of discrimination using direct evidence,but the employer responds with a showing of legitimate reasons for the actions it took,then the court may view the employer as having mixed legitimate,some not.under the act amending title vii,the employer may then assert an affirmative defense,bearing the burdens of production and persuasion,that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.civil rights act of,stat,codified at g b.on such a showing in a case,the employer may then avoid liability for monetary damages and reinstatement.but so long as the employee has shown that the impermissible factor was a motive,even if not the determinative motive,the employer will still be subject to declaratory and limited injunctive relief,as well as attorneys fees.id.although the act is silent on exactly what showing is needed to trigger a case,and so might be read to leave open the possibility of a analysis following a sufficiently strong circumstantial showing of discrimination,many courts require an employee to produce direct evidence that establishes discrimination was a motive before employing such an analysis.see generally fernandes costa.masonry,cir citing price waterhouse,at,concurring.
employees benefit from presenting such direct evidence for a number of reasons.first,the sheer strength of the evidence may carry the day.second,it increases the chance of some form of relief,including attorneys fees.third,it imposes on the employer the burdens of production and persuasion unlike the mcdonnell douglas model,which merely shifts to the employer the burden of producing admissible evidence to support a reason for its actions.smith morse,cir.fourth,it is more difficult,although not impossible,for the employer to get summary judgment in light of the strength of direct evidence and the potential shifting of burdens.suttle caribe,cir swierkiewicz,at,d,at a plaintiff who is able to produce direct evidence of discrimination may prevail without proving all the elements of a mcdonnell douglas prima facie case.to obtain these benefits,the employee must offer stronger evidence than that needed to establish a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas.i lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law ed.
much has been written about what is direct evidence.see id.at nn,collecting cases.it is easy to say that there is direct evidence when a decisionmaker says,for example,i fired you because you became pregnant and took maternity leave.but that rarely happens in this world,where most employers are well aware of the legal consequences of discrimination.and so employees offer other types of statements as direct evidence.see price waterhouse,at,concurring treating as direct evidence a statement by the relevant decisionmaker that the plaintiff professional problems would be solved if she would walk more femininely,talk more femininely,wear,have her hair styled,and wear jewelry.
this circuit has made clear that inherently ambiguous statements do not qualify as direct evidence.in fernandes,we held that the statement i do need minorities and i do need residents on this job was ambiguous because in context it might have reflected a benign response to a specific inquiry reflecting the speaker perception that he no longer had to make special efforts to comply with eeo requirements.at and in shorette rite aid of maine,cir,we held a store manager statement that the plaintiff in that case had a perfect case of age discrimination did not suffice as direct evidence because there was insufficient evidence linking the manager to the actual decisionmaking process for the statement to be admissible.id.at.
offered as direct evidence at summary judgment her testimony about both neumann statement regarding neumann conversation with bowles and bowles silence at the lunch with.the district court concluded that testimony about neumann supposed statement about what bowles purportedly said is double hearsay and inadmissible,d at.does not challenge that conclusion on appeal.the appellate issue instead concerns bowles silence in the face of accusation that bowles had made the statement to neumann.the district court held it was of doubtful admissibility and so ambiguous that it could not be considered direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation.id.at.the court did not,however,fully resolve the question of admissibility.id.
this ruling presents a evidentiary question.argues that the underlying bowles was laid off because of her maternity an admission,that bowles is for this purpose an agent of the hospital,and that bowles failure to respond to when accused of making the statement constitutes bowles adoption of that behalf of the silence.could not get the statement into evidence otherwise because bowles and neumann deny the encounter.her argument presents two questions whether the statement itself met the criteria for the admission of a,and if so whether bowles by her silence adopted that admission at the lunch with 
we start with the general requirements for an admission.for the statement of an employee to be the admission of a corporate or institutional employer,it must fit within subsection c or d of federal rule of evidence d,which reads 
admission by.the statement is offered against a party and is a the party own statement,in either an individual or a representative capacity or b a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth,or c a statement by a person authorized by the party to make a statement concerning the subject,or d a statement by the party agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,made during the existence of the relationship,or e a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.the contents of the statement shall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish the declarant authority under subdivision c,the agency or employment relationship and scope thereof under subdivision d,or the existence of the conspiracy and the participation therein of the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered under subdivision e.
the statement of an individual defendant may be a direct admission under subsection a.bowles is not a defendant the hospital is.in order for the statement to be an admission,therefore,must show through evidence other than the statement itself either that bowles was authorized by the hospital to make the statement or that bowles was the hospital agent and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of her employment,made while she was employed.as we discuss below,she must also show that bowles adopted the statement through her silence in the face of accusation.
it is undisputed that the relevant decisionmaker in this case was melin,the hospital president.it is also undisputed that bowles had held the position of vice president for patient care services,that her position was eliminated,and that she became one of the five program directors,the program director of medical services.moreover,there was evidence that bowles was not at all involved in the decision to lay off the testimony was that melin,without discussing the fate of specific individuals,told his management team,including bowles,about the new overall structure he had in mind that melin told her his reasons for putting neumann into the new position and that bowles thus learned that position would be eliminated.nevertheless,bowles was direct supervisor,and we do not think it is clear that a statement regarding the reasons for termination would necessarily be outside the scope of her employment.even assuming that the matter was within the scope of bowles employment,however,the district court other reasons for holding bowles silence not to amount to direct evidence are solid.
the district court wrote that it was doubtful that bowles silence could constitute an adoptive admission,and that if admissible it did not amount to direct evidence,d at.theory is that bowles,by failing to deny the statement that she had told neumann that had been laid off because of her maternity leave,adopted that statement.see generally mccormick on evidence strong et,ed discussing the doctrine of admission by silence.the trial judge plays a screening role in ruling whether a party or,as here,its agent has adopted an admission by silence.in vazquez,cir,we held that i n all such cases,the burden is on the proponent to convince the judge that in the circumstances of the case a failure to respond is so unnatural that it supports the inference that the party acquiesced in the statement.id.at quoting ricciardi children hosp.med,cir quoting weinstein berger,weinstein evidence d b,at.in making the evaluation,the trial judge considers the nature of the statement,the identity of the person offering the testimony,the identity of the maker of the statement,the context,and whether the circumstances as a whole show that the lack of a denial is so unnatural as to support an inference that the undenied statement was true.
these circumstances do not meet that standard.it was a social occasion bowles had invited to lunch.testified that during that lunch,she told bowles that neumann had said that bowles had made the statement to neumann.the district court correctly concluded that in context there might have been a great many reasons why bowles was silent on the point and changed the subject,and those other reasons made it far from unnatural for bowles to handle the matter as she did,d at.we add another bowles could not know what neumann had or had not said to see weinstein federal evidence d,at mclaughlin,ed.a court may find,after evaluating the type of statement and who made it,that the party could not have been expected to deny it because the party lacked the information necessary to assess its truthfulness.the silence was not an adoptive admission.
finally,even if the district court,exercising its discretion,might have concluded that the evidence just barely met the criteria for admissibility,the court was plainly correct to hold that this was not direct evidence.its probative value is not sufficiently strong.the reasons why bowles did not respond with a vigorous denial were ambiguous at
