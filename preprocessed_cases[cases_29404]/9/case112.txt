the question presented is whether plaintiff sonia vélez vélez political discrimination claim was timely brought within the statute of limitations for such actions filed in puerto rico.we agree with the district court that the logic of the supreme court decisions in delaware state college ricks,d,and chardon fernandez,d per curiam,requires finding that the claim here was untimely.see vélez vélez highway transp,wl.we affirm the entry of summary judgment for the defendants.
vélez vélez political belief discrimination termination claim is all too familiar after puerto rico elections.vélez vélez,a popular democratic party pdp member,worked for the puerto rico highway and transportation authority the transportation authority under a prior pdp administration,after being hired under that administration interpretation of a set of policies.but,she lost her job after an election returned the opposing political party,the new progressive party npp,to office.the new npp administration undertook a review of whether the former administration hiring policies in fact complied with puerto rico law.they determined that one such set of policies was contrary to puerto rico law and that the employment of those hired under the erroneous determinations must be terminated.this decision,ruling,was announced on january,almost two years before vélez vélez brought suit.
vélez vélez was in the group of employees who had been hired under the erroneous determinations.there is no evidence that the members of that group were not all terminated or that the new interpretation of the policies was not uniformly applied.vélez vélez was individually informed by letter,dated february,that she would be terminated under the new ruling.she received this letter on february,some months before she brought suit.
vélez vélez was told that she could have a hearing,which she did on june.at no time did she say an error had been made as to whether she was an employee under the policy regarding termination.on november,the examining officer recommended affirming the decision to terminate vélez vélez employment.
her claim is that the clock did not begin to run until she was formally terminated after the hearing.but,the purpose of the hearing was not to revisit the of policy that her superiors had already made in ruling.vélez vélez has never denied that ruling did,in fact,nullify the rulings on which her transfer was based.the statute of limitations began to run when she was informed of this relevant decision,and its undisputed effect on her position,by letter on february.to hold otherwise would be to pervert the holdings of ricks and chardon.
in,vélez vélez was transferred from the puerto rico labor relations board to the transportation authority to be the director of human resources transactions.vélez vélez concedes that her transfer was based on ruling,issued on april,and ruling,issued on june,by the secretary of the puerto rico department of transportation and public works at that time,josé izquierdo encarnación 
in november of,luis fortuño burset won the general election in puerto rico as the npp candidate for governor.the result was a change in the administration from the pdp to the npp.two months later,fortuño appointed rubén hernández gregorat to be the new secretary of the puerto rico department of transportation and public works,and the executive director of the transportation authority.
hernández gregorat then appointed luis sánchez casanova to be the director of human resources at the transportation authority.when sánchez casanova left this position on may,hernández gregorat appointed brenda gomila santiago.vélez vélez alleges that both hernández gregorat and gomila santiago were members of the npp.
vélez vélez,in contrast,is an open member of the pdp.the defendants allege that vélez vélez never told them of her political affiliation and she does not say that she did.but,vélez vélez asserts that every one knew the political affiliation of the other employees because everyone talked about politics in the office and because she attended campaign events when politicians visited the office cafeteria.
vélez vélez alleges that sánchez casanova told her,before he left in may of,that hernandez gregorat was putting pressure upon him to issue letters of intention to terminate the employment of the popular democratic employees that worked at the transportation authority human resources office,including her.hernández gregorat allegedly told sánchez casanova that he was looking for an attorney that was willing to justify the manner in which he wanted to terminate the employment of the popular democratic employees.
vélez vélez alleges that,immediately after gomila santiago replaced sánchez casanova in june of,gomila santiago diminished vélez vélez working responsibilities.as examples,gomila santiago allegedly removed vélez vélez responsibility to supervise the personnel appointment process,excluded her from directors meetings which she had previously attended,and briefly denied her access to the human resources database.in addition,vélez vélez alleges that she was moved from office space to office space and finally assigned an office that did not compl y with her work requirements,and that gomila santiago took away equipment assigned to vélez vélez office.
on january,hernández gregorat issued ruling,which declared ruling and ruling to be null and void since both were in express contradiction of puerto rico regulations concerning the merit principle.ruling,which went into effect immediately upon its approval,authorize d the deputy executive director of the authority to take those measures which were legally pertinent in order for the transactions of personnel enacted by the transportation authority under the aforesaid rulings be revised,corrected,or annulled pursuant to applicable law.
an audit of personnel files,conducted by iris azalia ocasio sandoval,identified vélez vélez transfer as having been authorized by the rulings recently rendered null and void.that meant that her appointment was nullified.see kauffman,cir.vélez vélez asserts that this audit selectively targeted transfers during the prior pdp administration,but admits that she does not know the details of the audit and has no evidence of that.vélez vélez alleges that nine other employees all members of the pdp were dismissed as a result of the resolution being declared null and void.
in a letter dated february,hernández gregorat informed vélez vélez of the results of the audit.he explained that her transfer was authorized by ruling and ruling,which were declared to be fully null and void according to decision from january,since said provisions,among others,violated the state of the law in effect at that time as to the transfer of human resources.on the basis of ruling,hernández gregorat advised vélez vélez of his intention to declare her original transfer to the transportation authority to be fully null and void and consequently to order that her service therein be terminated.
in the same letter,hernández gregorat informed vélez vélez of her right to request an informal administrative hearing within twenty days.hernández gregorat explained that,o nce the aforementioned period has elapsed or once the report of the examining officer presiding over the informal hearing if you request one is received,we shall notify you of the legally appropriate final decision.
vélez vélez acknowledged receipt of the letter on february.after a timely request,an informal administrative hearing was held on june.vélez vélez appeared at the hearing with counsel,ramón rodríguez.
on november,the examining officer issued a report and recommendation that recommended that the decision of the executive director notified by way of his letter dated february,be upheld,and that consequently sonia velez be terminated from service and employment.the examining officer agreed that ruling and ruling had the effect of rendering the principle of merit and open competition null and void as mechanisms for determining who serves and who is chosen to serve in a position within the transportation authority.for example,in vélez vélez case,the examining officer found that she did not apply in response to a call for the position,t here was no registry of eligible candidates,and t here was no equivalency in the position.in effect,it was a transfer through promotion without opposition.
since puerto rico law prohibit s every personnel transaction that is contrary to the merit principle,the examining officer concluded that vélez vélez appointment must be rendered null and void.therefore,the examining officer explained,invoking the intrinsic qualities and other good aptitudes of vélez vélez was not a valid argument.nor was the argument that everything has been rectified over time.the examining officer certified that a copy of his decision had been sent to vélez vélez counsel,but did not specify the date on the certification.
by letter dated december,hernández gregorat informed vélez vélez of her formal termination.vélez vélez received this letter on january.
vélez vélez and her husband,pedro rodríguez cintrón,filed the instant complaint on december.vélez vélez alleged that her treatment and the audit that resulted in her termination were politically motivated,in violation of the first amendment that the february,letter failed to comply with due process and that the defendants had violated her rights under the laws and constitution of puerto rico 
on january,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.vélez vélez,wl,at.the district court held that defendants are correct that the discrimination claim is.id.at.in addition,the district court dismissed the due process and state law claims since vélez vélez failed to sufficiently advance either at the summary judgment stage.id.at.
vélez vélez now appeals.she argues,primarily,that her political discrimination claim is not.she also asserts that the district court erred when it dismissed her supplemental state law claim under puerto rico antidiscrimination statute,puerto rico law.vélez vélez has not appealed the district court dismissal of her due process claim or any state law claim other than puerto rico law.

in this case,vélez vélez asserts that she has suffered two injuries harassment while she was employed and her later termination as a result of the audit.we begin with the timing of vélez vélez termination.since vélez vélez filed this lawsuit on december,her claim is if she knew,or had reason to know,of her termination before december.
the supreme court has made clear that the statute of limitations for a terminated employee claim can begin to run before he or she has a chance to contest the relevant employment decision and before he or she is formally terminated.in delaware state college ricks,d,the plaintiff argued that his denial of tenure and ultimate termination were discriminatorily motivated.id.at.the court concluded that the only alleged discrimination occurred and the filing limitations period therefore commenced at the time the tenure decision was made and communicated to ricks.id.at see also id.at.his later termination was not an independent discriminatory act it was the delayed,but inevitable,consequence of the denial of tenure.id.at see also knox davis,cir.
the supreme court then rejected the argument that the relevant tenure decision was not final until after ricks grievance was denied.ricks,at.the court recognized the possibility that the board of trustees could change its prior decision if ricks grievance were found to be meritorious.id.at.but,the court explained,entertaining a grievance complaining of the tenure decision does not suggest that the earlier decision was in any respect tentative.id.the court highlighted that t he grievance procedure,by its nature,is a remedy for a prior decision,not an opportunity to influence that decision before it is made.id.
one year later,in chardon fernandez,d per curiam,the supreme court applied the logic of ricks to plaintiffs claims that their employment had been terminated for political reasons.id.at.in that case,the plaintiffs received notice that their appointments would later end.id.at.the court held that the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs received the notification that their employment would be terminated,and not when the employment was actually terminated.id.at.the relevant date was when the operative decision had been made and communicated to the plaintiffs.id.the court reiterated that m ere continuity of employment,without more,is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment discrimination.id.alteration in original quoting ricks,at.
here,vélez vélez termination was a delayed,but inevitable,consequence of the decision to render the rulings that authorized her original transfer null and void.see ricks,at.specifically,on january,hernández gregorat issued ruling,which declared ruling and ruling to be null and void.the audit identified vélez vélez transfer as being authorized by the rulings a fact which vélez vélez has never disputed.hernández gregorat informed vélez vélez of ruling,and the effect on her transfer,in a letter dated february.as a result,he advised vélez vélez of his intention to declare her original transfer to the transportation authority to be fully null and void and consequently to order that her service therein be terminated.
vélez vélez argues that,regardless of hernández gregorat initial intent to terminate her under his new ruling,she was given an opportunity to change his mind at a hearing held on june.she has presented no evidence that she contested the legality of the nullification decision,or its applicability to her own transfer.nevertheless,vélez vélez argues that she did not reliably know of her termination until she learned that the hearing had been unsuccessful by virtue of hernández gregorat final decision,dated december,
generally,due process requires a hearing to resolve factual disputes as well as the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge for an employee with a property interest.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d see also jones city of boston,cir.in this case,the only factual issue,which vélez vélez does not dispute,was whether she fell within the group of employees whose employment had been nullified as contrary to the merit principle by ruling.the decisionmaker had no further discretion since e mployees whose hiring contravened commonwealth laws and regulations are not vested with a property interest in their career positions.casiano montañez state ins.fund,cir see also gonzález de blasini family dep t,cir de feliciano de jesus,cir kauffman,at.instead,t heir career appointments are null and void ab initio.casiano montañez,at quoting kauffman,at.
the underlying basis for vélez vélez termination thus proves critical.the operative decision to nullify ruling and ruling had been made and formally issued in ruling as of january.see chardon,at.as vélez vélez recognized in her opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment,it was hernandez gregorat execution of resolution which was the one that actually provoked her dismissal of employment.the pretermination hearing provided vélez vélez with a chance to contest the applicability of ruling to her position,but it was not an opportunity to influence that decision before it was made
