louis thompson,a former inmate at the clinton correctional facility clinton,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york thomas mcavoy,judge that dismissed his three consolidated civil rights complaints pursuant to e because thompson did not allege that he had suffered a physical injury.section e provides no federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail,prison,or other correctional facility,for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.because thompson various complaints requested injunctive declaratory relief and the pleadings before the court did not reveal the nature of any damages thompson sought,the district court erred.
background 
on december,thompson filed three civil rights complaints in the office of the clerk for the united states district court for the northern district of new york.in each complaint,he made civil rights claims against one or more clinton employees.in the first,thompson alleged that carter,a corrections officer at clinton,confiscated dilantin and ibuprofen from thompson cell without giving him a contraband slip.as relief,thompson demanded the return of these medications.in the second complaint,thompson alleged that owens stopped another nurse from prescribing dilantin and ibuprofen for thompson,thus subjecting him to deliberate indifference.he asked the court to r esolve this conflict of important interest so that i receive the medication.the third complaint also concerned thompson medications,but it is unclear what misconduct thompson claimed.he again asked the court to r esolve these violations.
in february,the district court consolidated thompson three lawsuits.two months later,the new york department of correctional services docs transferred thompson to its great meadow correctional facility great meadow in june,thompson submitted an affidavit to the court in which he claimed that he suffered from jacksonian epilepsy and that great meadow personnel continued to deny him his medications.thompson subsequently submitted two additional documents in which he requested damages of.the clerk returned the first of these documents because it had not been served but filed the second on december.
on july,defendants moved to dismiss thompson complaint because it did not state a claim on which relief could be granted.magistrate judge ralph smith recommended that the district court grant the motion to dismiss because thompson had not responded to the motion.rather than objecting to the,thompson attempted to appeal to this court.nevertheless,after noting thompson failure to object,judge mcavoy reviewed the de novo and dismissed thompson complaint because he failed to allege that he was physically injured.
following thompson timely notice of appeal,we appointed counsel for him and directed counsel to brief the following issues whether the portion of thompson complaint seeking injunctive relief could be dismissed pursuant to section e whether the portion of his complaint seeking damages for the confiscation of his medicine was subject to section e and whether,assuming section e applied,the district court should have allowed thompson to amend his complaint to allege physical injury.
on appeal,thompson argues that section e does not apply to his eighth amendment claim for deliberate indifference or to his claim for improper confiscation of his medications because neither is a claim for mental or emotional damages even if section e applies,it does not bar either injunctive relief or damages for violation of a fundamental constitutional right if section e is interpreted to bar damages for violation of a constitutional right,it is unconstitutional and at a minimum the district court should have allowed thompson to amend his complaint to allege physical damages before dismissing the complaint.defendants concede that section e does not bar injunctive relief and applies only where a plaintiff has requested compensatory damages for mental or emotional injury.however,they argue that because thompson requested only injunctive relief against defendants employed at clinton,his appeal is now moot.
after the clerk of the court certified to the attorney general of the united states that thompson disputed the constitutionality of section e,the united states moved to intervene.we granted the government request,and it defends the statute as constitutional.the united states also contends that section e does not apply to requests for injunctive relief section e applies even where the plaintiff alleges a violation of a constitutional right and if thompson claims only an emotional or mental injury,section e bars compensatory,nominal,and punitive damages.
discussion 
defendants argue that this appeal is moot because thompson requested only injunctive relief and he no longer is confined at clinton where the defendants are employed.a prisoner transfer to a different correctional facility generally moots his request for injunctive relief against employees of the transferor facility.prins coughlin,cir per curiam.this result flows logically from the more generalized proposition that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the case,not just at the time the complaint is filed.beyah coughlin,cir.in this case,a live controversy continues between thompson and carter thompson request for an order directing carter to return thompson medications.therefore,this scenario differs from the more usual one in which the inmate plaintiff seeks prospective example,an order directing that harassment employees at one facility that would be useless after his transfer to a second facility.thompson appeal is not moot to the extent it seeks the return of medications seized from him although thompson claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the remaining defendants are moot,thompson also contends that the district court should have construed his complaint as a request for damages and that,at a minimum,the court should have allowed him to amend his complaint to claim damages more clearly.we examine these issues in point 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court rule b dismissal of thompson complaint.chance armstrong,cir.thus,we accept all the material allegations of the complaint and will not affirm the dismissal unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.this rule applies with particular force where the plaintiff alleges civil rights violations or where the complaint is submitted pro se.chance,at.finally,when addressing a pro se complaint,a district court should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.branum clark,cir.
iii.scope of section e 
before determining whether section e bars thompson claims and whether the district court should have granted him leave to amend his complaint,we briefly discuss the scope of section e.although many of our sister circuits have addressed the limits of section e,we have not yet had an opportunity to consider whether this statute reaches constitutional violations,claims for injunctive or declaratory relief,or nominal and punitive damages.but see dawes walker,cir walker,chief judge,writing separately indicating in dicta that for a constitutional claim brought pursuant to,section e does not require a showing of physical injury for an award of injunctive or declaratory relief or nominal and punitive damages.
for the convenience of the reader,we repeat the text of section e 
limitation on recovery 
no federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail,prison,or other correctional facility,for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that section e applies to all federal civil actions including claims alleging constitutional violations.because section e is a limitation on recovery of damages for mental and emotional injury in the absence of a sh
