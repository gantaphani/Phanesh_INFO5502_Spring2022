one of the central goals of the americans with disabilities act of ada,et,is to ensure that,if reasonably practicable,individuals are able to obtain and maintain employment without regard to whether they have a disability.to accomplish this goal,the ada requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals.see id.b.this case highlights the importance of conducting a analysis in ada claims.
it is undisputed that rodney mcmillan severe disability requires treatment that prevents him from arriving to work at a consistent time each day.in many,if not most,employment contexts,a timely arrival is an essential function of the position,and a plaintiff inability to arrive on time would result in his failure to establish a fundamental element of a prima facie case of employment discrimination.but if we draw all reasonable inferences in mcmillan favor as we must at summary judgment it is not evident that a timely arrival at work is an essential function of mcmillan job,provided that he is able to offset the time missed due to tardiness with additional hours worked to complete the actual essential functions of his job.
in our view,the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge did not conduct a sufficiently detailed analysis of the facts that tend to undermine the city claim that a specific arrival time is an essential function of mcmillan position before granting summary judgment for the city.vacated and remanded.
background 
mcmillan has schizophrenia,which is treated with calibrated medication.despite this impairment,mcmillan worked for ten years as a case manager for the city human resources administration hra before assuming his present role in as a case manager for the hra community alternative systems agency casa.mcmillan current job duties include conducting annual home visits,processing social assessments,recertifying clients medicaid eligibility,making referrals to other social service agencies,and addressing client concerns.he also meets with clients daily in the office.
casa policy allows employees to arrive at the building anytime between and due to elevator wait times,they are not considered late unless they arrive at the office after.when an employee is late,the tardiness can be approved or disapproved by a supervisor.when a tardiness is approved,an employee may apply accumulated annual leave,sick leave,or other banked time,additional hours worked to cover the time missed due to the late arrival and still be paid in full.if the employee does not have or does not wish to use his banked time,the time prior to the late arrival is unpaid.under their collective bargaining agreement,casa employees are required to take a break for lunch unless they receive prior approval to work overtime through lunch,and under casa policy,they may leave between and casa employees are expected to work approximately hours per week,excluding their break for lunch.
although mcmillan testified that he usually wakes between and,his morning medications make him drowsy and sluggish.as a result,he often arrives late to work,sometimes after.the city makes no allegations that mcmillan malingers instead,it is undisputed that his inability to arrive at work by a specific time is the result of the treatment for his disability.
prior to,and for a period of at least ten years,mcmillan tardy arrivals at casa were either explicitly or tacitly approved.at some time in,his supervisor loshun thornton,at her supervisor jeanne belthrop direction,refused to approve any more of mcmillan late arrivals.as explanation,thornton stated that she would be doing her job if she continued to approve a lateness every single day.
after thornton stopped approving his late arrivals,mcmillan repeatedly made verbal requests for a later start time to avoid being disciplined for tardiness.thornton informed mcmillan that a later start time would not be possible because he could not work past without a supervisor present.
on june,thornton and belthrop held a supervisory conference with mcmillan to discuss his continued tardiness.a memorandum describing the meeting noted that his late arrivals were due to his medication.the memorandum also noted thornton request that mcmillan speak with his treating physician to determine if his schedule could be altered.in october and december,his treating psychiatrist wrote two letters stating that mcmillan medication schedule should not be altered.
on may,mcmillan was fined eight days pay for his late arrivals.in december,belthrop recommended additional disciplinary action in light of mcmillan long history of tardiness.in march,the city brought charges of misconduct incompetence against mcmillan.on april,in a step ii grievance hearing resulting from the march charges,a city representative recommended that mcmillan employment be terminated.mcmillan union representative argued that there were mitigating circumstances due to mcmillan disability.
on march and april,mcmillan formally requested accommodations for his disabilities including a later flex start time that would permit him to arrive at work between and.these requests were forwarded to donald lemons,the deputy director of hra equal employment opportunity office,for evaluation.after speaking with thornton and others,but not with mcmillan,lemons determined that mcmillan request for a later flex start time could not be accommodated because there was no supervisor at the office after ultimately,the city reduced the recommended sanction of termination to a thirty day suspension without pay.
contending that the city response to his request for accommodations was insufficient,mcmillan brought suit alleging violations of the ada,the new york state human rights law,executive law,et,and the new york city human rights law,administrative code,et.mcmillan alleged that he often worked past and that the office is open until,so that he could arrive late and still work hours per week.alternatively,mcmillan asserted that he would be willing to work through lunch to bank time.mcmillan argued that these suggested accommodations would allow him to complete the essential functions of his position.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment for the city and dismissed all of mcmillan claims with prejudice.after noting that it could not distinguish between absenteeism and tardiness,the district court observed that a court was required to give considerable deference to the employer judgment and its general policies in determining whether the ability to arrive at work within a designated time period with some degree of consistency is an essential function of plaintiff job.mcmillan city of new york,civ.jsr,wl,at.because the city determined that an ability to consistently arrive at work within a time frame is a fundamental requirement of plaintiff position,the district court granted summary judgment to the city on the ground that plaintiff can not state a prima facie case of disability discrimination because he has failed to demonstrate that he could perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation.id.at.as an alternative basis for its holding,the district court found that mcmillan could not demonstrate that the city legitimate business reason for his discipline his repeated tardiness was pretext for discrimination.
the district court also dismissed mcmillan claims that the city failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations.the district court concluded that mcmillan request for a later start time was unreasonable as a matter of law because he has failed to demonstrate that he would be able to arrive at work on time even if he were granted a later flex starting time.id.at.
