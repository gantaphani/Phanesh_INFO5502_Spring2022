factual background and procedural history 
factual background 
viewing the record in a light most favorable to the nonmovant,willis,the facts in this case are as follows.willis worked as a neonatal nurse practitioner nnp at children from august,until her termination on january.a.from until,willis served as nnp.a,a.at all times relevant to the instant action,margaret lamouree,the nurse manager for the newborn intensive care unit nicu was willis supervisor.a a.lamouree supervisors were cynthia valenta and diane hupp.a a.from august through january,children issued disciplinary warnings to willis for her conduct in three distinct incidents,the relevant details of which are included below.
the first disciplinary incident took place one morning in.while on duty,willis received a call that she was needed in the room of a patient who had recently undergone surgery necessitating an endotracheal tube.a a.in the hallway on her way to assist the patient,willis passed a nurse who remarked to willis that the patient tube must be out.a.in response,willis stated,t hat fuckin sic tube better not be out,i fuckin sic kill someone.a.the patient father was in the room at the time,but did not hear willis statement.a a.willis received a final written warning regarding this incident in early september,which stated that she would be removed from her role as a nnp a.
later that month,after she received the written notice of the warning and demotion,willis attended a meeting at which lamouree and valenta were present.a a.at the meeting,clinical leadership explained that the nnp role was changing to include a greater focus on administrative and budgetary duties,rather than patient care.a a.willis was interested and thought she was qualified for the role,but felt that lamouree and valenta coerced her to step down.a.
the second disciplinary incident took place in early january.one evening while willis was on duty,another nurse indicated she was looking for someone to start an intravenous line on a patient.frustrated with the nurse,whom willis believed to be inexperienced,and concerned that there was not enough time to look for someone else,willis started the line herself.a.afterwards,willis approached the nicu clinical leadership to express her concerns about the inexperience of some of the nursing staff.a a.willis raised her voice loud enough for the nicu supervisor missy locke,who was nearby,to hear her.a a.a week later,lamouree sent jenelle taylor in human resources an email summarizing her conversation with willis about the incident.a a.lamouree email stated that willis became defensive when lamouree told her the clinical leaders were offended by how willis handled the situation.a a.when lamouree asked willis if she thought that she could have communicated her concerns without yelling,willis said,n ever mind i always wrong and walked out of the room.a a.willis denies yelling,but otherwise agrees with lamouree characterization of the incident.a a.
the third disciplinary incident occurred one night the following week when willis was near the end of her shift.on any shift,all the nicu nurses are split into two teams,blue and green.a.willis,who was assigned to the green team that night,received a patient who was assigned to the blue team,but did not perform a history and physical or complete admission orders,as required.a a.there is some confusion about who was supposed to take care of these tasks.willis contends that another nurse,holly bernardi,who was assigned to the blue team that night,was responsible.a.
concerned that this patient care fell through the cracks,hupp called both willis and bernardi at home after their shifts to discuss the incident.hupp documented the call with willis in an internal memo.a.willis told hupp that she thought she had placed the admission orders,but,as bernardi was aware,this was the extent of the responsibility willis assumed.a.the next day,willis emailed hupp about their conversation the previous night regarding the incident,and stated that she put the admission orders in and relayed this information to bernardi.a.hupp forwarded the email to taylor in human resources.a.at her deposition,willis again stated that the patient was bernardi and not her responsibility at all,but that she completed the admission orders,which bernardi knew.a a.hupp internal memo,the contents of which willis does not dispute,indicates that willis left without completing the patient admission orders.a,a.willis also told hupp that it was common practice for nurses to complete admission orders received at the end of their shift,but then pass along the physical and history to those in the oncoming shift.a,a.when lamouree asked willis if this is what she did that night,willis said that it had been very busy and she was unable to recall to whom she had reported about the patient.a.
two days after this incident,on january,hupp,valenta,and lamouree met with willis to terminate her employment.a,a a.willis was years old at the time of her termination,making her a member of a protected class under the adea and the phra.a.
procedural history

standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over a district court order granting summary judgment.simpson kay jewelers,div.of sterling,cir.accordingly,we engage in the same analysis as the district court initially applied.anderson consol.rail,cir.we will affirm the grant of summary judgment if the moving party has shown that the evidentiary material on the record,if reduced to admissible evidence,is insufficient to permit the nonmoving party to carry its burden of proof.celotex catrett,d.
on a review of an order granting summary judgment,this court is required to construe all facts and inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.simpson,at quoting fuentes perskie,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.a.a genuine issue of material fact is one that affect s the outcome of the suit under the governing law and could lead a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that the evidentiary record presents no genuine issue of material fact.simpson,at quoting fuentes,at.once the moving party has done so,to avoid the entry of summary judgment against them,the nonmoving party must identify facts in the record that would enable them to make a sufficient showing on essential elements of their case for which they have the burden of proof.celotex,at.if,after adequate time for discovery,the nonmoving party has not met its burden,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,the court must enter summary judgment against the nonmoving party.id.at.
willis claims children discriminated against her on the basis of age,in violation of the adea and the phra.since this court has determined that the interpretation of the phra is identical to that of federal laws,including the adea,we present a single analysis for willis claims under both statutes fasold justice,cir quoting fogelman mercy,cir connors chrysler fin,cir there is no need to differentiate between adea and phra claims because the same analysis is used for both.
standard for age discrimination claims 
the adea prohibits employers from discharg ing any individual or otherwise discriminat ing against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a.to succeed on an adea claim,a plaintiff must establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that age was the cause of the adverse employment action.gross fbl fin,d.age discrimination claims in which the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence proceed according to the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d keller orix credit,cir reaffirming the application of a slightly modified version of mcdonnell douglas in adea cases.
under this framework,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.keller,at citing mary honor ctr.hicks,d.satisfying the prima facie elements creates an inference of unlawful discrimination.pivirotto innovative,cir quoting waldron sl,cir.the elements of a prima facie case of age discrimination are that the plaintiff is at least forty years old the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment decision the plaintiff was qualified for the position in question and the plaintiff was ultimately replaced by another employee who was sufficiently younger so as to support an inference of a discriminatory motive.burton teleflex,cir.this court has indicated the prima facie case is not intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.pivirotto,at quoting furnco constr.waters,d.where the plaintiff is not directly replaced,the fourth element is satisfied if the plaintiff can provide facts which if otherwise unexplained,are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.id.
once the plaintiff has successfully established a prima facie case creating an inference of discrimination,the burden shifts to the employer who must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.jones sch.dist.of,cir citing keller,at.this second step of mcdonnell douglas does not require that the employer prove that the articulated legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason was the actual reason for the adverse employment action.instead,the employer must provide evidence that will allow the factfinder to determine that the decision was made for nondiscriminatory reasons.fuentes,at.
if the employer satisfies this second step,the burden shifts back once more to the plaintiff to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer proffered legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual.burton,at.in fuentes perskie,this court recognized two ways in which a plaintiff can demonstrate that the employer legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason was pretextual.at.the first way to show pretext is for the plaintiff to point to evidence that would allow a factfinder to disbelieve the employer reason for the adverse employment action.id.at.in order to raise sufficient disbelief,the evidence must indicate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons to satisfy the factfinder that the employer actions could not have been for nondiscriminatory reasons.id.alternatively,the second way a plaintiff can establish pretext is to point to evidence that would allow a factfinder to believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer action.id.at.specifically,the plaintiff can show pretext this way by presenting evidence with sufficient probative force so as to allow the factfinder to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that age was a motivating or determinative factor.simpson,at citing keller,at.pointing to evidence demonstrating any of the following satisfies this second way to prove pretext the defendant previously discriminated against the plaintiff the defendant discriminated against others within the plaintiff protected class or the defendant has treated similarly situated,substantially younger individuals more favorably.simpson,at citing fuentes,at.if this step is satisfied,at trial the plaintiff must convince the factfinder that not only was the employer proffered reason false,but the real reason was impermissible discrimination.fuentes,at quoting mary honor,at.
prima facie case 
since the parties agree that willis has satisfied the first three elements of a prima facie case,the only element at issue is the fourth whether willis has presented evidence that raises an inference of age discrimination.a.willis claims that she has satisfied this element by demonstrating that children treated similarly situated,but substantially younger,individuals more favorably.appellant br.the district court rejected this argument,finding the evidence willis provided would not permit an inference of intentional discrimination.a.accordingly,the district court found that willis had not adduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case.a.
on appeal,willis renews her claim that the evidence she provided raises an inference of discrimination that children treated similarly situated,substantially younger employees more favorably.appellant br.to demonstrate more favorable treatment of similarly situated,substantially younger employees,willis references the three disciplinary incidents,and cites the lack of discipline for substantially younger employees engaging in the same or similar conduct.appellant br.however,with respect to the first incident in august,willis states t here is no indication on the record that any substantially younger employee was ever reported for using profanity,much less disciplined for it.appellant br.with respect to the second incident,which took place in early january,willis also admits that t here is nothing on the record to indicate that there are any similarly situated employees of any age who were accused,falsely or not,of raising their voices or yelling at clinical leaders.appellant br.willis reference here to the lack of discipline goes against her argument of more favorable treatment of younger employees,since she admits there is no evidence that anyone,including employees her own age,committed these same infractions and escaped discipline.appellant br.in conceding this,willis admits that there is no evidence to support her point,but attempts to use this omission in her favor.
the argument that the absence of disciplinary incidents involving younger staff members is evidence of more favorable treatment,defies this court precedent and logic.this court has emphasized that evidence of more favorable treatment can not be viewed in a vacuum,but rather that the record must be viewed as a whole.simpson,at.viewing the record in its entirety,which includes willis documented issues with communication and interpersonal skills,this argument works against willis.a a,a.instead of showing disparate treatment of willis as an employee in a protected class,the record,particularly the three disciplinary incidents,supports the concerns of willis supervisors that she had difficulty working appropriately with others.the record does not reveal any evidence of similarly situated,substantially younger employees experiencing similar difficulties and not receiving discipline.appellant br.
assessing the other portions of the record willis cites in support of her case,she has not pointed to any other evidence that gives rise to the inference that she was terminated due to age discrimination.willis argument that children discriminated against her on the basis of age is rooted in her own belief that this was the reason for her termination,but she is unable to point to any supporting evidence.willis concedes that she can not identify anything lamouree,hupp,or valenta ever said that would suggest an age bias in general,or specifically with respect to willis.a a.in fact,when questioned at her deposition about the role her age played in her employment at children,the only conversation willis recalled ever having with her supervisors was a statement she made once that she planned to work until age.a a.a passing reference to retirement age and willis own belief that age discrim
