kevin sullivan,vincent dudley,mark mehringer,jason sleeper,and michael trombley are current and former police officers who were hired by springfield,massachusetts the city in and then laid off in.plaintiffs were all later recalled by the city.in,they sued the city,asserting claims under,inter alia.
plaintiffs,who are white,claimed that determinations made by the city during the hiring process in were not permitted under either a consent decree or the constitution.they alleged these determinations harmed them by assigning them to lower seniority ranks than minority officers hired at the same time.plaintiffs claimed that,if the city had not made these impermissible determinations in,they would have had higher seniority in and would not have been laid off or would otherwise have been recalled sooner.
on cross motions,the district court granted summary judgment to the city on two grounds.it found that plaintiffs had not shown facts establishing any causal connection between defendant actions and the plaintiffs injuries.it also found the city actions were within the scope of the city ongoing obligations under a consent decree in a case known as castro beecher castro i.see sullivan city of springfield,d.we affirm the district court decision on both grounds.
a.the castro consent decree 
the history of the castro consent decree sets the stage.in,eight minority plaintiffs who had applied unsuccessfully to become boston police officers,brought suit against the massachusetts civil service division,an agency which has since become known as the human resources division hrd,the name we use.the suit alleged discriminatory hiring and recruiting practices,which violated the fourteenth amendment and had led to a disproportionately low number of minority police officers in boston.see castro i.at see also deleo city of boston,dist.lexis,at,at the time,the black population of boston was approximately of the total population,but about of the boston police force was black.
the district court in castro i rejected the plaintiffs claims as to several of the eligibility requirements.see,castro i.at discussing the height and swim test requirements.it also declined to certify the plaintiffs requested class.id.at.it concluded,however,that the massachusetts civil service police entrance written examination administered by hrd to police against minorities who did not share the prevailing white culture.id.at.the court barred the use of the existing examination and set out guidelines for creating a one.see id.at see also castro beecher castro ii,cir.
the decision was appealed to this court,which held that class certification should have been granted.castro ii,at.it agreed that the examination was discriminatory,but held that the district court remedy had been too narrow,and remanded.this court stated that,i n our view,if relief in the near future is to be more than token,further provision is necessary,and that the relief could include the creation of a priority pool for minority applicants who passed a examination and who could be hired according to a preferential ratio.id.at.while recognizing that any such effort is bound to be a crude one and must be pursued with sensitivity,this court stated that preferential status for the priority pool will yield a significant increment of minority police officers in the near term.id.at.
following the remand,and in the context that use of the extant examination was illegal,the parties entered into what has now come to be known as the castro consent decree.the decree was approved by the district court in.castro beecher castro iii.the court stated that the decree was intended to counteract the unconscious lopsidedness of the recruitment of the past by giv ing a priority to minority candidates who have shown themselves qualified.id.at.in entering a consent decree,the defendant state authorities may well have agreed to relief beyond what the constitution would have provided as a remedy.see united states charles george trucking,cir.this is a point we need not decide.
the consent decree was subsequently revisited and modified.see castro v.at castro beecher castro iv.the amended remedy was explicitly modeled on the consent decree adopted in a parallel case involving massachusetts firefighters.see castro iv.at citing boston chapter,naacp,beecher,aff,cir see also castro v.at.
the castro consent decree required hrd to prepare certification lists by creating two groups.the first,group a,would consist of all black and applicants who pass a future police entrance examination and are otherwise qualified for appointment on the basis of existing requirements.the second,group b,would consist of all other persons who pass a future police entrance examination and are otherwise qualified for appointment on the basis of existing requirements.when an appointing authority,such as the city,sought to hire police officers,it would send a request to hrd,which would send the appointing authority a certification list ordered on the basis of one candidate from group a for every candidate certified from group in making its hiring decisions,if the appointing authority chose to reject a candidate in favor of another candidate who appeared lower on the hrd list,hrd would not approve the appointment unless the appointing authority furnished hrd with a written statement of its reasons for doing so hrd would then provide a written statement of those reasons to the candidate upon written request.
the castro decree was to remain in effect for a given city until that city police department achieves a complement of minorities commensurate with the percentage of minorities within the community.the decree accordingly continues to apply to springfield.the plaintiffs agree that is so.boston is no longer under the decree.see deleo,dist.lexis,at finding that boston had reached this goal for minority representation.
facts underlying the present case 
the facts in the present case are undisputed,and it is undisputed that there are gaps in the evidence about plaintiffs hirings and layoffs.this may in part be attributable to the fact that plaintiffs did not bring suit until,some eight years after they were hired 
in,springfield decided to hire sixty new police officers.its police commission chairman requested a list of eligible candidates from hrd.eligibility meant something more limited however in the intervening years,hrd had delegated to the local appointing authorities most of the responsibility for determining the eligibility of candidates for eligibility criteria other than the examination.
on january,in response to the city request,hrd generated a list,certification,of candidates who had passed a written examination.under the castro decree,the list placed the minority candidate who had scored highest on the test first,followed by the candidate who had scored highest on the test,followed by the second highest scoring minority candidate and the second highest scoring candidate,and so on,in alternating order 
after the city received the hrd examination certification list,it asked those candidates who were still interested in being considered for the job to come in and sign the certification list.the record does not establish which candidates signed the list,and which were eliminated from consideration for failure to do so.although an appointing authority such as the city would generally have sent the original,signed certification list back to hrd,the relevant certification other evidence as to which candidates signed and which did not in the record.
hrd retained oversight of the process used by local appointing authorities to ensure compliance with its rules.the city applied a series of hiring prerequisites to the remaining candidates to decide which candidates would receive offers and be able to go through the police academy.for each candidate,the city ran a background check a residency check and an interview if the candidate was not eliminated at this point,he or she would be given a conditional offer of employment,after which he or she would be further subject to a medical examination,a psychological examination,and a physical abilities test.
captain william cochrane,who from to was the commanding officer of the academy for the springfield police department,was responsible for this process.cochrane and his staff evaluated and eliminated candidates on the basis of the qualifications listed above.once they had a list with enough qualified candidates to meet the city hiring goals,cochrane passed this list to the chief office,which then filled out an authorization of employment form form.form,which was sent to the state hrd on may,contained the names of officers who had been selected for appointment.in addition to candidates who were on the hrd certification list,form included the names of eight former police cadets as well as two other officers whose employment applications were processed differently.
cochrane testified at deposition that in carrying out this process,he and his staff attempted to comply with the requirements of the castro decree.to this end,he had spoken with hrd many,many times to try and clarify how we were to proceed.cochrane testified that,in order to comply with what he understood as the requirements of the castro decree,after he received the original list from hrd,he and his staff worked off of two separate with the minority candidates in ranked order and the other with the candidates in ranked order.if a minority candidate was eliminated from consideration under the qualification procedures,cochrane and his staff would proceed to considering the next minority candidate.likewise,if a candidate was eliminated,cochrane and his staff would proceed to considering the next candidate.cochrane testified that his memory was that,at the end of the process,these two lists were combined in alternating minority candidate followed by one candidate.that racially reordered list was then given to the chief office,which filled out form accordingly.that form was placed into evidence.the form shows that the city did not hire on a basis.rather,in the spring of,the city hired about twice the number of white officers as minority officers,excluding police cadets.if cadets are counted,the city hired more than twice the number of white officers as minority officers.
contrary to cochrane memory,form was not in fact organized on a basis.the district court justifiably concluded that cochrane memory was simply incorrect.sullivan,d at.even discounting the eight cadets and the two other candidates who were treated separately,form contained candidates and twelve minority candidates.the minority candidates are not in alternating order.within each group,the candidates were in the same rank order as they were on the original hrd list.but some candidates,including the plaintiffs,appeared lower on form,relative to some minority candidates,than they did on the original hrd list.as the district court noted,there is no evidence as to when if ever the city created one or more reordered lists.and there is no evidence that the ordering on the list was based on race.
the city assigned badge numbers according to the order on form.it also simultaneously assigned seniority according to officers badge numbers the greater the officer seniority,the lower the badge number.thus,those who appeared lower on form were assigned less seniority than those who appeared higher on form.plaintiffs seniority dates were assigned on this basis.
almost six years later,in early,the city laid off approximately police officers.it is undisputed that the layoff order was determined purely by is,by badge number,and not by race.the city laid off the five plaintiffs over a period beginning march.later that year,and through the end of,the city obtained more funding through grants and retirements,and was able to recall all of the police officers who wanted to return.as a result,plaintiffs were all recalled.it is undisputed that the recall order was also based on seniority,not race.because both the layoffs and the recalls were conducted on the basis of seniority,officers with less seniority were laid off sooner and recalled later than those with more seniority.
on january,plaintiffs brought their suit,claiming that they were assigned higher badge numbers in,and thus were given less seniority,on the basis of impermissible determinations.that is,they argued that if the city had not racially reordered the hrd list as it was going through the various qualification procedures,they would have been hired with greater seniority,and thus would have been either not laid off at all in,or would have been recalled more quickly than they were.as the district court viewed their claim,the plaintiffs were arguing that the failure to assign seniority based on the original,alternating hrd certification,instead of the form,violated both the castro decree and the equal protection clause.sullivan,d at.
plaintiffs alleged that as a result of the city actions,they lost,among other things,back pay,overtime,details,and health insurance contributions.they sought compensatory damages,back pay,front pay,and compensation for lost overtime and details.plaintiffs claims of harm necessarily rest on their contention that the original assignment of seniority was discriminatory.they do not challenge the validity or constitutionality of the city continuing obligations under the castro decree,but argue that the city actions were not within the scope of the decree.
on november and december,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.on january,the district court denied both motions without prejudice,citing certain gaps in the record,but invited the parties to file substitute motions that resolved these gaps.plaintiffs filed a new motion for summary judgment on may,which attempted to clarify the record.the city filed a cross motion for summary judgment on september.on march,the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendant motion the court issued a second memorandum on may,reiterating its conclusion and explaining its reasoning more fully.sullivan,d at.the court noted that there was no material dispute of fact.id.at.it found that plaintiffs had not established the causal connection between defendant actions and their injuries because there appeared to be no racial reordering of form.see id.at.furthermore,the court held that even if this causal connection could be established,the city actions were within the scope of the castro decree.see id.at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.
we review de novo the grant of summary judgment.rodriguez am.int l ins.of,cir.all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party still,we ignore conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.prescott higgins,cir quoting reynolds tobacco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also new fed mortgage union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa,cir.
plaintiffs do not challenge the application of the castro decree by the city.mackin city of boston,cir.they concede that to the extent defendant actions were within the scope of the decree,they have no claim for relief.plaintiffs argument is that defendant made employment decisions that went beyond the dictates of the castro decree.these actions,they urge,must be subject to strict scrutiny.see parents involved in cmty.schs.seattle sch.dist,d it is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.plaintiffs argue that defendant actions can not withstand strict scrutiny.
plaintiffs claims focus on the actions of cochrane.in his deposition,cochrane stated that he and his staff reordered the list sent to the city by hrd in in order to maintain the order as candidates were eliminated from the list.if a minority candidate was eliminated,he was replaced by the next highest minority candidate if a candidate was eliminated,he was replaced by the next highest candidate.plaintiffs claim that because of this reordering,they were hired with higher badge is,with less they would have had if hiring proceeded purely according to the order of the hrd list.and although cochrane claimed the reordering was done to comply with the castro decree,plaintiffs argue the decree did not allow any ordering beyond that already done by hrd.
plaintiffs opening argument on appeal is that they are entitled to strict scrutiny of any governmental decision based on race.see parents involved.at johnson california,d.however,they have failed to produce evidence that the governmental decisions here were based on race.
in order to have a valid claim under,plaintiffs must show that defendant actions were the cause in fact of the alleged constitutional deprivation.gagliardi sullivan,cir citing garcia,cir see also nahmod,civil rights and civil liberties litigation ed.it is not enough for plaintiffs to show cochrane may have used an impermissible racial classification there must be a causal link between this and the adverse employment is,plaintiffs being given their particular seniority ranking on hiring.see gagliardi,at back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir on an alleged equal protection clause violation,the plaintiff must show more than invidious intent.she must also demonstrate that the causal connection between the defendant action and the plaintiff injury is sufficiently direct.quoting gierlinger gleason,cir.to survive summary judgment,plaintiffs were required to offer sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude defendant actions were based on race and this caused their injuries.see soto flores,cir see also,at back,at.plaintiffs have failed to do so.
to the extent plaintiffs continue to argue that the city was obliged not to alter the hrd list or that any alterations to it were,the argument is simply wrong.the hrd list was based only on examination results all other eligibility criteria were left to the city to determine and on that basis the list was altered,introducing a large number of variables other than race.
it is undisputed that seniority was assigned purely on the basis of form,which the city sent to hrd on may.it is also undisputed that plaintiffs names were lower on form,relative to certain minority candidates,than they were on the original list hrd sent to the city.but the plaintiffs have not shown this was based on race.plaintiffs introduced the city at some point reordered the hrd list on the basis of race as it was going through the qualification process.there is no evidence in the record,however,beyond plaintiffs speculation,from which a fact finder could reasonably determine what effect cochrane reordering of the list the city received from hrd had on the list that was ultimately sent back to hrd,form.there is a break in the causal chain between the original hrd list,cochrane reordering,and form.
plaintiffs rely on cochrane testimony that he and his staff split the original hrd list into two lists,one for minorities and one for that they worked off these separate lists during the qualification process and that they then created the final list that was the basis for form,at the end of the process,by recombining the two lists,dovetailing minority and candidates.
but the record evidence does not stop with cochrane account.the actual order of persons on the form sent by the city to hrd is in evidence and it does not correspond to cochrane description.discounting the eight cadet candidates and candidates jose diaz and brian elliot,who were all handled under separate procedures,the names on form were not organized in order nor are there equal numbers of minority and candidates.thus,it can not be that form was created simply by combining the two lists.
even assuming a,interim list was created at some point in the process,plaintiffs have presented no evidence they were lower on this list than they were on the hrd list,or that this was ultimately the reason why plaintiffs were lower on the final form list.inferences must be reasonable ones and it is plaintiffs burden to present enough evidence for a trier of fact to infer that there was a causal connection as to both lists.speculative hypotheses are not enough.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs speculation that there may be a causal chain,without supporting evidence,is insufficient to survive summary judgment.see gagliardi,at upholding dismissal under.b of a suit where plaintiff theory of causation was conclusory and not substantiated by reasonable inference from the facts,at upholding grant of summary judgment in suit in which plaintiffs offered no competent evidence that could have supported a finding of causation.
plaintiffs try a different argument that summary judgment was premature because there are documents that could be brought before the court that could prove the causal connection there are several reasons to reject the argument.
first,not only did the plaintiffs not argue to the district court that summary judgment was premature,they affirmatively requested that the court resolve the case on the existing evidence plaintiffs filed their summary judgment motion before the city filed its cross motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs thought the statements in cochrane deposition were sufficient not only to defeat defendant summary judgment motion but to establish their case as a matter of law.the district court disagreed,and plaintiff s disappointment with that ruling is understandable,but there is no reason for us now to turn back the clock and give them a further opportunity to reconfigure the record.golden arch,cir see also meehan town of plymouth,cir.
second,the fact that such documents at one point existed and would likely have been in the possession of defendant or hrd did not relieve plaintiffs of their burden to produce evidence necessary to support a jury verdict,see singh blue shield of,cir.plaintiffs never filed a rule f affidavit or otherwise represented that consideration of summary judgment was premature.see.f providing that,i f a party opposing a summary judgment motion shows by affidavit that,for specified reasons,it can not present facts essential to justify its opposition,the court may order a continuance to enable other discovery to be undertaken.plaintiffs had a full opportunity to conduct discovery.see,at stating that when a party professes an inability to respond to a summary judgment motion because of incomplete discovery,his recourse is by way of.f.plaintiffs can not claim to be surprised that the procedures by which the city handled hrd certification list and the effect these procedures had on plaintiffs were at issue indeed,these issues were central to the case from the start.
plaintiffs counter that the necessity of such evidence only became apparent when the district court,in ruling on the summary judgment motions,made reference to two documents not contained in the unpublished stipulation of facts between the parties in the original castro beecher case and a certification handbook prepared by hrd.the court use of these documents will be discussed further below,but plaintiffs argument fails in this context.the documents used by the district court were unrelated to the question of whether cochrane actions could be established as the cause in fact of plaintiffs injuries.
scope of the consent decree 
the district court held that the city actions were part of its obligations under the castro consent decree.plaintiffs argue that defendant actions went beyond the scope of the castro decree,which they say should be narrowly read.they argue the requirements of the castro decree were fulfilled when,following the written examination,hrd created a list of candidates that alternated minority and candidates any reordering by the city after it received the list from hrd was impermissible.
plaintiffs offer two arguments in support of their interpretation of the consent decree.first,because the consent decree was intended to remedy the effects of a discriminatory written examination,it contemplated reordering only after that stage of the process,and not also after candidates were eliminated in later stages,such as the medical or psychological examinations.second,even if the consent decree did allow further reordering,such reordering could be done only by hrd,and not by the city.we disagree on both counts,as the district court did,se
