craig holcomb appeals from a decision of the district court,which granted iona college motion for summary judgment on holcomb claim under title vii of the civil rights act of,et.holcomb,who is white,claims that the college decision to terminate his employment as an assistant coach of its basketball team was motivated by his marriage to a black woman.the college contends,instead,that holcomb was removed from its staff as part of a necessary overhaul of a poorly performing team,and asserts that the decision was not based on race.
we hold,for the first time,that an employer may violate title vii if it takes action against an employee because of the employee association with a person of another race.further,we find that a reasonable jury could determine that holcomb was fired in part because he was married to a black woman.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
i.the evidence in the record 
we emphasize that,at this stage of the proceedings,we are required to construe the evidence adduced in the court below in the light most favorable to plaintiff case.see,holtz rockefeller,cir.
a.the iona college men basketball team 
in,craig holcomb was hired as an assistant coach of the iona gaels men basketball team.holcomb reported both to the head coach,tim welsh,and to the college director of athletics,a role filled at that time by richard petriccione.
in,welsh left and was replaced as head coach by jeff ruland,an alumnus of iona,who was twice an nba all star,and who is white.when ruland was appointed,holcomb was made associate head coach.this new title denoted his position as the top assistant to ruland,and was accompanied by a pay raise,but seemed to make no difference to holcomb responsibilities as an assistant coach.when ruland came on board,the iona gaels were enjoying considerable success,and their good form continued for three seasons thereafter.the team won the metro atlantic athletic conference maac tournament in,and,thereby earning a spot in the national collegiate athletic association ncaa men division i championship tournament in each of those years.
in june,holcomb married pamela gauthier,an woman.in,ruland began a relationship with iris hansen,who was also an woman and friend of gauthier.hansen and gauthier often went to games and functions together.in june,ruland signed a new contract as head coach.this contract,worth over a year,made ruland the highest paid employee at iona.
from to,ruland supervised the same three assistant coaches holcomb worked alongside tony chiles,who is,and rob,the most junior of the three,who is white,and who was not in an interracial relationship.this case arises from the college decision to fire holcomb and chiles,while deciding to retain and ruland.
brennan and petriccione 
of the five officers of the college formally involved in the decision to end holcomb employment,holcomb imputes improper racial motives to two people shawn brennan the director of athletics and richard petriccione a vice president of the college.brennan and petriccione were close colleagues.before,brennan worked as sports information director directly under petriccione,who was then the athletics director.when petriccione was promoted to vice president,brennan replaced him as director of athletics,and the two worked in tandem for a transitional period.
as vice president for advancement and external affairs,petriccione was one of three vice presidents working immediately under the college president,brother james liguori.in that capacity,petriccione was the chief officer at the college,and worked on alumni relations,advertising,public relations,corporate and foundational grants,and scholarships.it was evidently no coincidence that an erstwhile athletics director was chosen for this post sporting events and activities play a major part in iona alumni relations and efforts.the men basketball program,in particular,played a prominent role in iona alumni outreach endeavors.
holcomb claims that both brennan and petriccione had prior histories of racially questionable conduct,and relies on these histories as support for his claim that the college termination decision was based,at least in part,on the fact that his wife was black.in particular,holcomb claims that the termination decision was motivated by a perceived need to appeal to the pockets of iona mostly white alumni.
in building his case that he was fired for racial reasons,holcomb cites,among other things,shawn brennan decision to bar high school students,and holcomb wife,from goal club events.the goal club is an iona college alumni fundraising and social organization,and is overseen by the director of athletics.members of the club,most of whom are iona alumni,pay an annual fee to the athletics department,and in return are invited to attend special functions and parties.throughout the period under consideration,the goal club routinely held or receptions with the players and coaches of the men basketball team.
holcomb asserts that,from at least until,high school basketball players from local schools,including potential basketball recruits,were permitted to attend these parties.the majority of high school students who attended these events were.moreover,holcomb wife regularly accompanied him to goal club functions.on holcomb account,all that changed after a november,home game against george mason university.
after the game,several basketball players from nearby mount vernon high school attended a goal club event with their coach.all these students were.the college version of events is that its assistant athletic director for compliance,jamie fogarty,noticed that their number included a highly prized student athlete whom iona was attempting to recruit.fogarty was concerned that the student presence violated ncaa recruiting regulations.brennan then told holcomb to ask all the high school players and their coach to leave.brennan later barred high school students from future goal club events.
holcomb took another view of the issue,and presents a different account of the college motive for barring the students.on his reading of the ncaa rules,permitting high school students to come to events was at worst a gray area.moreover,holcomb believed that the new policy would seriously hurt recruiting.he told brennan as much at a later meeting.suspecting that brennan wanted to reduce attendance at goal club events,holcomb asked brennan if he was looking for a reason not to allow the student athletes to come.
at the same meeting,brennan allegedly told holcomb that holcomb wife,along with ruland girlfriend iris hansen,should no longer attend goal club functions his stated reason for excluding these two women was that they were neither alumni nor donors.holcomb,however,concluded that brennan was again attempting to limit the number of black people at the college fundraising events.
in addition to his allegations about the goal club,holcomb also relies on testimony that brennan,on seeing some of the college team players wearing clothing,asked ruland if he could get these colored boys to dress like the white guys on the team.
petriccione 
holcomb has also adduced affidavits and testimony to the effect that richard petriccione was in the habit of making racially offensive comments.early in his tenure as an assistant coach,holcomb claims to have heard petriccione say e verybody at fordham thinks they have these good black kids,and iona has niggers.a year later,when several black members of the iona gaels were accused of stealing and selling telephone access codes,petriccione allegedly told holcomb that the basketball program needed to keep its niggers in line.
colleagues at iona testified to petriccione record of what might,charitably,be called racial insensitivity.egregiously in this respect,petriccione is said to have referred to a nigerian employee at the alumni giving office as a jungle bunny and an african princess.when that member of staff applied to his office for the position of assistant director of annual giving,he remarked w hat does she think she is coming from a hut in africa and thinking she could apply for this job 
the most striking of the allegations against petriccione relates directly to holcomb and his wife.plaintiff testified that in february,he asked petriccione whether he had received the wedding invitation that holcomb and gauthier had sent him.according to holcomb,whose claim is backed up in this respect by a third party,petriccione replied y ou really going to marry that aunt jemima you really are a nigger lover.
discontent 
after the successes of ruland first three years in charge,the men basketball program began to suffer poorer fortunes.the parties dispute the extent of the downturn,but it is clear that the college had serious cause for concern about the team results and its activities.
on the court,the team went from an impressive tally of for the period of to,to a lackluster record of for to.in stark contrast with the preceding seasons,the gaels failed to make it to the ncaa tournament in,or.the team came under fire from the media and from fans for its inconsistent performances.in,the team finished seventh out of ten in the maac,and had a record of.the program also exhibited problems off the court.in late,several players were discovered to have defrauded the college by buying books with book vouchers and selling the books for cash.poor academic performance led to the dismissal of two starting players after the season two more were suspended for the same reason during the course of the season.and in late,the ncaa informed the college that it was investigating possible rules infractions by iona men basketball players and coaches.ruland and,but not holcomb or chiles,were interviewed in connection with that investigation.
on june,brother liguori was quoted in a local newspaper as saying that he was not a happy camper.from his vantage point,the men basketball program seem ed to be going from bad to worse.
brennan reports 
in march,after the conclusion of the season,brennan was asked as director of athletics by liguori and the iona board of trustees to prepare a written report evaluating the men basketball program,and to make recommendations for reform.brennan submitted two reports a preliminary report,and a final report.in the course of preparing the reports,brennan consulted petriccione on several occasions.brennan presented each of his reports to the four people who ultimately made the termination decision.these four were the college president,brother liguori and his three vice presidents petriccione vice president for advancement and alumni affairs,sister marie thornton vice president for finance,and warren rosenberg the college provost.
brennan reports noted a l ack of team motivation,and stated that the gaels were c onsistently outperformed by teams with less talent.he found that there was p oor team and individual academic performance.the n umber one problem with the men basketball program was f undamental lack of discipline.initially,brennan suggested three possible courses of action to shake up the team and get it back on track.first,the college might fire the entire coaching staff,including ruland.given the size of ruland contract,however,this would have cost the college a very large amount of money,and seems to have seriously considered the possibility.brennan presented a second option firing all three assistant coaches.third,the college could keep the current coaching staff in place.
in late march,brennan submitted a new report,offering final proposals for consideration.this final report ultimately counseled against firing the assistant coaches to do so,brennan stated,would be akin to only cutting off appendages to the issue while the core remains.in addition to the three options mentioned above,brennan added what he said was his preferred option leave the coaching staff intact,place them on notice that there might be personnel changes as early as july if the situation did not improve,and impose as a condition of continued employment a strategic plan to improve the program both on and off the court.
brennan reports made no specific criticisms of holcomb,but did criticize the coaching staff as a whole,saying that they c a get along,that they were p oor politically,and that they d o not work as hard as they need to make this program successful.the one assistant coach who was mentioned specifically in brennan reports was,of whom brennan wrote,rob works very well with others across campus.
e.the termination decision 
the final report was presented to the president and vice presidents by conference call.petriccione and brennan say that,during this call,they supported the latter fourth proposal retaining the staff,putting them on notice,and implementing the program.nothing was decided during the initial conference call.
the decision to terminate the employment of holcomb and chiles was reached in a later conference involving the president and three vice presidents.there was no formal vote after a discussion,all four reached a collective decision.while it is apparent that the decision to keep ruland in post was largely based on financial reasons,there is no contemporaneous record of the reasons for retaining while firing holcomb and chiles.later,in deposition testimony,liguori said that he felt more drastic action was needed than that favored by brennan.rob was asked to stay,liguori says,as a connection to the rest of the program and also because the athletics director thought he was doing an adequate job which i specifically remember reading in brennan report.
the record is equivocal as to whether brennan had any role in the ultimate decision to fire holcomb and chiles and retain the college maintains that the final determination was presented to brennan as a fait accompli.according to brennan himself,however,he had,at some stage in the process,a meeting with brother liguori,at which liguori informed him that two of the assistant coaches would be fired.brennan says that he and liguori then discussed that when you make a change like this,there needed to be someone in place to keep the program moving forward,to be with the kids,to make sure that things were being attended to,and in my opinion the best person to carry that out was rob.this testimony might be read to suggest that brennan had a hand in deciding who exactly would be asked to leave.later in his deposition,brennan stated that in his role on the coaching staff was the one who was carrying out his duties to the best of his ability.in a meeting with ruland at which brennan transmitted to an angry ruland the decision reached by the president and the three vice presidents,brennan defended it fully,according to notes taken by brennan.when ruland asked him why holcomb was chosen to leave,brennan apparently replied in my evaluation holcomb and chiles have not provided you the proper level of support that you and our basketball program need to be successful emphasis added.
holcomb was asked to resign he refused,and was terminated by letter dated may.tony chiles was also asked to resign he chose to do so at some point in may.
subsequent developments 
just after the termination decisions were reached,the ncaa informed the college of the results of its investigation,indicating that the men basketball program was guilty of several secondary violations of the association rules,none of which related to the goal club.the ncaa issued its report,attributing one of the violations to,and blaming none on holcomb or chiles.the report cited for moving the personal belongings of one of the players from a dorm to garage.
though the college wanted to keep,he was offered a position as first assistant coach at marist,and he took it.the college hired three coaches to replace holcomb,chiles,and,one of whom was.
ii.the district court decision 
holcomb brought suit on january.after discovery,the college moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.holcomb iona college,civ.cm,wl july.judge mcmahon analyzed the case under the mcdonnell douglas framework,but concluded in the end that no reasonable jury could favor holcomb on the merits of his suit.even if petriccione and brennan had previously engaged in racist conduct,holcomb ha d not established any facts that link these alleged racist tendencies to the administration evaluation of the basketball program.id.at.holcomb,the district court held,had produced no evidence that his firing was the product of improper discriminatory motives.id.at.
judgment for the college was entered on july.this appeal followed.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the party moving for summary judgment is initially responsible for demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.celotex catrett,d.then the onus shifts to the party resisting summary judgment to present evidence sufficient to satisfy every element of the claim.the party is required to go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.at.quotation marks omitted see also anderson liberty lobby,d.but in assessing the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue to be tried as to any material fact,the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.anderson,at.on appeal from a decision to grant summary judgment,we review the record de novo to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist requiring a trial.morales quintel entm t,cir.
we have repeatedly expressed the need for caution about granting summary judgment to an employer in a discrimination case where,as here,the merits turn on a dispute as to the employer intent.see schwapp town of avon,cir gallo prudential residential,cir meiri dacon,cir.where an employer has acted with discriminatory intent,direct evidence of that intent will only rarely be available,so that affidavits and depositions must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial proof which,if believed,would show discrimination.gallo,at.even in the discrimination context,however,a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations to resist a motion for summary judgment.see meiri,at.
title vii of the civil rights act of,as relevant,provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual race.a.in,congress amended the statute to make clear that an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.m.an employment decision,then,violates title vii when it is based in whole or in part on discrimination.feingold new york,cir emphasis added quoting stern trs.of columbia,cir.to avoid summary judgment in an employment discrimination case,the plaintiff is not required to show that the employer proffered reasons were false or played no role in the employment decision,but only that they were not the only reasons and that the prohibited factor was at least one of the motivating factors.cronin aetna life ins,cir see also holtz,at.
holcomb has invoked the familiar framework set forth for title vii cases by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d and texas dep of community affairs burdine,d.under these cases,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.if the plaintiff does so,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate,reason for its action.id.if such a reason is provided,plaintiff may no longer rely on the presumption raised by the prima facie case,but may still prevail by showing,without the benefit of the presumption,that the employer determination was in fact the result of racial discrimination.the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.burdine,at.
for the reasons explained below,we find,first,that holcomb has established a prima facie case of discrimination,and,second,that the college has produced evidence that it acted for a reason.to that extent,we agree with the district court conclusions.unlike the district court,however,we find that plaintiff has established genuine issues of material fact as to the merits of his claim,and we therefore vacate the district court decision to grant summary judgment to the college.
prima facie case of discrimination 
the burden of establishing a prima facie case of alleged disparate treatment is not onerous.burdine,at.a plaintiff satisfies this burden if he or she introduces evidence that raises a reasonable inference that the action taken by the employer was based on an impermissible factor.holcomb must show that he belonged to a protected class that he was qualified for the position he held that he suffered an adverse employment action and that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.feingold,at.the second and third elements of holcomb prima facie case are not in question there is no dispute that holcomb was qualified to be an assistant coach of the basketball team,nor,obviously,could it be doubted that his firing was an adverse employment action.the first and fourth elements,however,require further analysis.
membership in a protected class 
holcomb alleges that he was discriminated against,not solely because of his own race,but as a result of his marriage to a black woman.this court has never ruled on the question of whether title vii applies in these circumstances.we resolve that question today,and hold that an employer may violate title vii if it takes action against an employee because of the employee association with a person of another race.
one of the first cases to address the question,ripp dobbs houses,reached the opposite conclusion.there,a white employee claimed that he was discharged because of his association with black employees.the court decided the plaintiff claim was not cognizable under the statute.it relied for this conclusion on the text of title vii itself,which prohibits discriminatory action against an individual because of such individual race.a emphasis added.on this view,title vii does not help those who suffer adverse employment action as a result of association with persons of another race.see also adams governor comm.on postsecondary,no,wl,at,dist.lexis at,rejecting a claim by a white man married to a black woman,because n either the language of the statute nor its legislative history supports a cause of action for discrimination against a person because of his relationship to persons of another race.
we reject this restrictive reading of title vii.the reason is simple where an employee is subjected to adverse action because an employer disapproves of interracial association,the employee suffers discrimination because of the employee own race.all the district judges in this circuit to consider the question,including the district court in this case,have reached that conclusion.holcomb,wl at rosenblatt bivona cohen,plaintiff has alleged discrimination as a result of his marriage to a black woman.had he been black,his marriage would not have been interracial.therefore,inherent in his complaint is the assertion that he has suffered racial discrimination based on his own race.whitney greater of adventists.the fifth,sixth,and eleventh circuits agree.stores,cir,vacated in part on other grounds by williams stores,cir title vii prohibits discrimination in employment premised on an interracial relationship.tetro elliott popham pontiac,oldsmobile,buick gmc trucks,cir holding title vii applicable to allegation that employee suffered discrimination because he had a biracial daughter parr woodmen of the world life ins,cir where a plaintiff claims discrimination based upon an interracial marriage or association,he alleges,by definition,that he has been discriminated against because of his race.
accordingly,we find that holcomb,in claiming that he suffered an adverse employment action because of his interracial marriage,has alleged discrimination as a result of his membership in a protected class under title vii.
circumstances giving rise to an inference of
