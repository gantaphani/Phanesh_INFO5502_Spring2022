this case raises the question of whether unlawful discrimination occurs when a woman is denied coverage for infertility treatments that can only be performed on women.after rochelle saks was denied coverage for certain infertility procedures under her employee health benefits plan,she sued her employer,franklin covey client sales,and its parent company,franklin covey collectively,franklin covey,claiming that the denial of coverage constituted a breach of her contractual rights and violated her civil rights under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,the pregnancy discrimination act pda,k,the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the new york human rights law,exec.law,et.the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,district judge granted franklin covey motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the lack of coverage for the contested infertility,artificial insemination,in vitro fertilization,and in utero not violate any of the federal statutes and saks state law claims were by erisa.see saks franklin covey,d.
with respect to saks title vii and pda claims,although we differ with the district court analysis in several important respects,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of franklin covey.as to the preemption of saks state law claims by erisa,we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
relevant facts 
franklin covey employed saks as a store manager from march until she resigned in october.during her tenure of employment,saks was a member of franklin covey health benefits plan the plan,which provided coverage to employees and their dependents.claims under the plan were handled through the tpa,tpa,a processing agent hired by franklin covey.
under the plan,an employee is entitled to benefits for medically necessary procedures,which are defined as a ny service required for the diagnosis or treatment of an active illness or injury that is rendered by or under the direct supervision of the attending physician.franklin covey plan franklin covey plan.the plan defines an active illness as a ny bodily sickness,disease,disorder or pregnancy.id.at.
under the plan,franklin covey employees may claim benefits for a variety of infertility products and procedures,such as ovulation kits,oral fertility drugs,penile prosthetic implants when certified by a physician to be medically necessary,and nearly all surgical infertility treatments.see id.at.examples of covered surgical infertility treatments include procedures to remedy conditions such as variococeles varicose veins in the testicles causing low sperm count,blockages of the vas deferens,endometriosis,and tubal occlusions.the plan expressly excludes coverage for s urgical impregnation procedures,including artificial insemination,fertilization or embryo and fetal implants collectively,surgical impregnation procedures,even if medically necessary.id.at.however,once pregnancy is achieved,whether by covered or uncovered means,all costs are covered.see saks,d at.
during her employment with franklin covey,saks attempted unsuccessfully to have a child with her husband.under the care of several reproductive endocrinologists,saks followed various courses of action,including the use of ovulation kits,the administration of the drug clomid in order to induce and regulate ovulation,intrauterine inseminations iuis,in vitro fertilization ivfs,the use of progesterone and estrogen,the administration of several injectable fertility drugs,such as humagon,and blood tests and ultrasounds in order to monitor the potentially harmful side effects of the drugs prescribed to her.see id.at.saks achieved pregnancy in september and again in august,but unfortunately each pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.see id.at.in april,saks also had a chemical pregnancy one marked by a hormonal change but not confirmed by an ultrasound that was not sustained.see id.at.
saks sought reimbursement from the tpa for all of the costs associated with her infertility treatments.for the purposes of the summary judgment motion,franklin covey did not dispute that infertility is an illness as defined by the plan or that surgical impregnation procedures were medically necessary to treat saks infertility problems.see id.at.the tpa refused to reimburse saks for a great many of the costs,including all of the iuis,ivfs,injectable fertility drugs,and tests necessary to monitor the potential side effects of the drugs see id.at.compensation for the iuis and ivfs was denied based on the plan express exclusion of coverage for surgical impregnation techniques.although the costs of injectable drugs are generally covered under the plan,the tpa rejected saks claims for the injectable fertility drugs and the monitoring because they were used in conjunction with the surgical impregnation procedures.see franklin covey plan clarke dep.after filing a charge against franklin covey with the eeoc,saks initiated the instant action.
ii.district court decision 
in the district court,saks alleged that franklin covey breached its contractual obligations and that the plan exclusion of coverage for surgical impregnation procedures violates the ada,title vii,the pda,and the new york human rights law.of specific relevance to this appeal,saks argued that the plan violates the pda,which prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and related medical conditions,because the plan benefits for infertility treatments are inferior to its coverage for illnesses.saks also argued that the plan discriminates on the basis of sex,in violation of title vii,because it provides incomplete coverage for surgical treatments that address female infertility but provides complete coverage for surgical procedures that remedy male infertility.in moving for summary judgment,franklin covey argued that the plan does not discriminate against infertility or women,and that,in any event,the pda does not prohibit discrimination based on infertility.in addition,franklin covey moved to dismiss saks state law claims on the basis that they are preempted by erisa.
in granting summary judgment for franklin covey,the district court determined that the plan exclusions affect male and female employees equally and thus did not violate title vii.see saks,d at.addressing the pda claim,the district court first concluded that the pda prohibits discrimination on the basis of infertility because infertility is a condition.see id.at.the district court nevertheless found that the plan does not violate the pda because it provides equal coverage for male and female employees who suffer from infertility.the district court dismissed saks state law claims as preempted by erisa and rejected saks argument that defendants had waived the preemption defense by failing to raise it in their answer.see id.at.finally,the district court dismissed saks claims based on disability discrimination.see id.at.saks has appealed from all of these rulings except the last one.

title vii and the pregnancy discrimination act 
background 
title vii prohibits employment practices that discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.this prohibition extends to discrimination in providing health insurance and other fringe benefits.see newport news shipbuilding dry dock eeoc,d.
the pregnancy discrimination act amends title vii definition of discrimination because of sex to include discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions.k.the pda further mandates that women affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all purposes,including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs,as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.id.under the pda,an otherwise inclusive plan that single s out benefits for exclusion is discriminatory on its face.newport news,at.
in challenging the district court analysis of her pda and title vii claims,saks argues that the district court applied incorrect standards in evaluating her claims and the plan discriminates on the basis of sex under title vii because it provides fewer benefits for infertile female employees than it does for infertile male employees.we agree that the district court applied incorrect standards in analyzing both the pda claim and the title vii claim.nevertheless,for the reasons explained below,we find that the plan exclusion of surgical impregnation procedures does not fall within the purview of the pda and,because it is gender neutral,does not violate title vii.
standards for pda and title vii claims 
equal access standard 
in analyzing whether the plan violates title vii,the district court adopted the equal access standard used by this court in construing the scope of the ada prohibition of discrimination based on disability.see saks,d at.in eeoc staten island savings bank,we held that an employee disabilities benefits plan that provided more benefits for physical disabilities than for mental disorders did not violate the ada,so long as mentally disabled employees had equal access to the physical disability benefits provided to their coworkers.see,cir.extending this analysis to the title vii context,the district court found that as long as both men and women receive the same benefits and are subject to the same exclusions under an employer insurance policy,the policy does not discriminate on the basis of sex.saks,d at.
the district court erred in applying the equal access standard to saks title vii claim.in general electric gilbert,the supreme court applied the equal access standard to an employee disability benefits plan that provided compensation during periods of all disabilities except pregnancy.the court found that the plan did not violate title vii because men and women had equal access to the same benefits,even if certain benefits were excluded.the court reasoned that disabilities constitute an additional risk,unique to women,and the failure to compensate them for this risk does not destroy the presumed parity of the benefits,accruing to men and women alike,which results from the facially evenhanded inclusion of risks,d emphasis added.shortly after the gilbert decision,congress enacted the pda,and,in so doing,not only overturned the specific holding in general electric gilbert,but also rejected the test of discrimination employed by the court in that case.newport news,at.accord id.at.the pda unambiguously expressed congress disapproval of both the holding and the reasoning of the court in the gilbert decision see also cal.fed.sav.loan ass guerra,d philbrook ansonia bd.of,cir,aff modified and remanded on other grounds,d.
in light of congress repudiation of the equal access standard as applied in gilbert,we conclude that this test is inapplicable to title vii claims involving sex discrimination in the provision of employee benefits packages.under title vii the proper inquiry in reviewing a sex discrimination challenge to a health benefits plan is whether conditions exist,and if so,whether exclusion of benefits for those conditions results in a plan that provides inferior coverage to one sex.see newport news,at.stating that equality in employment health benefits plans is measured by the relative comprehensiveness of coverage for men and women.
couple analysis 
saks further contends that the district court improperly endorsed a couple analysis,defined by the parties as a finding that a exclusion does not constitute sex discrimination so long as male and female employees and their respective partners receive the same health benefits when considered as a couple.franklin covey,on the other hand,maintains that the couple analysis is used regularly by courts in determining whether an employer benefits plan constitutes sex discrimination under title vii.we reject saks contention that the district court relied on the couple analysis,and find that judge mcmahon properly focused on the effect of the exclusion on employees,male and female,not on the benefits offered to the couple,the employee and his or her spouse,considered together.see saks,d at.contrary to franklin covey suggestion,moreover,we find that the supreme court decision in newport news gives us no reason to adopt the couple analysis,as defined above,as part of this circuit pda or title vii jurisprudence.
in newport news,the supreme court held that an employee health benefits plan violated title vii by covering costs for employees but excluding such costs for the spouses of employees.reasoning that this exclusion would necessarily affect only the coverage offered to the female spouses of male employees,the court found that the exclusion discriminated against male employees.see at.the court,therefore,focused on whether male and female employees received equal coverage under their health benefits packages.it did not hold,as franklin covey seems to suggest,that an exclusion would pass muster under title vii or the pda,so long as all couples received the same benefits.under franklin covey couple analysis,exclusions based on pregnancy would not violate title vii,a conclusion that has been squarely rejected by congress and the supreme court.see k newport news,at.
saks infertility discrimination claim 
saks claims that the plan violates the pda because it provides fewer benefits for infertility procedures than for treatment of other types of illnesses.the central issue with respect to this claim is a threshold one of coverage whether the pda prohibition of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and related medical conditions extends to discrimination on the basis of infertility.we have no doubt that by including the phrase related medical conditions,the statutory language clearly embraces more than pregnancy itself.see carney martin luther home,cir.the question is how much more.
every exercise in statutory construction must begin with the words of the text.see mallard united states dist.court,d auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir.the text plain meaning can best be understood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.see robinson shell oil,d the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.we have stated that the preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.auburn hous,at accord united states interlink,cir.
title vii is,at its core,a statute that prohibits discrimination because of,inter alia,an individual sex.the pda modified title vii by requiring that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions be considered discrimination because of sex.k.because reproductive capacity is common to both men and women,we do not read the pda as introducing a completely new classification of prohibited discrimination based solely on reproductive capacity.rather,the pda requires that pregnancy,and related conditions,be properly recognized as characteristics of women.
this understanding of the pda comports with the supreme court reasoning in international union johnson controls,in which the court indicated that,although discrimination based on childbearing capacity violates title vii as modified by the pda,discrimination based on fertility alone would not.see,d.we conclude that under this reasoning,for a condition to fall within the pda inclusion of pregnancy and related medical conditions as characteristics,that condition must be unique to women 
infertility is a medical condition that afflicts men and women with equal frequency.see joint app.ex.at fc stating that approximately one third of infertility problems are due to male factors,one third due to female factors,and one third due to couple factors see also cintra bentley,a pregnant pause are women who undergo fertility treatment to achieve pregnancy within the scope of title vii pregnancy discrimination act.including infertility within the pda protection as a related medical condition would result in the anomaly of defining a class that simultaneously includes equal numbers of both sexes and yet is somehow vulnerable to sex discrimination.because such a result is incompatible with the pda purpose of clarifying the definition of because of sex and the supreme court interpretation of the pda in johnson controls,we hold that infertility standing alone does not fall within the meaning of the phrase related medical conditions under the pda.thus,even if we were to agree with saks that the plan provided inferior coverage for infertility,such inferior coverage would not violate the pda 
in sum,we find that,because the exclusion of surgical impregnation procedures disadvantages infertile male and female employees equally,saks claim does not fall within the purview of the pda.
saks claim 
having concluded discrimination based on infertility alone is not cognizable under the pda,we now consider whether saks has stated a claim for sex discrimination under title vii on any other ground.saks contends that the exclusion of coverage for surgical impregnation procedures violates title vii because the actual procedure is performed on women and,therefore,the exclusion affects only female employees.thus,according to saks,the plan violates title vii by offering complete coverage for surgical infertility treatments for male employees but incomplete coverage for female employees.
in a different context the exclusion of surgeries that are performed solely on women from an otherwise comprehensive plan might arguably constitute a violation of title vii,but here we are faced with the unique circumstance of surgical impregnation procedures performed for the treatment of infertility.although the surgical procedures are performed only on women,the need for the procedures may be traced to male,female,or couple infertility with equal frequency.thus,surgical impregnation procedures may be recommended regardless of the gender of the ill patient.for example,where a male suffers from poor sperm motility or low sperm count,resulting in his infertility,his healthy female partner must undergo the surgical procedure.in addition,treatment by surgical impregnation procedures requires the participation of both the male and the female partners.because male and female employees afflicted by infertility are equally disadvantaged by the exclusion of surgical impregnation procedures,we conclude that the plan does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
the supreme court reasoning in newport news supports this conclusion.in that case,the supreme court recognized that,although a policy that excluded maternity benefits for dependent children discriminates on the basis of pregnancy,the exclusion affects male and female employees equally since both may have pregnant dependent daughters.see newport news,at.similarly,in this case,the plan exclusion of surgical impregnation procedures does not provide male employees with more comprehensive coverage of infertility treatments than female employees because the surgical procedures in question are used to treat both male and female infertility 
saks contends that,regardless of the origin of the problem necessitating the procedures,the plan exclusion effectively targets only infertile women.in support of this contention,saks makes a argument.first,she maintains that the plan implicitly restricts coverage to procedures performed directly on the ill patient.under that implicit restriction,an infertile man who sought surgical impregnation of his healthy wife as a remedy for his infertility would be denied coverage.second,saks reasons that,because,under the implicit restriction,the plan would not cover procedures performed on the infertile male employee healthy wife,the explicit exclusion of coverage for surgical impregnation procedures limits only the plan coverage for treatment of a female employee infertility 
without some evidence to support saks reading of the plan to contain the implicit restriction,her argument is simply too speculative to defeat a motion for summary judgment.see kulak city of new york,cir though we must accept as true the allegations of the party defending against the summary judgment motion,conclusory statements,conjecture or speculation by the party will not defeat summary judgment.saks has adduced no such evidence.
saks argument requires the court to assume that,if the plan did provide coverage for surgical impregnation procedures,it would refuse to cover surgical impregnation procedures to treat male infertility.there is nothing in the language of the plan to support this interpretation.the plan covers all medically necessary procedures unless specifically exempted.medically necessary procedures are defined as any service required to treat an active illness.thus,to the extent that franklin covey would consider surgical impregnation medically necessary to treat female infertility,the plain language of the plan suggests that such procedures would also be considered medically necessary to treat male infertility moreover,she does not offer any data suggesting that insurance companies that do cover surgical impregnation procedures do so only for female infertility,and not when the procedure must be performed on a healthy woman because of her partner infertility.without some evidence,saks argument is wholly speculative and,as such,is insufficient to defeat franklin covey motion for summary judgment.
because the exclusion affects a procedure that is used to treat both male and female infertility which occurs at similar rates across genders,this case is distinguishable from the authorities upon which saks relies,namely,johnson controls,and a decision by the eeoc.in johnson controls,the supreme court held that title vii was violated by an employer fetal protection policy that required women to prove their inability to become pregnant as a prerequisite to job assignments involving actual or potential exposure to lead.see at.in,the eeoc concluded that an exclusion of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices in an otherwise comprehensive health care plan violated title vii because prescription contraceptives,which are prescribed as birth control and for other medical purposes,are used solely by women.see decision of the equal employment opportunity commission.whereas these cases involved a distinction based on the capacity to become pregnant and on the exclusion of oral contraceptives,both of which disadvantage women only,the exclusion of surgical impregnation techniques limits the coverage available to infertile men and infertile women and,thus does not violate title vii.see johnson controls,at.finding gender discrimination in fetal protection policy because it classifies on the basis of gender and childbearing capacity,rather than fertility alone.
because the plan exclusion of coverage for surgical impregnation procedures limits the infertility procedures covered for male and female employees equally,that exclusion does not violate title vii 
ii.erisa preemption 
finally,saks contends that the district court erred in finding that franklin covey had not waived the defense that erisa preempts saks state contract claims where that defense was raised for the first time in franklin covey motion for summary judgment.she also argues that it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to allow defendants to amend their answer to include the erisa preemption defense after she filed a motion for summary judgment.in the alternative,for the first time on appeal,she requests leave to amend her complaint to add erisa claims.
waivability of erisa preemption 
four circuits,as well as numerous state courts,have concluded that the defense of erisa preemption in a action may be waived if not timely raised.see,wolf reliance standard life ins,cir citing s
