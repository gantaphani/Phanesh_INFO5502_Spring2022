sammy ussery brings this action pursuant to,maintaining that a team of correctional officers employed excessive force when they forcibly extracted him from his prison cell.the district court denied the officers motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.the officers appeal and,for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the cell extraction at the center of this case occurred on july.at that time,ussery was incarcerated at bertie correctional institution in windsor,north carolina,where the appellants david mansfield and officers james dunlow and timothy ruffin were employed.the parties agree that the correctional officers,supervised by mansfield,forcibly removed ussery from his cell,but they dispute many facts involved in the cell extraction.we consider the facts in the light most favorable to ussery,the.see pbm products,llc mead johnson,cir.
ussery contends that he and mansfield had an antagonistic relationship,in part because of racial tension.he maintains that correctional officers had searched or tossed his cell numerous times in the days immediately preceding the extraction,but never found any weapons or other contraband.on the morning of july,mansfield approached ussery cell and ordered him to exit.ussery,fearing that his cell would be ransacked,refused to do so.in response,mansfield shot a burst of pepper spray into ussery cell.ussery still would not leave the cell.
mansfield then assembled an extraction team of five correctional officers,including officers dunlow and ruffin.a sixth officer videotaped the extraction,pursuant to prison policy.mansfield told the extraction team that ussery had a weapon and had threatened to harm anyone who entered his cell.ussery maintains he made no such threat,and apparently,no weapon was ever found.
mansfield ordered ussery cell unlocked,and the extraction team entered and restrained ussery on the floor.according to ussery,members of the extraction team then beat him repeatedly in the head and face with batons,punches,and kicks he maintains that mansfield kicked and stomped on him.eventually the extraction team cuffed ussery hands behind his back,shackled his feet together,and carried him out of his cell holding him by the cuffs and shackles in a position ussery characterizes as hogtied.at least one witness reported seeing blood on the floor,marking the path from ussery cell to the holding cage,to which the officers took him.in the holding cage,ussery was belligerent and initially resisted efforts to clean him up.
the video of this incident depicts events consistent with ussery account of the incident in some respects.as the district court noted,the viewer of the video can see that there is a disturbance in ussery cell during the extraction that someone begins to punch ussery,but it is unclear which guard is doing so that a t one point,the movement of mansfield body suggests that mansfield may be kicking ussery that ussery is cuffed or shackled and carried with his body facing toward the ground by the shackles that he appears bloody and has facial injuries after the extraction and that he is verbally aggressive in the holding cage.but as the court also noted,a viewer can not discern additional details about the extraction because mansfield stood in front of the camera,obstructi ng the view of the cell,during most of the extraction.
later in the day of the extraction,officers transported ussery to bertie county memorial hospital for emergency medical treatment.there,doctors prescribed ussery morphine for his pain and used antibiotic ointment and wound adhesives to treat his contusions.ussery maintains that a s a direct and proximate result of the officers beating,he suffered severe lacerations above his right eye and behind his left ear and extensive bruising of his head,neck,face,chest,and hands.he further maintains that m edical records indicate that as a result of his injuries,he suffered increased bilateral hearing loss,neck pain,loss of vision in his right eye,chronic swelling and loss of feeling in his hands and knee,and recurring migraines,causing him physical and emotional pain and suffering,and disability.
about five months after the extraction,the north carolina department of corrections requested that the state bureau of investigation conduct an inquiry into the possible inappropriate use of force by correctional staff during this cell extraction.the investigators were ultimately not able to reach a definitive determination as to whether excessive force was used,but noted that the behavior of the correctional officers on the videotape appears too aggressive for the situation and would be excessive force.the district attorney involved in the state investigation of this incident wrote that mansfield apparent blocking of the cell door during the video was disturbing and precluded the state from investigating this matter fully.she concluded that b ecause of the position of the camera operator,this has become a situation where it is the inmate version versus the officers version of events.
acting pro se,ussery filed this action,advancing eighth amendment excessive force and claims.the complaint survived a frivolity review pursuant to.thereafter,the north carolina prisoner legal services undertook representation of ussery in this matter and filed an amended complaint.
in response to ussery amended complaint,the officers admit that they forcibly extracted him from his cell when pepper spray proved insufficient to compel him to exit that he was escorted out of his cell by the extraction team and that he received medical treatment following the extraction.the officers,however,deny kicking or punching ussery during the extraction.they contend that he suffered nothing more than de minimis injuries.to support that contention,they offer the affidavit of a doctor long employed by the north carolina division of prisons.he opined,based on his examination of the prison records,not an examination of ussery himself,that ussery incurred minor injuries including abrasions,contusions,and lacerations,which healed completely without any lasting ill effects.on the basis of this affidavit,the officers moved for summary judgment,asserting entitlement to qualified immunity.ussery opposed the on his account of his injuries,statements from some officers and inmates,his medical records,the video,and the report of the state bureau of investigation.
the district court granted the officers motion as to the claim,but denied the motion as to the excessive force claim against mansfield and officers dunlow and ruffin the officers timely noted this appeal.
the supreme court has explained that the defense shields government agents from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.behrens pelletier,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.as the parties agree,the law clearly established at the time of the extraction governs the entitlement to qualified immunity here.further,they agree that norman taylor,cir en banc,provides the legal framework for determination of that question.
in norman,this court held that absent the most extraordinary circumstances,a plaintiff can not prevail on an eighth amendment excessive force claim if his injury is de minimis.id.at.the supreme court expressly abrogated norman in wilkins gaddy.the court held in wilkins that a n inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to escape without serious injury.id.at.we have subsequently concluded,however,that where the alleged use of force occurred prior to wilkins,a defendant entitlement to qualified immunity turns on whether that force was objectively reasonable in view of the clearly established law at the time of the alleged event,the law as set forth in norman.see hill crum,cir.
to prevail,then,an inmate like ussery,seeking relief for excessive force deployed before the issuance of wilkins in,must establish either that he sustained more than de minimis injuries or that the defendants use of force was of a sort
