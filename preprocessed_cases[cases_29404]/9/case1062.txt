we heard oral argument on december,and entered an order on january,vacating the district court preliminary injunction and indicating that an opinion would follow to explain the court holding.we now write to clarify that,because plaintiff claims are under both potentially applicable statutes of limitations,the district court erred as a matter of law in granting the requested injunction.
background 
the following section is based in substantial part on the recitation of facts from the district court february,decision and order.see somoza new york city dep t of,d.
factual background 
plaintiff received special educational services from the doe from preschool until the january,as required by the idea.in accordance with her individualized education plan iep,plaintiff attended and graduated from high school in the new york city public schools.from through,at the direction of the doe,plaintiff was evaluated by a special education expert,andrea blau,who assisted in the monitoring of plaintiff progress and made recommendations to the doe regarding possible accommodations to address plaintiff specific educational needs.
after her graduation from high school in june,plaintiff began attending a program run by the doe at queens occupational training center queens.mary mother and advocate,to whom plaintiff has delegated authority for educational dissatisfied with the queens program and lodged complaints with the doe.in response,the doe authorized blau to evaluate plaintiff and to recommend and develop an appropriate educational program.the doe and plaintiff developed a new iep,and in november she was placed in an individualized,customized program developed and administered by blau the blau program.the doe agreed to fund the blau program,without competitive bidding,at an annual cost of for the remainder of the academic year as well as the and academic years.plaintiff appeared to make significant improvement during her time in the blau program,and she and her mother reported their satisfaction with the program.blau noted these improvements and also concluded,in early,that plaintiff had been denied a fape during her approximately thirteen years in the public schools 
as of june,the end of the school year in which she reached the age of,plaintiff was no longer eligible for the doe to fund her education.see a a educ.law stating that the doe is not required to fund such educational services for a person after the age of or the receipt of a high school diploma.plaintiff mother contacted the doe to request an additional year of funding of the blau program.although plaintiff was no longer eligible for such funding under the terms of the governing statutes,the doe agreed to fund the blau program until june on the condition that plaintiff,through her mother,sign a proposed stipulation and release the agreement.plaintiff mother signed the agreement,which included the following provision releasing the doe from any liability for claims that plaintiff did not receive a free and public education under the idea 
i mary somoza individually and on behalf of alba somoza in consideration of an extension of one school year of services as outlined above do hereby release and discharge the defendant new york city board of education,also known as the new york city department of education from any and all claims alleged,and all claims rights of actions that were or could have been alleged against any of the released parties based on any act,omission,event or occurrence from the beginning of the world up to and including the date of the execution of this release,including,without limitation,any claims that alba somoza did not receive was not offered a free and appropriate public education,as well as all claims for costs,expenses and attorney fees.
under the terms of the agreement,funding for the blau program was to expire on june.before the expiration date,plaintiff mother made another request to the doe for an extension of the funding.the doe denied that request in january.
procedural background 
in march,plaintiff mother filed an administrative action on plaintiff behalf,contending that plaintiff had been denied a fape from preschool until she began the blau program and requesting that the doe provide funding for the blau program for two additional years as compensatory education.the doe responded by filing a motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiff,through her mother,had waived any such claims in the agreement and that,in any event,her claims were untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.before the impartial hearing officer iho,plaintiff mother argued that the release contained in the agreement was not enforceable because the agreement had been signed under duress and because a waiver of fape claims is void as against public policy plaintiff administrative claim was dismissed by the iho who found that t he doe has complied in good faith and performed its part of the a greement and the a greement is clearly binding the parent has accepted the services of the a greement without protest.the iho concluded that plaintiff mother had executed a knowing and voluntary waiver of any right to additional educational services granted the doe motion to dismiss and denied plaintiff request for relief.
shortly thereafter,plaintiff filed the instant action in the district court,seeking to enjoin the doe from terminating its funding of the blau program.in july,judge marrero granted plaintiff a temporary restraining order prohibiting the doe from terminating funding of the blau program.see somoza new york city dep t of,civ,wl july.one month later,the parties appeared before judge richard holwell for a hearing on plaintiff request for a preliminary injunction while her administrative appeal was pending.judge holwell granted plaintiff the requested preliminary injunction.
plaintiff also pursued an appeal of the decision of the iho through the state administrative process,arguing that the release was not valid or enforceable.in august,the state review officer sro affirmed the decision of the iho,observing that 
the doe obligations under the idea to plaintiff ceased at the end of the school year,which was the school year in which she turned.
plaintiff has already received one school year of educational services after her eligibility under idea expired.the parties have worked cooperatively over the past four years and the doe has funded an extensive program of services for plaintiff.i note that according to plaintiff report that the consultant program has been provided at a cost of approximately per year.
the sro concluded that plaintiff claims that she was denied a fape were barred by the statute of limitations of the idea and that plaintiff had not presented a valid basis for tolling the statute.according to the sro,plaintiff claims accrued no later than the end of the academic year,when blau expressed her opinion to plaintiff mother that plaintiff had not received a fape during the relevant period.because plaintiff had not filed a claim based on the alleged denials of a fape until march,her claims were barred as untimely.the sro did not reach the question of whether the release was otherwise enforceable.
after the sro decision was issued,judge marrero held a bench trial on the merits of plaintiff claims and on the affirmative defenses raised by the,that plaintiff claims were and that,in any event,she had waived any idea claim in the agreement.at the conclusion of the trial,the court filed a decision and order february order confirming and extending the preliminary injunction originally entered by judge holwell.somoza,d.the court concluded that plaintiff claims were not under any of the potentially applicable statute of limitations periods because her claims were not justiciable at the time they accrued the agreement was not a knowing and voluntary waiver of plaintiff rights and that the balance of hardships favored plaintiff.as an initial matter,the district court found that plaintiff claims accrued at the end of the academic year,when blau concluded that plaintiff had been denied a fape during the thirteen years before the blau program was implemented.somoza,d at.the court then concluded that plaintiff claims were not.id.at.the court reasoned that any suit filed while plaintiff was participating in the blau program would not be ripe because plaintiff was receiving the remedy for the deficiencies in her earlier education.id.at.on this basis,the district court determined that the limitations period on plaintiff claims did not begin to run until january,when the doe denied her request for an additional year of funding.id.because plaintiff filed her request with the administrative agency on march,her claims were not barred under any of the arguably applicable limitations periods.id.at.the district court did not rule on the merits of plaintiff fape claims,but instead remanded the case to the iho for a determination on the merits of plaintiff fape claims and extended the preliminary injunction entered by judge holwell until the iho ruling.the district court further ordered the clerk of the court to close the case.id.at.
the doe filed this timely appeal from the district court february order entering the injunction.before our court,the doe argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.specifically,the doe contends that the district court improperly concluded that plaintiff fape claims were not and the district court erroneously found that the waiver of these claims was not valid.in response,plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,arguing that our court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court order.
following oral argument,we entered an order reversing the february order of the district court and dissolving the injunction on the basis that plaintiff claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.we set forth our reasons below.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see,corning picvue,cir.the district court necessarily abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law.see zervos verizon new york,cir noting that an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.we review legal conclusions,such as the application of a statute of limitations,de novo.see,brennan nassau county,cir.
jurisdiction 
pursuant to,our court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.a final order is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d citation omitted.the requisite indica of finality is that there be some manifestation by the district court that it intends the decision to be its final act in the case.nelson unum life ins.of america,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in the instant case,the district court decided that the doe affirmative defenses were without merit,remanded the case to the agency,and ordered the clerk to close the case.somoza,d at.such a decision constitutes a final order for the purposes of.see nelson,at concluding that an order was final because we could state with assurance that no further proceeding will occur in the district court regarding any matter touching on the subject of this appeal accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review the district court order.
ii.preliminary injunction 
congress enacted the idea to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs d a see also frank bd.of educ.of hyde park,cir.to that end,the idea guarantees that a child with a disability receives a fape from as early as age three until at least age eighteen see a a providing idea funding to states to ensure that eligible children receive a fape.under new york law,a child is no longer entitled to the protections and benefits of the idea,honig doe,d,after the age of and does not have a right to demand a public education beyond that age,wheaton,cir.
as of the end of the academic year,when plaintiff reached the age of,the doe was no longer required to fund the blau program or otherwise provide a fape to plaintiff.to its credit,the doe extended its funding of the blau program for an additional year as a matter of grace.plaintiff now requests additional funding for the blau program as compensatory educational services,see note ante,on the basis that she was denied a fape for the entirety of her thirteen years in public schools.
there are two limitations periods that could potentially be applied to plaintiff claim the period applicable at the time that plaintiff claims accrued and the limitations period applicable at the time that plaintiff brought her suit because we conclude that plaintiff claims would be untimely under either limitations period,we need not address which period applies.
an idea claim accrues on the date that a plaintiff or his parent knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint.b b the parties agreed,and the district court found,that plaintiff mother knew or should have known about the alleged denials of a fape during the academic point at which plaintiff mother first observed her daughter rapid improvement in the blau program and that blau,an expert in the field of special education,expressed the opinion that plaintiff had not previously received a fape.somoza,d at.plaintiff complaint was filed in march.taking june as the latest date at which plaintiff knew about the alleged denials of a fape plaintiff claims are even under a limitations period.
the district court came to a different conclusion based on its understanding that plaintiff suit was not ripe for adjudication until early in,when it became clear to mary somoza that her daughter needed to remain in the blau program beyond june,and that the doe would not continue to fund it past that time.somoza,d at.according to the district court reasoning,there was no justiciable controversy between the parties until june because,by funding the blau program,the doe was providing somoza with precisely the remedy that she would otherwise have sought at an impartial hearing.id.at.
we agree with the district court that the limitations period on an idea claim does not begin to run until the claim is ripe for adjudication.somoza,d at i t would be inconsistent with basic limitations principles for a limitations period to commence before a party may file suit.quoting bay area laundry and dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of california,d see also trw andrews,d noting that,in bay area laundry,the court determined that a statute of limitations could not commence to run on one day while the right to sue ripened on a later day unless the statute indicates otherwise polanco drug enforcement,cir applying bay area laundry to claim for procedurally deficit forfeiture.we disagree,however,with the district court application of this doctrine.the district court concluded,without explanation,that plaintiff claims presented an exception to the general rule that claims are ripe once a cause of action accrues.somoza,d at.the court adopted plaintiff view that,at the time her claims accrued,there was no dispute between the parties because there wa
