background 
on november,the district superintendent,gordon,issued a memorandum the policy memorandum explaining the district policy regarding the reporting by staff members of student pregnancies.it advise s staff members that a student communications to one of them that a student is pregnant is not a communication protected by a legal privilege,but rather may trigger legal reporting obligations.compl.ex.a mem.re reporting student pregnancy.it states that a staff member who becomes aware of a student pregnancy should report it immediately to the school social worker.then,
t he social worker should encourage the student to voluntarily disclose her pregnancy to her parents and,if the student represents that she will inform her parents,confirm that such a disclosure was made.if the student refuses to voluntarily inform her parents,the social worker should offer to meet with the parents and the student to help the student to inform her parents offer to inform the student parents without the student being present.if the student continues to insist on keeping the information from her parents,the social worker should inform the student that will inform the parents.after consultation with the principal and superintendent,the social worker should inform the parents.
the policy memorandum further provides that where statutory rape or incest is suspected,the social worker should inform the principal and superintendent immediately so that legally required reporting can be made to the appropriate authorities.id.the policy memorandum forbids any member of the staff from informing any other person of a student pregnancy,but it advises staff members to inform students that conversations about student pregnancies will not be held in confidence.id.

ii.standing 
t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements there must be an injury in fact,an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.every plaintiff seeking to establish standing must prove these three elements,even where,as here,he or she asserts standing that is,he or she is attempting to resolve the rights of third parties who are not parties to the litigation but whose rights are likely to be diluted or adversely affected,craig boren,d quoting griswold connecticut,d,by the statute or rule being challenged.see singleton wulff,d applying the injury in fact requirement necessary to establish a case or controversy to the plaintiffs doctors seeking medicaid payments even though they were asserting the constitutional rights of third parties patients claiming that they had a constitutional right to the abortions griswold,at.concluding that plaintiff doctors convictions on state criminal charges of disseminating birth control advice constituted injury to them sufficient to support standing for them to challenge the state statutes they had violated,even though they were asserting the constitutional rights of privacy of the persons to whom they had given the advice.
at issue here is the plaintiffs ability to establish the requisite injury in fact,the first of the three constitutional elements.the plaintiffs assert that they can show such an injury in fact because complying with the policy memorandum requires social workers to risk civil liability and place their licensure in jeopardy for violating their clients constitutional and state statutory rights,while not complying with it requires all district staff to face the threat of discipline and possible termination.pls.br.at.
having examined the policy memorandum,we agree with the district court that it poses no actual or imminent harm to the plaintiffs.
first,the plaintiffs offer little more than conclusory statements to support their assertion that social workers risk civil liability and their professional license by complying with the policy memorandum.while new york law provides that a licensed master social worker or a licensed clinical social worker shall not be required to disclose a communication made by a client,a,and a breach of the privilege of professional confidence is actionable as a tort,doe community health,dep t,the plaintiffs have not shown that there is imminent danger either that they will disclose confidential communications to parents,the p
