murphy lewis lewis brought this action against the city of boston city,claiming that the city first discharged him and then failed to hire him for a newly created position because of his race in violation of.laws ch,and because of his public statements regarding inadequate funding for the city music programs in violation of the first amendment.the district court granted summary judgment in the city favor.we affirm.
lewis,an male,has been employed by the city in the boston public schools bps from through the present,and served as music director from through august.the city initially employed lewis as a music instructor from to august,at which time the city appointed him as acting music director on january,the city appointed him as permanent music director.as music director,lewis was responsible for implementing and developing policy relating to music education,overseeing music curriculum development,supporting music teachers,conducting inventories of musical instruments,organizing the martin luther king,celebration,and serving as liaison between the bps and various music organizations in the city.
the music director was one of ten senior program directors in the department of curriculum and instructional practices curriculum department,all of whom reported to the director of the department,sid smith smith,a white male.smith reported directly to timothy knowles knowles,deputy superintendent for teaching and learning.in,of these ten directors,four were,one was asian,and five were white.
during his tenure as music director,lewis was a public advocate for increased funding for music education,particularly instrumental music instruction in a november,article,the boston herald reported that lewis desired to expand instrumental music instruction and that to do so he proposed hiring new music instructors to travel among elementary and middle schools.sometime in,lewis reduced this proposal to writing and shared it with a city councilor.the proposal stressed that the city was in noncompliance with its own arts policy by not offering instrumental music instruction.to come within compliance,the proposal recommended that the city hire twenty new teachers at an approximate cost of,as part of a revived itinerant music program.lewis did not speak to his supervisors before sharing his written proposal with the city councilor.according to lewis,shortly thereafter,smith told lewis that the superintendent,thomas payzant,was very upset with lewis for speaking to the city councilor smith also testified that he expressed his concern that lewis should think about whether he was violating established protocol by talking to city council members about matters without first consulting payzant.
lewis was also quoted in a february,boston globe article.the city press office had directed the boston globe reporter to lewis.the article reported that instruments lay dormant in a warehouse,many of which had rotted in the eight years since funding for instrumental music instruction was eliminated from the city school budget.the article did not reveal,and lewis did not know,the source of this information.lewis was quoted as stating that the school system was trying to inform teachers of the existence and location of the instruments.the article also discussed lewis desire to revive the itinerant music program.lewis discussed the article with smith and payzant,and neither of them expressed any negative comments.in march,with payzant present,lewis addressed a city council hearing,discussing the need for greater funding for music programs.
in late spring of,the city instituted a reduction in force to fund transition programs in literacy and mathematics,and to prepare students for the impending massachusetts comprehensive assessment system tests mcas.smith decided,with the approval of knowles and payzant,to eliminate the music director position and to spread lewis duties to other positions.the reorganization contemplated the creation of a new position,which consolidated the bulk of the music director duties with the school responsibilities held by the director of the roland hayes division of music,who would report directly to knowles,rather than to smith,as lewis did.the arts director would assume the remaining responsibilities.by letter dated may,payzant notified lewis that the city was eliminating his position due to budget cuts.in addition to eliminating lewis position,the city terminated other relatively,supervisory employees.
the city posted the revised roland hayes position three times.qualified candidates were required to have a master degree and management experience.the city formed a screening committee that reviewed applications and selected qualified candidates for interviews.a diverse group,the screening committee consisted of three,one hispanic,and one white.although lewis did not have a master degree,he applied for the position,but was not selected for an interview.instead,the city selected four candidates for interviews,including three,all with the requisite master degree and management experience.the city did not hire any of the candidates,the position,and decided to keep greg gozzola,the teacher who had been filling in for winfrey,as acting director of roland hayes for the following academic year.some of the responsibilities formerly held by lewis were assumed by the arts director,kathy tosolini tosolini,a white female,and the remainder,such as the martin luther king,celebration,were assumed by other employees.
in,the city the position,but reduced the responsibilities tosolini and others continued to cover those functions.even though lewis still did not have a master degree the city mailed to him a written invitation to interview and called him to confirm on the morning it was scheduled.lewis failed to appear for the interview,claiming that he never received the invitation and that by the time he received the call,he had a prior commitment.his interview was not rescheduled.ultimately,the city offered the position to an,but he declined.the position was,and remained unfilled at the time of the district court summary judgment ruling.
lewis filed this civil suit against the city,alleging that,by eliminating his position and failing to hire him for the roland hayes position,the city retaliated against him for his public statements in violation of the first amendment and because of his race in violation of.laws.ch.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city,finding that lewis had adduced insufficient facts to support either claim.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to lewis,the nonmoving party,and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.
to prevail on his chapter claim,lewis must prove that he is a member of a protected class,he suffered harm as a result of the city adverse employment action,and the city harbored discriminatory animus,which was the determinative cause of the adverse action.weber community teamwork.because lewis relies upon circumstantial evidence of discrimination,we employ a familiar,paradigm first set out in mcdonnell douglas green,d.abramian president fellows of harvard.lewis bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination doing so creates a presumption of discrimination.id.at.the burden then shifts to the city to rebut the presumption by advancing a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.the city obligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion,as the burden of persuasion remains with lewis.id.at.if the city meets its burden,the presumption of discrimination disappears.the burden returns to lewis to establish that the basis of the city decisions was unlawful discrimination,by adducing evidence that the reasons given by the city for its actions were mere pretexts to hide such discrimination.id.at.
elimination of the music director 
we first decide whether lewis established a prima facie case,mindful that the purpose of doing so is to eliminate the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for an employment decision,from which a fact finder might reasonably conclude that the employer made its decision because of race.id.at.as lewis was terminated as part of a reduction in force,he must show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a member of a protected class under chapter he performed his job satisfactorily he was terminated and the city did not treat race neutrally in making its decision to terminate him or retained personnel outside of his protected class in the same position.leblanc great am.ins,cir wheatley am,it is our practice to apply federal case law construing the federal statutes in interpreting.
it is undisputed that lewis has established the first three elements the battleground then is in the fourth prong.on appeal,for the first time,lewis attempts to demonstrate that the city did not treat race neutrally in deciding whom to terminate by arguing that the were statistically out of line with the overall racial makeup of the bps workforce.see,lipchitz raytheon,holding that statistical evidence may support an inference that a particular decision was made because of discriminatory animus smith college mcad,in a proper case,gross statistical disparities alone may constitute prima facie proof of a practice of discrimination.because lewis failed to raise this theory below,we deem it forfeited higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir a lthough the court of appeals affords de novo review to orders granting summary judgment,it will not reverse such an order on the basis of arguments or theories that were not made in the trial court.utica mutual ins.weathermark investments,cir see generally,wright miller,supra note,at.lewis also contends that only black senior program directors were laid off,from which a jury could infer that the city targeted him because of race.but lewis was the only senior program director in the curriculum department to be terminated the remaining three senior program directors retained their positions.we fail to see how a jury could reasonably infer that the city targeted lewis due to his race merely because he was the one senior program director,out of ten,who was terminated.leblanc,at we question whether a company can be said not to treat age neutrally as a matter of law merely because two of the three people it discharges pursuant to a reduction in force belong to the protected class.a sample of three is a small number from which to draw deductions of this sort.
lewis also relies on the city retention of the other senior program directors who were not in his protected class lewis points to no convincing evidence that shows how the positions held by the other directors may reasonably be considered the same as the position that lewis held.lewis himself testified that there no comparable position to his former position,unless the city were to make a position of director of fine arts,now,that position does exist in any event,the record emphasizes the differences,not the similarities,between the positions.each senior program director was responsible for a specific academic discipline english,which included two directors one for elementary and one for secondary education,math,science,history,world languages,music,art,physical education,and health.the duties and responsibilities of each of the directors were defined by the specific academic discipline to which they were assigned.within an assigned discipline,the director established and implemented performance standards,curriculum guidelines,and professional development programs,and supported teachers throughout the bps.smith also testified,uncontroverted by lewis,that the city disregards seniority when instituting a reduction in force within the curriculum department because the city does not view the senior program director positions as being of similar character.
lewis makes much of the fact that the arts and music director positions had the same personnel grade and salary and were listed on a single job posting.although true,lewis ignores significant differences.the arts director covered three subject areas visual arts,theater,and dance.among other things,she supported art teachers,established and implemented the arts and education policy for the bps,coordinated programs with the museum of fine arts,and coordinated and other programs not coordinated by the music director.on this record,no fact finder could reasonably conclude that any of the other directors were in the same position as lewis.
relying upon flebotte dow jones,d,lewis attempts to avoid our inevitable conclusion by asserting that the city delegation of his duties to other individuals not in his protected class amounted to retaining individuals in the same position.we disagree.the purpose of the prima facie case is to identify those circumstances where the employer actions,if left unexplained,are more likely than not based on unlawful discrimination.in the typical reduction in force case,the employer actions have already been explained,as the reduction in force is itself a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the.and as recognized by the district court,in a reduction in force situation,a company generally reorganizes its workforce and reassigns responsibilities to reduce headcount and save money.lewis city of boston,no.civ,wl,at.march.merely demonstrating that,as a result of the reduction in force,the employer consolidated positions or allocated duties of discharged employees to other existing employees does not itself raise a reasonable inference that the employer harbored discriminatory animus toward any one employee.accepting lewis argument would render meaningless the fourth requirement of the prima facie case under leblanc.id.we are careful not to suggest,however,that an employer may mask unlawful discrimination by simply transferring all of an employee duties to another employee during a reduction in force.rather,we are saying that the employee must come forward with something more than evidence of the inevitable transfer of his or her responsibilities to existing employees.this lewis has failed to do 
finally,lewis for the first time contends that his position was not,in fact,eliminated,reasoning that the duties of the roland hayes director were merely added to the position he formerly held.this argument is unavailing.the evidence in the record,adduced by both the city and lewis,leaves beyond question that the city eliminated the music director position from the curriculum department and consolidated the duties of that position with that of the former roland hayes director and the arts director.there simply is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether his position was eliminated.we hold therefore that lewis failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.
even if we were to assume arguendo that lewis satisfied his prima facie burden,we would still affirm.the city proffered a number of legitimate reasons why it chose lewis position for elimination during its search for additional funds for transition programs in literacy and mathematics and to prepare students for the mcas tests.smith,who made the decision,testified that the music director position was the natural candidate for elimination in his department because music was not a priority subject area aside from english,the arts was the only subject area that had two senior program directors and the duties of the music director could be easily transferred to the arts director and the roland hayes position,which would result in one less person doing the work.in addition,transferring duties to the roland hayes position and creating a new director position that was under the supervision of the deputy superintendent would achieve the city goal of raising the status and visibility of the roland hayes position.the city reasons sufficiently dispel any taint of racial discrimination.
beyond the thin evidence lewis relies upon to satisfy his prima facie case,lewis presented no evidence to support a reasonable inference that any of the reasons given by the city were false.that evidence does not by itself even suggest that the reasons advanced by the city were a pretext for discrimination.the city decision to discharge lewis is not actionable under chapt
