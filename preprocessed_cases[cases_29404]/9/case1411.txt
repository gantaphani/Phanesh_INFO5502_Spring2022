derrick taylor,currently an inmate within the connecticut state prison system,appeals pro se and in forma pauperis from a grant of summary judgment by the united states district court for the district of connecticut squatrito,dismissing his civil rights suit brought under.defendants,in whose favor summary judgment was granted,are captain rodriguez,office of the deputy commissioner,remi acosta,warden of garner correctional institution,captain shipman,captain of security of garner correctional institution,lieutenant migdalia soto,disciplinary hearing officer,and captain meyers,close custody unit manager.captain meyers is not a party to this appeal.
taylor alleges various prison officials deprived him of his rights by placing him in close custody,a housing status involving severely restricted privileges,for an indefinite period of time.when taylor filed his appellate brief,he remained in close custody.key among his claims is his contention that due process was denied him in an april hearing because the notice containing the charges against him and the procedures followed at the hearing were insufficient to protect his constitutional rights.
in denying plaintiff motion for summary judgment,the district court found plaintiff proffer of proof inadequate to determine whether he had a liberty interest in being free from close custody.the court further stated that plaintiff provided very little information regarding the conditions in the general prison population that would allow it to make a finding that close custody constituted an atypical and significant hardship within the meaning of sandin conner,d.in granting defendants for summary judgment,the district court also concluded that taylor received all the process due him had a liberty interest existed.because we disagree with some of these conclusions,we remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
in april taylor was incarcerated at the garner correctional institution in connecticut.on april of that year,he was notified that a hearing would be held to determine whether he was a member of a security risk group that constituted an institutional safety threat.a safety threat member is an inmate whose association with a security risk group jeopardizes the safety of the institution.the notice served on taylor stated that the reasons for the hearing were past admission to outside law enforcement about involvement with latin tension in involving gang by independent confidential informants.
taylor filed a freedom of information act foia request on april seeking disclosure of statements and evidence provided by confidential informants to be used against him.plaintiff foia request was denied on april because the information sought was exempt from disclosure.that same day,plaintiff was placed on administrative detention status pending the outcome of the hearing that was held on april.
migdalia soto presided at the hearing,during which taylor again requested the identity of the confidential informants and insisted they testify.the hearing officer denied the request to protect the informants safety.she also denied plaintiff request for a continuance to obtain a private attorney.although taylor refused an advocate at the hearing,one had previously been appointed for him and was present.
taylor testified and presented witness statements obtained by his advocate.the statements presented concerned an unrelated prison disciplinary incident.soto ultimately determined that,based on the confidential information and an incident that occurred in july at hartford correctional center,no doubt existed that plaintiff was still involved with the latin kings.as a result,taylor was designated a safety threat member of a security risk group.
such members at garner are housed in the close custody unit,designed to segregate inmates identified as safety threats while providing programs and incentives to sever their ties to the security risk group,in this case the latin kings.the program begins with an inmate assignment to phase i,the most restrictive close custody status.inmates are then evaluated for acceptance into phases ii and iii,each involving additional privileges.upon completion of phase iii,an inmate may be considered for release into the general population.
an important condition of advancement from phase i to phase ii is that an inmate sign a letter of intention to sever ties with all security risk groups.taylor refused to sign such a letter.as a result,he remained in phase i close custody from april at least until he filed his appellate brief on january,even though hearing officer soto recognized that he had formally renounced his membership in the latin kings on march.she further acknowledged taylor insistence at the april hearing that he no longer had any contact with that group.
inmates who do not complete the close custody program within months of entering the unit may be transferred to northern correctional institution,where their security level is increased.after less than five months,taylor was in fact transferred to northern in september,and placed in more restrictive administrative segregation.he has since graduated from the program at northern,been returned to garner,and transferred yet again to northern,although the reason for this last transfer is not clear from the record.
after unsuccessfully pursuing various appeals and grievances within the prison system,taylor in september brought this suit pro se pursuant to.his complaint alleges he should have been accorded full due process rights at the april hearing he should have been notified of the actual charges against him the hearing officer should hold a higher rank than lieutenant assignment to close custody should be for a definite period of time security risk group affiliation is too vague a charge to defend against all lost good time credit should be returned and forcing inmates to sign a renunciation as a condition of release from close custody violates their fifth amendment rights.although not framed in the complaint as a separate cause of action,plaintiff further asserts his first amendment right to free exercise of his religion orthodox judaism was infringed by placement in close custody.
after the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss on december,both sides moved for summary judgment.taylor also moved in march for a temporary restraining order to require defendants to remove him immediately from close custody.
in a decision dated august,and entered the following day,the district court denied taylor motion for summary judgment on the due process claims,finding that plaintiff provided insufficient evidence to make a threshold showing that his confinement in close custody constitutes an atypical and significant hardship.with respect to plaintiff contention that a classification hearing officer should hold a rank higher than lieutenant,the district court found plaintiff submitted nothing to suggest soto did not fairly review the evidence at the hearing.the trial court also dismissed the first amendment free exercise claim because taylor had another action pending on this issue.finally,it dismissed taylor fifth amendment claim on two grounds first,with no proof indicating that signing the renunciation form was to be accompanied by miranda warnings,the statements could not be used against him second,plaintiff lacked standing to assert a fifth amendment claim absent an imminent threat of prosecution.
the district court then considered defendants for summary judgment,assuming for purpose of the motion only that taylor confinement in close custody constituted an atypical and significant hardship as required by sandin.it ruled that taylor was provided with adequate notice of the charges against him and that defendants decision to place him in close custody was supported by some evidence.accordingly,summary judgment was granted to defendants.taylor motion for a temporary restraining order was denied as moot.
discussion 
taylor appeals the grant of summary judgment to defendants,which we review de novo.see wright coughlin,cir.such relief is appropriate only if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there exists no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
i taylor due process claims 
a claim alleging procedural due process violations must show that plaintiff enjoyed a protected interest,and defendants deprivation of that interest occurred without due process of law.see tellier fields,cir.we begin by addressing the second element.for if the district court correctly concluded that taylor received all the process due him,then taylor showing of a protected liberty interest would not save his cause of action from dismissal.see welch bartlett,cir.
adequacy of process accorded taylor 
the district court determined that conditions in close custody are similar to those in administrative segregation.plaintiff does not challenge this conclusion,and in fact asked in his complaint that close custody be recognized as administrative segregation.the supreme court requires that,assuming the existence of a liberty interest,a prisoner placed in administrative segregation be provided some notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.hewitt helms,d accord rodriguez phillips,cir.
in her affidavit in support of summary judgment,hearing officer soto states that she conducted the hearing in accordance with connecticut department of correction administrative directive security risk groups and administrative directive code of penal discipline plaintiff does not urge that any other regulation should have been controlling.under these state regulations,connecticut state prisoners being considered for transfer to close custody must receive notice of the charges against them at least hours prior to the hearing,have a meeting with an advocate hours before the hearing,and if the inmate requests such assistance,a thorough investigation by the advocate,an opportunity to appear,present evidence and call witnesses.the record of the hearing must contain a written statement including the offense charged,the plea of the accused inmate,the disposition of witnesses,a summary of witness testimony,the finding and the reasons for it,the sanction s imposed and the reasons for it and any other noteworthy information about the hearing.connecticut dep t of correction admin.directive at.these processes are in accordance with supreme court precedent.see hewitt,at.
case law has not expressly set out what is to be included in a notice with respect to administrative segregation,but since such standards have been articulated with respect to disciplinary segregation,we see no reason to establish separate standards for each.the supreme court has held that while prisoners are entitled to the protection of procedural due process in the context of a disciplinary hearing,the due process clause in no way implies that these rights are not subject to restrictions imposed by the nature of the regime to which they have been lawfully committed.wolff mcdonnell,d.the full panoply of rights due a defendant during a criminal trial are not available in a prison disciplinary hearing.see id.yet,as explained in wolff,at least the minimum requirements of procedural due process appropriate for the circumstances must be observed.id.at.
minimum requirements,we think,include a notice that is something more than a mere formality.see benitez wolff,cir.the effect of the notice should be to compel the charging officer to be sufficiently specific as to the misconduct with which the inmate is charged to inform the inmate of what he is accused of doing so that he can prepare a defense to those charges and not be made to explain away vague charges set out in a misbehavior report.mckinnon patterson,cir.
plaintiff acknowledges he received written notice of the charges.his challenge is directed towards the district court finding that it was sufficient.the notice indicated taylor was being considered for close custody based on his past admission to outside law enforcement about involvement with the latin kings,recent tension in involving gang activity,and statements by independent confidential informants.taylor insists such information was too vague to allow him to prepare an adequate defense to the charges.
we agree.the notice does not contain specific allegations of conduct indicating current involvement with the latin kings,nor does it indicate which of his actions while incarcerated formed the basis for believing him to be a member of a security risk group.as noted,his foia request for disclosure of evidence and his request for the hearing officer to describe the tension were denied on the basis of confidentiality.thus,taylor had before him only these vague,unspecific charges to defend against.this sort of notice falls short of its function as set forth in wolff.see at.part of the function of notice is to give the charged party a chance to marshal the facts in his defense and to clarify what the charges are,in fact.even in cases involving administrative segregation based upon a prisoner membership in a gang,sufficient notice can not simply recite vague or conclusory allegations of recent tension involving gang activity.rather,to be sufficient,notice must inform the defendant of more specific facts underlying the allegation that he is suspected of gang membership,for example,a report of contact with known gang members.specific facts underlying allegations of current member involvement were especially important here,because hearing officer soto expressly acknowledged taylor insistence that he had formally renounced membership in the latin kings on march,and that he no longer had any contact with the group.
although the hearing requirement for placement in administrative segregation may be met by an informal,nonadversary proceeding,hewitt,at,it is a bedrock requirement of due process that such hearing be held at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,mathews eldridge,d.a hearing is not meaningful if a prisoner is given inadequate information about the basis of the charges against him.a prisoner should not,as taylor was,have to guess what conduct forms the basis for the charges against him.see brown plaut,if an inmate was not provided an accurate picture of what was at stake in the hearing,then he was not given his due process.
here we have no doubt that plaintiff misunderstood what charges were leveled against him.for example,the plaintiff testified,and introduced witness testimony,on matters concerning a wholly unrelated disciplinary incident,even though he had been assigned an advocate to assist in preparing a relevant defense.hence no remand for factual findings is necessary.id.at remanding case to determine whether plaintiff inmate understood charges against him.the notice,the contents of which are not in dispute,was deficient as a matter of law.
we must add that in questioning the sufficiency of the notice,we do not mean to imply that prison officials should have divulged the identity of the confidential informants,or that taylor was entitled to have the informants testify as witnesses.giakoumelos coughlin,cir reasoning that confidential informant testimony in prison disciplinary hearing need not be disclosed because the requirements of prison security are unique.
evidence supporting the determination 
although the issue of notice is sufficient to warrant a remand,we are also troubled by the district court conclusion that the decision supporting taylor close custody designation was based on some evidence.see superintendent hill,d holding that to satisfy due process,the relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board connecticut dep t of correction admin.directive,incorporating a some evidence standard.
in the inmate security risk group threat member determination form,hearing officer soto recites that her conclusion is based in part on the confidential information received from informants.the form also indicates that she relied upon an incident on july,when taylor was housed at hartford correctional center.no details about that incident are included in the findings.further,while the he
