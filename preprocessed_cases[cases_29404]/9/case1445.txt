opinion of the court 
this action stems from the death of juanya spady,the son of appellee mica spady juanya died of what appears to have been a rare form of asphyxiation known as dry drowning or secondary drowning,shortly after his participation in a mandatory swimming class run by his physical education teacher,appellant carlton rodgers.spady filed suit against rodgers and the bethlehem area school district basd,claiming violations of her son civil rights under u.rodgers moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,which the district court denied.because we agree with rodgers contention on appeal that his conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right,we will reverse the district court order denying summary judgment with instructions to grant summary judgment in rodgers favor.
the facts of this case,as the district court aptly noted,are undeniably tragic.spady bethlehem area sch,no,wl,at.july.in november,juanya spady transferred to liberty high school,which is part of the basd.a,student,juanya was enrolled in a variety of classes,including a course taught by rodgers,who had been a teacher at liberty for approximately four years and was a certified lifeguard.
as part of the curriculum,students rotated into a swimming course conducted at liberty swimming pool.during the last week in november and the first week of december of,juanya class was assigned to the swimming course.as per rodgers policy,students were required to be in the pool for the entirety of each class or risk having points deducted from their grade.this policy applied to as well as swimmers.rodgers acknowledged that he was made aware that juanya could not swim.
the classes were all taught in the same fashion,with rodgers standing at the side of the pool and instructing the students for approximately minutes on a specific stroke.after each lesson concluded,students were allowed to swim freely in the pool.in addition to rodgers,a student lifeguard also was on duty,although such supervision usually consisted of monitoring the pool from a reclined position on the bleachers.students could remain in the shallow end during the entirety of the class,but were also permitted to venture into the deep end by holding onto the side of the pool,a practice referred to as gutter grabbing.aside from these general procedures,there were no course policies governing instruction or swimmer safety.
on december,juanya first class of the day was,which commenced at approximately.after roll was taken,juanya entered the pool and swam in the shallow end for the first ten to fifteen minutes of class while rodgers instructed the students from the side of the pool.at the conclusion of the lesson,juanya departed the shallow end and began to gutter grab around the edge of the pool.while in the deep end,he ran into a group of students and was submerged for a matter of seconds,possibly inhaling or swallowing water as he resurfaced.juanya then exited the pool and told rodgers that his chest hurt.rodgers responded by telling juanya to sit on the bleachers for a few minutes.
several minutes later,rodgers went over to check on juanya,who requested permission to remain out of the pool for the rest of class.rodgers denied the request and told him to get back into the water.juanya followed these instructions and stayed in the shallow end for the remainder of the period.the students vacated the pool at approximately and proceeded to the locker room to change.
a few minutes later,juanya reported to english class,which began at approximately his teacher reported that he was attentive.abruptly,at around,nearly an hour and a half after he left the pool,juanya fell backward from a seated position and hit the desk behind him.as he rolled off his chair and onto the floor,he began to have a seizure.teachers observed labored breath,general unresponsiveness,and a pink,frothy fluid escaping from juanya nose and mouth.a school nurse attempted to revive juanya while they waited for medical assistance.shortly thereafter,paramedics took juanya by ambulance to luke hospital.he died later that day.
during the course of this litigation,spady provided an expert medical report opining that juanya died of a condition known as delayed drowning,supp app,or secondary drowning,which can occur when a small amount of water or other fluid is inhaled into the lungs.if the fluid is not removed,the lungs begin to spasm,causing a of other fluids,which in turn can cause the victim to asphyxiate because the lungs can not oxygenate the blood.this condition can cause death anywhere from an hour to a day after the initial inhalation of fluid and is extremely rare,accounting for only of drownings.
in december,spady filed this action against numerous parties,including rodgers and the basd,who are the only remaining defendants at this juncture.spady asserted that the defendants violated juanya constitutional rights,triggering liability under.more specifically,count ii of the complaint alleges a fourteenth amendment violation premised on the theory of liability against rodgers,and count iv raises a claim of municipal liability against basd based on a theory of deliberate indifference.
after the close of discovery,rodgers moved for summary judgment as to count ii,asserting that qualified immunity precluded liability by memorandum and order filed july,the district court denied the motion for summary judgment,concluding that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether rodgers violated juanya constitutional rights.spady,wl at.the district court also concluded that because it was unclear whether a constitutional violation actually occurred,it need not determine whether that right was clearly established.id.citing curley klem,cir.rodgers timely appealed.
