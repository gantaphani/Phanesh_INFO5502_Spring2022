ana maría lópez claims that puerto rico insurance commissioner,ángela weyne,eliminated lópez job as a director within the office of the insurance commissioner oic on account of lópez political affiliation.weyne now seeks interlocutory review of the district court rejection of her argument that her qualified immunity defense entitled her to summary judgment on lópez federal damages claim.finding that a reasonable official in weyne position could have understood the first amendment not to protect lópez against politically motivated removal from her job,we reverse.
background 
in denying weyne motion for summary judgment,the district court properly viewed the record in the light most favorable to lópez,and assumed the facts to be as supported by lópez competent evidence.neither party claims any error in that regard.we therefore take the facts as given,filling any gaps by similarly viewing the record in the light most favorable to lópez.johnson jones.
under puerto rico law,career employees may only be terminated for cause,whereas trust or confidential employees can be selected and removed at will.see laws ann.tit,see also id.in,after working as an attorney at the oic for a number of years,lópez was promoted to the career position of director of the special investigations afsi division.in january,she was appointed by commissioner ramón cruz to the trust position of auxiliary commissioner of legal affairs.several months later,lópez received an additional trust appointment to the position of chief deputy commissioner,thereby elevating her to of the agency.both cruz and lópez were affiliated with the new progressive party,as was the governor of puerto rico at the time.
in november,puerto rico elected the gubernatorial candidate of the popular democratic party.the subsequently announced that he would be nominating weyne to serve as his insurance commissioner.in january,lópez was reinstated to her previous career position as afsi director.around the same time,weyne assumed her position as insurance commissioner.shortly thereafter,weyne summoned lópez to her office to inform her that things would be changing.lópez responded by pointing out that her afsi director position was a career position,and that she intended to continue serving in the position with excellence.nevertheless,lópez alleges that over the course of the next several months,she was subject to various forms of politically motivated harassment and disparate treatment.
on may,weyne informed lópez that weyne was eliminating the afsi division and transferring lópez employees to the market conduct division.because the division of which she was the director ceased to exist,lópez was reclassified as a principal attorney and assigned to the legal affairs division.although lópez retained the same salary and fringe benefits,her duties and the nature of her work changed substantially.
soon thereafter,lópez filed this lawsuit against weyne,the oic,and certain unknown oic staff members collectively,the defendants,alleging that the job reassignment and alleged harassment violated the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,various provisions of article ii of the puerto rico constitution,and various provisions of puerto rico law.under,lópez sought damages from weyne personally for the alleged violations of federal law.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to lópez due process claims,but denied it as to her remaining claims,including her federal political discrimination claims for damages,declaratory relief,and injunctive relief.in so doing,the court rejected weyne principal argument that any rational jury would have to conclude that lópez simply lost her job as a collateral effect of a broader reorganization of the agency.the district court also rejected an alternative defense raised by weyne that even if the reorganization could be interpreted as an action directed at lópez because of her political affiliation,weyne was entitled to qualified immunity on the damages claim because a reasonable official could have thought that lópez position fell within the exception to the first amendment bar on political removals recognized in elrod burns,and branti finkel,that denial of the qualified immunity defense was immediately appealable for the purpose of allowing review of the district court assessment of the law as applied to the assumed facts.see cady walsh,cir.after weyne promptly sought such review,we granted weyne request for a stay of the proceedings below and denied lópez request for summary disposition.we now turn to the substance of the appeal.
ii.discussion 
under our test for qualified immunity in political discrimination cases,we ask whether the nature of the position was such that defendants were entitled to consider political affiliation as a job qualification,and even if they were not,whether a reasonable offic ial at the time would have understood patronage dismissal or demotion to be barred.guard,cir.for ease of reference,we refer to these two questions,respectively,as the merits question and the reasonableness question.we treat each question as a question of law,to be answered de novo.hunt massi,cir.
the preferred approach is to decide the merits question first,reaching the reasonableness question only if the merits question is resolved against the defendant.see,at citing saucier katz.in this case,though,we face an unusual twist in her answer to the complaint,weyne admitted that party affiliation was not an appropriate requirement for lópez position.hence,the district court deemed the merits question uncontested.and on appeal,while protesting that she could not have conceded a point of law,weyne offers no developed argument for why that is so.like the district court,then,we also treat the merits question as uncontested.
this concession nevertheless does little to narrow the scope of our inquiry.to answer the reasonableness a reasonable official at the time could have understood lópez job to be unprotected we pretty much have to run through the entire merits analysis anyhow.we do so not to answer the uncontested merits question,but rather to see how close a question it is.furthermore,the test we apply in assessing the closeness of the question is objective,rather than subjective we focus on what a reasonable official could have believed,not on allegations about what the official actually believed.eves lepage,cir.see also,at.though qualified immunity does not shield the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,eves,at quoting mullenix luna,per curiam,an official can not fairly be said to know that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful,harlow fitzgerald.with this twist explained,we turn to examining lópez job to see how a reasonable official could have viewed it.
in conducting this examination,we try to determine the extent to which the position involve s government decisionmaking on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.jimenez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir.en banc,cert.denied.we begin with an inspection of the functions of the position in question.valdizán,cir.citing branti,at.we examine the particular responsibilities of the position to determine whether it resembles a policymaker,a privy to confidential information,a communicator,or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.jimenez fuentes,at.we also look to secondary factors such as relative pay,title,and legal or legislative classification to further inform our analysis.see,at power,cir.jimenez fuentes,at.
in analyzing lópez job functions,both parties rely primarily on the skills profile contained in the record.we do so as well.see olmeda,cir.citing,cir.a n official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.the skills profile establishes that the afsi director performs m anagerial work of great complexity and responsibility under the general supervision of the deputy supervision and compliance commissioner.though the deputy commissioner gives out s
