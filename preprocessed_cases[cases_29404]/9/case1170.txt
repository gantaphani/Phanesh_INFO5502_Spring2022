this case concerns charges and of official misconduct within the police department of the village of mamaroneck the village and an alleged effort by the chief of police and the governing commission to silence subordinates.the plaintiffs,all former officers of the department,allege that the chief of the department,edward flynn,and the board of police commissioners the board conspired to retaliate against them because the plaintiffs spoke out against what they claimed was a pattern of serious misconduct by fellow officers and subsequent by chief flynn and other officers.the plaintiffs sued the defendants under,alleging a violation of their first amendment and equal protection rights.
the district court denied summary judgment to the village,the board,and chief flynn,including,as to chief flynn and the board,summary judgment based on claims of qualified immunity.the individual board members and chief flynn seek immediate review of the denial of qualified immunity,and the village asks that we exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over its appeal.
i.the greenland incident 
sometime in,plaintiff jeremy skehan and fellow police officers in the mamaroneck police department responded to a call at an a p supermarket in mamaroneck that resulted in a confrontation with ronald greenland,a black male.according to skehan,greenland was known as a felon with a history of violence who had threatened several members of the department.on february,skehan,at a meeting with the department executive officer,alexander ricozzi,and lieutenants hank paul and mary matero,was told to ignore any future violations by greenland because skehan is white and greenland black.the officers said that if skehan failed to obey the order he would be disciplined.
days later,at a meeting attended by chief flynn,skehan,ricozzi,and matero,flynn rescinded the previous order and asked if skehan wanted to express any concerns about the incident.skehan replied that he was concerned that the department was making its enforcement decisions concerning greenland on the basis of race.flynn immediately said skehan was mistaken he added,your judgment needs to be looked at a little bit because i think you have a problem with your judgment.flynn then told skehan that flynn was proposing that skehan forfeit ten days pay because of skehan failure to disclose the reason for taking a previous period of sick leave.when skehan refused to consent to the forfeiture,the department issued a series of memoranda accusing skehan of misconduct and suspending certain of skehan privileges,including switching shifts with other officers without approval.on march,chief flynn proposed eight disciplinary charges against skehan,and skehan was formally charged on april.charges alleged that skehan refused to provide the department with information concerning his sick leave.charge alleged that skehan had failed to report promptly to the february meeting.
ii.the incident 
on may,officer reagan kelly of the department responded to a accident in the village.the drivers were doris hutchinson and a minor,referred to only as.at the scene,kelly arrested for driving while intoxicated.soon after,skehan assisted kelly with the preparation of the bill of particulars to be filed against kelly confided to skehan that kelly did not have probable cause to arrest for the offense but that he was directed to do so by sergeant gaffney,who had gone off on his tangent again because he does like kids and he gets really nutty,and he went nuts again.
on may,skehan met privately with an assistant district attorney,jeffrey chartier,to report kelly allegations and skehan own concerns about racial decisionmaking in the department.skehan told chartier that he feared the incidents would have been covered up if he had gone through the normal chain of command.the next day,skehan reported his conversation with the district attorney office to lieutenant paul.later that month,skehan wrote to sergeant peter monachelli,his direct supervisor,advising monachelli of his meeting with the district attorney office and his concerns about the conduct within the department.
monachelli,who was also vice president of the local police benevolent association pba,forwarded skehan memorandum to monachelli immediate supervisor,lieutenant matero.the next day,monachelli drafted his own memorandum to matero,expressing his concern that the department was making enforcement decisions on the basis of race.
on may,an internal investigation prompted by skehan allegations concerning the accident was concluded and exonerated sergeant gaffney.that same day gaffney required all the officers to attend a roll call meeting where he threatened retaliation against skehan,saying,i want everyone to know,now that it over,it just beginning.
two days later,skehan wrote to local pba president john dicioccio,reiterating his concerns.in their capacities as president and vice president of the pba,respectively,dicioccio and monachelli posted a memorandum,dated may,in the police locker room.the memorandum disputed the conclusions of the internal investigation into sergeant gaffney conduct concerning the arrest of.it also reiterated and supported skehan contention that the department was engaged in enforcement.dicioccio and monachelli sent a copy of their memorandum to the board and chief flynn.
iii.the department retaliation and plaintiffs lawsuit 
the next day,acting chief ricozzi,with chief flynn authorization,suspended skehan without pay for making false and improper allegations about other officers to the district attorney.a copy of the suspension notice was sent to the board.by letter dated june,flynn urged the board to continue skehan suspension pending the completion of the investigation of skehan.all five members of the board voted to continue the suspension.
on june,chief flynn published a memorandum,with copies to the board,outlining his response to dicioccio and monachelli memorandum.in it,chief flynn promised action against dicioccio and monachelli.a month later dicioccio was interviewed by chief flynn concerning the may memorandum.when dicioccio was asked to remove his firearm,he dropped his gunbelt to the floor in a show of disrespect for the investigation.on the advice of counsel,dicioccio refused to answer any questions related to the pba memorandum.on july,chief flynn leveled disciplinary charges against dicioccio for his refusal to answer questions at the hearing and dropping his gunbelt and then suspended him without pay.the board unanimously voted to continue dicioccio suspension on july.also on july,chief flynn served monachelli with a notice to appear.his interview was conducted the following day and was continued to july like dicioccio,monachelli refused to answer questions concerning the may pba memorandum.skehan disciplinary proceeding began on july.
on august,skehan filed this action in the southern district of new york against flynn and the board members,as well as other officers who are not appellants.on september,dicioccio and monachelli filed a separate action.the same day,flynn sent a memorandum to the board explaining that he was instituting disciplinary charges against monachelli.monachelli was charged with refusal to answer questions during the investigation,posting of the may pba memorandum,and discussing the memorandum with third parties.monachelli was not suspended but was relieved of supervisory responsibilities.because of a perceived conflict of interest,the board appointed a retired new york state supreme court justice,james cowhey,to hear the charges against skehan,dicioccio,and monachelli.
on february,paul micalizzi,a mamaroneck police officer,wrote to the board,expressing his belief that the charges against skehan,dicioccio,and monachelli were unjustified and that their complaints against the department were.micalizzi further alleged that chief flynn had filed the charges to retaliate against and silence the officers.micalizzi testified on behalf of skehan,dicioccio,and monachelli during their disciplinary hearings in march and april.on april,chief flynn filed disciplinary charges against micalizzi and suspended him without pay.the charges alleged that micalizzi had tape recorded conversations with the mayor of mamaroneck and police department officials in violation of department policy.flynn also wrote the board to recommend that they continue the suspensions of skehan and dicioccio and that they suspend monachelli and micalizzi until the disciplinary proceedings were completed.at about that time,the board voted to suspend micalizzi pending the outcome of the investigation but reinstated him on july.there is no record that monachelli was suspended.on april,micalizzi filed a lawsuit in the southern district of new york against chief flynn,the board,and other officers no longer party to this suit.
iv.the disciplinary proceedings 
justice cowhey hearing of the charges against all the plaintiffs was completed in the fall of.he found that skehan,dicioccio,and monachelli were guilty of all charges,and that micalizzi was guilty of four of the five counts of tape recording without authorization.because the plaintiffs also had sued the village manager,leonard verrastro,who had been appointed by the board to be the final decisionmaker in the plaintiffs case,verrastro recused himself.the board then appointed justice cowhey in his place.on january,justice cowhey terminated each plaintiff from the department.
v.the district court proceedings 
district judge brieant consolidated into a single action the complaints filed by the four plaintiffs.the substance of their claims,brought under,was that they had been retaliated against in violation of the first amendment and that they had been disciplined more harshly than other officers in violation of the equal protection clause.see const.amends.i,xiv.chief flynn,the village,and the board moved for summary judgment,with the individual defendants asserting a qualified immunity defense.
the district court rejected all of the defendants arguments and denied summary judgment.as to chief flynn,the district court found sufficient evidence that he was personally involved in the suspension of the officers,that it was clearly established that a government official could not discipline an inferior officer because of that officer expression of protected speech,and that the motive for chief flynn actions presented a question of fact particularly for summary judgment.the district court also found evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to whether flynn disciplined skehan and the other plaintiffs more severely than offenders.the district court therefore denied flynn motion for qualified immunity as to both constitutional claims.
as to the board,the district court held that the evidence was sufficient to suggest that the board knew of chief flynn unconstitutional actions and ratified them.in the district court view,this ratification was sufficient for liability to attach under.the district court denied qualified immunity to the board members,holding that the board was required to do more than flynn decision to discipline the officers because the board had more than adequate knowledge of flynn possibly unconstitutional motivation.with regard to the village,the district court held that,because the board was the final policymaker for the village,the village could be liable for the actions of the board.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not usually immediately appealable.see vargo,cir.under the collateral order doctrine,however,the denial of a motion for qualified immunity is immediately appealable to the extent that the denial turns only on a question of law.poe leonard,cir.in this case,the district court found that issues of material fact remained in dispute between the parties,including the defendants motivation for bringing charges against the plaintiffs.thus,at least in part,the district court denial of summary judgment and its rejection of the defendants qualified immunity defense turns on disputed issues of fact,and we would ordinarily lack jurisdiction to review those denials here.
nevertheless,defendants may appeal from denials of qualified immunity if they are willing,for the purposes of appeal only,to pursue the appeal on the basis of stipulated facts or the facts as alleged by the plaintiff.alternatively,the defendants may appeal if they assume that all the facts that the district court found to be disputed are resolved in the plaintiff favor.salim proulx,cir.while we may not inquire into the district court determination that there was sufficient evidence to create a jury question,we may resolve whether,as a matter of law,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity either because the law was not clearly established or because,on the facts assumed for the purposes of appeal,the defendants conduct did not constitute a violation of a constitutional right.see poe,at.both chief flynn and the members of the board are entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense,see harlow fitzgerald,d,and to pursue an immediate appeal under the appropriate circumstances,which are present here.we therefore have jurisdiction to hear their appeal,with the limitations imposed by salim that we must accept the plaintiffs version of the disputed facts and can not examine the determinations made by the district court.
the village is not entitled to claim qualified immunity,owen city of independence,d,and thus may not normally appeal the district court denial of summary judgment as to it.the supreme court has cautioned that there is no general appellate jurisdiction to consider issues related to claims that are capable of interlocutory appeal.see swint chambers county comm n,d.we may consider only such issues as are inextricably intertwined,munafo metro.transp,cir,with matters over which we do have is,matters where no additional inquiry or analysis is necessary,and issues necessary to ensure meaningful review of the jurisdictionally proper elements of the case.mccullough wyandanch union free sch,cir.for reasons that we will discuss,we find that we lack jurisdiction to consider that part of the village appeal related to plaintiff first amendment claim but do have jurisdiction to consider the village appeal concerning the plaintiffs equal protection claim.accordingly,we dismiss the village appeal on the first amendment claim.
ii.first amendment claims 
plaintiffs argue that chief flynn and the board charged them with violations of departmental rules and suspended them in retaliation for their protected speech against decisionmaking and of misconduct within the department.on plaintiffs view,chief flynn suspended skehan because skehan complained about the greenland incident and reported the questionable arrest to the district attorney.when dicioccio and monachelli supported skehan by expressing their concerns to the board and posting the pba memo,flynn brought charges against them,and the board suspended dicioccio pending the investigation.because micalizzi attempted to support the other plaintiffs by testifying in their favor at their hearings,flynn and the board then suspended him.
the supreme court recently held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.garcetti ceballos,d.if a public employee is not speaking pursuant to his official duties,the analysis is different a lthough a governmental entity enjoys significantly greater latitude when it acts in its capacity as employer than when it acts as sovereign,the first amendment nonetheless prohibits it generally,subject to certain defenses,from punishing its employees in retaliation for the content of their speech on matters of public importance.munafo,at.in order to establish a first amendment retaliation claim,plaintiffs must prove that they engaged in constitutionally protected speech because they spoke as citizens on a matter of public concern they suffered an adverse employment action and the speech was a motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.gronowski spencer,cir sheppard beerman,cir the speech must be at least a substantial or motivating factor internal quotation marks omitted lewis cowen,cir.whether the speech addresses a matter of public concern is a question of law to be decided by the court.gronowski,at.in addition,plaintiffs must show that each defendant was personally involved in the alleged constitutional deprivations.id.at.if a plaintiff makes this required showing,defendants may nevertheless escape liability if they can demonstrate that either the defendant would have taken the same adverse action against the plaintiff regardless of the plaintiff speech or the plaintiff expression was likely to disrupt the government activities and that the harm caused by the disruption outweighs the value of the plaintiff expression.cobb pozzi,cir.the government defendants do not argue on this appeal that the plaintiffs expression would have caused a disruption that outweighed the value of plaintiffs speech.see reuland hynes,cir.
defendants concede that garcetti does not affect micalizzi claims and do not seriously contend that monachelli and dicioccio posting in the department locker room of a memo in their capacities as leaders of the pba is not protected speech under garcetti.as to skehan,defendants argue that his reports to the district attorney office of an arrest made without probable cause and of decisions were made pursuant to his official duties as a police officer.because no factual record has been developed on the scope of skehan duties,we express no view on this question and leave to the district court in the first instance to consider the application of garcetti to skehan claims and any others that may be relevant.
as for the claim that plaintiffs were speaking as citizens on a matter of public concern,defendants do not seriously contest that plaintiffs have satisfied the first two elements of their first amendment case,nor could they.plaintiffs speech plainly concerned issues of public concern misfeasance within the police department and allegations of an ongoing and an attempt to silence those who spoke out against it.feingold new york,cir complaint of discriminatory treatment is a matter of public concern munafo,at safety of the workplace and union activities hale mann,cir administration of juvenile detention facilities.likewise,the institution of disciplinary proceedings is sufficient in this circuit to constitute an adverse employment decision.see burkybile bd.of,cir.
the questions remain whether plaintiffs were in fact disciplined because of their constitutionally protected speech and,if so,which defendants were personally involved in that decision.chief flynn contends that he had legitimate,constitutionally permissible reasons for charging the plaintiffs.the board and village contend that their constitutional duties were fulfilled by instituting the hearing process whether or not chief flynn charged and suspended the plaintiffs for unconstitutional reasons.
qualified immunity 
chief flynn and the board members are entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense persons entitled to qualified immunity are immune from liability for damages under.in conducting the qualified immunity inquiry,a court must first decide if the facts alleged make out the deprivation of a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if those facts would constitute a deprivation,the court should grant qualified immunity if the legal right said to be violated was not clearly established at the time of the defendant conduct or the defendant action was objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established legal rules then in effect,at see saucier,at.
chief flynn 
applying the qualified immunity principles to chief flynn,the district court was plainly correct to deny flynn motion for summary judgment.first,as a general proposition with some exceptions,see,pickering bd.of,d adverse action may be taken if employee speech is disruptive elrod burns,d adverse action may be taken against policymaker mount healthy sch.dist.doyle,d adverse action may be taken if for other lawful reasons it would have been taken in the absence of the protected speech,governmental entities may not inflict an adverse employment decision upon an employee in retaliation for the employee exercise of his first amendment rights.moreover,that right was clearly established by and,the period of time where flynn allegedly retaliated against the plaintiffs.see munafo,at.in our view,no reasonable officer could hold a contrary belief.
flynn principal contention on appeal is that he had constitutionally permissible reasons for charging and suspending the plaintiffs.in addition,flynn contends that he was not personally responsible for the suspensions of those plaintiffs who were suspended in the first instance by the board.the latter contention is inapposite to the present retaliatory proffering of charges is sufficient to constitute an adverse employment decision for first amendment purposes.see burkybile,at.similarly,flynn argument that he had other,reasons for disciplining the plaintiffs is beside the point.so long as flynn alleged animus was a substantial or motivating factor behind flynn decision,sheppard,at internal quotation marks omitted,the fact that he had other legitimate reasons is irrelevant because the plaintiffs allege that flynn motivation was unconstitutional and the district court found the issue to be disputed,we must accept the plaintiffs version of the facts.to the extent that flynn is also arguing that the evidence submitted at summary judgment was insufficient to create a disputed issue of fact on the question,we lack jurisdiction to consider his argument.see locurto safir,cir stating that we lacked jurisdiction to review the district court first amendment ruling because it would require us to review the district court determination that sufficient evidence existed to create a genuine issue of fact on the question of subjective motivation salim,at.similarly,we must accept the plaintiffs allegations that flynn would have not taken the same adverse action in the absence of plaintiffs protected expression.see mount healthy sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of summary judgment and qualified immunity as to chief flynn on plaintiffs first amendment claim.
as we have explained,retaliatory action against the plaintiffs is unconstitutional,and this was clearly established at the time of the relevant conduct.the board contends,however,that,even assuming that it reasonably suspected or even knew outright that chief flynn motivation for disciplining the plaintiffs was unconstitutional retaliation,it had no duty other than to investigate the charges impartially and thoroughly,which it did by conducting the disciplinary hearing required by law.
while we disagree with the district court analysis of this claim we believe that the plaintiffs have alleged a different and legally adequate basis for board liability.there is no dispute that the board direct participation in violating the plaintiffs rights would be a proper basis for liability.provost city of newburgh,cir a supervisory defendant may be held liable if it personally participated in the alleged constitutional violation.again,whether the district court was correct in finding sufficient evidence to create a jury question on this issue is not before us.however,assuming that the district court was correct,as we must,we agree that if the board,apart from flynn,charged and suspended the plaintiffs,at least in part,to punish them for the exercise of their constitutional rights,a legally adequate theory for liability under would be presented.moreover,we are certain that such a theory was clearly established by.see moffitt,at liability may be premised on the supervisors knowledge of the activities of their subordinates and a resulting direct participation therein.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court denying qualified immunity to the board on the basis that,taking the allegations in plaintiffs favor,the board intended to further chief flynn desire to retaliate against the plaintiffs for their exercise of first amendment rights.

municipalities may be held liable under,but they may not be held liable for the actions of their officers on a theory
