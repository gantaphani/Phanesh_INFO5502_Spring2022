opinion of the court 
the issue before us is whether a school district,in order to maintain a policy of complete religious neutrality,may prohibit celebratory religious music at events.the district court,in a careful analysis of the facts on record and the applicable law,upheld the school district discretion to maintain and enforce its policy.stratechuk bd.of,sch,d.
the unsuccessful plaintiff,michael stratechuk,the father of two students in the school district of south,new jersey school district,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district and related defendants on stratechuk claims filed pursuant to,that the school district policy on the performance of religious holiday music violates the establishment clause and his children first amendment right to receive information and ideas,right to learn,and right to academic freedom.id.at.
factual and procedural background 
policy,religion in the schools policy,was adopted on april,by the south board of education.it provided that 
it is the goal of the school district to foster mutual understanding and respect for the right of all individuals regarding their beliefs,values and customs.in pursuing this goal,we recognize that we serve a diverse community with varying cultural,ethnic and religious orientation.
we are cognizant of the role of culture,including religion,in the development of our society and believe that objectively teaching about religion and its role in the social and historical development of civilization does not violate the religious neutrality of the public schools.
music,art,literature,dance and drama along with religious customs and traditions,which have come to us from various elements of our national population,may be used to broaden our pupils awareness of the many elements that comprise our diverse american culture.
in any reference to religion in the schools,the district is guided by the following concepts when determining the appropriateness of activities the activity should have a secular purpose,the activity should neither advance nor inhibit religion,and the activity should have relevance to the curriculum.app.at.
on the issue of the treatment of religion in the curriculum,policy permitted the inclusion of religious literature,music,drama,dance and visual arts in the curriculum provided that it achieves specific goals of the written curriculum in the various fields of study that it is presented objectively and that it neither inhibits nor advances any religious point of view.app.at.it also permitted expression of religious belief or in compositions,works of art,music,speech and debate.app.at.policy permitted the use of religious symbols only to teach about historical or cultural context,not to promote or celebrate religious concepts,events or holidays.app.at.
as most relevant to this appeal,the section,treatment of religious holidays in classrooms,school buildings,programs or concerts,provided 
religious holidays are not to be celebrated in the schools,except in the form of the secular nature of that holiday.however,opportunities to learn about cultural and religious traditions should be provided within the framework of the curriculum.information about religious and cultural holidays and traditions,focusing on how and when they are celebrated,their origins and histories may be part of this instruction.
in planning school activities related to the teaching about religious holidays or themes,special effort must be made to ensure the activity is not devotional and that pupils of all faiths and beliefs can join without feeling they are betraying their own faith or beliefs.
decorations with religious significance are not permitted.
religious music,like any other music,can only be used if it achieves specific goals of the music curriculum.
music programs prepared or presented by student groups as an outcome of the curriculum shall not have a religious orientation or focus on religious holidays.
prior to the academic year,holiday music christmas and hanukkah songs were performed at the school district december concerts.in the fall of,the mother of a school district student told her child music teacher,william cook,that she objected to her daughter playing the christmas sing along at the december concert.app.at.cook recounted this concern to nicholas santoro,the director of fine arts,who passed the concerns on to james memoli,the assistant superintendent.
in any event,the music repertoire of the december concert included star spangled banner,sounds of hanukkah a medley of hanukkah tunes,recuerdos de la alhambra,and the christmas sing along which was a medley of joy to the world,silent night,oh,come all ye faithful,and hark the herald angels sing.
after that concert,the objecting mother sent a letter to peter horoschak,the superintendent of the school district,express ing her concern that the school board policy was not followed because point a of policy clearly states music programs prepared or presented shall not have a religious orientation or focus on religious holidays.app.at.the letter continued,a s you know,the selection of music,both instrumental and vocal,had a clear religious orientation and focused on religious holidays.app.at.horoschak responded,i t was our judgment that because of the variety of both secular and holiday,hanukkah and christmas selections there was not one particular focus on a particular religion or religious group,and,as such,there was no attempt to advance any religious point of view.app.at.however,he also noted that concerns raised by parents regarding the holiday concert at south orange middle school suggest that the policy needs further clarification,and that memoli and santoro are engaged in discussions about such musical programs,and they will recommend to me suggested language for regulations which should clarify what types of programs and activities are permissible and not permissible under this policy.app.at.
on march,the school board addressed the december concert issue at horoschak annual performance review,and,according to horoschak deposition testimony,the board members had heard from some community members about instrumental music that people felt represented a celebration of christmas holidays and also there ha d been discussion about the fact that you really ca balance all religious groups in these representations in these types of performances.app.at.the board decided that policy would be consistently implemented so that there would be so much discretion by every faculty member,and discussed drafting regulations to clarify the policy.stratechuk,d at.
after meeting with relevant faculty and staff,santoro issued a memo to the department of fine arts,dated october,october memo.it stated that the board policy,as it is written,will be implemented,and included the following bullet points 
all programs will be reviewed and approved by me 
we will avoid any selection which is considered to represent any religious holiday,be it christmas,hanukkah.this holds true for any vocal or instrumental setting.
i would strongly suggest you gear towards the seasonal wonderland,frosty the snowman.music centered on peace is also a nice touch.
for the high school,the brass ensemble repertoire must also adhere to this policy,so the traditional carols must be eliminated from the repertoire.
the mkl sic gospel choir can not perform at the chs holiday assembly for the student body.
your printed programs for any holiday concert must avoid graphics which refer to the holidays,such as christmas trees and dreidels.
in response to the october memo,there were complaints from,inter alia,music teachers,parents,the south orange village president,and representatives of the mlk gospel choir.for example,seventeen members of the maplewood community signed a petition asking the board of education to honor religious tolerance.app.at.other complaints were more vigorous.
however,as cook explained in his deposition testimony,policy did prohibit all religious music in performances,only music based on or themes consistent with pieces commonly associated with the holiday at the time of the holiday.app.at.accordingly,santoro approved the performance of vivaldi gloria in excelsio cum sancto spiritu because t he program does not have a religious orientation and it does not refer to a holiday app.at.
in addition,policy and the october memo were interpreted to prohibit only the performance of celebratory holiday the teaching of such music in particular or of religious music in general.for example,santoro testified that i n performance of the winter concerts those selections,joy to the world,oh,come all ye faithful,hark,the herald angels sing,and silent night would not be allowed,although i n the curriculum they would be allowed to be taught.app.at.he amplified that point in a letter to music teacher barbara eames stating that she could continue to teach about the different holidays in music classes because c lassroom work is not a program,within the meaning of policy.app.at.although eames contended in a declaration to the district court that the october memo has caused me to exclude certain music pieces that i would have used to achieve specific goals of the music curriculum and has caused me to censor my music curriculum in a way that i believe is harmful to my students education and contrary to the goals of the music curriculum,app.at,she conceded in her deposition testimony that i have removed christmas or chanukah songs from my classroom curriculum because the policy does not do that,app.at.
the music performed at the december concert approved by santoro included jingle bell rock,vivaldi gloria,winter wonderland,hava nagila,madrigal of the bells,rudolph the reindeer,and frosty the snowman.since,songs with religious content have been performed at the december concerts the concerts included concerto viii fatto per la notte di natale,waters of babylon psalm,jubilate,and agnus sanctis.
on december,stratechuk filed this action pursuant to in the united states district court for the district of new jersey and later an amended complaint naming as defendants the school district,its board of education,the board president and superintendent peter horoschak together,school district the complaint alleged that during the school year defendants created,adopted,and implemented a strict policy of banning all religious music,including instrumentals,from the public schools in the district,such that students are no longer permitted to learn about,listen to,and participate in the presentation of traditional christmas music during such curricular and events as holiday concerts,assemblies,and recitals.complaint at.stratechuk alleged that the school district actions violated his and his minor children rights under the establishment clause of the first amendment by convey ing the impermissible,message of disapproval of and hostility toward religion,including christianity complaint at.in addition,stratechuk claimed that the same actions deprived him and his minor children of their right to receive information and ideas,their right to learn,and their right to academic freedom,which are guaranteed under the first amendment amended complaint at.stratechuk sought a declaratory judgment that his and his children constitutional rights had been violated,a permanent injunction enjoining defendants policy,practice,custom of banning religious music within the school district,damages for the past loss of his and his minor children constitutional rights,and attorneys fees,costs and expenses.amended complaint at.
on october,after the period at issue in stratechuk complaint,the school district amended policy by removing section a.see supra.at the same time,in order to clarify policy the school district adopted regulation,religion in the schools,app.at,which provides that for children in grades,the performance of music with religious text is appropriate when doing so is an outgrowth of the curriculum,but musical performances shall not be celebrations of particular religious,ethnic or cultural holidays,app.at.for elementary school students,the performance of music with a religious text shall be avoided.app.at.in addition,the section entitled celebration of religious holidays prohibited states that m usical concerts or assemblies which take place during holiday seasons will not be holiday concerts,which celebrate religious,cultural or ethnic holidays.app.at.stratechuk has not amended his complaint to include a challenge to this regulation or any of the school district specific actions that occurred after he filed his amended complaint.the district court,appellees,and amici correctly note that the schools have permitted the performance of music with religious content since.see stratechuk,d at appellee br.at amici br.at.
the district court dismissed stratechuk complaint,finding that his claim relied on policy alone and that he could not state a claim under that policy.see stratechuk bd.of educ.of sch,cir.this court vacated and remanded in a nonprecedential opinion,noting that the policy that stratechuk alleges was in place in is decidedly different than the official policy articulated in the text of policy and concluding that a categorical ban on exclusively religious music,of the type that stratechuk alleges,appears to state a claim under the first amendment.id.at.
on remand,the parties engaged in discovery and both moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the school district,holding that policy,as interpreted by the october memo and as applied did not violate the establishment clause or any first amendment right to receive information,ideas,right to learn,and right to academic freedom.stratechuk,d at.stratechuk timely appealed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over stratechuk claim under and a,and this court has jurisdiction under.
this court review s a grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.pichler unite,cir.summary judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.norfolk ry.basell usa,cir quoting abramson william paterson coll.of,cir.
discussiona.the establishment clause 
stratechuk launched a broad first amendment attack against the school district interpretation of policy,focusing in the first instance on the establishment clause.under the establishment clause of the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.const.amend.i.the supreme court has read this clause to forbid not only law respecting an establishment of a religion,const.amend.i,but also an official purpose to disapprove of a particular religion or of religion in general,church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.the touchstone for our establishment clause analysis is the principle that the first amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion,and between religion and nonreligion.mccreary county aclu,d quoting epperson arkansas,d.
under the lemon test,a state law or governmental action violates the establishment clause if it lacks a secular purpose,its principal or primary effect advances or inhibits religion,or it foster s an excessive government entanglement with religion.lemon kurtzman,d citation and quotation omitted.although still good law,see mccreary county,at,some justices have criticized the lemon test,see,lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d scalia,concurring like some ghoul in a horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad,after being repeatedly killed and buried,lemon stalks our establishment clause jurisprudence once again,frightening the little children and school attorneys.without discarding the lemon test,the court has set forth two related tests,the coercion test,see lee weisman,d,and the endorsement test,see lynch donnelly,d,concurring.the district court analyzed stratechuk claim under lemon,concluding that the lemon test was the most appropriate for the claim before it.stratechuk argues that the school district policy and conduct violates the establishment clause under both the lemon test and the endorsement test.
the lemon test 
in applying the purpose prong of the lemon test,it is appropriate to ask whether government actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion.wallace jaffree,d internal quotation omitted.while a court is normally deferential to a state articulation of a secular purpose,it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham.edwards aguillard,d.as such,t he eyes that look to purpose belong to an objective observer,one who takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the text,legislative history,and implementation of the statute,or comparable official act.mccreary county,at.internal quotations omitted.
here,there is no religious a secular the issue is whether this secular purpose is actually,as stratechuk maintains,a purpose to disapprove of religion.the school district argues,and the district court found,that the purpose of the policy was to avoid government endorsement of religious holidays and a potential establishment clause violation.although there are few opinions addressing this type of secular purpose,the district court cited several courts of appeals opinions where the courts held that a ctions taken to avoid potential establishment clause violations have a secular purpose under the purpose prong of the lemon test.stratechuk,d at citing vasquez los angeles county,cir holding that county removal of the image of the cross from its official seal in order to avoid a potential establishment clause violation had a valid secular purpose under lemon roberts madigan,cir holding that school district order directing teacher not to leave his bible in sight or read silently from it during classroom hours had a secular purpose in that it was intended to assure that none of the teacher classroom materials or conduct violated the establishment clause borden sch.dist.of twp.of brunswick,cir the supreme court has stated that compliance with the establishment clause is a state interest sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions on speech.quoting capitol square review and advisory bd.pinette,d.indeed,our own court has said as much.busch marple newtown sch,cir.
stratechuk maintains that this alleged purpose is a sham because the establishment clause does not require a prohibition on performing religious music and v irtually every court that has been asked to review holiday concerts or music programs that have included religious music or music associated with religious holidays has upheld them.appellant reply br.at.in support of this assertion,stratechuk cites cases from the eighth,tenth,and fifth circuits that upheld the constitutionality of performing religious music in public schools.appellant reply br.at citing bauchman ex rel.bauchman high,cir upholding utah school policy permitting music teacher to select explicitly christian music and christian religious sites for performance of school choir doe duncanville indep.sch,cir upholding texas high school practices,such as permitting choir to use christian religious song as its theme song florey sioux falls sch.dist,cir upholding south dakota school policy that permitted music having religious themes or basis,including christmas carols,as part of the curriculum for activities and programs if presented in a prudent and objective manner.
the cases cited by stratechuk all upheld the policy of the respective schools or school districts.that is far different from holding that the first amendment compels a school district to permit religious holiday music or risk running afoul of the first amendment.stratechuk has offered no persuasive authority that the first amendment prevents south school district from formulating a policy that precludes performance of religious holiday music.
moreover,as the district court noted,the assumption that the establishment clause does not require the restrictions enacted by defendants does not automatically render defendants stated purpose a sham.stratechuk,d at.in other words,even if performance of religious songs did not violate the establishment clause,it does not follow that the goals underlying the school district desire to avoid a potential establishment clause violation were disingenuous or impermissible.
a similar issue was raised in bishop aronov,cir.in that case,a university had placed certain limits on a professor comments regarding religion.the court upheld those limits under the lemon test even assuming that the comments did not violate the establishment clause.the court explained that the restrictions neither advance nor inhibit the contrary,the university simply attempted to maintain a neutral,secular classroom id.
as the district court noted,the october memo was spurred by at least one parent complaint,as well as the practical impossibility of including every religion in a december holiday concert.stratechuk,d at.in fact,the concerns that led to the october memo were the very type of concerns underlying the establishment clause jurisprudence in this area,the need for government neutrality towards religious institutions and beliefs,mccreary county,at,and the impressionability of young children,edwards,at.in addition,as amici note,the constitution does not require the school to promote religion to the constitutionally permitted maximum and its failure to do so does not make it in any constitutionally significant way.school districts can determine how close to the establishment clause line they wish to place themselves amici br.at.
moreover,as the school district points out,stratechuk argument that the purpose of the current interpretation of policy is to unconstitutionally disapprove of religion and,in particular,christianity is based largely upon plaintiff inaccurate factual contention that defendants policy amounts to a ban on religious music in the school system.appellee br.at.to the contrary,it is clear that the policy,as interpreted,does not the record shows that it has not in fact teaching of religious holiday songs in the classroom or the performance of songs with religious content at the december concerts albeit not songs specifically related to winter holidays.
it follows that the district court did not err in holding that the school district actions did not have an impermissible purpose within the meaning of lemon.
turning to the lemon test effect prong,which considers whether the principal or primary effect of the challenged policy or practice advances or inhibits religion,lemon,at,we note justice explanation that t he effect prong asks whether,irrespective of government actual purpose,the practice under review in fact conveys a message of endorsement or disapproval,lynch,at,concurring.while an adjudication of a policy effect must take into account the perspective of one who is neither christian nor jewish,as well as of those who adhere to either of these religions,the constitutionality of its effect must also be judged according to the standard of a reasonable observer.county of allegheny aclu,d opinion of blackmun.in a passage describing the endorsement test that is often quoted to describe the effects prong of the lemon test,justice also noted that the history and ubiquity of a practice is relevant because it provides part of the context in which a reasonable observer evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice conveys a message of endorsement of religion.id.at,concurring.
stratechuk argues that the effect of the school district ban on the performance of religious music,irrespective of any alleged purpose,conveys a message of disapproval of religion appellant br.at.for example,stratechuk maintains that t he reasonable observer would know that the mlk gospel choir was permitted in the past to perform traditional christmas religious music at the columbia high school holiday assembly but has now been banned from performing at this event pursuant to the school district new policy in the final analysis,an informed,reasonable observer would conclude that the policy has the effect of disfavoring religion appellant br.at.
