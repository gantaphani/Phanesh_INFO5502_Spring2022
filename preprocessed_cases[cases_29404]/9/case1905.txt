this appeal arises from a million jury award in favor of a terminated employee on a claim of retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights.
a veteran deputy sheriff used pepper spray and physical force to subdue a motorcyclist fleeing from a fellow law enforcement officer.the deputy duly prepared his report of the incident and submitted the report to his superiors,who in turn passed it along to their superiors.alarmed that a damages lawsuit against the office of the sheriff might result from the deputy actions,officers in the upper echelon of the chain of command authorized detectives to interrogate him aggressively,while ordering him to revise his incident report.the deputy opposed this order as factually and legally unwarranted.after the deputy broadly publicized to numerous public officials,the media,and others,what he described as corrupt and unlawful practices occurring in the office of the sheriff,the sheriff terminated his employment.
the sole issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in failing to grant qualified immunity to the sheriff.for the reasons stated within,we hold that the district court did not err and accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
to a significant extent,the cardinal facts underlying this appeal are undisputed but,as always in an appeal from a district court denial of a motion for judgment,we summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the district court.sloas csx,cir.
appellee james troy durham,who had worked in public safety and law enforcement for nearly twenty years,was employed as one of about twenty deputy sheriffs in the somerset county,maryland,sheriff office scso.on august,while on routine patrol,durham used pepper spray and physical force to detain a suspect in the course of assisting a maryland state trooper arresting a man fleeing from the trooper on a motorcycle.shortly after the incident,as durham was preparing his report captain bill lewis of the scso came into durham office to confirm that he was preparing a report.captain lewis slammed his fist down on durham desk,and in a very loud,rude manner,he said,good,because pitts,the suspect,has been transported to the hospital,claiming that he is injured.
durham report included the following statements explaining his use of force on the suspect 
based on dfc durham training,knowledge,and experience,in,dfc durham delivered two forearm blows to the ridge area under the suspect nose,in an effort to gain control of the suspect and to overcome the resistance that the suspect was putting up.
dfc durham then delivered two knee blows to the left side of the suspect body in an effort to gain control of the suspect and to overcome the resistance that the suspect was putting up.
durham provided copies of his report to his immediate supervisors.despite durham use of the terms and resistance in describing the need for force against the suspect,durham has unfailingly insisted throughout these proceedings that he regarded his role in the encounter as merely one of assisting the pursuing state trooper in detaining the fleeing suspect.the suspect did not assault durham and,from durham perspective,he had no basis whatsoever to charge the suspect with a criminal offense 
the next day,august,although durham immediate supervisors had approved his reports,captain lewis asked durham to complete another use of force report using a different form.captain lewis also asked durham if he needed to go to the hospital,suggesting obliquely that durham surely must require medical attention as a result of the incident the day before.durham stated that he was not hurt or in need of medical attention.durham added a report to his initial report explaining this exchange with captain lewis.
four days later,on august,durham supervisors explicitly ordered him to charge the suspect with assaulting durham and resisting arrest.the supervisors further told durham that if he failed to do so,durham himself would be charged with assaulting the suspect.durham then spoke with other supervisory officers,and based on those consultations,he decided he would not place charges against the suspect.durham also detailed these exchanges in a second report.
on august,durham received a memorandum from captain lewis,advising him that detective sergeants renny miles and george nelson,two criminal investigators with the scso,would supervise durham in correcting the deficiencies in his report.at this time,durham contacted his attorney through his collective bargaining organization,the fraternal order of police,giving him copies of his original report and the memorandum.again,durham detailed the exchange with captain lewis in a third report.
upon reporting for duty on august,durham was escorted into an interrogation room by detectives miles and nelson,where they aggressively questioned him about his use of force report durham asked to have his attorney present.miles refused to permit durham to contact his attorney,had durham read and sign a document containing the warnings,and continued to question him with increasing aggressiveness.durham then told miles and nelson that he had already retained an attorney and given his attorney a copy of durham original police report and the reports.miles insisted that durham must revise his original police report and delete the reports if durham did not,he would be charged both internally and criminally with assault on the suspect.specifically,miles instructed durham to remove the facts concerning his use of force against the suspect miles also instructed durham to delete the reports as they each reported how superior officers had asked him to change his reports.
durham did not believe that he should revise any of his previous reports as he later testified,it was his understanding that when any law enforcement officer signs a report you swearing under oath and swearing to god that that the truth,that the facts of the case.as the interrogation continued,miles threatened to take durham gun and badge if he did not change his report.
durham theorized that the reason the superior officers wanted him to revise his report,and charge the suspect with assault and battery and resisting arrest,was to cover the sheriff office.durham suspected that the supervisors anticipated the suspect would file a complaint of excessive force and perhaps a lawsuit,and wanted to have everything lined up in case that event happened.id 
durham persisted in his refusal to revise the report,and eventually miles demanded durham gun,id,and badge,which he deposited in an evidence bag.after this,durham decided to revise the reports because he did not want to lose everything.using a computer terminal in the interrogation room,durham made the revisions and deletions miles demanded that he make.after first refusing to return durham service weapon,id,and badge,miles eventually returned the items to durham.as durham left the interrogation room after more than two hours miles patted durham on the back,and said durham was a good boy,a good guy,and that none of this happened.scso supervisors gave durham the afternoon off with pay and he went home,emotionally and psychologically shaken by the experience 
within days after his interrogation,durham filed an internal grievance with his superiors,requesting an outside investigation into the matter.on the same day that durham filed his grievance,appellant,sheriff robert jones,demoted him from dfc to deputy.on september,durham was suspended with pay pending further investigation.the parties spar over the precise circumstances and sequence of events surrounding the means durham originally chose to pursue his grievance.apparently,durham first invoked somerset county human relations remedies,but soon county officials seemingly deferred to proceedings within the purview of the sheriff office.
in any event,after receiving a letter from the county administrator informing him that the grievance would be investigated by the very officials in the scso against whom the grievance had been made in the first place,durham decided to take proactive measures of a highly public nature.specifically,he prepared a cover letter to a set of documents,which included a memorandum summarizing the events arising from his august,encounter with the suspect,addressed to his immediate supervisor his original police report the deleted reports the false police report durham created on the computer during his interrogation by miles and nelson the signed miranda form a copy of the grievance durham filed and his suspension paperwork.durham sent this packet of materials to the somerset county state attorney the governor of maryland the police academy where he had been trained the maryland police training commission and the maryland state police.in addition,he sent the packet to a number of media outlets,such as the local newspaper,the daily times of salisbury,maryland,and two local television stations,wboc tv and fox news.
in the correspondence to which the internal scso documents were attached,durham stated that he believed sheriff jones and others had broke public trust and abused their power.durham testified that he sent these materials to the news media to expose and to alert the public on what had taken place involving falsifying reports,deleting reports,placing false charges on an innocent person,violating county policy,violating my rights,me being assaulted.durham explained that he sent these materials to the maryland state police because they are an independent,unbiased,outside law enforcement agency.and as a citizen,i was making a complaint.i was the victim in a complaint and of a crime.
durham continued to send these materials to various political officials,including a senator in virginia,until jones issued a gag order against him on september.durham testified,and jones agreed,that in the internal scso documents,durham did not reveal any confidential interrogation methods,special police tactics,or the identity of any confidential informants.during the ensuing internal investigation,durham told investigators that he had sent out these materials to expose and to alert the public of the corruption that had taken place.
in may,durham was departmentally charged pursuant to the law enforcement officers bill of rights the leobr,pub.safety,et west,with assorted misconduct,including dissemination of departmental information and unbecoming conduct in july,the leobr trial board,consisting of three law enforcement commanders from other counties,conducted a evidentiary hearing on the charges.the trial board acquitted durham of all the charges except the two relating to the dissemination of information outside the agency without authorization.the trial board recommended a punishment of five days suspension for each charge,totaling ten days suspension.jones initially recommended a penalty of thirty days suspension for each of the charges,totaling sixty days suspension.
after the trial board issued its decision,jones sent a letter to durham,informing him that,pursuant to the leobr,he jones was considering a possible increase in the sanction.he invited durham to appear for a penalty hearing on september.the day after durham and his attorney appeared before jones for the penalty consideration,durham received notice of his termination.
durham sued jones in his individual capacity under,alleging that he was terminated in retaliation for exercising his free speech rights under the first amendment jones moved to dismiss durham case under federal rule of civil procedure b on grounds of qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion and the case went to trial.
durham and jones both testified at length.durham testified to the incidents leading up to his termination,including his interactions with jones and miles.jones explained that he terminated durham employment because durham had undermined the sheriff office durham public disclosures were full of all kinds of comments about people in my office,me,and everybody else.we were a joke.it was an embarrassment.we spent time tracking down witnesses it was just a nuisance.jones also testified that if durham had not disseminated the information he did,he probably would not have been terminated.jones testified that he felt that durham had stabbed him in the back,and that durham allegations amounted to calling him a crook.
after durham presented his case,jones moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a,again on grounds of qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion.jones did not present an affirmative case,and the matter was submitted to the jury.the jury found in favor of durham,awarding him in combined economic and damages.
jones timely renewed his motion for judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,once again presenting arguments on qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court denial of a rule b motion de novo.sloas,at.as to qualified immunity,as with any claim or defense,we view the evidence adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,and,in circumstances such as those here,we reverse only if the evidence favoring the plaintiff is not legally sufficient to overcome the defense.ortiz jordan.in our de novo review of the denial of qualified immunity on the record here,we are mindful of the supreme court recent admonishment 
once the case proceeds to trial,the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary judgment motion.a qualified immunity defense,of course,does not vanish when a district court declines to rule on the plea summarily.the plea remains available to the defending officials at trial but at that stage,the defense must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.
jones contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity,which shields government officials who commit constitutional violations but who,in light of clearly established law,could reasonably believe that their actions were lawful.henry purnell,cir en banc citing saucier katz.the burden of proof and persuasion with respect to a defense of qualified immunity rests on the official asserting that defense.meyers baltimore,cir.to prevail under qualified immunity,jones has to show either that there was no constitutional violation or that the right violated was not clearly established.gregg ham,cir citing henry,at.jones argues first that there was no violation of durham first amendment rights,and second,even if there was a violation,the right was not clearly established.we consider each issue in turn.
jones contends that it was not a violation of durham first amendment rights to terminate him for his publication of documents from durham internal grievance proceedings.if he is correct,then he is entitled to qualified immunity.chavez martinez,plurality opinion in deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity,we must first determine whether the officer alleged conduct violated a constitutional right if not,the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.internal citations omitted.
we evaluate the exercise of first amendment rights by public employees differently from their exercise by other citizens we must balance the interests of an employee who,as a citizen,comments upon matters of public concern,on the one hand,and the interests of a governmental employer,which must maintain an effective workplace,on the other.connick myers,citing pickering bd.of.to determine if a public employee has a cognizable first amendment claim for retaliatory discharge,we apply a test 
first,we consider whether the public employee was speaking as a citizen upon a matter of public concern or as an employee about a matter of personal interest.
second,even if the employee spoke upon a matter of public concern,we must determine whether the employee interest in speaking upon the matter of public concern outweighed the government interest in managing the working environment.and finally,if the employee claim satisfies both of these legal criteria,the court turns to the factual question of whether the employee speech was a substantial factor in the employee termination decision.
brooks arthur,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
jones does not dispute that durham speech was a substantial factor in his decision to terminate durham employment.thus,we are concerned solely with the first two prongs of durham retaliation claim.
matter of public concern 
jones first argues that durham speech was not on a matter of public concern,as he was simply publicizing his internal grievances.the trial record does not bear out jones contention.
the supreme court has instructed courts to look to the content,form,and context of a given statement to determine whether it addresses a matter of public concern.connick,at.speech involves a matter of public concern when it involves an issue of social,political,or other interest to a community.kirby city of elizabeth city,cir.this does not include personal complaints and grievances about conditions of employment.campbell galloway,cir citing stroman colleton cnty.sch,cir.while jones is correct that personal grievances are not matters of public concern,he mischaracterizes durham actions and misapprehends the focus of durham communications to public officials and the media.
as the district court correctly ruled,durham is not claiming first amendment protection for the materials he filed in the internal grievance proceedings including the attachments to his letters,or for his filing of an internal grievance.rather,durham is claiming first amendment protection for his publicizing of those materials in connection with his overarching allegations of serious and pervasive law enforcement misconduct in the scso.to be sure,it can not be denied on this record that the misconduct alleged came to light mainly because,or perhaps only because,durham himself became a victim of the misconduct.nevertheless,that circumstance does not undermine the conclusion that his allegations rose to the level of speech on a matter of public concern.we have no hesitation in holding that the trial evidence amply supported the district court determination that the content of durham communication strongly militated in favor of finding it was on a matter of public concern.
unlike in connick,durham did in fact seek to inform the public,at,of how his superiors were instructing him to revise his reports in a way that he,as the only percipient witness to the events,knew and believed to be false.durham sought to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing,on the part of his superiors,calling for an external investigation and media coverage.in his explanatory letter included with the other materials,durham outlined the circumstances of his superiors asking him to falsify police reports and submit unwarranted charges against the suspect in the august,incident,on the unmistakable pretextual basis that doing so would pretermit a citizen complaint or a damages lawsuit.as we held in maciariello sumner,cir,an allegation of evidence tampering by a police officer is a matter in which the public should be interested.durham was disturbed by the misconduct he saw in the scso,and which he experienced,and he felt that it needed public attention in order to be remedied 
in addition to the content of his statements,the form and context of their dissemination confirm that they were on a matter of public concern.durham did not keep the written materials internal,but instead sent them to a broad audience state and law enforcement offices including the somerset county state attorney,the governor of maryland,the police academy,the maryland police training commission,the maryland state police,as well as a number of media outlets,such as the daily times of salisbury,maryland,wboc tv,and fox news.as an insider in the scso,durham was uniquely positioned to have knowledge of its practices.moreover,jones testified that if the scso engaged in a,the public would be concerned and upset,and noted that he had given at least one interview to the news media about durham termination.the fact that the issue was one which interested the media indicates that it was of public interest,as we noted in robinson balog,cir.there,we found that statements made at a public meeting were protected speech,and a factor in our consideration was that the meeting led to local press coverage.id.at.
in sum,the district court correctly concluded,as a matter of law,see connick,at,that durham communications were on a matter of public concern,given their content,form,and context.
balancing speech rights against effective work environment 
jones argues that even if durham was addressing a matter of public concern,the scso interest in maintaining an efficient and effective law enforcement agency outweighed durham rights under the first amendment again,however,we discern no substantial evidence in the trial record supporting this claim.
the efficient functioning of government offices is a paramount public interest.balog,at.police are the most restrictive in this regard as they are paramilitary discipline is demanded,and freedom must be correspondingly denied.maciariello,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we consider a number of factors in determining the extent to which the protected speech disrupts the operation and mission of the agency.mcvey stacy,cir.
factors relevant to this inquiry include whether a public employee speech impaired the maintenance of discipline by supervisors impaired harmony among coworkers damaged close personal relationships impeded the performance of the public employee duties interfered with the operation of the institution undermined the mission of the institution was communicated to the public or to coworkers in private conflicted with the responsibilities of the employee within the institution and abused the authority and public accountability that the employee role entailed.
ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir citing mcvey,at.
tellingly,jones presented no evidence at trial of any actual disruption in the scso resulting from durham communications,other than vague references to durham actions undermining the public trust.while jones is correct that concrete evidence of an actual disruption is not required,there must still be a reasonable apprehension of such a disruption.maciariello,at.at trial,jones paid lip service to ostensible damage to office morale,relationships between colleagues,and the function of the office generally,but he was unable to articulate any way in which the office would have been different or was actually different due to durham statements.had jones imposed the relatively brief suspension recommended by the leobr trial board,there is evidence in the record that deputies and supervisors in the scso were still amenable to working with durham,including jones himself,who had actually rehired durham when he had earlier left the scso for what he thought might be a better opportunity,only to return to the scso.
it is useful to compare this situation with the one in stroman,at.in stroman,a teacher wrote letters to his colleagues regarding wage grievances and proposed a during exam week to send a message to administrators.id.at.the potential for disruption in such a situation is obvious the school could not be functional without its teachers,who are essential in providing its services.in contrast,when jones was asked whether durham actions hamper ed the ability of the somerset county sheriff office to protect the public,jones responded he did know,but he would think so.
this is not to say that there was no impact felt in the scso whatsoever.jones testified that officers had to spend time on the investigation,and there was office conversation about durham and the entire incident.but it is not enough that there is some disruption the amount of disruption has to outweigh the importance of the speech and its concern to the public.see connick,u.at see also mcvey,at murnaghan,concurring a stronger showing of public interest in the speech requires a concomitantly stronger showing of interest to overcome it.
whatever artful affidavits might have suggested at summary judgment,we examine here the trial record,not a hypothetical rumination on what could have or might have transpired.see ortiz.at.serious,to say nothing of corrupt,law enforcement misconduct is a substantial concern that must
