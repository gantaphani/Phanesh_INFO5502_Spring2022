in,the plaintiffs fourteen maintenance,domestic,and warehouse workers embarked on a quest to seek some relief after being abruptly fired from the puerto rico executive mansion shortly after a newly elected governor took the helm the plaintiffs to whom we refer as the workers sued luis fortuño burset fortuño,his wife,and two executive staffers,alleging that they were terminated solely because they affiliated with fortuño rival political parties.the firings,the workers have maintained,amounted to political discrimination prohibited by the first amendment.
after six years and two appeals,this voyage has reached its end for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court summary judgment disposal of the workers political discrimination claim 
background 
a.the factual skeleton 
because we are reviewing a summary judgment motion,we recite the facts in a light as favorable to the workers as the record will reasonably allow.velázquez pérez developers diversified realty,cir.
in november,fortuño,of puerto rico new progressive political party npp,defeated the incumbent,a member of the npp primary rival,to become puerto rico newly elected governor.fortuño took office on january,bringing on board a chief of staff,juan carlos blanco urrutia blanco,and an administrator,velmarie berlingeri marín berlingeri.through an executive order,fortuño authorized berlingeri to take any necessary actions and sign any necessary official documents related to the administration of the office of the governor,which included administering the executive mansion,where the governor lived and worked.
a few days after taking office,fortuño issued another executive order declaring a statewide fiscal emergency,authorizing a hiring freeze across state agencies,and requiring certain spending cuts.the executive order required each state agency to eliminate thirty percent of all authorized trust service positions.relevant to this case,trust service employees one of several categories of employment types within the puerto rico government could be freely remove d,or,in other words,terminated without cause.
shortly after the executive order was issued,each of the plaintiffs all of whom were trust employees was let go either in february or march,by way of written termination letters signed by berlingeri.the termination letters which were all identical in substance did not provide a specific reason for the firings,citing only to the regulations allowing for trust service employees to be freely selected and freely dismissed.berlingeri has since asserted that some of the workers were fired based on the recommendation of their immediate supervisors because of their poor work performance others,she claimed,were fired due to the budget cuts.
b.the long procedural history 
wasting no time,in march,the workers sued fortuño,his chief of staff blanco,his administrator berlingeri,and his wife,first lady luz vela gutiérrez vela,asserting that each of the defendants had a role in their allegedly unlawful terminations and claiming they were fired because they affiliated with political parties.the workers complaint brought claims alleging violation of their due process and equal protection rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments and their right to free speech under the first amendment they also sought relief under numerous puerto rico laws and the puerto rico constitution.
in july,the defendants moved to dismiss the workers claims,arguing that the complaint failed to state a plausible claim for relief.the district court allowed that motion and dismissed all of the federal and state claims against all of the defendants.
apparently abandoning their due process claim,the employees appealed only the dismissal of their first amendment and state law causes of action we vacated the dismissal of those claims and remanded them to the district court.see ocasiohernández fortuño burset,cir.
with the case back before the trial court,discovery ensued.at its close,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining political discrimination claim,arguing that the workers could not show that the defendants knew of their political views or that politics was a reason for the terminations.in a written order,the court allowed the motion as to fortuño,vela,and blanco on the grounds that there was no evidence that these defendants were aware of the workers political affiliations or that they were personally involved in the terminations.the court held off on berlingeri because it wanted to engage in additional and deeper analysis and hear oral argument before deciding whether to dismiss the claim against her.the court later ended up dismissing berlingeri from the case as well,in a separate written decision concluding that there was insufficient evidence that political affiliation was the reason for the dismissals the workers then moved the district court to reconsider its judgment,which the court denied.
the workers now bring the case to us once again on resurgence,they ask us to reverse the district court summary judgment disposal of their first amendment claim,as well as the court subsequent denial of their motion to amend the judgment.
we address both rulings in turn.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.velázquez pérez,at.summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we consider a dispute genuine if a reasonable jury,drawing favorable inferences,could resolve it in favor of the nonmoving party.velázquez pérez,at citation and quotations omitted.but c onclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation are insufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact.id.citation and quotations omitted.
to succeed in showing that there is no genuine dispute of material fact,the moving party must direct us to specific evidence in the record that would be admissible at trial.that is,it must affirmatively produce evidence that negates an essential element of the party claim,or,using evidentiary materials already on file demonstrate that the party will be unable to carry its burden of persuasion at trial.carmona toledo,cir citations omitted.i f the summary judgment record satisfactorily demonstrates that the plaintiff case is,and may be expected to remain,deficient in vital evidentiary support,this may suffice to show that the movant has met its initial burden.id.at.
iii.discussion 
summary judgment 
the dispute before us arises from the well established constitutional mandate prohibiting government officials from firing public employees on the basis of their political affiliations to prove political discrimination,the workers must show that they and the defendants have opposing political affiliations,the defendants were aware of the workers political affiliations,an adverse employment action,an employment termination occurred,and political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.ocasio hernández,at.
here,the district court held in a written ruling that the workers failed to come up with any evidence to the effect that fortuño,vela,and blanco were aware of their adverse political affiliation,and as such,that partisan politics played a substantial or motivating role in the terminations later,in a separate written ruling addressing the remaining defendant,berlingeri,the trial judge acknowledged that the parties disagree whether berlingeri had knowledge of plaintiffs political affiliations,but refrain ed from passing judgment on the knowledge requirement because it was dismiss ing plaintiffs claims on alternative grounds,causation.
as we explain below,we agree with the district court that the record lacks sufficient evidence that fortuño,vela,and blanco were aware of the plaintiffs political affiliations.and,although the district court did not address berlingeri knowledge,we conclude that the record does not provide enough evidence of hers either,and affirm both summary judgment rulings on that ground 
we delve into our discussion by first noting that the workers opening brief does not address the sufficiency of evidence of knowledge,focusing instead on causation.at oral argument,counsel explained the workers position that given that the trial judge did not decide knowledge,that issue was to be decided in favor of the plaintiff,and that for purposes of appeal,the court must assume that the defendants knew of the workers political affiliation.
as we suggested at oral argument,counsel statement is incorrect in three respects.
first,the workers appear to have imparted a holding that was specific to berlingeri on the rest of the defendants.as we noted above,the district court did rule on knowledge as to defendants fortuño,blanco,and vela,but separately from its ruling on berlingeri 
second,the workers incorrectly suggest that the district court choice not to address berlingeri knowledge equated to a ruling in their favor on that particular issue.
third,based on their misapprehension that the district court ruled in their favor on berlingeri knowledge,the workers assume that we are now obligated to adopt the district court ruling in that regard,thus choosing to focus their arguments on the causation element.
here are the problems with the workers logic.on de novo review of a summary judgment motion,we undertake the same inquiry as the district court we look at whether the supported facts,when considered as a whole,are legally sufficient to satisfy each element of a claim.here,the district court did not decide one way or another whether the knowledge element was satisfied as to berlingeri.it simply found that there was insufficient evidence in the record to satisfy a different element of the workers claim,causation,and dismissed berlingeri on that ground.
even if the district court had ruled,in the workers favor,that the record showed sufficient evidence of berlingeri knowledge,on de novo review,we do not just assume the district court was correct in its ruling.rather,we take a fresh look at the record to determine for ourselves whether the plaintiffs met their evidentiary burden in so doing,we are not bound by the district court decisional calculus but,rather,may affirm the decision below on any ground made manifest by the record.ruiz bally total fitness holding,cir.
as we will explain,upon our review of the record,a jury could not reasonably infer that any of the defendants were aware of the workers political affiliations.because the plaintiffs case fails on that element,we need not address any others.
even though the workers mistakenly presumed that the knowledge element was satisfied as to all of the defendants,we gave the workers a chance at oral argument to point us to what,if any,evidence in the record suggests that any of the defendants were aware of their political affiliations.the workers conceded that the record offered no direct evidence that the defendants knew of their political inclinations,but urged us to infer that because the workers were hired by a prior administration,the defendants must have known that they were not affiliated with fortuño party.
we recognize that political discrimination,which often turns on an employer cloaked motives,can be hard for a worker to to prove.in so recognizing,we have consistently held that circumstantial evidence can suffice to show a defendant knowledge of a plaintiff political party.see,martinez vélez rey hernández,cir noting that a jury could reasonably infer that the defendant was aware of the plaintiff npp affiliation based on testimony that the plaintiff spoke openly about her political views and sat in the npp portion of the de facto segregated cafeteria.we have also held that a government official knowledge that an employee was hired by a prior administration when considered in tandem with other relevant facts could certainly help prove the defendant knowledge of the employee political affiliation.see,anthony sundlun,cir given the nature of the employees positions,the defendants knowledge that the plaintiffs had originally been hired by the previous administration,the timing of the moves,the identities of those consulted,the lack of any legitimate reason for ousting the incumbents,and the partisan connections of the replacement workers,it seems disingenuous to suggest that the defendant acted without regard to the politics of the situation.
beside the fact that here,the workers argument lies on a shaky factual premise the defendants claim,and the workers do not refute,that two of the plaintiffs were actually hired under an npp administration,more generally,a defendant mere knowledge that an employee was hired by a prior governor without more is not sufficient to show political discrimination.were that the case,a newly elected governor could never impose or other legitimate layoffs.see martinez vélez,at concluding that if reorganization was hatched as a plan to clear the decks of npp employees so that pdp employees could be favored,it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery and offer the evidence at trial.liability without such proof would effectively preclude any reorganization that happens to affect adversely employees connected to the previously dominant party.
significantly,as the defendants have pointed out,the workers here have directed us to no evidence showing that the defendants they sued had knowledge of their particular political affiliations.the record actually suggests the opposite a number of the plaintiffs testified at their depositions that mansion employees did not usually discuss at work the political parties to which they belonged,employees political affiliations were not common knowledge within the mansion,and the plaintiffs did not discuss politics in general at work.the workers have directed us to no evidence in the voluminous record to refute the veracity of their own testimony.see torres martínez dep t of,cir a s to issues on which the summary judgment target s bear the ultimate burden of proof,they can not rely on an absence of competent evidence,but must affirmatively point to specific facts that demonstrate the existence of an authentic dispute.citation and quotations omitted.when all is said and done,the workers have offered no proof that others in the mansion let alone the higher ups had knowledge of their political leanings.as we have held in the past,while an incoming administration may not use a systematic reorganization to effectuate otherwise impermissible terminations,in order to defeat summary judgment,the plaintiffs have the burden of directing us to sufficient record evidence to create a triable issue.rodríguez sanchez municipality of santa isabel,cir citation omitted.
we acknowledge that it is certainly curious that more than a dozen workers almost none of whom affiliated with their new boss political party were all terminated within a couple months of the new governor move into the mansion but we can not allow a case to proceed to trial based on unsubstantiated suspicion.the workers do not even offer generalized statistical evidence showing how many npp employees were retained after the layoffs as compared to employees,whether npp employees were also given the boot,or whether the terminated workers were replaced with npp affiliates.see anthony,at noting that even though the record showed that most of the ousted plaintiffs were replaced by members of the opposing political party,these raw numbers alone still are likely insufficient to ground a finding of patronage dismissal figueroa serrano ramos alverio,cir noting that in their unsuccessful attempt to defeat summary judgment,plaintiffs most viable claim,the allegation that similarly situated opposing party members were not fired,lacked factual support,and that plaintiffs failed to provide names or other specific factual information supporting their claim that the government replaced them with new hires from the opposing political party.because the workers have simply failed to meet their burden,we must affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
motion to alter judgment 
the workers also argue that the district court erred in denying their request to reconsider the judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil p
