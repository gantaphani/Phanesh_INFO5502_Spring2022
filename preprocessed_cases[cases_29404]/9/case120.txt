standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party favor.maldonado denis castillo rodriguez,cir.in a wrongful discharge case under the adea,the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that her age was the determinative factor in her discharge,that is,that she would not have been fired but for her age.freeman package mach,cir.where there is no direct proof of discrimination,as is the case here,we apply the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,which has been adapted for adea cases.woodman haemonetics,cir.
under the mcdonnell douglas framework,the plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case for age discrimination by showing that i she was at least ii her work was sufficient to meet the employer legitimate expectations iii her employer took adverse action against her and iv either younger persons were retained in the same position upon her termination or the employer did not treat age neutrally in taking the adverse action.brennan gte gov t,cir.once the plaintiff establishes her prima facie case,there is a rebuttable presumption of discrimination,and the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for dismissing the employee.id.if the employer does so,the presumption vanishes and the burden shifts once again.this time,the plaintiff is required to show that the employer proffered reason is but a pretext,and that age was the cause of the employer adverse action.v√©lez thermo king de,cir quoting gross fbl fin,d.
ii.the age discrimination claim 
on the motion for summary judgment below,the district court assumed that del valle santana had established a prima facie case,and accepted the defendants proffered reason that the termination was a result of the unexpected budget cuts.the district court then granted judgment in the defendants favor on grounds that del valle santana had failed to show that this reason was pretext and that the termination was motivated by age animus.having reviewed the record,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the defendants,but do so on the ground that del valle santana failed to establish a prima facie case for age discrimination see hodgens dynamics,cir we will affirm a correct result reached by the court below on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.citation omitted.
there is no dispute that del valle santana has satisfied the first three elements of the prima facie case i she was over years old when she was terminated ii her work met the employer legitimate expectations until the time of her termination and iii her termination constitutes an adverse employment action.the parties disagree as to whether she has established the fourth element that younger persons were retained in her same position after she was terminated or that the defendants otherwise did not treat age neutrally in their decision to terminate her.see brennan,at.
the defendants argue that younger employees were not retained in the same position because the appeals unit director position was unique,and remained unoccupied after the appeals unit was completely eliminated as a result of the budget cuts.del valle santana disagrees,arguing that when slpr transferred her over to the appeals unit in the first place,they called it a lateral move.therefore,she contends the appeals unit director position was not unique,and the younger,directors who were retained in other slpr offices remained in the same director position she had held before she was terminated.at the very least,she says,whether these director positions were the same or different is a disputed issue that should be submitted to a jury.
we do not need to make a decision on the question of whether the appeals unit director position was the same as the other director positions because even if we assume,favorably to the plaintiff,that they were the same,del valle santana still fails to state a prima facie case.del valle santana fails to show that the younger employees who occupied these assumedly same positions were significantly younger than her.see consol.coin caterers,d.as the supreme court explained in,a prima facie case of age discrimination requires evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on an illegal discriminatory criterion,and such an inference can not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger.id.at emphasis added citation omitted.applying,this court has held that a age difference between a plaintiff and his replacement is too insignificant to support a prima facie case of age discrimination.williams raytheon,cir.
while the burden of establishing a prima facie case is not onerous,the plaintiff is still required to prove the prima facie elements by a preponderance of the evidence.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.here,the sole piece of evidence del valle santana has produced to prove that younger employees were retained in her position after she was terminated is a single paragraph in her affidavit that states several younger directors with less experience and seniority were not fired.these were yolanda bonilla,eduardo escribano,roberto laboy,consuelo melendez,janice gutierrez and jamila canario.del valle santana does not provide the actual ages of these other directors in her affidavit,nor is there anything in the record that would otherwise indicate that thes
