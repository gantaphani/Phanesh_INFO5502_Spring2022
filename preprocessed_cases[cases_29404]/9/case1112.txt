a federal prison inmate pro se appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,dismissing his claim against the united states based on the allegation that a prison officer negligently detained and lost his property during his transfer from one cell to another.the federal tort claims act ftca waives the sovereign immunity of the united states for certain civil actions,with various exceptions,and vests jurisdiction in the district courts.b,a n.the district court dismissed the claim on the ground that c,one of the exceptions to the ftca waiver,bars jurisdiction for claims involving the detention of goods by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.the court ruled that a prison officer is such an other law enforcement officer.we conclude that the phrase any other law enforcement officer,as used in c,references only law enforcement officers who are functioning in a capacity akin to that of a customs or excise officer.since plaintiff claim is not barred by c,we vacate the judgment in relevant part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
abc is a federal prisoner whose name is concealed in this opinion and in the caption the district court proceedings are largely under seal including the opinion reviewed on this appeal and our statement of facts accepted as true by the district court is spare.
sometime in,the government came to believe that information regarding abc cooperation with the authorities might have been disclosed to other prisoners.for his safety,abc was transferred to a special housing unit.he was told by a prison official that certain property in his cell and in storage would be transferred with him.about six weeks after the transfer,abc surveyed his property and discovered that many items were missing.he brought this action seeking money damages against the united states,the united states department of justice doj,and the federal bureau of prisons bop,alleging that the loss of his property was the result of negligence by federal prison officials during the transfer abc claims against the doj and the bop were dismissed because the ftca does not permit suits against federal agencies,see mignogna sair aviation,cir see also a,a ruling that is not contested on appeal.as to abc claim against the united states,the district court concluded that there was no waiver of sovereign immunity and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction because the bop official responsible for transferring abc property was an other law enforcement officer under c.this appeal followed.
in relevant part,the ftca vests the district courts with 
exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages for injury or loss of property caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.this is a broad waiver of sovereign immunity,kosak united states,d but it is subject to numerous exceptions,see a n.relevant here,c excepts claims regarding the detention of property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.
the government contends that any other law enforcement officer should be read broadly to encompass any law enforcement officer who has detained any property in any law enforcement context.abc contends that the phrase should be read more narrowly,in light of the surrounding text,to reference only law enforcement officers who are acting in a customs or excise capacity

the issue first arose in this circuit in formula one motors,united states,in which agents of the drug enforcement administration dea had seized a car being shipped to the united states from italy,searched it for illegal drugs,and allegedly damaged the car in the process,cir.in discussing whether the ftca permitted suit against the united states,we observed that c might suggest a more narrow reading of the exception than the one advanced then as now by the government but we did not so hold because we concluded that the dea agents were performing a function sufficiently akin to the functions carried out by customs officials accordingly,we held that the agents conduct was within the scope of section c.id.at.
we now join a sound minority of the courts of appeals,and conclude that the phrase other law enforcement officer in c references only law enforcement officers whose function or authority are related to customs or excise functions see id.at holding that c applied to the detention of an automobile still in transit from overseas because the detention was sufficiently akin to the functions carried out by customs officials 
the starting point of our analysis of these competing interpretations must,of course,be the language of c.kosak united states,d.we look first to the plain and commonsense meaning of the statute.united states dauray,cir.
without context,the phrase any other law enforcement officer would mean as the government argues anyone who is a law enforcement officer.but statutes are not construed in isolation the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.king vincent,d.section c exception to the ftca waiver of immunity is expressed in two phrases as marked 
any claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection or any tax or customs duty,or the detention of any goods,merchandise,or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer 
the first phrase relates only to the customs and excise functions of government.the second phrase,which concerns the detention of property by any other law enforcement officer,is similarly confined by context to customs and excise.
if any other law enforcement officer were read to mean any law enforcement officer doing anything,then the immediately preceding language regarding any officer of customs or excise would be superfluous.but,as a general proposition of statutory interpretation,we are counseled to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,and to render none superfluous.collazos united states,cir quoting duncan walker,d see also tablie gonzales,cir concluding that a proffered construction reduction of statutory language to surplusage was fatal.
the government contends that abc reading does violence to the statutory language by replacing what congress actually said any other law enforcement officer with something congress did not any other law enforcement officer acting in a customs or excise capacity.but statutes are drawn to be to be read in context.when a general term such as any other law enforcement officer follows the enumeration of specific types of law enforcement officers,the general term is often understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one s with specific enumeration.norfolk ry.am.train dispatchers ass n,d.to the extent the phrase any law enforcement officer is ambiguous,the meaning of doubtful terms or phrases may be determined by reference to their relationship with other associated words or phrases.dauray,at.as the district of columbia circuit explained in interpreting c if a statute lists fishing rods,nets,hooks,bobbers,sinkers and other equipment,other equipment might mean plastic worms and fishing line,but not snow shovels or baseball bats.bazuaye united states,citation omitted
