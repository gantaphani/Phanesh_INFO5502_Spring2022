john collins filed suit against alco parking corporation alco,alleging that the company fired him because of his age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,et.the jury returned a verdict in favor of alco,and the district court entered final judgment accordingly.collins now appeals from that order.the appeal raises a number of interesting questions about the application of the doctrine of plain error under this court jurisprudence,and we take this opportunity to explicate them.we will affirm.
collins worked for alco parking corporation for nine years,first as a attendant and then as a lot manager.this case revolves around an incident in which a customer,john miller,was overcharged by one of the company employees.miller parked two cars in the lot.although the fixed rate was per car,miller paid per car.the next day,he called the company to complain of the overcharge.
at trial,the parties presented dramatically different accounts of what happened next.alco claimed that collins confessed to having taken the extra money and that this was the reason for his termination.four employees testified that they heard collins confession.
collins denied making a confession and presented evidence purporting to prove that he was not and could not have been the employee of whom miller complained.specifically,collins asserted that on the day in question he was working inside the lot,where he directed traffic and kept count of spaces.according to collins,any customer who obtained parking in the lot would have first encountered two other employees the flag man,whose job was to direct customers from the street into the lot and the cash man,who sat in the booth,collected fees and let customers through the gate.under this arrangement,collins insists,he would only have interacted with a customer,if at all,after the customer had already paid his fees.
collins identified several additional problems with the company story.miller said he was overcharged by a haired man wearing a parking jacket,but this description fit the flag man and the cash man as well as collins.moreover,collins alleged,the flag man had been disciplined in the past for soliciting extra money from customers,and the cash man turned in a false report of the payments made on the day in question.collins,in contrast,had never been the subject of a complaint during his nine years of work nor had he ever been disciplined for violating company policies.collins further alleged that alco knew that he was not responsible for the overcharge,and that the company fired him anyway because the employee at fault was hard to discipline due to his union membership.
the jury rendered a verdict for alco,and the district court entered judgment accordingly.collins raises two issues on appeal the district court instruction concerning the availability of attorney fees,and the district court instruction on pretext.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.where a party properly objects to a jury instruction under,we exercise plenary review to determine whether the instruction misstated the applicable law.franklin prescriptions,new york times,cir citations omitted.where a party fails to object properly,we may review for plain error in the instructions affecting substantial rights.id.quoting.d.
collins contends that the plain error standard is inapposite because he complied with the requirements of rule c.we disagree.with respect to the attorney fee instruction,collins notes that at the charging conference he told the district court that attorney fees are not something the jury decides on.they done on a fee petition to the court purely as a legal matter.app.however,it is far from clear that this observation apprised the district court that it was not allowed to deliver its proposed instruction.indeed,collins prefaced his observation by stating i honestly do know what the law is on the instruction on attorney fees.i never seen it before.given his own doubt as to the propriety of giving the instruction,collins comment can hardly be considered an objection.moreover,collins did not cite any authority holding that the instruction was error,did not explain why the instruction might cause him harm,conceded that the instruction contained a correct statement of the law,expressed his uncertainty as to the propriety of the instruction at the wrong time when the district court had asked only for objections challenging the correctness of the instructions,not the propriety of giving them,and failed to raise his concern at the right time when the district court asked the parties if they thought that the court should not give any of its proposed instructions.under these circumstances,we can not say that collins registered an objection to the attorney fee instruction,much less that he stat ed distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection,as required by rule.
as to the pretext instruction,collins does not cite any portion of the record in which he objected to the district court instruction.collins did offer alternative instructions,but m erely proposing a jury instruction that differs from the charge given is insufficient to preserve an objection.franklin prescriptions,new york times,cir citations omitted.
collins invokes united states russell,cir,and smith borough of wilkinsburg,cir,for the proposition that a party complies with rule by putting the trial judge on notice of the requirements for a proper charge.collins reply br.at.neither case is availing here.unlike the appellant in russell which interpreted an analogous provision of the federal rules of criminal procedure,collins did not inform the court that the instructions in question were erroneous.and smith simply affirmed the proposition that a definitive ruling from the trial court rejecting a requested instruction is sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.at.collins does not point to any explicit rejection of his proposed instructions,and mere omission of a requested instruction from the final charge does not constitute a definitive ruling excusing the failure the object for purposes of appeal.d b amendment to rule,explaining that a party who does not properly object to a court decision not to give a proposed instruction may only assign that decision as error if the court made a definitive ruling on the record rejecting the request.emphasis added.hence,smith is likewise inapposite.
both instructions are thus properly reviewed for plain error.under the discretionary plain error standard,we will reverse the trial court only where a plain error was fundamental and highly prejudicial,such that the instructions failed to provide the jury with adequate guidance and our refusal to consider the issue would result in a miscarriage of justice.franklin prescriptions,new york times,cir quotations omitted.
turning to the merits,collins first challenges the following instruction on attorney fees 
you are instructed that if plaintiff wins on his claim,he may be entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs over and above what you award as damages.it is my duty to decide whether to award attorney fees and costs,and if so,how much.therefore,attorney fees and costs should play no part in your calculation of any damages.
app.because collins concedes that the above statement correctly sets forth the law,the only issue is whether the district court committed plain error affecting substantial rights by giving the instruction at all.collins contends that the instruction was error because it may have caused the jury to decide the case against him in order to avoid handing him a windfall in the form of attorney fees.
we need not and do not decide now whether a district court commits error by informing a jury about the availability of attorney fees in an adea case.assuming arguendo that an error occurred,such error is not plain,for two reasons.
first,error is plain only where the proper course is clear under current law.franklin prescriptions,at quoting united states vazquez,cir en banc.colli
