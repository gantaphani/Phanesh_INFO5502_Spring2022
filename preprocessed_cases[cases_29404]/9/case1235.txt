after being placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,thomas,a teacher working for the wethersfield board of education,was invited back to work conditioned on a psychiatric examination and his release of past medical records.lawsuit in state court,removed to federal court,asserted procedural and substantive due process claims in opposition to the board conditions.the district court granted summary judgment for the board.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
thomas,an english teacher and track coach,started teaching in the wethersfield public schools in and achieved tenure under the connecticut teacher tenure act,before this case began.in early,the wethersfield board of education received a number of complaints from students,their parents,and other teachers about behavior.these complaints included allegations that used foul language and made sexual remarks to students,yelled at a fellow teacher,and breached school security.after meeting with on march,the assistant superintendent of schools,robert buganski,placed him on administrative leave with pay and without prejudice pending the outcome of an investigation into the complaints.
a few days later,cardiologist,fred rubin,wrote to buganski that was ill with chest pain,anxious,and depressed,and that rubin had advised to take an indefinite leave of absence.remained suspended with full pay.
during the summer and into the fall,the board investigated the charges against.as the investigation was nearing completion in late october,buganski wrote to requesting the medical assessment of fitness to resume teaching that had promised to provide during a meeting with buganski in august.on october,rubin wrote to buganski that 
is doing well from a cardiac standpoint and,from that view,he could return to work.however,i am extremely concerned about his severe anxiety and worry that this will affect his health problems.however,i am not a psychiatrist nor am i his general physician.i would strongly suggest that these issues be directed to his general physician.
on november,lynne pierson,the superintendent of schools,issued a report summarizing the results of the board investigation into conduct.although the investigation did not bear out all of the initial allegations,superintendent pierson concluded that had violated the standards of conduct for a teacher in many respects.pierson did not recommend firing.instead,she informed that he would,on pain of termination,have to work with the administration to improve his performance.pierson instructed to schedule a meeting to develop a remediation plan the record does not indicate whether he did so.
on november,the day after pierson issued the report,assistant superintendent buganski wrote to that it appears that you are medically cleared to return to work but requested that contact buganski immediately to confirm his ability to return to work.buganski further noted,if,however,your health prevents you from returning to work at this time,you will be placed on sick leave pending review of documentation concerning any such health issues.informed the board that he had an appointment with rubin on november,and expected rubin to certify the next day that he could return to work.
no letter from rubin was immediately forthcoming.superintendent pierson decided that in light of both failure to certify that he could return to work and the contents of rubin october,letter which adverted to severe anxiety,should submit to an independent psychiatric evaluation.in a letter dated december,pierson instructed to schedule an appointment with harold schwartz,a psychiatrist,and enclosed a release form for to sign.the release form would have authorized the recipient to release medical records to schwartz and to the wethersfield board of education or any of its representatives.it placed no time or limitations on the records to be released.
hired a lawyer,who objected by letter to both the psychiatric examination and the release form.without signing the release,scheduled the examination.on january,schwartz interviewed for approximately two hours.schwartz told that he would need to conduct more interviews,administer psychological tests,and review records from treatment for alcoholism some thirteen years earlier at a facility called arms acres.these records included written responses to questions like the following how did you learn about sex explain have you ever masturbated at what age did you begin masturbation how had you been taught to feel about masturbation explain have you ever had significant problems with sexuality or sexual functioning schwartz asked to sign the release form that superintendent pierson had sent in december.
as of january,had neither seen schwartz again nor executed the release form when the board lawyers wrote to him insisting that he do both if he wanted to keep his job.responded within the week with letters to the board from both rubin and eric shore,doctor,attesting that was healthy enough to teach.on january,went to his own psychiatrist,les smith,who wrote a letter much later,on march,stating that is not currently disabled by a psychiatric disorder and is able to return to work at this time.
next sued the board and its various employees in connecticut superior court on january seeking,under federal and state law,an injunction against being sent to schwartz and money damages.that same day,lawyer wrote the board attorneys that,in light of the board threat to discipline for insubordination if he did not see schwartz,had scheduled an appointment with schwartz and would allow rubin to speak with schwartz about cardiac condition.in response,superintendent pierson wrote insisting that he see schwartz and sign the release form.she also noted that because of lawsuit challenging the board requirement that he see schwartz,i have advised schwartz not to proceed further with his evaluation until the superior court has ruled on your motion for a permanent injunction.you will remain on medial sic leave until the issue has been resolved.
complaint contained a claim under for violation of his constitutional rights.based on this federal claim,on february,the board removed the case to the united states district court for the district of connecticut robert chatigny,chief judge pursuant to b.
as discovery and briefing on for summary judgment proceeded throughout the year,settlement conferences overseen by the district court were fruitless.meanwhile,on november,buganski advised by letter that had been using up sick leave since november,and that his sick pay would run out on november,which it did.on december,the board lawyer reiterated to that he could not return to work until he saw schwartz and signed the release with no restrictions on the records to be reviewed and conversely,on the information that schwartz may share with pierson.
in late february,magistrate judge donna martinez,upon referral from judge chatigny of for summary judgment,recommended summary judgment in the defendants favor on the two procedural due process and the two substantive due process claims that she deemed raised by the complaint,and remanding the claims to the connecticut superior court.
on march,judge chatigny adopted judge martinez recommendation as to the procedural due process claims,but deferred ruling on the substantive due process claims and declined to decide whether superintendent pierson,the only defendant sued in her individual capacity,was entitled to qualified immunity.on september,judge chatigny,upon reconsideration,adhered to his earlier ruling,but found that superintendent pierson was entitled to qualified immunity,a ruling that has not appealed.because the only claims on appeal are against the board and its employees in their official capacity,we refer to the defendants collectively as the board.
also on september,the parties informed the district court that because schwartz was no longer willing to see,they agreed that would see a new psychiatrist,howard zonana.between october and december,zonana examined on four occasions,administered psychological tests,and reviewed the records from arms acres related to alcoholism treatment.never executed the release that the board had originally requested and instead released his medical records only to zonana.on december,zonana wrote pierson that suffered no psychiatric disability that would prevent him from teaching,and on january,resumed teaching.
settlement conferences in came to naught.meanwhile,the parties litigated a second state suit featuring only claims that filed after the district court first summary judgment ruling.in september,received a jury verdict in his favor on his claim.
the moribund district court proceedings resumed when,on october,judge chatigny granted summary judgment in the board favor on the substantive due process claims that had been left undecided in march.on december,the district court entered judgment in the board favor on all of federal claims and remanded the case to state court.appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to the board.see green mountain vermont,cir.because lost below,we construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.id.summary judgment is warranted only if the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
before we proceed to the merits,we must dispose of the board argument that we should rule in their favor based on claim preclusion res judicata even though it was not raised below.the board makes the unsupported,and unsupportable,assertion that its argument goes to jurisdiction and we must therefore entertain it.the board also asserts that it raised claim preclusion throughout the litigation,but to support this assertion,it primarily cites documents filed in state court.
claim preclusion is an affirmative defense it does not go to jurisdiction.see rivet regions bank of,d see also.c.although the board correctly notes that mootness goes to federal jurisdiction,see muhammad city of dep t of,cir,the doctrines of mootness and claim preclusion are distinct,and the board has not raised any credible claim that case is moot.
because claim preclusion is an affirmative defense,the board was obligated to raise it in the district court.see market share,sterling bank,cir.the district court record does not reveal any reference by the board to its argument.the board has provided this court with a copy of a letter addressed to judge chatigny dated october,requesting a briefing schedule on the subject,but the district court did not docket the letter.even if it received the letter,the district court could not have entered judgment based on claim preclusion unless the board moved for judgment on that basis,which it did not.a motion by the board raising the defense when it became available would have preserved the issue for appeal a letter asking for a briefing schedule,which was not followed up,did not the board waived this defense,and we thus proceed to the merits,beginning with procedural due process claims.
procedural due process claims 
advances two procedural due process claims.he raises both a classic procedural due process claim,arguing that he was deprived of his property without due process,and a claim based on the theory that his liberty interest in his reputation was infringed by the board.
the claim need not detain us long.to succeed on such a claim,must prove two things some action by the board imposing a tangible and material burden,and utterance of a false statement that damaged his reputation in connection with the burdensome action.velez levy,cir.the magistrate judge concluded that had not alleged the utterance of any false statement and that his claim therefore necessarily failed.the district court adopted this reasoning and granted summary judgment on the claim in the board favor.
cursory argument for reversing the district court on this point cites brandt board of cooperative educational services,cir,for the proposition that in the employment context,the stigmatizing false statement on which a claim is based need not be publicized but need only be placed in an employee personnel file where it is likely to be disclosed to future employers.brandt is beside the point because does not allege that the board made any false statement that stigmatized him,either publicly or in materials in his personnel file.both complaint and his brief on appeal posit that his stigma arose from the board actions,not from its statements in effect,has alleged the plus without the stigma,and argues that the plus alone has created the stigma.even if is correct that townsfolk drew negative inferences from his suspension,this is not enough to make out a claim.the district court properly granted summary judgment in the board favor on this claim.
procedural due process claim is more substantial.to determine whether a plaintiff was deprived of property without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment,we must first identify the property interest involved.next,we must determine whether the plaintiff received constitutionally adequate process in the course of the deprivation.see harhay town of ellington bd.of,cir.
identifying the relevant property interest is also a process.see ciambriello county of nassau,cir.first,we must determine whether some source of law other than the constitution,such as a state or federal statute,confers a property right on the plaintiff.
property interests,of course,are not created by the constitution.rather,they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.
bd.of regents of state colleges roth,d.once such a property right is found,we must determine whether that property right constitutes a property interest for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.town of castle rock gonzales,d.
no one doubts that,as a tenured teacher,has a legitimate claim of entitlement to his position under connecticut law.see.d.and it is well established that the property interest of government employees who may only be discharged for cause,such as tenured teachers,is a constitutionally protected property interest for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.see,cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d strong bd.of,cir.thus if had been fired,the constitution would have required the board to provide him with certain procedural protections.
but the board did not fire it placed him on sick leave,and his sick pay ran out while the suit was ongoing.because both the degree of deprivation suffered by and the procedures available to him to challenge that deprivation differ in the periods before and after his sick pay ran out,our due process analysis requires that we examine each period separately.
before doing so,however,we reject a threshold argument raised by the board.the board asserts that we need not assess the nature of property right in his position or what process he was afforded because the board did not deprive of any property right.according to the board,it simply left on sick status his physician he agreed to see a psychiatrist of the board choosing,and therefore own actions occasioned the deprivation.
the fact that initially asked to be put on sick leave is true but irrelevant.once informed the board on january,that he was healthy enough to return to work and wanted to do so,his sick leave became involuntary sick leave was not rendered voluntary by his refusal to comply with the conditions that the board required him to fulfill before returning to work.
moreover,whether the board was justified in conditioning return to work on his acceding to its demands is a separate question from whether was deprived of a property right.if a tenured employee is fired,he is deprived of a property right,even if he can not recover damages for his firing because he was fired for good cause pursuant to adequate procedures.similarly,whether was deprived of a property right is an entirely separate question from whether that deprivation was proper.we therefore reject the board invitation to assume that deserved to be on involuntary sick leave and to conclude,based on that assumption,that he was not deprived of a property right.instead,we will examine the nature of the property rights may have possessed,and determine whether he was deprived of those rights without constitutionally adequate process.
the period after sick leave ran out 
once sick leave ran out,he received no salary and was,in effect,suspended without pay.although the supreme court has not decided whether procedural due process protections extend to employee discipline short of termination,see gilbert homar,d,we have done so in the case of a tenured state employee suspension without pay,see,strong,at narumanchi bd.of trustees of the.state,cir observing that a school decision to suspend the plaintiff without pay implicated a protected property interest.under this circuit case law,therefore,the constitution required the board to provide with adequate procedural protections in relation to placing him on unpaid sick leave,which is the equivalent of suspending him without pay.
to determine whether received the process he was due,we must consider the private interest at stake the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used and the probable value if any of alternative procedures the government interest,including the possible burdens of alternative procedures.mathews eldridge,d see also ciambriello,at applying mathews test.while the ultimate conclusion about procedural adequacy under mathews turns on the full set of pre and procedures available,courts often analyze pre and procedures separately.see,locurto safir,cir.procedures are evaluated not only in light of the general mathews inquiry,but also in terms of the specific due process principle mandating that a deprivation of life,liberty,or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.loudermill,at.quoting mullane cent.hanover bank trust.
conceded in the district court that the grievance procedure outlined in the agreement cba governing wethersfield teachers provided constitutionally adequate process to remedy whatever deprivation he suffered once his sick leave ran out this concession was wise,since grievance procedures are routinely though not always held to provide adequate process.see,harhay,at finding that cba procedures,where unchallenged,provided adequate process narumanchi,at wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir.but ciambriello,at i f the plaintiff was deprived of a property interest,then he was entitled to more due process than the cba afforded him.goetz windsor cent.sch,cir.
in relation to his being on unpaid sick leave,therefore,has only one claim that he was provided constitutionally inadequate process.to prevail on this claim he would have to demonstrate that even in light of the procedure he received in the form of the grievance process,the process he received was so inadequate that it violated the constitution.see loudermill,at.t he existence of procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures.because he can not do so in light of the undisputed facts,the district court properly granted summary judgment in the board favor on this claim.
process need not be elaborate.id.at.its primary function is to serve as an initial check against mistaken decisions id.because process serves a limited function,the constitution mandates only that such process include,at a minimum,notice and the opportunity to respond.id.at.although disputes whether he was properly notified in the fall of that he would be placed on sick leave if he did not return to work,by the time his sick leave was about to expire in he knew both that he was on sick leave and that his sick leave was running out.further,had voiced his objections to being placed on sick leave first through informal communications from his attorney to the board,and later through his lawsuit.he thus received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard,which is all the process the constitution requires under the circumstances.
moreover,the hearing before superintendent pierson to which argues he was entitled would have been futile.as we stated in strong when we rejected a similar argument,the parties were well aware of each other assertions and any further hearing would have amounted to an empty formality.at.any speculation that pierson might have changed her mind at a hearing is easily answered by the fact that she stood by her demands in the face of litigation.in sum,because received constitutionally sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard in writing,nothing required the board to also afford him a hearing to raise the same objections he had already put forth.see ezekwo nyc health hosps,cir.
the period while was receiving sick pay 
we now turn to the merits of procedural due process claim relative to the period during which he was receiving sick pay.the district court held,in its march,oral ruling,that the grievance procedure provided an adequate remedy for this period as well.in moving for reconsideration,argued that he was forced to exhaust his sick leave before grieving his situation and that the grievance procedure was therefore an inadequate remedy for the period before his sick leave ran out.in response to this argument,the district court held,first,that because interest in his sick leave was a contract benefit that can be recovered through a breach of contract action,he did not merit a hearing.it further held that even if could not,by prevailing in the grievance proceeding,have his sick leave restored,his property interest in his sick leave benefits did not entitle him to more process than he received.
as discussed in the previous section,received adequate process as to the period after his sick leave ran out.it necessarily follows that he received adequate process for the period during which he was receiving sick pay because his deprivation while on paid sick leave was less onerous than the deprivation he suffered while suspended without pay,he can not have been entitled to more procedure while on paid sick leave than while on unpaid leave.there still remains,however,the question whether received adequate process for the period while he was on paid sick leave,a question the district court did not address upon the motion for reconsideration.
neither this circuit nor the supreme court case law resolves definitively whether accumulated sick leave is a property right that deserves due process protection.compare martz.village of valley stream,cir holding that the right to payment on an ordinary contract is not a constitutionally protected property right,with harhay,at,ciambriello,at,ezekwo,at,and greenwood office of mental health,cir all finding that employees had constitutionally protected property rights in interests other than employment itself.even if it is,however,we do not think that an employee is deprived of his sick leave in any meaningful sense until he suffers a financial loss because of that leave unavailability.in cash terms,an employee who is on paid sick leave is no different from an employee who is on leave and receiving his normal salary.yet no court has held that an employee on fully paid leave has been deprived of a property right merely by virtue of being relieved of his job duties.indeed,such a position would seem to run afoul of loudermill,which observed that a state employer,wishing to terminate an employee immediately without providing the hearing that due process requires,may suspend the employee without pay.at.further,decisions from two circuits have rejected due process claims that were based on an employee asserted property interest in doing his job as opposed to receiving a salary.see swick city of chicago,cir hardiman jefferson county bd.of,cir.
as long as the employee is receiving a paycheck equivalent to his normal salary,that the employee is drawing down his sick leave is a bookkeeping entry with no pecuniary effect.the entry has no consequence until the employee suffers actual financial harm,which could occur in three ways.first,the employee could stop being paid while on sick leave,as eventually occurred here.as noted in the previous section,however,once that occurs,the employee is suspended without pay and therefore is entitled to procedural due process in relation to his suspension.second,he could return to employment,need to take time off for illness,and be deprived of his pay during that time off because his sick leave is exhausted.while this would arguably present a procedural due process problem,we are not faced with such a situation here and need not decide it.finally,if the employee contract allowed him to cash out accumulated sick leave upon separation from his employer,he would suffer a financial loss in the form of a reduced payout upon separation due to improperly attributed sick leave.again,we are not faced with such a situation in this case,nor could we be,since the cba provides that wethersfield teachers may not cash out their benefits.
in this case,we do not think that was deprived of a property right in any meaningful sense until his sick pay ran out.once that happened,was able to grieve his situation.because did not challenge the board assertion below that his sick leave would be fully restored upon a successful grievance,the grievance procedure was an adequate remedy for his loss of sick pay,just as it was for his loss of salary while suspended without pay 
substantive due process claims 
we turn now to substantive due process claims.the district court construed to have raised two distinct substantive due process claims.it considered arguments to be that the board violated his right to privacy,a type of liberty interest,and unconstitutionally deprived him of his property interest as a tenured teacher.on appeal,has narrowed the point to whether the board violated his substantive rights to privacy and to be free from arbitrary governmental action by requesting access to his medical records 
claims center on his argument that the board violated his privacy rights by insisting that he sign a broad release form.the board conditioned return to work on his being examined by schwartz and signing a form that would have authorized the recipient to release medical records to schwartz and to the wethersfield board of education or any of its representatives the form placed no time or limitations on the records to be released,and the board insisted that it had the right to review records schwartz asked for relating to treatment at an facility,arms acres,some thirteen years earlier.
if the constitution forbade the board to require to execute the release,then the board violated his constitutional rights by imposing on him an unconstitutional condition.it is settled law that the government may not,as a general rule,grant even a gratuitous benefit on condition that the beneficiary relinquish a constitutional right.united states oliveras,cir per curiam discussing doctrine see also lingle chevron,d discussing doctrine in relation to takings clause claims dolan city of tigard,d same referring to doctrine of unconstitutional conditions perry sindermann,d.
to determine whether the board violated constitutional rights by insisting on the release,we first identify the right at stake.it is well established that the individual right to privacy is protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see whalen roe,d.the privacy right takes two somewhat different forms the right to personal autonomy,the right to make certain choices free of unwarranted government interference and the right to confidentiality,the right to hold certain information private.see id.at.doe city of new york,cir barry city of new york,cir.this case involves the latter.
medical information in general,and information about a person psychiatric health and history in particular,is information of the most intimate kind.in powell schriver,we held that postoperative transsexuals possess a constitutional right to maintain medical confidentiality about their status,cir.similarly,in doe,we held that i ndividuals who are infected with the hiv virus clearly possess a constitutional right to privacy regarding their condition because,as a more general matter,the right to confidentiality includes the right to protection regarding information about the state of one health.at.in light of these precedents,we easily hold that had a protected privacy right in the medical records sought by the board.
that has a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his records does not,however,mean that he need never disclose them it means that he need not disclose them unless the board has a sufficient interest to justify its request.where a government employer has reason to question whether an employee is medically fit to work,the employer may direct the employee to undergo a medical examination,see gargiul tompkins,cir,overruled on other grounds,gargiul tompkins,cir,and to provide the examining doctor with relevant medical records,see strong,at.in this case,however,the board asked to release records of treatment dating back over thirteen years not only to schwartz,but also to the board itself and its representatives.
the board argues that it was entitled to independently review medical records should it need to take action based on its psychiatrist examination of.in the district court,the board asserted that superintendent pierson needed at least to have the ability to review the raw data,medical records to verify zonana or schwartz conclusion about medical fitness.but pierson has a doctoral degree in education,not medicine.she is not qualified to independently assess medical records and verify a psychiatrist conclusion based on those records.
suppose that the board prevented from returning to teaching because it was worried that his heart condition would prevent him from doing his job,and the board could therefore justifiably have required to see a cardiologist and to provide his records to that doctor.it can scarcely be argued that the board would also have been entitled to review those records in order to verify the cardiologist recommendation.lay people are not qualified to determine other people medical fitness,whether physical or mental that is what independent medical experts are for.if the board did not trust its expert judgment enough to rely on his recommendation,the solution was not for the board to review the medical records,something beyond the board competence,but to send the records and to a different medical expert.
the district court,however,thought that the board was entitled to see medical records.the district court concluded that our precedents required it to apply intermediate scrutiny to substantive due process claims alleging the violation of privacy rights.under this level of scrutiny,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the board,concluding that the board had a legitimate interest in reserving a right to review the file itself in light of any findings and recommendations schwartz might make.we disagree.
in contrast to the district court,we think that the board demand that release his medical records to the board was arbitrary.because the board was not competent to independently evaluate those records,requesting them could serve no legitimate purpose.the board,and the district court,may have been operating from the intuition that because we all make rudimentary assessments of mental competence in our daily,for example,we doubt a friend or relative people are somehow qualified to make such assessments in the workplace.but while psychiatry may not be an exact science,see newman bd.of,cir,it is nonetheless a discipline that can be practiced only by professionals.
when legislation burdens constitutionally protected privacy rights,we will apply intermediate scrutiny and uphold the statute only if a substantial government interest outweighs the burdened privacy right.see doe,at barry,at.the supreme court has,however,set the bar higher for challenges to executive action.see county of sacramento lewis,d c riteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue.to prevail when challenging executive actio
