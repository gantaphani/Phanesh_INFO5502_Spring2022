plaintiff neysa colón appeals from the entry of summary judgment on her claims against infotech aerospace services,for unlawful employment retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act,et.colón infotech aerospace servs,d.the district court dismissed colón case with prejudice on the grounds that,as to the two aspects of her employment at issue,she had neither established a prima facie case of retaliation nor shown that the defendants stated rationales for their purportedly unlawful actions toward her were pretextual.id.at.finding no error in the district court conclusions,we affirm.
defendant infotech aerospace services,ias is a puerto rico corporation specializing in the design and supply of aerospace products for military,commercial,and industrial application.from april,through her resignation on march,colón was employed at ias as a human resources hr generalist,and she was primarily responsible in that capacity for overseeing the benefits and compensation of ias employees.throughout colón term of employment,defendant luis mercado served as ias hr manager,while defendants iveetzia aviléz and jeffrey tracey occupied other supervisory roles within the company.
colón filed this action against the defendants in the district of puerto rico on december.the complaint alleges that beginning in approximately december,colón was subject to several adverse employment actions,including a january demotion and a june suspension,which compelled her to resign from ias.colón asserts that these actions were taken in retaliation for two occasions on which,in the ordinary performance of her duties,she called attention to ias purportedly discriminatory employment practices 
defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on april,asserting that the uncontested facts established that colón had been treated fairly and without retaliation throughout her employment with ias,that ias actions toward colón were taken for bona fide business reasons,and that colón resignation resulted from her own overreact ion to a disciplinary situation.the defendants argued that colón claims should be dismissed with prejudice because she could not establish her prima facie case nor show that ias stated reasons for its actions toward her were pretextual.
on may,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r advising the district court to grant the defendants motion for summary judgment in full.colón infotech aerospace,civil,wl may.the district court ultimately adopted the magistrate judge r r,dismissing colón case with prejudice.colón,d at.this timely appeal followed.
we set out the undisputed facts articulated in the r r and in the district court opinion as to the two allegedly adverse employment actions that colón has emphasized on appeal as the bases for her retaliation claims the january change in her position,which she asserts was a demotion and the june suspension 
a.the january change in position 
colón inadequate preparation of ias affirmative action plan 
in,shortly after she was hired,colón was asked to prepare ias affirmative action plan aap,having represented to the company that she had experience preparing aaps through her previous employer.colón timely completion of this assignment was important because ias could not receive contracts with the federal government without an aap.see,exec.order,authorizing secretary of labor to require submission of aaps by all government contractors see also pts,implementing regulations.
around january,more than a year later,colón submitted a late copy of the aap to her supervisor,luis mercado,who found it to be six months late,incomplete,and a draft.mercado informed colón that her work was acceptable.he,not being an expert in the area,recommended that ias hire an outside consultant to independently evaluate colón progress and complete the whole process.ias retained janice monge,a certified expert in affirmative action,to that end on february.colón was removed from the assignment.
monge completed her review of colón draft aap in july,finding a host of errors and deficiencies of some importance here,while colón version of the aap purported to find compensation discrimination at ias,it did not indicate what methodology was used,what information the conclusion was based on and how colón had reached that conclusion.colón,wl,at.following this evaluation,monge completed a corrected aap for ias in.ias has since retained monge to prepare its annual aap.id.
colón participation in human resources cross training 
in december,mercado expressed to jeff tracey his intention to four hr employees,including colón,in other areas within the hr department the purpose of this exercise was to create a more flexible work force and to ensure that all functions of the human resources department could be performed,even in the absence of the employee who usually performed them.colón was informed of her participation in january and was subsequently assigned to new business partner responsibilities,which made her an hr point person of contact for employees within various ias departments.another hr employee,hermy rosario,assumed colón previous compensation responsibilities.
the complaint alleges that colón new position was a demotion.however,colón job title,salary,and benefits remained the same,and her performance review for,discussed in early,was favorable.moreover,colón had participated in a similar exercise in january,which had also assigned to her some business partner responsibilities.colón,d at.
b.the june suspension 
colón investigation of díaz salary discrimination complaint 
in march,the hr department received a complaint from anayanssi díaz,an employee in ias project management department,regarding an alleged disparity between her compensation and that of a male coworker.as the business partner assigned to project management,colón was asked to prepare a table comparing díaz and the male employee as to salary,experience,education,and other factors relevant to compensation.mercado testified that both he and ias manager,hector rodríguez,explicitly instructed colón that all information pertaining to this investigation was confidential and could not be disclosed except as authorized by mercado colón would later violate this instruction,as recounted below.
a few months later,in may,díaz had a panic attack in an ias restroom and was discovered there by colón and another ias employee.ias referred díaz to the puerto rico state insurance fund sif for evaluation and,on june,an sif investigator,agrimalde pérez,came to ias to interview colón and other witnesses to the panic attack incident.because ias is a secured facility,pérez had to be escorted by an authorized ias employee at all times hermy rosario,the employee who had assumed colón compensation duties during,was assigned that task and remained with or near pérez for the duration of his visit 
colón disclosure of confidential information to the puerto rico state insurance fund and other violations of ias rules 
on june,rosario found a fax transaction report indicating that an ias employee had sent confidential salary information to the sif concerning ias internal investigation of díaz salary discrimination complaint.when mercado later met with colón,she admitted to faxing the information even though it was confidential and she had not requested prior approval from mercado as instructed.this conduct violated several provisions in the ias employee manual 
colón argued,however,that pérez had specifically requested her salary comparison analysis and that she believed disclosure was therefore required by law.mercado decided to contact the sif directly before taking disciplinary action and adjourned the meeting.both the sif and pérez denied requesting the confidential salary information.in fact,pérez testified that colón had independently offered to provide the information and that he had instructed colón,if she could provide it,she could send it by fax.emphasis added.
on june,tracey and aviléz held a meeting with colón,during which colón also admitted to having confidential salary information on her pen drive and her personal h drive on ias server,both violations of ias policy.this was a separate transgression of company rules.colón was asked to transfer that proprietary information to a password protected folder on the company o drive.she was then informed that she was being placed on three days of paid administrative leave while ias investigated the matter further it is this leave which she alleges was retaliatory.tracey and aviléz also told colón that they wished to keep the investigation of her conduct confidential for her privacy and benefit 
at the close of its investigation,ias determined that colón conduct had,in fact,violated company policy.upon her return to work,colón was to receive a final corrective action,or a written warning informing her that future disciplinary infractions might result in termination of her employment.no additional disciplinary action was contemplated at that time.
colón failure to return to work and subsequent resignation 
on the morning of june,the friday before the monday on which colón was scheduled to return to work,aviléz left colón a voice message instructing her to contact tracey in order to retrieve her employee badge,which had been taken away during her suspension and was required to enter ias secure facility.otherwise,colón would have to pick up her badge in ias lobby,jeopardizing the confidentiality of her disciplinary investigation.
colón never contacted tracey and did not report to work on june.instead,colón reported to the sif,claiming that due to aviléz voice message,she was emotionally distressed and feared tracey might attack or even kill her if they met outside ias facilities during the pendency of the sif investigation,ias reserved colón employment,as required by puerto rico law,and kept her position open and available should she decide to return.
on february,the sif closed colón case,finding that her emotional condition was not related to her employment.from that date,colón had fifteen days to request reinstatement before being subject to termination.she did not request reinstatement.rather,ias held colón position open until march,approximately one month later,when she resigned.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.roman potter,cir iverson city of boston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate under this rubric when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we may affirm summary judgment on any basis apparent in the record.chiang verizon new eng,cir.
colón appellate brief raises a host of poorly differentiated to the district court conclusion that,on the undisputed evidence,neither her purported demotion in january nor her suspension in june constituted unlawful employment retaliation.we evaluate these challenges under the familiar burden shifting framework articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see valentín almeyda municipality of aguadilla,cir mcmillan.soc y for prevention of cruelty to animals,cir.
under the mcdonnell douglas framework,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that she engaged in protected conduct,she was subject to an adverse employment action,and a causal connection existed between the first and second elements.noviello city of boston,cir.the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for its challenged actions.provencher cvs pharmacy,div.of melville,cir citing texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.finally,i f the defendant does so,the ultimate burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was the result of the defendant retaliatory animus.fennell first step designs,cir 
a.the january demotion 
the magistrate judge and district court found on the undisputed evidence that colón january participation in,and concurrent removal from aap responsibilities,did not support an employment retaliation claim.two independent grounds supported that conclusion 
colón reassignment to business partner responsibilities did not amount to a materially adverse employment action,as required to establish her prima facie case,colón,wl,at and 
colón failed to show that the defendants explanations for her reassignment to business partner responsibilities were pretextual at the third stage of mcdonnell douglas,id.at.
by failing to address the first ground for summary judgment in her brief,colón has waived any challenge she may have had,see fennell,at,and we could affirm the district court on that basis alone.moreover,on the merits of the issue,the district court rightly concluded that the record did not support colón characterization of her reassignment to business partner responsibilities as materially adverse.colón,d at.

as to the second ground for summary judgment,we briefly describe and reject colón two challenges to the district court analysis on the issue of pretext.first,colón objects to the district court earlier conclusion at the second stage in mcdonnell douglas that ias furnished a legitimate business rationale for reassigning her aap and compensation responsibilities to others.colón argues that because monge did not complete her review of the aap until july,the she allegedly found therein could not justify ias decision six months earlier,in january,to assign colón to exclusively business partner responsibilities but that argument does not go to the defendants independent rationale for her reassignment,namely,that mercado wanted to create a more flexible hr staff by way of the january program.and we agree with the district court that this rationale provides an independent and legitimate basis for the defendants actions.colón,d at.
colón next objection is that,even if the defendants furnished a legitimate business rationale for her participation in,the temporal proximity between that decision and her submission of the aap created a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants true intentions were retaliatory.not so.
as an initial matter,the record does not establish that mercado had even seen the flawed aap colón prepared before deciding that she would participate in.additionally,even if mercado had reviewed colón submission prior to including her among the participants,t he mere proximity of these acts without any indication of discrimination or retaliation does not serve to establish pretext by defendants.colón,wl,at.in fact,the defendants had previously colón in january and,in doing so again in january,assigned three other employees to participate in the program with her.conversely,colón has not produced any evidence to discredit the legitimacy of the defendants stated interest in conducting or to show,as required,that the defendants true motivation was retaliatory animus.see mesnick,cir.
b.the june suspension 
the magistrate judge and district court also concluded that colón june suspension did not give rise to an actionable employment retaliation claim.in so concluding,both judges found that regardless of whether pérez had or had not requested that colón submit the confidential salary information,the defendants had provided two
