opinion of the court 
three detainees in the delaware correctional stevenson,michael manley,and michael an action under against warden thomas carroll,alleging violations of their substantive and procedural due process rights.the district court dismissed their complaint.on appeal,they assert that their allegations of placement in restrictive confinement state valid substantive and procedural due process claims sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.we agree,and remand the case to the district court.
at the time of their complaint,stevenson and manley were awaiting resentencing.both had been convicted and sentenced to death in january,but their sentences were vacated and remanded on or about may.at that time,they were moved off death row,and into the security housing unit shu.stevenson was moved from the shu to a less restrictive facility in december,but was returned to the shu in january.neither one of them received a hearing or explanation for their transfers into the shu.they were both subsequently to death on february.
jones was awaiting trial at the time of the complaint.following a disruption at gander hill prison in wilmington,delaware,he and several other inmates were moved to the shu on or about february.jones asserts that,like stevenson and manley,he was not afforded an explanation or hearing regarding his transfer into more restrictive housing.he does,however,state that he was alleged to have been involved in the riot at gander hill.jones was subsequently found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on september.
the appellants seek relief in the form of a transfer back into the general prison population,monetary damages,and the establishment of a system of review for transfers of pretrial detainees into the shu 
the warden filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,which was granted on december.the district court held that the detainees transfer out of the general prison population into the shu for nonpunitive reasons was within the scope of the prison officials authority with respect to prison management.in its ruling,the district court relied upon sandin conner,d.the plaintiffs appealed from this order on january,review of a dismissal of a complaint under rule b is plenary.lake arnold,cir.
stevenson,manley,and jones present two arguments as to why their complaint should have survived the motion to dismiss.first,they argue that they have sufficiently asserted a liberty interest in being free from punishment prior to imposition of sentence.second,they assert that they should have been afforded notice of their transfer and an opportunity to respond.the warden disputes the sufficiency of their substantive and procedural due process claims,arguing that they have made only conclusory allegations regarding punishment and have no cognizable liberty interest in being housed in the general prison population.
in support of his contention that the complaint made only conclusory statements regarding punishment,the warden looks to evancho fisher,cir.the opinion in evancho,however,offers the warden no support.the holding of evancho is that the amended complaint of a state employee filed against the state attorney general alleging violations of the pennsylvania whistleblower law and her civil rights failed to meet the liberal pleading requirement of federal rule of civil procedure a.evancho admitted that she did not have evidence of the involvement of one of her named defendants.id.at.the complaint here is significantly different in that it does support a claim for substantive due process violations.as the warden acknowledges,the complaint alleges that plaintiffs were given an explanation for the punitive move.this express reference to punishment is supported by numerous references in the complaint to lengthy stays in isolation with prisoners who had disciplinary problems or who were in protective custody,and the imposition of additional hardships that are not shared by the general prison population.the reasonable inference from these factual allegations is that appellants were impermissibly punished.markowitz northeast land,cir we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them.liberal pleading dictates that,particularly in the context of a pro se complaint,such allegations be deemed sufficient.erickson pardus,d gibbs roman,cir.
to be sure,there are reasonable inferences apart from punishment that could be drawn from the complaint as explanation for the appellants confinement.jones notes that he was alleged to have been a participant in a riot at the gander hill detention facility.if this allegation is true,it is entirely possible that his relocation to the smyrna facility shu was for disciplinary reasons rather than for impermissible retaliation or punishment.likewise,stevenson and manley admit that they had been sentenced to death,but that only their sentences had been vacated.death sentences are available in delaware only for offenses of murder.see.code,a.accordingly,the warden assertion that stevenson and manley were housed in the shu because they were charged with violent offenses is also a legitimate inference to be drawn from the complaint.however,the fact that such inferences may be drawn is proof that the dismissal was premature.the appellants have met their obligation to provide grounds for their entitlement to relief by presenting factual allegations sufficient to raise their right to relief above a speculative level.see,bell atlantic twombly,d.
the complaint also alleges sufficient facts to make out a claim for relief based on procedural due process.in addition to the list of deprivations the plaintiffs suffered,the complaint states that they were not afforded all the rights of normal pretrial detainees,and that the standard practice at delaware correctional center of returning those whose sentences had been vacated to the general prison population was not followed.these allegations do not explicitly state the nature of the appellants alleged liberty interest,but they provide an adequate framework for the inquiry.see,unger residents matching program,cir requiring facts in the complaint from which we could infer that plaintiff had a liberty or property interest.
the complaint details the differences between the conditions they encountered in the shu and those encountered by regular pretrial detainees.it evinces the appellants contention that they were improperly housed in the shu without explanation or an opportunity to contest their placement.the complaint states that the appellants wrote to warden carroll and his employees requesting an explanation for their confinement in the shu,but received no response.the reasonable inference to be drawn from these allegations is that the appellants assert a liberty interest in being free from punishment while awaiting sentencing and in not being held in the shu indefinitely.the plaintiffs specifically requested relief in the form of a system to inform inmates why they were put into isolation,who made the decision to put them in isolation,and a chance to appeal the decision to a official.they also requested that the prison m ake procedural safeguards.the allegations in the complaint sufficiently raise the appellants claim that their procedural due process rights were violated.
although both stevenson and manley had been convicted at the time of their complaint,they are classified as pretrial detainees for purposes of our constitutional inquiry.see cobb aytch,cir the right to remain at liberty continues until a court pronounces a judgment of sentence,although after a jury has pronounced a guilty verdict the court may insist upon greater assurance that a defendant will submit to sentence.see also fuentes wagner,cir.their initial sentences had been vacated and they were awaiting resentencing at the time of their complaint and for the duration during which they allege they were subjected to due process violations.jones was awaiting trial at the time of the complaint.the warden does not contest the status of the appellants as pretrial detainees for purposes of this appeal.
