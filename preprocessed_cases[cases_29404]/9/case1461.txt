mckee,chief judge.
lisa lupyan appeals the summary judgment rendered in favor of her former employer,corinthian colleges,cci on her claims of interference with the exercise of her rights under the family and medical leave act fmla,or act,et seq and retaliation for her exercise of those rights.after a thorough review of the record,we conclude that genuine issues of fact remain as to her fm la claims.accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual procedural history 
lupyan was hired as an instructor in cci applied science management program in.in december,lupyan supervisor,james thomas,noticed that she seemed depressed and suggested she take a personal leave of absence.appx.i at.on her request for leave form,lupyan specified that she was taking personal leave from december,through december.appx.i at.however,thomas suggested that she apply for shortterm disability coverage instead.appx.ii at.accordingly,lupyan scheduled an appointment with her doctor and received a certification of health provider,a standard department of labor dol form for providing certification of a mental health condition.based on this document,cci human resources department determined that lupyan was eligible for leave under the fm la,rather than personal leave.
on december,sherri hixson,cci supervisor of administration,met with lupyan and instructed her to initial the box marked family medical leave on her request for leave form.hixson also changed lupyan projected date of return to april,based upon the certification of health provider provided by lupyan.appx.i at.lupyan contends and cci does not dispute that her rights under the fmla were never discussed during this meeting.however,later that afternoon cci allegedly mailed lupyan a letter advising her that her leave was designated as fm la leave,and further explaining her rights under that act the letter.lupyan denies ever having received the letter,and denies having any knowledge that she was on fmla leave until she attempted to return to work.the issue of whether lupyan received the letter is central to this appeal.
on march,lupyan advised cci that she had been released by her doctor to return to her teaching position with certain restrictions.on april,thomas informed lupyan that she could not come back to work if any restrictions were a condition of her return.appx.i at.shortly thereafter,lupyan provided thomas with a full release from her psychiatrist.this confirmed that she was able to return to work without any restrictions or accommodations.nonetheless,lupyan was advised on april,that she was being terminated from her position at cci due to low student enrollment,and because she had not returned to work within the twelve weeks allotted for fmla leave.id.at.lupyan claims this was the first time she had any knowledge that she was on fmla leave.appx.ii at.
thereafter,lupyan brought the instant action.she alleges that that cci interfered with her rights under the fm la by failing to give notice that her leave fell under that act,and that she was fired in retaliation for taking fm la leave.the district court granted cci initial motion for summary judgment as to both claims.thereafter,the district court sua sponte reversed its ruling on lupyan fm la interference claim.the court recognized that summary judgment was not appropriate because there was a factual dispute regarding whether cci had informed lupyan of her fm la rights.appx.i at.cci responded with an amended summary judgment motion which included affidavits from cci employees who testified that the letter was properly mailed to lupyan.based on the affidavits,the district court relied on the evidentiary presumption that arises under the mailbox rule and found that lupyan had received the letter.the court entered summary judgment in favor of cci,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction to review a district court final order under and.
we exercise plenary review over a district court order granting summary judgment.justofin metro.life ins,cir.we apply the same standard as the district court.we affirm pursuant to federal rule c if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.a factual dispute is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.doe luzerne,cir citing gray york newspapers,cir.
a.the family medical leave act 
congress passed the fmla in in an attempt to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families.b.the fmla enables employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,id.b.however,congress recognized the needs of employers by requiring that all such leave be taken in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers,id.b.the fmla entitles eligible employees to take twelve weeks of leave during any twelvemonth period for the employee own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her job.see a d.following this period of leave,an employee has the right to be restored to his or her original position or its equivalent.id.a.when an employee can not perform an essential function of his or her original position due to the continuation of a serious health condition,no right to restoration exists.c.
the fmla creates a cause of action for interference with the rights it bestows.employees can sue for interference with the exercise of fmla rights under a.they can also sue under a,if an employer retaliates against an employee for exercising her fm la rights.see erdman nationwide ins,cir f iring an employee for a valid request for fmla leave may constitute interference with the employee fmla rights as well as retaliation against the employee.
notice requirements 
the fmla requires employers to provide employees with both general and individual notice about the fmla.to meet the general notice requirements,an employer must post a notice of fmla rights on its premises.see a.because employers have some discretion in the way fm la policies are implemented,employers must also include information regarding the employer fmla policies in a handbook or similar publication.see cfr.
in addition,regulations issued by the department of labor require that an employer give employees individual written notice that an absence falls under the fmla,and is therefore governed by it.cfr.conoshenti public serv.gas,cir the regulations require employers to provide employees with individualized notice of their fmla rights and obligations.thus,once an employer is on notice that an employee is taking fm ifyi ng leave,the employer must within five business days notify the employee of his or her eligibility to take fmla leave,b notify the employee in writing whether the leave will be designated as fmla leave,d provide written notice detailing the employee obligations under the fm la and explaining any consequences for failing to meet those obligations,c and notify the employee of the specific amount of leave that will be counted against the employee fm la leave entitlement,d.
interference claims 
the fm la requirement that employers inform employees of their rights under the act is intended to ensure that employers allow their employees to make informed decisions about leave.conoshenti,at citing nusbaum cb richard ellis,d.failure to provide the required notice can constitute an interference claim.id.at.
however,an employer failure to properly notify an employee of her fmla rights does not necessarily prevent the employee from claiming that her leave is covered by the fmla.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,no relief under a unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation.prejudice occurs when the employer failure to advise the plaintiff of her fmla rights rendered h er unable to exercise the right to leave in a meaningful way,thereby causing injury.conoshenti,at see also ragsdale,at.
here,lupyan claims that cci interfered with her fmla rights by not informing her that her leave was under the fm.according to her,she therefore was unaware of the requirement that she had to return to work within twelve weeks or be subject to termination.as noted above,the district court ultimately entered summary judgment in cci favor on this issue based upon its conclusion that cci provided adequate notice of lupyan fmla rights via the letter.the court also relied on provisions of cci employee handbook which contains a description of an employee rights under the fmla however,the description in an employee handbook can only satisfy the fmla general notice requirements.see cfr.even if we assume arguendo that lupyan receipt of a properly descriptive handbook provided the general notice under the act,that would not resolve the issue before us.given lupyan claim that she did not receive the letter that cci claims was properly mailed to her,we must decide whether the district court properly afforded cci the benefit of the presumption of receipt of properly mailed letters that arises under the mailbox rule.it is clear that if cci has established lupyan receipt of the letter,cci has shown that it satisfied the employer obligation to provide actual notice under the fmla.
b.the mailbox rule 
presumption of receipt 
the presumption of receipt derives from the longstanding common law mailbox rule.under the mailbox rule,if a letter properly directed is proved to have been either put into the or delivered to the postman,it is presumed that it reached its destination at the regular time,and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.rosenthal walker,phila.marine trade ass l longshoremen ass pension fund,cir.
however,this is not a conclusive presumption of law.rosenthal,at citations omitted.rather,it is a rebuttable inference of fact founded on the probability that the officers of the government will do their duty and the usual course of business.id.noting that when the presumption of mailing is opposed by evidence that the letters never were received,it must be weighed by the jury in determining the question whether the letters were actually received or not.
a strong presumption of receipt applies when notice is sent by certified mail,because it creates actual evidence of delivery in the form of a receipt.santana gonzalez att y gen,cir emphasis added.a weaker presumption arises where delivery is sent via regular mail,for which no receipt,or other proof of delivery,is generated.id.in the absence of actual proof of delivery,receipt can be proven circumstantially by introducing evidence of business practices or office customs pertaining to mail.united states hannigan,cir.this evidence may be in the form of a sworn statement.id.at custer murphy oil usa,cir a sworn statement is credible evidence of mailing for the purposes of the mailbox rule.however,because the presumption is weak where proof of receipt is attempted solely by circumstantial evidence,we require the affiant to have personal knowledge of the procedures in place at the time of the mailing.kyhn shinseki,cir.
as noted earlier,cci amended its motion for summary judgment to take advantage of the mailbox rule and thereby establish that lupyan had actual notice of her fmla rights.cci submitted the affidavits of evan gwynne,cci mailroom supervisor,and anne binns,ccl human resources coordinator,both of whom had personal knowledge of cci customary mailing practices when the letter was allegedly mailed to lupyan.moreover,binns swore that she personally prepared the letter and placed it in the outgoing mail bin.app.br.at.
however,cci provided no corroborating evidence that lupyan received the letter.the letter was not sent by registered or certified mail,nor did cci request a return receipt or use any of the now common ways of assigning a tracking number to the letter.therefore,there is no direct evidence of either receipt or.see estate of wood commissioner,cir noting that a postmark could present irrefutable evidence of mailing.instead,the only evidence cci submitted consists of affidavits signed nearly four years after the alleged mailing date.see affidavit of anne binns,appx.iii at.these affidavits implicate the presumption of receipt that arises under the mailbox rule.however,under the circumstances,it is a very weak presumption.given lupyan denial,and the ease with which a letter can be certified,tracked,or proof of receipt obtained,that weak rebuttable presumption is not sufficient to establish receipt as a matter of law and thereby entitle cci to summary judgment.
rebutting the presumption of receipt 
pursuant to the mailbox rule,once a party proves mailing,the presumption of receipt imposes the burden of production on the party against whom it is directed.mccann newman irrevocable trust,cir.federal rule evidence provides the default rule for how presumptions operate in federal civil cases.specifically,the party the presumption operates against has the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption,while the actual burden of persuasion remains does not change.mccann,at.under this bursting bubble theory,the introduction of evidence to rebut a presumption destroys that presumption,leaving only that evidence and its inferences to be judged against the competing evidence and its inferences to determine the ultimate question at issue.mccann,at quoting mckenna pac.rail,cir.
moreover,the quantum of evidence needed to burst an evidentiary presumption bubble in a civil case is minimal.mccann,at.t he presumption only effect is to require the party contesting it to produce enough evidence substantiating the presumed fact absence to withstand a motion for summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law on the issue.id.accordingly,a single,nonconclusory affidavit or witness testimony,when based on personal knowledge and directed at a material issue,is sufficient to defeat summary judgment.see,kirleis dickie,mccamey chilcote,cir.this remains true even if the affidavit is selfservi ng.id.
accordingly,under rule,lupyan contention that she had no notice that her leave was subject to the limitations of the fmla because she never received cci letter,sufficiently burst the mailbox rule presumption,to require a jury to determine the credibility of her testimony,as well as that of cci witnesses.the district court therefore erred in rejecting lupyan affidavit as a matter of law based on her inability to corroborate her claim that she never received the letter from cci.appx.i at.
lupyan argues that her testimony alone,if credited by the factfi nder,should be sufficient to rebut the presumption she received the letter.we recently adopted this position in a suit under the truth in lending act tila.cappuccio prime capital funding llc,cir.there,the district court instructed the jury that i n a tila case,something more than just the testimony of the borrower is needed to rebut the presumption that she received two copies of the notice of her right to rescind her mortgage.cappuccio,at.we reversed.we held that the testimony of a borrower alone,that she did not receive the requisite notice,was sufficient to overcome tila presumption of receipt.id.at.we reasoned that the plaintiff testimony related directly to a material issue in her tila claim,and was based on her personal knowledge.id.accordingly,her testimony overcame the presumption,leaving to the jury the decision of whether to credit her testimony,or that of defendant witnesses,who testified that the requisite notices were sent.cappuccio,at kirleis,at.
there is no meaningful distinction between the circumstances in cappuccio,and the circumstances here.cappuccio applied the interpretation of rule that the introduction of evidence to rebut a presumption destroys the presumption id.at quoting mccann,at.although we recognized that congress could impose a more stringent burden to rebut a presumption under rule,our holding was not based on anything in the ti.id.at.similarly,there is no language in the fmla or its regulations that suggests a legislative intent to create a stronger presumption there than would otherwise apply in under rule.accordingly,we hold that evidence sufficient to nullify the presumption of receipt under the mailbox rule may consist solely of the addressee positive denial of receipt,creating an issue of fact for the jury.
we recognize that,at the summary judgment stage,the
