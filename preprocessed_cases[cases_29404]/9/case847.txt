this case requires us to consider whether detaining an individual pursuant to a material arrest warrant is a prosecutorial function entitled to absolute immunity.we hold that it is not.as the record is insufficient to determine whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,we vacate the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eric vitaliano,judge and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
alexina simon commenced this action under following her arrest and detention pursuant to a material witness warrant.this case was dismissed on grounds of absolute immunity before simon was able to depose or otherwise conduct discovery.for purposes of this appeal,therefore,we take as true the facts set forth in simon complaint and deposition testimony.see rolon henneman,cir.
simon arrest and detention 
the chain of events leading to alexina simon detention began with an investigation of whether a police officer named shantell mckinnies falsely reported her car stolen.police sought to interview mckinnies friend alexandra griffin,allegedly the last person to have seen the car.over the course of the investigation,officials confused alexandra griffin,mckinnies friend,with alexina simon,alexandra mother who lives at the same residence and is the plaintiff in this case.the confusion may have arisen because alexandra griffin allegedly informed an nypd detective that she goes by the name alexandra simon,not alexandra griffin.
after alexandra simon did not respond to a subpoena left in that name at the women shared residence,assistant district attorney francis longobardi of the queens district attorney office queens da obtained a material witness warrant and order for alexina simon on august.the material witness order instructed simon to appear before the court on august,at for a hearing to establish whether she possessed information material to the inquiry regarding mckinnies.as the court determined that simon would be unlikely to respond to an order demanding her presence at the hearing,it also issued an arrest warrant for material witness authorizing any police officer in the state of new york to take the alexina simon into custody within the state of new york and bring her before this court in order that a proceeding may be conducted to determine whether she is to be adjudged a material witness.the arrest warrant specified that the hearing was to take place on august,at 
detective douglas lee and sergeant evelyn the officers executed the material witness warrant on the morning of august,at simon workplace.the parties accounts of the execution of the warrant differ dramatically.the officers maintain that simon consented to accompany them for questioning,while simon maintains that she accompanied the officers against her will.simon testified at her deposition that the investigators appeared at her workplace,asked if she was alexina simon,and told her that they had a warrant for her arrest and that she needed to come with them.when asked at her deposition if she had agreed to go with the investigators,she stated i asked them if i have to go.they said yes.simon said that she asked to see the warrant,and was shown some paper with her name on it that she did read closely.simon testified that when she went with them she assumed that she was under arrest and she was going to jail,to be locked up or whatever,and that she thought this because the male investigator told her that she was under arrest and if she did want them to put handcuffs on her,she would come with them.
simon stated that she was first taken to the precinct for several hours,during which she waited in a room,then taken to another building that defendants identify as the queens district attorney office.there,she spoke briefly with the district attorney or something like that,whom defendants identify as longobardi.she testified that longobardi asked her about a stolen car,and that she told him that she did know anything.at approximately that evening,the officers told simon that she could leave,but that she ha d to be back the next day to answer some more questions.the next day,august,the officers picked her up at at her house and brought her back to the precinct,where they further questioned her.simon did not meet with longobardi that day,and was allowed to leave at approximately.at no point during the two days of detention was simon brought before a grand jury or judge 
ii.district court proceedings 
simon began the present action on march,and filed an amended complaint on august,naming the city of new york,lee,alegre,and longobardi as defendants.the amended complaint,asserting various claims under and state law,alleged that defendants violated simon rights by arresting,threatening,harassing and detaining her without justification,probable cause or reasonable suspicion.the amended complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages,as well as any other relief that the court deemed necessary in the interest of justice.
defendants moved for summary judgment arguing,in part,that they were entitled to absolute immunity for the acts of obtaining and executing a material witness warrant,and that in the alternative,they had qualified immunity for their actions.in an order entered october,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the complaint,holding that the individual defendants had absolute immunity or,in the alternative,qualified immunity,and that simon had not stated a cognizable claim against the city under monell department of social services,d.simon city of new york,d.the district court concluded that longobardi had absolute prosecutorial immunity as an official performing discretionary acts of a judicial nature,which also extended to the officers because their actions were executed under the direction of the prosecutor in the course of performing functions closely tied to the judicial process as opposed to police functions.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
simon moved for reconsideration,arguing that defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity because they were engaged in investigatory activities.on december,the district court orally denied simon motion for reconsideration,reiterating its view that a prosecutor when seeking a material witness order and executing a material witness order is acting as advocate and therefore is entitled to absolute immunity.on december,simon timely appealed the district court denial of her motion for reconsideration as to the individual defendants

standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.johnson of rochester med,cir.a court abuses it s discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding or can not be found with the range of permissible decisions.id.the issue on appeal is one of law,which we review de novo.see giraldo kessler,cir.
ii.absolute immunity 
to determine whether an official enjoys absolute immunity we take a functional approach,examining the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.buckley fitzsimmons,d internal quotation marks omitted.a prosecutor acting in the role of an advocate in connection with a judicial proceeding is entitled to absolute immunity for all acts intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.imbler pachtman,d see also flagler trainor,cir noting that prosecutors receive absolute immunity only when acting as advocates and when their conduct involves the exercise of discretion.these functions include deciding whether to bring charges and presenting a case to a grand jury or a court,along with the tasks generally considered adjunct to those functions,such as witness preparation,witness selection,and issuing subpoenas.see imbler,at.absolute immunity also extends to persons who act under a prosecutor direction in performing functions closely tied to the judicial process.hill city of new york,cir.
by contrast,prosecutors receive only qualified immunity when performing administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate t
