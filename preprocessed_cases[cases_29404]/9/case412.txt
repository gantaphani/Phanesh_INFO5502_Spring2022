background 
as befits an appeal from summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to forrest,drawing all inferences in her favor.see horizon lines of,cir.
forrest worked as a server and then a bartender at chili bar and restaurant in south portland,maine from july to may.she began to date her vashaw,who was employed as a line cook at the same restaurant,in october.the couple dated on and off for about a year.in october,after forrest had broken off the relationship,she and vashaw argued about money that vashaw owed her.forrest was then threatened by four women in the parking lot of the restaurant,who she claimed acted at vashaw instigation.forrest reported the incident to the general manager of the restaurant the next day and following that report did not experience any similar incidents.
forrest and vashaw continued to see each other socially after the october incident and engaged in intimate relations as late as january.in march of forrest began dating another man,jeremy gregor.vashaw,apparently upset by forrest new relationship,questioned forrest frequently about gregor,began to call her names such as whore and bitch,and refused to give her things that she needed in the kitchen.in early march,forrest complained about vashaw to the restaurant general manager claude hadjaissa however,she told hadjaissa that she did not want vashaw to be fired.hadjaissa investigated the complaint and gave vashaw an oral warning to stop,and behave as a professional or circumstances will take place.
forrest alleges that vashaw verbal abuse continued unabated throughout march,and that she and other witnessed vashaw calling her names such as whore,slut,bitch,and cunt.at the end of march,forrest complained to the kitchen manager craig twombly that she was upset with vashaw handling of her food orders,that he was calling her names,and that he was talking to other employees about her.on march,twombly issued a final written warning to vashaw,directing him to stop all negative confrontations with other employees,instructing him that he must correct the problem immediate ly there will be no other warnings on this matter,and informing him that failure to comply would result in immediate termination.twombly and hadjaissa informed forrest that vashaw had been given a written warning and asked her to let them know if his inappropriate behavior continued.
on april,forrest reported to hadjaissa that on the previous night vashaw had squirted her with hot water while she was making a personal phone call,had acted rudely towards her,had cornered her in a cooler,called her a whore and other names,as well as telling her she was fat and needed to go to the gym.hadjaissa terminated vashaw after he admitted that he had told forrest she was fat and needed to go to the gym,though he denied calling her a whore.
after vashaw was terminated,forrest obtained first a temporary and then a permanent restraining order against him.forrest also initiated a meeting with the chili area director,jonathan witham.witham told forrest that vashaw would not be allowed on the premises when she was working,but that chili could not prevent him from entering the premises when she was not in the building.forrest resigned from her position on may.
the record also demonstrates that chili has an harassment policy,a copy of which was provided to forrest when she began her employment there.among other things,the policy prohibits derogatory or sexual comments,making threats after a sexual advance is rejected,and certain types of inappropriate physical conduct.the policy also lays out a complaint procedure,providing that management will begin an objective,thorough investigation upon receiving a complaint of harassment and that a ny employee found to have violated the policy on discrimination harassment will be subject to disciplinary action,which may include reprimand,suspension,or termination if warranted.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a a plaintiff may establish a violation of title vii by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.to prove a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment,a plaintiff must demonstrate 
that she or he is a member of a protected class that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment that the harassment was based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment and create an abusive work environment that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been established.
crowley bean,cir.this appeal focuses on the third and sixth prongs of the test that is,whether the harassment was based upon sex and whether,even if so,chili may be held liable.we consider each point in turn 
based upon sex 
the magistrate judge found that forrest did not proffer sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that vashaw inappropriate behavior towards forrest was harassment based on her sex,as required by title vii,rather than on personal animosity stemming from their failed relationship.
in cases involving a prior failed relationship between an accused harasser and alleged victim,reasoning that the harassment could not have been motivated by the victim sex because it was instead motivated by a romantic relationship gone sour establishes a false dichotomy.presumably the prior relationship would never have occurred if the victim were not a member of the sex preferred by the harasser,and thus the victim sex is inextricably linked to the harasser decision to harass.to interpret sexual harassment perpetrated by a jilted lover in all cases not as gender discrimination,but rather as discrimination on the basis of the failed interpersonal relationship is as flawed a proposition under title vii as the corollary that ordinary sexual harassment does not violate title vii when the asserted purpose is the establishment of a new interpersonal relationship.babcock frank,internal citations omitted.whether a harasser picks his or her targets because of a prior intimate relationship,desire for a future intimate relationship,or any other factor that draws the harasser attention should not be the focus of the title vii analysis.instead,improper gender bias can be inferred from conduct if the harassing conduct is,title vii requirement that the harassment b
