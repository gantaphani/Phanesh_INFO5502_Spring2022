diane kassner and marsha reiffe brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in september,alleging age discrimination on the basis of adverse employment actions and retaliation in violation of the age discrimination in employment act of adea,as amended,et,the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law et,and the new york city human rights law nychrl,admin.michael daly code et.they appeal from the district court judgment in favor of avenue delicatessen and its owner and general manager,jacob lebewohl,entered on july.
the district court george daniels,judge granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and denied as futile plaintiffs to amend the complaint.the district court ruled that all of kassner claims were under applicable statutes of limitations,that most of reiffe claims also were,and that reiffe remaining claims either did not amount to an adverse employment action or were supported by insufficient factual allegations from which the court could infer age discrimination.the district court concluded,further,that allowing plaintiffs to amend the complaint would be futile because plaintiffs proposed amended complaint alleged few new facts and because,in restating the same alleged acts by defendants without the references to specific dates that appeared in the complaint as filed,the proposed amended complaint could hide,but not cure,any timeliness deficiencies.
we conclude that certain of plaintiffs claims were supported by factual allegations sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.we further conclude that the district court erred in denying the motion to amend the complaint on the ground of futility and direct that the district court,on remand,exercise its discretion under federal rule of civil procedure b to determine whether the proposed amendment or different amendments to the complaint should be allowed.for these reasons,we vacate the judgment dismissing the action and remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
when they commenced their action in district court in,plaintiffs kassner and reiffe were and years of age,respectively,and were employed as waitresses in a restaurant operated by defendant avenue delicatessen.kassner had worked for avenue delicatessen since reiffe began her employment there in.on november,and december,prior to bringing this action,reiffe and kassner,respectively,filed claims of age discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc against avenue delicatessen and jacob lebewohl.see br.for.the eeoc issued each plaintiff a form letter dated june.id.at.
plaintiffs filed their complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on september,alleging that defendants violated the adea,the nyshrl,and the nychrl by discriminating against plaintiffs on account of age and by retaliating against plaintiffs for complaining about age discrimination and for bringing charges alleging age discrimination.the complaint contains various allegations to the effect that defendants discriminated against plaintiffs by assigning them to work shifts and work stations at which earnings were less than those to which younger waitresses were assigned.compl.the complaint alleged that defendant lebewohl and several of his subordinates repeatedly made degrading comments about kassner,including,but not limited to,drop dead,retire early,take off all of that,and take off your wig.id.the complaint further alleged that defendants retaliated against reiffe by changing her work shift and work station.id.in addition,the complaint claimed that defendant lebewohl pressured plaintiffs to retire and pointed to the front of the restaurant and said there the door when they complained about their disparate treatment.id,emphasis omitted.plaintiffs sought injunctive relief,lost earnings,compensatory and punitive damages,and an award for attorneys fees.id,prayer for relief.
on september,nine days after plaintiffs filed the complaint,the district court entered a civil case management plan and scheduling order,pursuant to rules and f of the federal rules of civil procedure.the case management plan and scheduling order limited the time for amendment of the pleadings,requiring any amendments to the pleadings to be made by february.
defendants did not file or serve an answer to the complaint but instead,on october,moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.during approximately the next four months,plaintiffs sought and were granted extensions of time in which to respond to the motion to dismiss,to engage in settlement discussions with defendants,and to obtain new counsel.on march,plaintiffs,through their new counsel,timely filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss and moved to amend their complaint.
in a judgment entered on july,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and denied plaintiffs to amend the complaint.in its memorandum decision and order,dated july,wl,the district court concluded that plaintiffs adea claims were to the extent they were based on discrete acts that occurred before february,because the adea requires filing of an administrative complaint with the eeoc within days after the alleged unlawful employment practice.mem.order at see d.the district court also found plaintiffs nyshrl and nychrl claims to be by the applicable statutes of limitations to the extent they were based on discrete acts occurring before september.see mem.order at.the district court concluded that all of kassner claims were because they were based on alleged discrete acts occurring in.id.at.moreover,the district court ruled that the only allegations by reiffe of discriminatory acts that were not either do not amount to an adverse employment action or are insufficient factual allegations to infer that those actions were based upon her age.id.at.
in denying plaintiffs to amend the complaint,the district court noted that the proposed amended complaint adds few new factual allegations and simply drops any reference to applicable dates in an attempt to vaguely and generally refer to events without any time reference.id.at.the district court concluded that s uch a proposed amendment may hide,but can not cure,any deficiencies.it therefore would be futile.id.
subsequently brought this appeal and,in connection therewith,request legal fees and costs.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court erred in granting defendants rule b motion to dismiss the complaint in the entirety 
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss.dougherty town of hempstead bd.of zoning appeals,cir.in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,the court is to accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint.id.the court is to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.fernandez chertoff,cir see also leibowitz cornell,cir.the supreme court has held that,under the notice system of pleading established by the federal rules of civil procedure,an employment discrimination plaintiff need not plead a prima facie case of discrimination.swierkiewicz sorema,d.under rule a,the pleading requirement is satisfied by a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.such a statement must simply give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.swierkiewicz,at.quoting conley gibson,d leibowitz,at.the supreme court has rejected the argument that allowing lawsuits based on conclusory allegations of discrimination would encourage disgruntled employees to sue and thereby overburden the courts.whatever the practical merits of this argument,the federal rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits.swierkiewicz,at.therefore,in considering such a motion to dismiss,t he appropriate inquiry is not whether a plaintiff is likely to prevail,but whether he is entitled to offer evidence to support his claims.fernandez,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in reviewing the complaint and thereby dismissing plaintiffs age discrimination claims,the district court considered many discrete acts to be.a plaintiff seeking to recover under the adea must file a discrimination charge with a state agency within days of the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful employment practice.see d.the district court concluded that plaintiffs adea claims were to the extent they were based on discrete acts that occurred before february,based on a filing date of december,for the administrative eeoc complaints mem.order at.because claims under the nyshrl and the nychrl are unless filed within three years of the alleged discriminatory acts,the district court also ruled that such claims are to the extent they were based on discrete acts occurring before september.id.at see exec.law mckinney admin.code d.
a prima facie case of age discrimination requires that plaintiffs demonstrate membership in a protected class,qualification for their position,an adverse employment action,and circumstances that support an inference of age discrimination.galabya new york city bd.of,cir.a plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.to be materially adverse a change in working conditions must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.id.at quoting crady liberty bank trust,cir citation omitted.a change that is materially adverse could consist of,inter alia,a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices unique to a particular situation.id.omission in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.at this stage of litigation,plaintiffs need not plead a prima facie case and may withstand a motion to dismiss by meeting a lesser standard.plaintiffs need only comply with rule a by providing a short and plain statement of the claim that shows that plaintiffs are entitled to relief and that gives the defendants fair notice of plaintiffs claims of age discrimination and the grounds upon which those claims rest.see swierkiewicz,at.
we agree with the district court that certain acts alleged in the complaint do not plead causes of action that were timely under the applicable statutes of limitations.nevertheless,the complaint contains other allegations that,when construed together to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs,state valid causes of action under the adea,the nyshrl,and the nychrl.as to the discrete acts for which the district court considered claims to be timely,the district court observed that p laintiffs primarily complain of a number of shift or work station changes that reduced their potential for tip income.mem.order at.with respect to such shift or work station changes,the district court concluded that none of the acts complained of by plaintiffs rise to the level of a material adverse employment action.id.we decline to hold that a waiter or waitress repeatedly assigned to less desirable work stations and work shifts than younger can never,under any proven set of facts,obtain a remedy for age discrimination in employment.
we now turn to the allegations in the complaint relevant to each plaintiff claim of age discrimination based on changes in work stations and work shifts.kassner alleged in the complaint that i n,defendant,lebewohl,permanently assigned kassner to work station six,located by the toilet and kitchen and that c ustomers do not sit at station six because of its location.compl.this allegation of a permanent assignment to an undesirable work station is under the adea,the nyshrl,and the nychrl.a discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act occurred on the day that it happened.passenger morgan,d internal quotation marks omitted.as we have stated previously,a completed act such as a discontinuance of a particular job assignment is not of a continuing nature.lightfoot union carbide,cir.the district court was correct in dismissing any claim arising from this factual allegation.the complaint also alleges that i n,lebewohl also refused to assign kassner any weekend shifts.however,younger waitresses are rotated amongst the better stations and assigned to weekend shifts,which is when the most money is made.compl.because this allegation also is pleaded as having occurred in,it too is under the adea,the nyshrl,and the nychrl.we conclude,therefore,that the district court correctly ruled that kassner had made no timely allegations of age discrimination based on changes in work stations and work shifts.
we conclude,as did the district court,that not all of the allegations of changes in work stations and work shifts affecting reiffe are untimely.the complaint alleges that in defendant lebewohl discriminated against reiffe by making a change in reiffe schedule that removed her from a sunday shift.id.in referring to a discrete act occurring in,this allegation is under the adea,the nyshrl,and the nychrl.another allegation in the complaint is of a discriminatory assignment,for four consecutive days in january,to the counter station,which the complaint alleges to be the least profitable station and to which only new workers allegedly are usually assigned.id.this alleged assignment is one for which relief is not under the nyshrl and the nychrl.on the face of the complaint,it is not possible to determine whether relief would be under the adea the allegation would be timely under the adea if reiffe were able to show that the assignment was made on or after january.the complaint also includes the allegation that lebewohl,in september,discriminated against reiffe by changing reiffe station and her hours on saturdays such that she was removed from the early dinner shift.id.it further alleges that in september her hours on tuesdays,which were until,were changed to until id.these allegations of acts occurring in september do not refer to acts for which relief is barred under the various statutes of limitations.
viewed absent the allegations,reiffe claims that defendants discriminated against her in her station and shift assignments are based on an allegation that she was assigned in january to the least desirable station,the counter,for four consecutive days and an allegation that her tuesday and saturday station and shift assignments were changed in september.the complaint fails to allege specifically that the september station and shift assignments were less favorable than those to which reiffe previously was assigned.however,in the context of the complaint as a whole we are able to draw an inference in favor of reiffe that the new station and shift assignments were less desirable than the previous ones and less desirable than those to which younger workers were assigned.we also may infer from the language of the complaint that the changes continued after september.reiffe timely claims relating to changes in shifts are limited to an allegation that in september her hours were reduced on tuesdays and also on saturdays,when she was removed from the early dinner shift.the significance of the reduction in hours on tuesdays is not apparent from the face of the complaint whether this alleged action was adverse is a matter of speculation.see bell atlantic twombly,d factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.we may infer the significance of the change in the saturday hours based on the allegation in the complaint that the weekend shifts were the most lucrative shifts.compl.we also may infer that the change in reiffe saturday hours continued after september.
the district court concluded that the timely claims on behalf of reiffe either do not amount to an adverse employment action or are insufficient factual allegations to infer that those actions were based upon her age.mem.order at.the timely allegations made on behalf of reiffe are limited in scope and therefore might be construed as insufficient to constitute a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment,see galabya,at,were we not required to draw all reasonable inferences on behalf of the plaintiff.the inferences in favor of reiffe that we discussed previously cause us to conclude that reiffe claims of age discrimination based on certain changes in work station and work shift assignments,although limited,are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under the standard articulated in swierkiewicz,at.we conclude,therefore,that the district court should have allowed reiffe to proceed on claims that certain alterations made to her work station and work schedule in january and september,those for which relief is not,constituted age discrimination.
we next consider the issue of discrimination based on a hostile work environment.although the complaint does not explicitly allege discrimination based on a hostile work environment,the complaint alleges continued harassment of kassner and alleges facts from which we may infer pleading of hostile work environment claims as to her the complaint states that lebewohl and several of his subordinates have repeatedly made degrading comments towards kassner,including,but not limited to,drop dead,retire early,take off all of that,and take off your wig.compl.an actionable discrimination claim based on hostile work environment under the adea is one for which the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment brennan metro.opera ass n,cir quoting harris forklift,d omission in original.the determination of hostility depends on whether a reasonable person would find the work environment to be hostile and whether plaintiffs subjectively perceived it to be so.id.minor incidents do not merit relief.id.plaintiffs need not present a list of specific acts.id.to establish a hostile work environment,plaintiffs must prove that the incidents were sufficiently continuous and concerted to be considered pervasive.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a plaintiff must also demonstrate that she was subjected to the hostility because of her membership in a protected class.id.at the pleading stage of the case,however,plaintiffs need not plead a prima facie case of discrimination based on hostile work environment,so long as they provide in the complaint a short and plain statement of the claim that shows that plaintiffs are entitled to relief and that gives the defendant fair notice of plaintiffs claim for hostile work environment and the grounds upon which that claim rests.see swierkiewicz,at.as to kassner,the allegation of a hostile work environment is sufficient for this purpose and thus entitles kassner to proceed to discovery and put on evidence in support of her hostile work environment claims.to prevail,kassner will have to persuade the factfinder that,inter alia,the comments the complaint attributes to lebewohl and subordinates actually were.
as to reiffe,however,we consider the factual allegations in the complaint to be insufficient to state a claim of hostile work environment.the complaint alleges that defendants pressur ed plaintiffs to retire from employment.see compl.this allegation,even when aided by inferences in favor of reiffe,is so vague that it fails to provide defendants with fair notice of the factual grounds supporting an implied claim that reiffe was subjected to a hostile work environment.the complaint alleges no specific facts as to what was done to pressure reiffe to retire.the complaint does contain an allegation,which was timely under the nyshrl and the nychrl but not under the adea,that the manager of avenue delicatessen,in december,suspended reiffe without pay for an incident without conducting a proper investigation and,when reiffe objected to the suspension,threatened to subject reiffe to arrest if she appeared in the restaurant.id.the complaint,however,fails to allege any facts about the circumstances surrounding the suspension and the incident that gave rise to it.the allegations made on behalf of reiffe,if assumed to be true,would not be sufficient to justify a conclusion that reiffe is entitled to a remedy based on a hostile work environment claim.
we turn next to the pleading of plaintiffs retaliation claims.the adea prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual employee because of the individual opposing any practice made unlawful under the statute.d plaintiffs allege that they complained to defendants about their disparate treatment and that defendant lebewohl did not act to remedy the situation but instead pointed to the front of the restaurant and stated there the door compl.the complaint alleges vaguely that defendants discriminated against plaintiffs because they opposed acts unlawful under the adea,made charges,and participated in proceedings in support of their adea rights.id.notably,the complaint fails to identify any specific acts by defendants against kassner that are alleged to have been taken in retaliation for kassner complaints or for her filing of discrimination charges with the eeoc in december.we conclude,therefore,that the complaint fails to state a retaliation claim on behalf of kassner under the adea,the nyshrl,or the nychrl.
we reach the opposite conclusion with respect to certain retaliation claims made on behalf of reiffe.the complaint alleges that retaliatory assignments to work stations and work shifts began after reiffe requested that her union file a grievance on her behalf for the incident in december when reiffe was suspended without pay.id.the complaint asserts retaliation claims based on the same alleged changes to reiffe work station and work shifts on which it bases its claims of discriminatory assignments,the changes in reiffe work station and work shifts in january and september.id.as we discussed above,the timely claims of age discrimination based on alleged changes to reiffe work station and work shift assignments are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss under the standard articulated in swierkiewicz,at.whether those alleged changes to work stations and work shifts constitute discrimination,retaliation,or both is to be determined as the litigation progresses.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing all of reiffe claims of retaliation.
in summary,we conclude with respect to kassner that the district court properly dismissed the claims of alleged discriminatory assignments to work stations and work shifts,erred in dismissing an implied claim of hostile work environment,and properly dismissed all claims of retaliation.we conclude with respect to reiffe that the district court properly dismissed certain untimely claims of alleged discriminatory assignments to work stations and work shifts but erred in dismissing other such claims that were based on acts alleged to have occurred in january and september of,properly dismissed any implied claim of hostile work environment,and erred in dismissing claims of retaliation based on acts that were alleged to have occurred in january and september of for which relief was not.
b.the district court erred in denying the motion to amend the complaint on the ground of futility 
we turn next to the district court denial of plaintiffs to amend their complaint,which we review for abuse of discretion.dougherty,at see parker columbia pictures,cir.in doing so,we review de novo any conclusions of law.dougherty,at.upon de novo review,we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that the proposed amendment to the complaint would have been futile.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure provides in the first sentence that a party may amend the party pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served.a.the second sentence of rule a provides that o therwise a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.id.
at the time that plaintiffs moved to amend th
