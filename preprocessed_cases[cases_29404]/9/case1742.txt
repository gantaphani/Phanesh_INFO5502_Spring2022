opinion of the court 
the hazleton area school district the school district appeals from the amended judgment and order in favor of appellee michael potence pursuant to a jury verdict that the school district had violated the age discrimination in employment act adea.it also appeals from the award of attorneys fees.
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.because we believe the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the school district motion for judgment as a matter of law,and in denying its alternative motion for a new trial,and did not abuse its discretion in calculating the attorneys fees,we will affirm.
the school district posted an advertisement seeking to fill the vacant position of heating,ventilation,and air conditioning instructor.as posted,the advertisement put forth the following job criteria must possess or be eligible for pa plumbing and hvac certification.must be able to document minimum two years related experience in both occupations.app.at.edward lyba,administrative director of the hazleton area career center,was appointed by superintendent geraldine shepperson to direct the hiring process.
initially five applications were submitted,and only one candidate,jeffrey sweda,was selected for an interview.after receiving some pressure from the school board,a second candidate,john darrow,was interviewed,and despite the hiring committee recommendation that sweda be hired for the position,the school board again directed lyba to interview yet another candidate,michael potence.
the entire original interview committee could not be reconvened for purposes of the interview with potence,and lyba added a practical examination on which applicants had to name parts of a refrigeration unit.sweda ranked first,potence second.lyba recommended to superintendent shepperson that sweda be hired,and sweda was hired after the school board approved his hiring.potence filed suit claiming that he was discriminated against on the basis of his age.
the school district contends that potence was not qualified for the job because he lacked a refrigerant recapturing certification.potence responds that this reason was pretext because,among other things,this certification has nothing to do with either hvac or plumbing instruction,and it was not listed in the advertisement for the position.a member of the second interview committee,kevin dodson,could not explain why a refrigeration exam was used to test plumbing,heating,ventilation,and air conditioning.there was trial evidence that the reasons provided to potence for not interviewing or hiring him changed over time.he was initially told by superintendent shepperson that he had failed to forward his educational transcripts,but a postal receipt introduced in evidence showed that his transcripts had been received in the required time period then shepperson told him that he was crying sour grapes because the school board had hired a fine young instructor and finally he was told that he was not hired because he was not certified in refrigerants.app.at.
potence also adduced evidence at trial from which the jury could have concluded that shepperson had a discriminatory animus against older candidates and that she had control over the hiring process.she directed lyba to hire no more old plumbers,and she told someone else that we are not going to hire any more old plumbers because the old plumbers can not pass the certification test.appellee br.at.she also made a comment to the effect that the school had hired a fine young man.app.at 
it was against this factual background that the jury found for potence and awarded him in damages,which the district court reduced by to reflect income that potence made in other employment.the court then doubled the award as liquidated damages,pursuant to the authority given in the adea for a court to do so for willful violations,b,resulting in a judgment of.the district court denied the school district motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in pertinent part,the adea provides,it shall be unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of such individual age a.the sequence in examining alleged employment discrimination was set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable factfinder as to all the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination.if a plaintiff does establish a prima facie case,then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.if the defendant does so,the plaintiff must submit evidence from which a factfinder could reasonably either disbelieve the employer articulated reasons,or believe that invidious discrimination was more likely than not the motivating or determinative cause of the employer action.stanziale jargowsky,cir.
in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,the plaintiff must demonstrate that is over forty,is qualified for the position in question,suffered from an adverse employment decision,and that his or her replacement was sufficiently younger to permit a reasonable inference of age discrimination.duffy paper magic group,cir.the school district challenges only the second of the criteria,and has asserted throughout that potence lacked the necessary qualifications.
whether the evidence showed that potence was qualified for the position,and whether the lack of a refrigerant certification was a pretext for discrimination.
in reviewing whether the school district was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,we must review the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party unless the record is critically deficient of that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief.rotondo keene,cir quotations and citations omitted.the school district only argument that potence was not qualified for the position was that he lacked a federal certification to handle refrigerants.lyba testified that the school district had purchased diagnostic equipment relating to hvac troubleshooting,and that this equipment required the operator to introduce refrigerant into,and remove refrigerant from,the machine.because this equipment was purchased before the instructor position was advertised,the school district argues the certification in question was a prerequisite,rather than a pretext,for age discrimination.
it is undisputed that potence did not possess this certification,but there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the school district reliance on this qualification was a pretext for discrimination.it is not contested that the advertisement for the position failed to list this as a qualification.the school district asserts that it would not be reasonable to expect the advertisement to put potential applicants on notice of every essential job qualification.appellant br.at.in light of the fact that the advertisement already listed plumbing and hvac certification as two of its criteria,the jury could reasonably have concluded that refrigerant also would have been included if it were an essential qualification.another fact that the jury could have considered in concluding the school district reason was pretext was that potence was given various reasons at different stages of the hiring process as to why he was not hired or given an initial interview.there was also testimony of several ageist remarks arguably attributable to shepperson.
the school district nonetheless objects that shepperson was not in control of the hiring process.we have held that stray remarks by alone are insufficient to establish discriminatory intent,walden,cir,but this argument fails in the instant case for two reasons.first,it is not only these remarks that give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.the different stories told to potence over the course of the process,the failure to even mention refrigerant certification in the notice of the position,the unplanned decision to create
