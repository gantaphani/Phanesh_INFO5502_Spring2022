vincent brock,is an inmate in the custody of the new york department of corrections docs.in december,brock suffered a deep laceration to his right cheek when another inmate slashed his face with a knife.brock received prompt and,by all accounts,adequate medical care for the wound itself.but he alleges that the wound has led to a painful and disfiguring keloid and that various docs employees have wrongfully,and in violation of the eighth amendment,prevented him from obtaining the care of a dermatologist.
brock brought suit under.the district court schroeder,western district of new york granted summary judgment to the defendants on the grounds that brock had failed to adduce evidence that he suffered from a sufficiently serious medical condition,that there was no evidence that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to brock medical needs,and that none of the defendants were personally involved in the decision to deny brock consultation with an outside dermatologist.brock appeals pro se.we affirm the judgment of the district court as to defendants berbary and eagan and vacate the judgment as to defendant wright 
factual background 
our discussion of the facts is informed by the standard of review applicable to appeals from summary judgment.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to brock,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.see fujitsu fed.express,cir.any doubts about the credibility of an affidavit or deposition are generally left to the factfinder,our role being to determine whether there is indeed no issue of material fact in dispute.id.
many of the relevant facts are uncontroverted.on december,brock suffered a serious knife wound to his right cheek,from below the corner of his right lip nearly to the earlobe.the laceration was sutured at a local hospital.after the removal of his sutures,brock was referred to an outside dermatologist who noted,a little less than a month after the incident,that the wound was healing remarkably well.the dermatologist report also indicated that brock had a history of keloid formation and,indeed,was observed at the hospital as having significant keloid formation on other lacerations.i would have him follow up for a steroid injection,should his laceration begin to keloid in the future,the report concluded.
keloids are abnormal overgrowths of fibrous tissue that,when triggered by a skin injury,typically extend beyond the location of the original wound.they are elevated above adjacent skin and are discolored.they may continue to grow for years.an affidavit executed by syed farooq on brock behalf indicates that,beyond the potential of keloids to cause disfigurement,nerve fibers may become tangled in the overgrown tissue leading to constant pain,local irritation,and paresthesias.such symptoms are likely to be heightened when sensitive parts of the body,such as the face,are affected.the defendants introduced no evidence into the record to rebut this portion of farooq affidavit.
according to brock,soon after he was seen by the dermatologist,the scar did indeed begin to keloid.in addition to anxiety over the prominence of the scar,brock started experiencing pain.he states 
the pain,which i continue to endure on a daily basis,can best be described as a throbbing,burning pain.whenever i move my mouth,for the sake of example,to brush my teeth,eat,yawn,or smile,it feels as though the right side of my face is being stuck with needles.the pain is nagging,it does not subside,and occurs every time i perform one of the aforementioned activities.
farooq affidavit similarly asserts that brock can not smile,yawn,brush his teeth,chew food on the right side of his mouth or sleep on his right side without experiencing pain.he also claims that brock teeth on the right side are decaying at an excessive speed due to brock inability to brush them adequately.
brock alleges that he informed prison medical staff on numerous occasions of the pain he was experiencing as a result of the laceration.but it is not until august that the first documentation appears that brock complained of pain from his scar.at that time,he mentioned to a docs nurse that his face hurt and that a doctor had recommended steroid injections.the treating nurse noted that a large keloid had formed,prescribed antibiotic ointment,and referred brock for an outside consultation with a dermatologist.a few days later,a docs physician,john cetin,examined brock and concurred in the need for a referral,noting the formation of a large,thick keloid.
the regional medical director,david,denied the request for a referral,writing that the nature of the requested consultation was cosmetic.although he had an opportunity to do so,cetin did not appeal the decision of the medical director.in a subsequent affidavit,cetin stated that there were no collateral symptoms to justify the appeal in light of the docs policy,promulgated by lester wright,forbidding treatment of keloids in the absence of such symptoms.
brock responded by filing an inmate grievance requesting that he be allowed to see a dermatologist.he urged that,given his medical history,arrangements should be made to get me to a dermatologist outside clinic,before further damage is done.the of two inmate representatives and two docs with hearing inmate grievances agreed with brock and requested that brock be allowed to see an outside dermatologist.
the superintendent of the collins correctional facility,james berbary,overturned the decision of the committee,noting only that the request for a consult was denied by central office medical.berbary later stated that he simply deferred to the decision of the regional medical director since this is an issue within his medical opinion and field of expertise.
brock appealed berbary decision to the central office review committee corc,arguing that the denial of medical treatment was causing him pain,anguish,and sleeplessness.corc affirmed berbary decision to deny the consult.the director of the inmate grievance program is eagan.as such,eagan sits as a nonvoting member on the corc,and his signature appears at the top of the form rejecting brock grievance.
having exhausted the appeals process in the new york prison system,brock brought this civil rights action in federal district court seeking money damages for docs inadequate treatment of his scar.
on appeal,brock reiterates his argument made to the district court that the refusal of the docs defendants to respond adequately to his medical condition constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.brock must meet two conditions in order to be successful against any one of the defendants.he must first show that his medical condition is objectively a serious one.see estelle gamble,d chance armstrong,cir.then,brock must show,for each defendant,that the defendant acted with deliberate indifference to brock medical needs.estelle,at.chance,at.
a.the objective test 
in light of the facts in the record,we conclude that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that brock medical needs were insufficiently serious to meet the estelle test.
there is no settled,precise metric to guide a court in its estimation of the seriousness of a prisoner medical condition.in many cases,however,we have set forth factors that should guide the analysis.thus,in chance armstrong,we referred to a list of such factors,including whether a reasonable doctor or patient would perceive the medical need in question as important and worthy of comment or treatment,whether the medical condition significantly affects daily activities,and the existence of chronic and substantial pain.at citing and quoting mcguckin smith,cir.
in chance,the prisoner unresolved dental condition,which caused him great pain,difficulty in eating,and deterioration of the health of his other teeth,was held to be sufficiently serious to meet the estelle standard.see id.at.similarly we have held that a tooth cavity is a serious medical condition,not because cavities are always painful or otherwise dangerous,but because a cavity that is not treated will probably become so.see harrison barkley,cir.and in hathaway coughlin,cir,we identified as serious a hip condition that caused a prisoner great pain over an extended period of time and difficulty walking.
brock has alleged that his scar is a source of chronic pain that interferes with his ability to conduct tasks associated with daily living.this allegation is supported by the affidavit farooq made after examining brock.importantly,another doctor noted,shortly after brock sustained the knife wound,that he would follow up with steroid injections if brock scar began to keloid.and yet another,cetin,after the keloid had formed and brock had complained of pain,referred brock to an outside dermatologist.whether cetin thought the request for outside consultation was routine,as defendants maintain,or not,the doctor at least thought brock condition sufficiently serious to be worthy of comment.
the totality of the defendants argument to the contrary is that n otwithstanding plaintiff claims in this action,the medical evidence does not portray plaintiff scar as an extremely painful one or as an urgent condition that may result in degeneration.but the defendants point us to no medical evidence that actually casts doubt on the conclusions and observations of farooq,much less that would lead us to conclude that the evidence adduced by brock is too insubstantial to raise a material issue as to the seriousness of his medical condition.the defendants have challenged the veracity of brock claims by suggesting that he had failed to mention the scar during several visits to the prison health care unit.but at most that raises a question of credibility for a jury,and we can not conclude that,as a matter of law,brock allegations and farooq observations are overstated.
the district court held that brock scar was not a serious medical condition,because the pain associated with the scar although uncomfortable and annoying is not extreme and because the scar does not present a risk of serious harm as would an infected wound.the evidence offered by brock is more fairly characterized as proof of chronic pain the magnitude of which probably falls somewhere between annoying and extreme.at summary judgment we must fully credit brock and farooq affidavits.it follows that the district court either erred in not treating that evidence as true or believed that only extreme pain or a degenerative condition would suffice to meet the legal standard.and the latter would also be wrong,for we have long held that the eighth amendment forbids not only deprivations of medical care that produce physical torture and lingering death,but also less serious denials which cause or perpetuate pain.todaro ward,cir.
we will no more tolerate prison officials deliberate indifference to the chronic pain of an inmate than we would a sentence that required the inmate to submit to such pain.we do not,therefore,require an inmate to demonstrate that he or she experiences pain that is at the limit of human ability to bear,nor do we require a showing that his or her condition will degenerate into a one.brock has brought forth enough evidence to establish the seriousness of his condition should a jury fully credit the evidence 
b.the subjective test 
having concluded that summary judgment may not be granted to the defendants on the ground that brock medical condition is not sufficiently serious,we turn to the subjective component of the estelle standard.the district court ruled that none of the defendants showed deliberate indifference to brock medical condition.we agree with this assessment with respect to defendants berbary and eagan and affirm the grant of summary judgment as to them.but since we find the constitutionality of docs policy on the treatment of keloids,a policy promulgated by defendant wright,to be an issue in dispute,we vacate the grant of summary judgment to wright.
in order to prove deliberate indifference in a challenge to an prison inmate conditions of confinement,the prisoner must show that a particular defendant knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.farmer brennan,d.although farmer requires that a plaintiff prove actual knowledge of a risk,evidence that the risk was obvious or otherwise must have been known to a defendant is sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that the defendant was actually aware of it.id.at.
defendant berbary 
superintendent berbary overturned brock claim,accepted by the initial grievance committee,that brock should receive a dermatology consult.the sole reason berbary gave in his denial was that the request had been denied by the regional medical director.
berbary automatic and complete deference to the very decision brock grieved is not,by itself,sufficient evidence that berbary was deliberately indifferent to brock serious medical needs.berbary had no medical training.there is no proof that he was aware that docs policy or decision was not protective of brock,nor need this conclusion have been obvious to him.even if we assume that he was aware of the full extent of brock condition,there is no evidence that could lead one to suspect that berbary understood that an outside consultation would be necessary or even useful.this is especially so given the fact that had clearly indicated that it would not.at most,brock contention that berbary should not have deferred to amounts to an allegation of negligence.but negligence is not deliberate indifference.we,therefore,affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to berbary.
defendant eagan 
brock does not dispute eagan testimony that he was a nonvoting member of the committee that reviewed brock appeal of berbary decision.nor does brock challenge eagan testimony that his usual role on the committee is only to provide information asked for by the voting members.but since eagan signature appears at the top of the committee affirmance of berbary decision,since eagan does recall attending the meeting at which brock appeal was discussed,and since eagan is the director of the committee,brock asserts that eagan was involved in the decision to deny the appeal and should have done more to evaluate brock condition.in these respects,however,brock has only perhaps adduced evidence on eagan part.in the circumstances of this case,it was not deliberate indifference for eagan to defer to the committee decision to rely on medical judgment.
of course,eagan could also be held liable if brock could prove that the members of the committee were eagan subordinates and that eagan was grossly negligent in failing to prevent them from committing an eighth amendment violation.see colon coughlin,cir.but no evidence has been proffered to support this basis of liability.thus,although eagan signed the decision of the committee,there is nothing in the record that indicates that eagan had the power to withhold his signature,or otherwise to overrule,a decision reached by the committee.and brock attorneys failed to elicit any testimony from eagan or to produce any documents demonstrating the degree of control over the selection or retention of committee members that eagan may have had moreover,there has been no showing that the individual committee members acted with deliberate indifference.there is,for example,no evidence that the committee members had medical training or were otherwise aware that the decision to defer to might not be responsive to brock true medical needs.nor is there any claim by brock that,from the documents the committee had before it,it should have been obvious to the committee that outside consultation was necessary to deal adequately with brock condition.we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted to eagan.
defendant wright 
wright has been the chief medical officer of docs for over seven years.his primary responsibility at docs is to set the overall direction for docs provision of health care.it is wright promulgation of docs policy on prevention and treatment of keloids that brock alleges resulted in a violation of his eighth amendment rights.
in particular,item of the docs manual declares keloids to be among the c onditions and services which,absent the existence of collateral symptoms,are considered prima facie medically unnecessary emphasis added.alth
