alfred noll,a software engineer,sued his employer for disability discrimination,alleging that international business machines ibm did not accommodate his deafness by arranging that all video files stored on its corporate intranet be captioned when posted and that all audio files likewise be posted with transcripts.noll asserts claims under the americans with disabilities act ada,and the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law,and appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,dismissing those claims on summary judgment.the district court held that ibm reasonably accommodated noll by providing american sign language asl interpreters capable of translating files at noll request and that,in light of this accommodation,noll has no claim that ibm failed to engage him in an interactive process.
on appeal,noll argues i that the district court overlooked portions of the record creating a factual dispute about the effectiveness of asl interpreters and hence,whether they were a reasonable accommodation,and ii that ibm is liable for failure to engage in an interactive process regardless of whether it provided reasonable accommodation.we affirm.
background 
noll,who is deaf,has worked as a software engineer at ibm since,enjoying consistently positive performance reviews.in performing his work,noll uses several accommodations provided by ibm,including and remote asl interpreters,as well as measures described as communication access translation cart,internet based transcription,and video relay services.noll is active on behalf of ibm employees who are deaf and,and helped develop many of the company accommodations for that group.
ibm maintains a corporate intranet for its approximately employees worldwide.content ranges from official management messages to educational and training resources to such personal material as employees vacation photos.the intranet hosts a huge volume of video and audio files in a number of locations,and thousands of files are continuously being uploaded.ibm media library alone stores over video files and over audio files,of which only about videos are captioned.
from to,noll frequently asked the persons with disabilities program manager at ibm for captioning of particular intranet videos or transcripts of audio files.on these occasions,ibm typically provided noll with transcripts of both video and audio files rather than captioning.however,the process of obtaining transcripts was imperfect although transcripts were generally made available within five days of noll request,they occasionally took longer,and links to transcripts were sometimes broken.
during the relevant period,noll also had access to asl interpreters who provided translation services,either or remotely,for intranet content as well as for live meetings.the process by which ibm employees at the poughkeepsie office where noll worked could request and get asl interpreters was coordinated by noll.
noll,who is fluent in asl,regularly used the interpreters when he attended live meetings,and found them to be effective.noll disliked using asl interpreters for videos because he found it confusing and tiring to look back and forth between the video and the interpreter.
noll filed this action on august,alleging that ibm discriminated against him on the basis of his disability,in violation of the ada and the nyshrl,by refusing to provide the accommodation he demanded that,at the time they are posted,all intranet videos be captioned and all audio files have transcripts.following discovery,ibm moved for summary judgment on june,arguing,among other things,that the accommodations it provided including asl interpreters were plainly reasonable,and noll request that all videos be captioned and all audio files be transcribed was prima facie unreasonable.the district court granted ibm motion on the ground that ibm reasonably accommodated noll by providing asl interpreters.the court also rejected noll claim that ibm failed to engage in an interactive process,reasoning that such a claim can not be maintained if the employer provided reasonable accommodation.
on appeal,noll argues that i the district court ignored evidence in the record creating a genuine dispute about the effectiveness of ibm accommodations,and ii an employer failure to engage in an interactive process suffices for a disability discrimination claim,even if reasonable accommodation was made.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.mario p c food markets,cir.summary judgment must be granted if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.i n assessing the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact,the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.chambers trm copy centers,cir.a genuine issue of material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law and as to which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby.
the ada and the nyshrl require an employer to afford reasonable accommodation of an employee known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer.b a exec.a.to maintain a claim under either statute,an employee must show that he is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ada an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability with reasonable accommodation,the employee could perform the essential functions of the job at issue and the employer has refused to make such accommodations.mcbride bic consumer prods,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also graves finch pruyn,cir a claim of disability discrimination under the new york state human rights law is governed by the same legal standards as govern federal ada claims.the only issue disputed in this case is whether ibm has refused to provide reasonable accommodations.noll concedes that ibm provided him with transcripts and asl interpreters,but argues that those accommodations were unreasonable.
the reasonableness of an employer accommodation is a question that often must be resolved by a factfinder.see wernick fed.reserve bank of,cir.but in a case such as this,in which the employer has already taken or offered measures to accommodate the disability,the employer is entitled to summary judgment if,on the undisputed record,the existing accommodation is plainly reasonable.id.in other words,the plain reasonableness of the existing accommodation ends the analysis.there is no need to engage in further to consider whether the employee requested accommodation would have been reasonable.see airways,barnett,borkowski valley cent.school,cir.
a reasonable accommodation is one that enable s an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position or to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.o ii,iii.noll does not dispute that the accommodations provided enabled him to perform the essential functions of his position.noll claim is that immediate access to all video and audio postings on ibm intranet was a benefit or privilege of employment,like a parking space,health insurance,or a locker.see app.the obligation to make reasonable accommodation applies to all services and programs provided in connection with employment,and to all facilities provided or maintained by an employer for use by its employees,including employer provided cafeterias,lounges,gymnasiums,auditoriums,transportation and the like.we will assume that is so for the purpose of this appeal 
reasonable accommodation may take many forms,but it must be effective.barnett,at it is the word accommodation,not the word reasonable,that conveys the need for effectiveness.an ineffective modification or adjustment will not accommodate a disabled individual limitations.see also borkowski,at.at the same time,employers are not required to provide a perfect accommodation or the very accommodation most strongly preferred by the employee.app.although the preference of the individual with a disability should be given primary consideration,the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations,and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide.emphasis added fink dep t of personnel,cir the rehabilitation act does not require the employer to provide every accommodation the disabled employee may request,so long as the accommodation provided is reasonable.all that is required is effectiveness.
the summary judgment record establishes that ibm provided noll with several accommodations.he had access to asl interpreters,received transcripts upon request,and could view certain videos such as the ceo annual broadcast with captioning.noll argues that the transcripts were inadequate because they were occasionally subject to delays though most were provided within five days,and that captioning appeared on only a few of ibm videos.while there may be disputes of fact as to the timeliness and adequacy of those accommodations,there is no dispute that the asl interpreters were available to noll whenever he wished to view a video or access an audio file and that they translated in.they were available both and remotely.and noll himself helped coordinate interpreter requests including selection of individual interpreters at ibm poughkeepsie office,where he worked.there is no evidence that the interpreters were unqualified or failed to translate fully and accurately.noll concedes that he regularly used interpreters for work meetings at ibm and found their services to be effective.
noll nevertheless insists that there is a genuine question of material fact as to the effectiveness of asl interpreters for intranet videos.first,noll cites his own deposition testimony that he found asl interpreters to be not as effective as captioning.no genuine material question is raised by that testimony because the law requires an effective accommodation,not the one that is most effective for each employee.moreover,a pure legal asl interpreters were entitled to no weight at summary judgment.see patterson cnty.of oneida,cir.
second,noll cites his affidavit,which says he could not simultaneously watch the interpreter and the video because it was too confusing and tiring to switch back and forth between the interpreter and the screen.although we credit noll assertion that it was tiring and confusing to divide his visual attention between interpreters and his screen,this disadvantage does not render interpretive services ineffective.a person who is deaf necessarily receives auditory information from the other senses principally,sight so it can be expected that many accommodations of deafness asl interpretive services as well as captioning will tax visual attention to some degree an accommodation for deafness therefore can not be rendered ineffective by the need to divide visual attention,without more.fink,at the reasonable accommodation requirement does not require the perfect elimination of all disadvantage that may flow from the disability.we do not doubt that the need to split visual focus was a disadvantage that likely tired or annoyed noll.we hold nevertheless that,in this case,the disadvantage did not render ibm accommodations ineffective 
our holding is reinforced by two considerations.first,the term reasonable accommodation is defined by regulation to include the provision of qualified readers or interpreters.o ii.per se rules are unreliable in the disability context,so asl interpretive services may not always constitute a reasonable accommodation.but according to the regulations,interpreters are a common form of reasonable accommodation.see app.part lists the examples,specified in title i of the ada,of the most common types of accommodation that an employer or other covered entity may be required to provide.
second,noll concedes that asl interpreters were effective for live business meetings.there is no evidence that live meetings were somehow less visually demanding or that noll had to shift his eyes a shorter distance.at meetings,just as with videos,noll would need to watch the interpreter while simultaneously looking elsewhere to observe the facial expressions and gestures of the speaker,identify who was speaking,and follow any visual aids.noll does not explain why an accommodation that was effective in the one context was ineffective in the other.at the summary judgment stage,noll was required to adduce evidence of a decisive difference he has not done so.
circumstances can be conceived in which the provision of interpreters would be less obviously reasonable,or even plainly unreasonable,as when technical material can not be fully and accurately communicated by asl.see ups supply chain solutions,cir noting the lack of a correspondence between asl and english.and not every person who is deaf or hard of hearing is able to understand asl.logistical constraints arising out of the job itself might also make asl interpretation infeasible or unwieldy.but a record would be required to document such extraordinary circumstances.
in this case,noll was fluent in asl,and there is no evidence that the interpreters ibm provided were unqualified or that the use of interpreters was somehow inconsistent with noll position as a software engineer.noll sole objection that he had to look back and forth between an interpreter and his screen did not,without more,make that accommodation unreasonable.
because we affirm on this basis,we do not consider ibm alternative argument that noll proposed accommodation was prima facie unreasonable.
to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal,interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.o.noll contends that ibm failed to engage in such a process,and advances an argument that this failure gave rise to an independent cause of action we disagree.
the ada envisions an interactive process by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee disability can be reasonably accommodated.jackan dep t of labor,cir citing o see also lovejoy wilson noco motor fuel,cir.at the same time,we have held that failure to engage in an interactive process does not form the basis of an ada claim in the absence of evidence that accommodation was possible.mcbride,at.that is because the ada imposes liability for discriminatory refusal to undertake a feasible accommodation,not mere refusal to explore possible accommodations where,in the end,no accommodation was possible.id.at.
we conclude that the corollary is also sound the ada imposes no liability for an employer failure to explore alternative accommodations when the accommodations provided to the employee were plainly reasonable.the point of engaging in an interactive process is to discover a means by which an employee disability could have been accommodated.mcbride,at.as our sister circuits have concluded,the interactive process is not required when the end it is designed to serve reasonable accommodation has already been achieved.see rehling city of chicago,cir to hold employers liable for the failure of an interactive process regardless of whether a reasonable accommodation was made would not serve the underlying purposes of the ada,and would,contrary to our own precedent,elevate the ada interactive process requirement to an end in itself.hohider united parcel,cir walter united airlines,wl,at cir unpublished table opinion.because ibm provided reasonable accommodation to noll,any failure to engage in an interactive process even if supported by the record did not give rise to a discrimination claim.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in my view,the record before the district court with respect to the attempted accommodation of alfred noll disability by his employer,international business machines ibm,did not permit the court to conclude as a matter of law,at the summary judgment stage,that ibm offered noll a reasonable accommodation for his disability as required by the americans with disa
