plaintiff fedie redd appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,nicholas garaufis,judge,dismissing her complaint alleging disparate treatment on the basis of race and gender,retaliation,and sexual harassment by her employer,defendant new york state state division of parole division or parole division,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii.the district court granted the division motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint,ruling,as to the sexual harassment claim,that the alleged touchings of redd breasts by a female division supervisor were minor and incidental,were episodic,may have been accidental,and did not occur because of redd sex.on appeal,redd contends that the supervisor touchings were sufficiently abusive to support her hostile work environment claim and that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of fact to be tried.we agree that summary judgment dismissing the hostile work environment claim was inappropriate,and we vacate so much of the judgment as dismissed that claim and remand for further proceedings.
background 
redd,who represented herself throughout the proceedings in the district court,has been employed as a parole officer or po by the division since april.she complained on a number of occasions that she,inter alia,was denied transfers to offices closer to home,where she resided with her three young daughters was subjected to racially discriminatory treatment and discipline was subjected to retaliation for making complaints and was subjected to sexual harassment.after receiving a letter from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,she commenced the present action to pursue those complaints.on this appeal,however,she pursues only her claim of a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment by a division supervisor.to the extent pertinent to that claim,the record,taken in the light most favorable to redd as the party against whom summary judgment was granted,includes the following.
redd complaints of sexual harassment 
in,redd worked in a parole division office in queens,new york the queens i office her immediate supervisor was senior parole officer clifford crawford.beginning in february,area supervisor sarah washington was transferred into the queens i office and headed that office.the principal focus of redd sexual harassment claim is that on three occasions between and,washington made sexual advances to her,touching redd breasts.

redd testified that,as a result of these incidents,in which washington had brushed against my breast and felt my breasts,she was uncomfortable around washington.redd dep.washington was not redd immediate supervisor,but she repeatedly called redd into her office.see,id.at.redd complained to her own supervisor and attempted to avoid going into washington office but as washington was in charge of the entire queens i office,redd had no alternative but to go to washington office when summoned.when asked whether she had complained to washington about the touching,redd testified,
i avoided washington at all costs and she knew i was avoiding her but she continued to call me into her office.i talked to my supervisor about it.she just continued to call me into her office and she was the area supervisor and what she said went 
redd testified that on september,washington rubbed up against my breasts again.redd dep.redd,at the time,was sitting at a computer in a secretarial area attempting to input information using a new procedure.washington,without redd having asked for her help,went over to redd,reached over and touched and brushed up against redd breast.id.at.

redd testified in her deposition that she had complained about washington sexual touchings to jose burgos,the parole division director of human resources,but that no action was taken.see redd dep.burgos,when his deposition was taken by redd,testified that he did not recall that redd had ever filed a complaint about washington directly with the division.deposition of jose burgos burgos dep.at however,he appeared to recall that redd had in fact complained to him that she had been sexually harassed by washington.in testifying about a disciplinary suspension of redd on september,and her reinstatement in as ordered by an arbitrator,burgos stated that the decision as to whether redd would be allowed to return to work absent a ruling by the arbitrator was a decision in which there would have been input from washington.redd asked 
even if she was sexually harassing me 
i have no evidence that she was sexually harassing you.
did i put in the complaint,did i not complain about her sexually harassing me 
my recollection is that you complained that washington bumped you and that you viewed that as bumped you as she passed you,and you viewed that as sexual harassment.

affirmation of jose burgos dated march,burgos aff,emphases added.
the division,in its statement pursuant to local rule rule statement as to the facts that it contended were undisputed,cited,inter alia,washington denial that on april,june,and september,she had touch ed plaintiff in any inappropriate manner.division rule statement.the division also stated that despite redd claim that there was a witness to washington alleged touching in the hallway,redd had failed to proffer the witness name or affidavit because that witness allegedly feared retaliation.id.redd,in a rule statement of facts as to which she contended there were genuine issues to be tried,disputed,inter alia,the division assertion that she had failed to identify the witness to washington hallway touching of redd breasts.see redd rule statement.redd gave the witness name see id,stated that she had previously given it in a confidential list of witnesses see id,and submitted a sworn declaration annexing,inter alia,a copy of the document which was part of the administrative record in which she had included the witness name see declaration of fedie redd dated may,exhibit t.
c.the decision of the district court 
the motion for summary judgment was referred to magistrate judge lois bloom for report and recommendation.the magistrate judge,while recommending that most of redd claims be dismissed,recommended that summary judgment be denied as to the claim of sexual harassment by reason of washington alleged physical contacts.the magistrate judge concluded that 
a reasonable jury could conclude that washington alleged conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile work environment.plaintiff alleges that washington,her supervisor,touched her breasts on three separate occasions over a period plaintiff states that these incidents made her feel uncomfortable to the point where she avoided washington at all costs,but that washington continued to call her into her office plaintiff also states that she was reluctant to complain about washington actions for fear of being labeled as someone who can not work with others 
although washington denies ever touching plaintiff in any inappropriate manner,the court must consider the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff plaintiff has testified that washington,her supervisor,touched her breasts on three occasions over a period,and that this conduct altered the conditions of her employment.plaintiff raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding her hostile work environment claim against washington.therefore,defendant motion for summary judgment on this claim should be denied.
magistrate judge report recommendation dated march,at.
the division objected to this aspect of the magistrate judge recommendation,arguing that 
three isolated brushes or touches by washington of plaintiff chest over a period were neither sufficiently severe nor pervasive enough to alter the conditions of employment,and plaintiff failed to show evidence that a specific basis exists for imputing the objectionable conduct to the employer to make out her prima facie title vii hostile work environment claim.
parole division objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation at see also id.at.it argued,inter alia,that redd had failed to show that the harassment occurred because of her gender see id.at that she had not shown that the incidents were physically threatening or humiliating,or unreasonably interfered with her work,or had caused her any psychological harm see,id.at and that although redd claim ed to have felt uncomfortable,she had not tried to avoid washington by transferring from the office id.at.
in a memorandum order dated march,reported at wl,the district judge upheld the parole division objection to the magistrate judge recommendation that summary judgment be denied as to redd hostile work environment claim of physical touching.the court began by noting that a reasonable jury could find that redd subjectively perceived her environment to be hostile or abusive.wl,at.however,the court concluded that 
redd has failed to offer evidence demonstrating that the conduct was objectively hostile and abusive enough to constitute an intolerable alteration of her working conditions sufficient to substantially interfere with her ability to perform her job.
id.emphasis in original.the court stated that 
washington alleged acts consisted of relatively minor,incidental physical contact.even drawing all inferences in redd favor,the contact may have been purely accidental.there is no basis for concluding that washington conduct was physically threatening or humiliating.moreover,the alleged incidents were episodic,rather than continuous or concerted.
id.emphases added.stating that s everal courts have concluded that similar allegations fall below the threshold of severity for a hostile work environment claim,id.citing quinn green tree credit,cir,and lewis north general hospital,d,the district court ruled that no reasonable jury could find washington conduct to be so severe or pervasive as to be objectively hostile or abusive,wl,at.
the district court also concluded that redd had not proffered sufficient evidence to permit an inference that washington had touched redd breasts because redd was a woman 
even if redd could establish that she was subjected to an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,however,summary judgment for defendant would be appropriate because redd has failed to offer evidence that the relevant conduct occurred because of her membership in a protected class abusive conduct in the workplace for reasons other than a plaintiff membership in a protected class is not actionable under title vii here,no reasonable jury could conclude that washington alleged conduct was directed at redd because of her gender.
the supreme court has explained that c ourts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most sexual harassment situations,because the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity it is reasonable to assume those proposals would not have been made to someone of the same sex.oncale sundowner offshore,d.where a plaintiff alleges sexual harassment,however,it may not be appropriate to infer that similar conduct would not have been directed at an individual of another sex.see id.the oncale court described three possible ways,however,in which a plaintiff may prove that harassment occurred because of sex.a plaintiff can provide credible evidence that the harasser was homosexual demonstrate that the harasser was motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace,or offer direct,comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes differently in a workplace.id.
redd has not offered any credible evidence that washington actions were based on her sex.she has not provided any evidence that washington is a homosexual or was acting based on sexual desire.likewise,there is no evidence that washington was motivated by a general hostility toward women or treated men and women differently in a significant way.redd does not attribute any suggestive or sexual remarks to washington,nor allege that she directed similar conduct toward others.as such,a jury would have to speculate as to washington underlying brushing up against redd.a reasonable jury could not find that,more likely than not,washington brushed up against redd because she was female accordingly,there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the requirement that redd prove that she was discriminated against because of her sex.
wl,at emphasis in original other internal quotation marks omitted.the court found that summary judgment was appropriate,without reaching the question of whether washington conduct could be imputed to the division,redd employer.see id.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,redd,represented by counsel,contends that the district court erred in ruling that there were no genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to her claim of hostile work environment.she argues principally that a reasonable jury could find that washington unwelcome touchings constituted discrimination because of sex and were sufficient to create an abusive working environment,altering the conditions of redd employment,in violation of title vii.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that a factfinder crediting redd version of the events could permissibly infer that washington repeated touching of redd breasts constituted intolerable discrimination against redd because of her sex.
summary judgment principles 
the granting of summary judgment is proper only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.a t the summary judgment stage the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,liberty lobby.where an issue as to a material fact can not be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility,summary judgment is not appropriate.e advisory committee note.

these principles also govern this court review of a grant of summary judgment,which we conduct de novo.see,kaytor,at petrosino bell atlantic,cir petrosino distasio perkin elmer,cir distasio.where s ummary judgment was granted for the employer,we must take the facts alleged by the employee to be true.ellerth,at see,oncale sundowner offshore services,distasio,at the will have her allegations taken as true internal quotation marks omitted.and we are obliged to assume that all factual disputes would be resolved in her favor at trial.petrosino,at.
hostile work environment principles 
title vii prohibits an employer from discriminat ing against any individual with respect to his or her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of,inter alia,such individual sex.a.the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.harris forklift systems,quoting meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,meritor.leaving aside for the moment the question of an employer liability for the acts of its employees,see part.below,it is established w ithout question,that when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate sex,that supervisor discriminate s on the basis of sex.meritor,at emphasis added.s ex discrimination consisting of sexual harassment is actionable under title vii oncale,at.
for sexual harassment to be actionable,it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive,meritor,at both subjectively and objectively,see,harris,at to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.meritor,at internal quotation marks omitted.and,of course,the plaintiff must establish that the hostile or abusive treatment was because of his or her sex.see,oncale,at.when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated.harris,at quoting meritor,at.
t he kinds of workplace conduct that may be actionable under title vii include u nwelcome sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.meritor,at quoting a.w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.harris,at.
these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.the effect on the employee psychological is,of course,relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.but while psychological harm,like any other relevant factor,may be taken into account,no single factor is required.
id.emphases added.to establish this element,a plaintiff need not show that her hostile working environment was both severe and pervasive only that it was sufficiently severe or sufficiently pervasive,or a sufficient combination of these elements,to have altered her working conditions.pucino verizon communications,cir pucino emphases in original see,terry ashcroft,cir race discrimination see generally faragher city of boca raton,standards for what amounts to actionable abuse are the same for racial and sexual harassment.isolated incidents usually will not suffice to establish a hostile work environment,although we have often noted that even a single episode of harassment can establish a hostile work environment if the incident is sufficiently severe,pucino,at kaytor,at howley town of stratford,cir quinn green tree credit,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by national passenger morgan,torres pisano,cir,cert.denied,see,feingold new york,cir a single act can create a hostile work environment if it in fact work s a transformation of the plaintiff workplace.internal quotation marks omitted.
the court must take care,however,not to view individual incidents in isolation.in assessing the evidence to determine whether a rational juror could infer that a reasonable employee would have found the abuse so pervasive or severe as to alter her working conditions,especially in the context of a claim of sexual harassment,where state of mind and intent are at issue,the court should not view the record in piecemeal fashion,kaytor,f d at internal quotation marks omitted.the objective hostility of a work environment depends on the totality of the circumstances,viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances including the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target.petrosino,at quoting oncale,at.
nonetheless,while the central statutory purpose of title vii was eradicating discrimination in employment,franks bowman transportation,title vii does not set forth a general civility code for the american workplace,burlington northern santa fe ry.white,quoting oncale,at.in oncale,the court noted that it had 
emphasized in meritor and harris that the statute does not reach genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex.the prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace it forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment.conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive is beyond title vii purview.
oncale,at quoting harris,at emphases ours.the court noted that it regarded the objective component both as crucial and as sufficient to ensure that courts and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace such as horseplay or intersexual discriminatory conditions of employment.oncale,at emphasis added.it pointed out that 
i n as in all harassment cases,th e inquiry requires careful consideration of the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target.a professional football player working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive,for example,if the coach smacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field even if the same behavior would reasonably be experienced as abusive by the coach secretary male or female back at the office.the real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.common sense,and an appropriate sensitivity to social context,will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing or roughhousing among members of the same sex,and conduct which a reasonable person in the plaintiff position would find severely hostile or abusive.
id.at emphases added.
the line between complaints that are easily susceptible to dismissal as a matter of law and those that are not is indistinct.see,schiano quality payroll systems,cir schiano holtz,at.on one side lie complaints of sexual assaults other physical contact,whether amorous or hostile,for which there is no consent express or implied uninvited sexual solicitations intimidating words or acts and obscene language or gestures on the other side lies the occasional vulgar banter,tinged with sexual innuendo,of coarse or boorish workers.gallagher,at internal quotation marks omitted.and on either side of the line there are,depending on the circumstances,gradations of abusiveness.
casual contact that might be expected among friends a hand on the shoulder,a brief hug,or a peck on the cheek would normally be unlikely to create a hostile environment in the absence of aggravating circumstances such as continued contact after an objection and e ven more intimate or more crude physical acts a hand on the thigh,a kiss on the lips,a pinch of the buttocks may be considered insufficiently abusive to be described as severe when they occur in isolation but when the physical contact surpasses what if it were consensual might be expected between friendly coworkers it becomes increasingly difficult to write the conduct off as a pedestrian annoyance.
patton keystone rv,cir patton internal quotation marks omitted emphases added.d irect contact with an intimate body part constitutes one of the most severe forms of sexual harassment.worth tyer,cir.
most of the above principles have been established in cases involving heterosexual conflicts.in harassment cases,however,an inference that physical contact was because of the employee sex may be less evident.
courts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most sexual harassment situations,because the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity it is reasonable to assume those proposals would not have been made to someone of the same sex.the same chain of inference would be available to a plaintiff alleging harassment,if there were credible evidence that the harasser was homosexual.but harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.a trier of fact might reasonably find such discrimination,for example,if a female victim is harassed in such and derogatory terms by another woman as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace.a harassment plaintiff may also,of course,offer direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in a workplace.whatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow,he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,but actually constituted discrimina tion because of sex.
oncale,at emphases added original emphasis omitted.
t he question of whether considerations of the plaintiff sex caused the conduct at issue often requires an assessment of individuals motivations and state of mind.kaytor,at quoting brown henderson,cir emphasis ours.issues of causation,intent,and motivation are questions of fact.see,anderson bessemer city,pullman standard swint.although summary judgment in discrimination cases is fully appropriate,indeed mandated,when the evidence is insufficient to support the party case,distasio,at sex discrimination see,mclee chrysler,cir race discrimination abdu brisson delta air lines,cir age discrimination,cert.denied,when,as is often the case in sexual harassment claims,fact questions such as state of mind or intent are at issue,summary judgment should be used sparingly,distasio,at internal quotation marks omitted see,kaytor,at schiano,f d at.

c.the record in the present case 
if redd had merely asserted sexual advances in conclusory terms,we would agree with the summary dismissal of her sexual harassment claim.however,her assertions although perhaps less detailed than they may be at trial,now that she is no longer proceeding pro se were far from conclusory.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to redd and accepting her version of the events as true,as we are required to do and a jury would be permitted to do,we have several difficulties with the district court conclusions that no rational juror could find that washington had sexually abused redd because of her sex and that the abuse was not sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment in violation of title vii.
according to redd sworn statements,washington touched redd breasts on three occasions.redd characterized washington touches in a variety of ways.in the first incident,which occurred in washington office,washington brushed against redd breasts,but did so in a way that was sufficiently substantial to unnerve redd and cause her to spill water all over the transfer list she was reviewing.redd dep.in the second incident,washington came up to redd in a hallway and touched and rubbed up against redd breasts.id.in these incidents,washington felt redd breasts.id.at emphasis added.in the third incident,washington came over to redd who was sitting at a computer in a secretarial area and reached over and touched redd breasts.id.at.there is nothing conclusory about these accusations.redd inferred that washington touching,feeling,and rubbing up against redd breasts were homosexual advances complaint.we see no principled reason why a jury,considering the evidence of repeated touching of such body parts,would not be permitted to draw the same inference.although washington denied that she had sexually harass ed redd or touch ed po redd in any inappropriate manner washington aff,the jury would not be required to believe those denials hence the district court,in determining whether the division was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,was required to disregard them.
the court statement that there was no basis for concluding that washington conduct was physically threatening,wl,at,is contradicted by the above evidence that washington in fact repeatedly made phy
