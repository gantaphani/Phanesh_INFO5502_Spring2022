this putative class action was brought by seven named plaintiffs,all who were detained on immigration violations following the terrorist attacks of september,the plaintiffs allege,inter alia,that on account of their arab or muslim background or perceived background,they were subjected to excessively prolonged detention,abused physically and verbally,subjected to arbitrary and abusive strip searches,and otherwise mistreated while in custody.crucially,plaintiffs acknowledge that at the time they were detained they were present in the united states illegally,and were subject to removal.their constitutional claims rest on i the conditions of their confinement,and ii the allegation that their detentions were illegally prolonged so that the government could investigate any potential ties to terrorism.
plaintiffs brought separate claims against identified defendants,including the united states,former attorney general john ashcroft,fbi director robert mueller,and former immigration and naturalization service ins commissioner james ziglar,as well as metropolitan detention center mdc officials and correctional officers.
the united states,ashcroft,mueller,and ziglar,as well as four mdc officials collectively,the moving defendants moved to dismiss certain claims on grounds that include qualified immunity and failure to state a claim.at the risk of oversimplifying a complex ruling the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,denied the motions to dismiss claims concerning the conditions of confinement,but dismissed claims concerning the length of detention.see turkmen ashcroft,civ.jg,wl,at june.both sides appealed.
on november,plaintiffs moved for dismissal without prejudice of the pending appeals and in their entirety.plaintiffs argue principally that the appeals and are moot in light of a settlement recently reached with five named plaintiffs and plaintiffs counsel intent to seek leave in the district court to file a proposed fourth amended complaint on behalf of the two remaining plaintiffs,other plaintiffs to be named,and the putative class.ashcroft and mueller oppose such a dismissal.
plaintiffs argue that we should dismiss as moot the appeals related to the denial of the conditions of confinement claims,because the two remaining named plaintiffs ibrahim turkmen and akil sachdeva did not appeal the dismissal of claim and never asserted claims.however,plaintiffs counsel intends to preserve claims and as part of the putative class complaint by proposing to file a fourth amended complaint adding five new named plaintiffs.further,ashcroft and mueller argue that they appealed the district court decision to deny the dismissal of claims in part,and in addition to claims and three claims that turkmen and sachdeva asserted along with the five settling plaintiffs.plaintiffs indicate that the proposed fourth amended complaint will not allege claim however,claims and remain live as does claim pending its withdrawal.moreover,defendants retain a strong interest in a decision on their invocation of qualified immunity concerning claims that have been long pending and as plaintiffs counsel confirms will be asserted in a new pleading.finally,this is not the kind of case in which the class representative interest abated during briefing or before oral argument the settlement did not arise until long after the february,argument and the settling plaintiffs thus maintained a personal stake in pressing this appeal throughout.
based on these circumstances and the district court stay of the class certification motion,this court is persuaded that the appeals related to the conditions of confinement claims are not moot.see comer cisneros,cir where the claims of the named plaintiffs become moot prior to class certification,there are several ways in which mootness is not had.see also swan stoneman,cir to the extent that appellants argument is that swan death does not moot the class claim if one of the proposed intervenors can be substituted as named plaintiff,we agree.in re australia bank sec,civ.bsj,wl,at,recognizing general rule that lack of class representative renders class action moot,and exceptions to that rule where motion for class certification is pending or plaintiff did not have reasonable opportunity to move for class certification id.at explaining that live controversy exists where new named plaintiff may be substituted or may intervene upon mooting of class representative claims.accordingly,we deny plaintiffs motion to dismiss this appeal without prejudice on the ground of mootness 
the appeals and are hereby dismissed only to the limited extent necessary to recognize the settlement of five named plaintiffs.despite this settlement and the proposed fourth amended complaint,virtually all of the appeals and remain pending for our review because i the two remaining plaintiffs asserted several of the claims underlying the moving defendants appeals,and ii plaintiffs propose to file a fourth amended complaint preserving for the putative class the claims asserted only by the settling plaintiffs through the addition of the proposed intervenor plaintiffs.
we review de novo the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint.see woods rondout valley cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.
we first consider defendants challenge to the district court order denying dismissal of claims related to the conditions of,in part,and.
the district court ruled on the defendants motions to dismiss prior to the supreme court decisions in twombly and iqbal.it applied a standard of review under which it would not dismiss a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief.turkmen,wl,at citing jaghory state dep t of,cir.now,following the district court decision,twombly and iqbal require a heightened pleading standard in those contexts where factual amplification is needed to render a claim plausible.ross bank of america,usa,cir internal quotation marks,citations,brackets,and emphasis omitted.we could undertake to decide whether the challenged claims satisfy the pleading standard of twombly and iqbal however,in the circumstances of this plaintiffs have already announced their intent to file a fourth amended complaint to preserve for the putative class the claims asserted only by the settling think it better to vacate that portion of the district court order denying dismissal of the conditions of confinement claims on the ground that an outdated pleading standard was applied,and to remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the standard articulated in twombly and iqbal.
it may be that the district court will grant plaintiffs leave to file the proposed fourth amended complaint to satisfy the heightened pleading standard.see.a providing that a court should freely give leave when justice so requires.we decline to consider whether plaintiffs should be allowed to replead yet again because,i n the ordinary course,we are accustomed to reviewing a district court decision whether to grant or deny leave to amend,rather than making that decision for ourselves in the first instance.iqbal ashcroft,cir.
if the district court denies leave to file the proposed fourth amended complaint,it should evaluate the sufficiency of the third amended complaint in light of the settlement and the heightened pleading standard.the district court can then address whether,under twombly and iqbal,the third amended complaint fails to state a claim,or inadequately alleges the personal involvement of the moving defendants,or entitles the moving defendants to qualified immunity with respect to the conditions of confinement claims.
at this stage of proceedings,we do no more than vacate the order denying the motions to dismiss with respect to the cond
