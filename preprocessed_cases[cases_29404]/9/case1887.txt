lori freeman appeals a grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer,dal tile corporation,on her claims of racial and sexual hostile work environment,constructive discharge,and common law obstruction of justice.for the reasons discussed more fully below,we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the hostile work environment claims and remand them for further consideration.we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the claims of constructive discharge and common law obstruction of justice.
dal tile corporation manufactures,distributes,and markets ceramic tile and natural stone products it operates eight manufacturing facilities,five regional distribution centers,and over sales service centers,including both stone yards and tile showrooms.
in june,dal tile acquired the assets of marble point,a stone yard located in raleigh,north carolina,from owner marco izzi.dal tile incorporated this operation into a center organization the stoneyard.after this sale,izzi purchased an ownership interest in vostone,a kitchen and bath remodeling center.a significant percentage of vostone business involved working with dal tile.
in august,freeman began working as a receptionist for dal tile predecessor,marble point.she was hired on a temporary basis through a staffing agency,but after six months,she joined marble point as a permanent employee.throughout her tenure at marble point,freeman reported to izzi and to assistant manager sara wrenn.following dal tile acquisition of marble point,freeman became a dal tile employee and wrenn continued to be her supervisor.freeman first position with dal tile was general office clerk.over time,freeman began interacting more frequently with dal tile customers,and she effectively functioned as a customer service representative.in may,she was promoted to the role of sales consultant.in november,freeman position was reclassified to customer service representative.
the harassment claims at issue are based on the behavior of timothy koester,an independent sales representative for vostone.freeman usually interacted with koester more than once a day while he was conducting business with dal tile on behalf of vostone.
about two weeks after freeman became a temporary employee with marble point in august,she overheard koester as he walked into wrenn office and,referencing a photograph of two former employees,asked wrenn and another employee h ey,who are these two black b es.after the incident,freeman asked wrenn about koester,inquiring w ho was he and what was his deal.wrenn replied h e an asshole,but i do think he do it again.id.the next day,freeman told koester how uncomfortable and demeaning that made her feel,and she asked him not to use that sort of language anymore.
freeman also recalled koester making comments about women he had been with the night before.on one occasion,koester showed her a photograph of a naked woman on his cell phone and remarked t his is what i left in my bed to come here today.on a different occasion,freeman overheard koester talking with one of her,jodi scott,about photographs of scott daughters that were displayed in scott office.according to freeman,koester told scott i going to hook up with one your daughters,or i going to turn one of your daughters out.scott replied y ou better stay away from my kids,or d o talk to me about my kids.id.
in a different instance,koester passed gas on freeman phone.koester was using freeman office phone,and she was standing there waiting for him to finish his conversation.before koester hung up the phone,he held it to his buttocks and passed gas on it.wrenn was present for this incident.freeman immediately began crying and had to leave the room to calm down.
in june,koester called freeman about covering a customer appointment for him because he had been partying the night before.koester indicated that he could not come into the office,saying i just too f ed up,do take offense,but i as f ed up as a n r checkbook.freeman told wrenn about koester comment that same day,but wrenn just scoffed and shook her head and put her head back down and continued on with trying to pick the nail polish off of her nails.freeman also reported koester remark to james vose,one of the of vostone.vose laughed and said y ou got to admit that kind of funny,just do what i do and hit him because he an asshole.
subsequently,on july,koester called dal tile general office line,and freeman answered the phone.koester had his daughter,angelina,with him at the time.freeman,who knew angelina,asked koester to tell angelina that she said hi.instead,koester put freeman on speaker phone so that she and angelina could talk with one another.freeman then heard angelina ask daddy,who that.koester replied t hat the black b over at marble point.id.freeman immediately became very irate.id.she told koester d o you ever call me a black b as long as you live.id.koester responded o h,word.id.freeman promptly told wrenn about koester comment,but wrenn appeared disinterested and continued a conversation that she had been having with some other.
in addition to these specific incidents,freeman and other testified more generally that koester frequently made inappropriate sexual comments.freeman testified that koester was always coming in making some sort of lewd comments.she also stated that maybe two or three times a week she would have to correct koester and tell him not to say something inappropriate.freeman explained that koester would come in to discuss what he did the night before with whatever woman he was with and freeman would tell him she did want to hear it.wrenn confirmed this,stating that he liked to brag about his,you know,evening excursions,or his weekend excursions t here were times where he would say something about what he did the night before that had sexual content to it.according to wrenn,h e always made comments about women.wrenn also testified that koester used the word b in the office,such as you should have seen these hot b es i met last night.jodi scott testified that koester used the word b u sually about every time that he came in.wrenn even referred to koester as a pig.koester himself also admitted he made sexual comments in the office.
freeman and other also testified generally about koester inappropriate racial remarks.for instance,koester used racial slang such as yo,b and how my b es when talking to the female employees.jodi scott testified that koester used racial language every day that he came into the office.koester himself admitted to using african american type slang.cathy diksa,a human resource manager,explained that according to manager wrenn,koester used racial language in the office.for instance,following the election of barack obama in,koester said to freeman,y ou guys won.koester himself testified that he probably made comments about taking beautiful black girls home with him.he also admitted that he made comments that were m aybe racially inappropriate.
following the most recent black b incident in july,freeman reported koester remarks to cathy diksa in human resources after wrenn ignored her complaint.diksa initially promised koester would be permanently banned from the facility.however,the company lifted the ban and instead prohibited koester from communicating with freeman.he was allowed on the premises but had to coordinate all meetings through wrenn.
freeman was so upset about the prospect of being forced to interact with koester that she took a medical leave of absence beginning september.during this time she received treatment for depression and anxiety.freeman returned to work around november.wrenn informed freeman that koester no longer worked for vostone but for another kitchen and bath fabricator.wrenn told freeman that koester would continue to call wrenn cell phone and not the general office line if he needed to conduct business with dal tile.
on december,freeman notified dal tile that she was resigning from her position effective december.freeman testified that she resigned because the depression and anxiety became too much for her she was constantly worried she would encounter koester at work.
in october,while on medical leave,freeman filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,asserting that dal tile had subjected her to discrimination based on her sex and race.
after receiving a right to sue letter,freeman brought this action in the eastern district of north carolina,asserting claims for racial hostile work environment under racial and sexual hostile work environment under title vii of the civil rights act of discriminatory discharge under and obstruction of justice under north carolina common law the obstruction of justice claim is based on the allegation that dal tile failed to issue a litigation hold on after it received her october,eeoc charge and thus destroyed a significant number of pursuant to its email retention policy.
following discovery,in may,dal tile filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted this motion.freeman dal tile,d.
first,the district court held that in regard to the racial and sexual hostile work environment claims,freeman did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue of whether the harassment was objectively severe or pervasive.however,the district court noted that plaintiff subjectively perceived the alleged racial and sexual harassment to be abusive.id.at.
second,the district court ruled that even if the harassment was found to be objectively severe or pervasive enough to alter freeman work conditions,dal tile would still be entitled to summary judgment because freeman could not establish that liability should be imputed to dal tile.the district court used a negligence standard,adopted from an unpublished opinion of this court,in which an employer is liable for the actions of a third party if it knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take appropriate actions to halt it.id.at quoting eeoc cromer food,app x,cir.
applying this standard,the district court held that daltile did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the harassment because no reasonable could conclude that plaintiff statement s to wrenn constituted a complaint,either formal or informal.id.at.further,the district court noted that even if it were to assume arguendo that the remarks that plaintiff made to wrenn could somehow be construed as complaints,it is undisputed that plaintiff knew there were additional avenues that she could have pursued if she was unsatisfied with wrenn response.id.at.in the second inquiry of the negligence analysis,whether the employer response was appropriate,the district court ruled that dal tile response to koester behavior was adequate as a matter of law.
third,the district court held that freeman was not constructively discharged but,rather,voluntarily resigned.the district court noted that freeman was unable to show that anyone at dal tile acted deliberately with an unlawful discriminatory intent in order to force her to resign either before or after she returned from medical leave.id.at.
lastly,the district court ruled that freeman north carolina obstruction of justice claim failed as a matter of law.the district court stated that the evidence does not support a finding that anyone at dal tile intentionally destroyed emails in order to keep plaintiff from proceeding with a legal claim.id.at.
this court review s the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court and viewing the facts and inferences drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.evans techs.applications serv,cir.
on appeal,freeman argues a reasonable jury could conclude that she was subjected to a racially and sexually hostile work environment a reasonable jury could find that liability for koester harassment is imputable to dal tile a reasonable jury could find that she was constructively discharged and north carolina common law requires only general intent not specific intent for obstruction of justice claims,and the destruction of emails here meets this standard.we address each in turn.
freeman first argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her hostile work environment claims.under title vii,i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.since an employee work environment is a term or condition of employment,title vii creates a hostile working environment cause of action.eeoc r r ventures,cir citing meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.
for this court to reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to dal tile on her hostile work environment claims,freeman must establish that the evidence,viewed in her favor,
would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the harassment was unwelcome,based on freeman gender or race,sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive atmosphere,and imputable to daltile.
eeoc cent.wholesalers,cir citing eeoc sunbelt rentals,cir.
first,freeman must establish that a reasonable jury could conclude that the sex or harassment was unwelcome.as discussed above,freeman complained of her harassment to wrenn,human resources,and koester himself.she told koester repeatedly to stop making such crude and demeaning comments.she cried in both wrenn and koester presence over the harassment.she eventually was treated for depression and anxiety because of it.based on this evidence,we believe that a reasonable jury could find that both the sex and harassment were unwelcome.
second,freeman must show that a reasonable jury could find that the harassment was based on her sex or race.the evidence shows that koester used the word b in the office almost every time he came in,often discussed his sexual encounters with women,showed naked pictures of women to freeman and others,frequently made lewd comments,discussed having sex with a daughters,and called freeman a black b,among other things.based on this evidence,a reasonable jury could find that the harassment was based on freeman sex.see,forrest brinker intern.payroll,cir stating that a raft of case law establishes that the use of sexually degrading,epithets,such as b,has been consistently held to constitute harassment based upon sex.
regarding race,koester discussed bringing black girls home with him,used racial slang in the office on a daily basis,said black b at least twice once directed at freeman,told freeman he was as f ed up as a n r checkbook,and admitted to maybe using racially inappropriate language in the office.in light of this evidence,a reasonable jury could find that koester harassment was also based on freeman race.see spriggs diamond auto glass,cir describing the use of the word n r as an unambiguously racial epithet quoting rodgers western southern life ins,cir.
third,freeman must show that a reasonable jury could find that the sex or harassment was so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive or hostile atmosphere.this element of a hostile work environment claim has both subjective and objective parts.cent.wholesalers,at citing harris forklift systems,d.freeman thus must show that she did perceive,and a reasonable person would perceive,the environment to be abusive or hostile.id.
regarding the subjective component,the district court stated,and we agree,that the evidence supports a finding that freeman subjectively perceived both types of harassment to be abusive or hostile.as discussed above,freeman complained about the harassment to her supervisor,human resources,and koester himself.she cried at work in front of because of the harassment.the evidence also shows the harassment interfered with her ability to work,as she was often distracted by koester inappropriate behavior and the stress that she felt from having to interact with him.freeman ultimately had to take medical leave and seek treatment for depression and anxiety because of koester harassment.in light of this evidence,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that freeman found the harassment subjectively hostile or abusive.see cent.wholesalers,at finding a triable issue of fact on subjective perception of hostility where plaintiff complained about both types of harassment and stated that she found such harassment objectionable and that the harassment caused her emotional distress harris mayor city council of baltimore,app x,cir finding a triable issue of fact on subjective perception of hostility where plaintiff presented evidence that she complained of harassment,suffered from a depressive disorder because of her work experiences,and was seen crying at work by a.
next we must determine whether the harassment was objectively severe or pervasive.
this objective inquiry is not,and by its nature can not be,a mathematically precise test.harris,at.rather,when determining whether the harassing conduct was objectively severe or pervasive,we must look at all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.sunbelt,at quotation marks omitted.n o single factor is dispositive,harris,at,as t he real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed,oncale sundowner offshore services,d.

here,the record is replete with evidence of frequent abusive behavior by koester during freeman tenure with marble point and dal tile.regarding the harassment,koester repeatedly used the word b in the office,inquired about two black b es he saw in a picture,called freeman a black b,passed gas on freeman phone,and often discussed his sexual experiences with women,including showing naked pictures on his phone.he made lewd comments on a regular basis,and was described by wrenn as a pig.freeman has certainly established a triable issue on whether the harassment was objectively severe or pervasive.see,cent.wholesalers,at finding that the frequent use of the word b,coupled with both displays of scantily clad or naked women in the office and inappropriate sexual jokes,was sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on the issue of objective hostility.
based on the evidence,a reasonable jury could also find the harassment was objectively severe or pervasive.freeman used racial slang in the office on a daily basis.he inquired about two black b es he saw in a picture.he called freeman a black b in the presence of his young daughter.he discussed bringing home black women to have sex with them.he told freeman he was as f ed up as a n r checkbook.
to begin,the word n r is pure anathema to african americans,spriggs,at,as it should be to everyone.moreover,as we have stated before,w e can not ignore the habitual use of epithets here or view the conduct without an eye for its cumulative effect.our precedent has made this point repeatedly.sunbelt rentals,at.therefore,when viewing the circumstances as a whole,we find the use of the word n r,coupled with the offensive racial talk,use of the term black b on more than one occasion once directed at a black employee,and sexual talk regarding black women,is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find the harassment was objectively severe or pervasive.
lastly,freeman must establish a basis for imposing liability on dal tile for the sex or harassment.gilliam dep t of juvenile justice,cir.the district court adopted a negligence standard for analyzing an employer liability for harassment under title vii.this court has not yet adopted this standard in a published opinion,but we do so today similar to the reasoning we set forth for employer liability for harassment,an employer can not avoid title vii liability for harassment by adopting a see no evil,hear no evil strategy.ocheltree scollon,cir en banc.therefore,an employer is liable under title vii for third parties creating a hostile work environment if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action reasonably calculated to end the harassment.amirmokri baltimore gas,cir quoting katz dole,cir internal quotation marks omitted applying this standard to harassment.
applying this standard here,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that dal tile knew or should have known of the harassment.here,freeman presented evidence that wrenn,her supervisor,knew of all three of the most major incidents the two black b comments,and the f ed up as a n r checkbook comment.wrenn was present for the first black b comment,which freeman complained about to wrenn afterward.freeman also complained to wrenn specifically about the other two comments from koester almost immediately after they occurred when freeman complained to wrenn about the f ed up as a n r checkbook comment,wrenn scoffed and shook her head and put her head back down and continued on with trying to pick the nail polish off of her nails.when freeman complained about the second black b comment,wrenn simply rolled her eyes and went on talking to a.in addition to these most severe incidents,wrenn was also present the time koester passed gas on freeman phone and freeman began crying and had to leave the room.
not only did wrenn know of these specific and more severe incidents,but she also knew the harassment was an situation.as discussed above,wrenn herself testified that she knew koester used the word b in the office frequently,that he made sexual comments in the office,that he showed pictures of naked women on his phone in the office,and that he always made comments about women.wrenn herself referred to him as a pig.cathy diksa also testified that wrenn knew koester used racial language in the office.
this evidence,if proven true,shows that dal tile,through its agent wrenn,had actual knowledge of the harassment and that freeman found it offensive,as shown by freeman frequent complaints and her negative reaction to his behavior.however,even if wrenn did not have actual knowledge that freeman was offended by koester behavior,at the very least,she should have known it wrenn was aware of koester inappropriate behavior and comments,had received several complaints about the harassing incidents from freeman,had witnessed freeman crying from the harassment,and knew incendiary terms like n r and black b had been used in the presence of a black,female employee.as stated above,a n employer can not avoid title vii liability for coworker harassment by adopting a see no evil,hear no evil strategy.ocheltree,at.therefore,we conclude a reasonable jury could find that dal tile knew,or at the very least,should have known,of koester harassment.
in addition,freeman has at least created a triable issue of fact as to whether dal tile response to halt the harassment was adequate.despite wrenn notice of koester behavior,dal tile did not take any effective action to halt the harassment until freeman reported up the chain to cathy diksa in human resources after the final black b comment at that point,the harassment had been ongoing for three years.diksa originally told freeman that koester would be permanently banned from dal tile.however,the company lifted the ban and instead simply prohibited koester from communicating with freeman while still allowing him on the premises if he coordinated his meetings through wrenn.
as stated above,once an employer has notice of harassment,it must take prompt remedial action reasonably calculated to end the harassment.amirmokri,at quoting katz,at internal quotation marks omitted.not only did dal tile fail to take any serious action for three years in spite of the long list of ongoing harassment by koester,but particularly shocking to us is the fact dal tile took absolutely no action when koester passed gas on freeman phone and made freeman cry in wrenn presence,nor when freeman promptly complained to wrenn that koester had used the word n r on the phone with her.although the harassment eventually stopped after the communication ban was put into place,the harassment had continued unabated for three years prior to that.while a communication ban ma
