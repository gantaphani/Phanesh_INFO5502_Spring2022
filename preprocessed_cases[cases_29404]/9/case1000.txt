background 
the parties do not dispute that in june spiegel was terminated from his position as an instructor at a tiger schulmann karate school located in stamford,connecticut.in the fall of,spiegel notified schulmann and uak that he intended to file an employment discrimination charge with the connecticut commission on human rights opportunities cchro,alleging that he had been terminated on the basis of his weight.subsequently,in november,schatzberg,who was known to be spiegel friend and roommate,was terminated from his position as an instructor at a tiger schulmann karate school in rego park,queens.after the plaintiffs filed their original ada complaint in the district court,the corporation that operates the stamford karate school filed a lawsuit against spiegel in connecticut state court,alleging that he had attempted to interfere with the stamford school contract with one of its employees.in their second amended complaint in this case,the plaintiffs alleged,inter alia,that schulmann had retaliated against them in violation of the provision of the ada by terminating schatzberg from the rego park center and by filing the state court lawsuit against spiegel,and that schulmann had violated the nyshrl and nychrl by terminating spiegel on the basis of his weight.
the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted in its entirety.it found that it had no personal jurisdiction over uak because the company did not do business in new york,nor did the claims in this action arise from any transactions conducted in new york.with respect to schulmann,the court concluded that the ada retaliation claims could not be sustained because plaintiffs had offered no theory upon which schulmann,an individual who was not the defendants employer,could be held liable for a claim of ada retaliation.the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the prima facie elements of their nyshrl discriminatory firing claim,the court found,and had failed under the parallel nychrl claim to rebut as pretextual the legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for the firing produced by the defendants.
this appeal followed.
personal jurisdiction over uak 
this court reviews de novo a district court legal conclusion regarding whether a party has demonstrated a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.see cutco,naughton,cir.we hold that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over uak.
a district court personal jurisdiction is determined by the law of the state in which the court is located.see thomas ashcroft,cir.in this case,the plaintiffs argue that uak was subject to the district court personal jurisdiction under a.section a,however,provides for personal jurisdiction only with respect to causes of action arising out of the transaction of business conducted in new york.see,bank brussels lambert fiddler gonzales rodriguez,cir noting that a single transaction can satisfy the requirements of a so long as the relevant cause of action also arises from that transaction citing george reiner schwartz.the plaintiffs allege that references to headquarters made by several witnesses during depositions in this case demonstrate that uak was involved in the decisions to terminate the plaintiffs employment.nothing in the record,however,demonstrates that any witness used headquarters to refer to uak or intended to suggest that uak was the headquarters from which the directive to terminate the plaintiffs originated.
the plaintiffs also argue that the record demonstrated that uak services to the new york karate centers included personnel matters such that the terminations of the plaintiffs arose out of those services.again,nothing in the record demonstrates that,in the context of personnel matters,uak provided anything more than administrative services and payroll processing to the new york karate centers.although the record contains evidence that vincent gravina,a of the rego park center,notified uak employees when he terminated shatzberg employment,that evidence also demonstrates that gravina did so only to effect schatzberg removal from the payroll of the karate center.the plaintiffs have failed to offer any evidence that their causes of action against uak arise from uak transaction of business in new york state.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment on this point 
ii.state law invasion of privacy claim 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all inferences in favor of,the.sheppard beerman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if it can be established that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c internal quotation marks omitted.
under new york law,a defendant immunity from a claim for invasion of privacy is no broader than the consent executed to him.dzurenko jordache,internal quotation marks omitted.where the plaintiff consent is limited with respect to form or forum,the use of the plaintiff photograph is without consent if it exceeds the limitation.id.
on appeal,the plaintiffs rely on russell marboro books,and carlson hillman periodicals.div.dep t,to support their argument that the use of spiegel altered photograph in the advertisement exceeded the scope of the consent he had granted by signing the general release.in this case,however,the release signed by spiegel was both broader and more clearly worded than the releases at issue in russell and carlson.by signing the release,spiegel agreed for all purposes,to the sale,reproduction use in any manner of any and all photographs,videos,films,audio,or any depiction or portrayal of himself or his likeness voice whatsoever.although spiegel might not have anticipated that his image would be altered for use as a fat suit,the release clearly allowed the defendants to use his image in any manner and to use any depiction or portrayal of spiegel for all purposes.given the lack of ambiguity in the release,the district court did not err in determining that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendants use of spiegel image had invaded his privacy.we affirm the grant of summary judgment on this claim.
iii.declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction 
this court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court decision declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.see mercantile,cir.in order to decide plaintiffs state and municipal retaliation claims,the district court would have been required to determine whether,under the applicable state and municipal laws,an allegedly frivolous lawsuit filed in another state court constituted a retaliatory act for purposes of the nyshrl and the nychrl.to decline to do so clearly was not an abuse of discretion.
iv.denial of motion to amend 
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision denying a motion to amend.see kassner delicatessen,cir.where the denial of leave to amend is based upon a legal interpretation,however,this court reviews it de novo.littlejohn artuz,cir per curiam.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint to add tsk franchise systems as a defendant.it reasoned that,because it had already determined the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over uak,and because the proposed allegations against tsk were identical to the allegations against uak,allowing such an amendment would be futile.
a review of the proposed third amended complaint and the record demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend.as discussed above,the district court properly determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over uak.neither the plaintiffs third amended complaint nor the evidence adduced during discovery provided any basis to demonstrate that the district court would have had personal jurisdiction over tsk.accordingly,we affirm the district court order denying the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their complaint.
denial of motion to enjoin the state court lawsuit 
when a district court declines to issue an injunction,we review for clear error the court factual conclusion that an injunction is not necessary,and we review de novo the court interpretation of the all writs and acts.see retirement of morgan chase,cir.the act prohibits a district court from granting an injunction staying a state court proceeding except as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.see mitchum foster,setting forth criteria for determining whether a statute expressly authorizes a district court to issue injunctions.
without determining whether the act applies to requests for injunctions of state court proceedings that are allegedly retaliatory under the ada,we conclude that the district court did not err in declining to issue the injunction sought by the plaintiffs.although the plaintiffs argued that the state lawsuit was patently frivolous,they offered no evidence to support that conclusory statement.see,eeoc levi strauss,noting that i n order to establish the propriety of an injunction,the party seeking to enjoin an allegedly retaliatory state court lawsuit must demonstrate that the action was filed for improper,retaliatory,purposes.further,other than general allegations regarding schulmann control over stamford karate,there is no evidence in the record that schulmann directed the filing of the lawsuit against spiegel.accordingly,to the extent that the ada might expressly authorize the issuance of the type of injunction sought by the plaintiffs,the plaintiffs offer no basis upon which this court can determine that the district court erred in failing to do so.we affirm the court order declining to enjoin proceedings in the connecticut lawsuit.
vi.individual liability under the ada retaliation provision 
a provides that n o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this chapter.with respect to retaliation claims in the context of employment discrimination,c adopts,inter alia,t he remedies and procedures available under section specifically makes applicable to actions under the ada the remedies available under.see a providing that t he powers,remedies,and procedures set forth in section of this title shall be the powers,remedies,and procedures this subchapter provides to any person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability.
this court has not addressed the issue of whether provides for individual liability.we have,however,determined that the remedial provisions of title vii,including,do not provide for individual liability.see tomka seiler,cir,abrogated on other grounds by burlington,ellerth,and faragher city of boca raton.accordingly,it follows that,in the context of employment discrimination,the retaliation provision of the ada,which explicitly borrows the remedies set forth in,can not provide for individual liability.
this conclusion is arguably contrary to a literal reading of a,where the phrase n o person shall suggests the possibility of individual liability.because we apply the remedies provided in title vii to the provision of the ada,however,presents that rare case in which a broader consideration of the ada,in light of the remedial provisions of title vii,indicates that this interpretation of the statutory language does not comport with congress s clearly expressed intent.tomka,at.accordingly,the district court conclusion that schulmann could not be liable for the alleged acts of retaliation was correct and presents no basis for disturbing the grant of summary judgment to schulmann on the plaintiffs ada retaliation claims 
vii.the nyshrl and nychrl claims 
in their complaint,the plaintiffs claimed that schulmann had violated the nyshrl and the nychrl by terminating spiegel because of his weight.this court has determined that a plaintiff discrimination claims under both the nyshrl and the nychrl are subject to the analysis applied to discrimination claims under title vii.see dawson bumble bumble,cir.under this test,a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he was a member of a protected class he was competent to perform the job in question,or was performing the job duties satisfactorily he suffered an adverse employment action and the action occurred under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination.id.at.if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,a presumption of discrimination arises,and the burden shifts to the defendant,who must proffer some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.id.if the defendant proffers such a reason,the presumption of discrimination drops out of the analysis,and the defendant will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff can point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason offered by the defendant is actually pretext for discrimination.id.
under the nyshrl,it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to discharge an individual because of a disability,which is a a physical,mental or medical impairment resulting from anatomical,physiological,genetic or neurological conditions which prevents the exercise of a normal bodily function or is demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.exec.law,a.here,with respect to the plaintiffs claim that the defendants had violated the state laws by terminating spiegel on the basis of his weight,the district court first determined that spiegel had failed to establish a prima facie case because he had failed to show that he was disabled for purposes of that statute.that is,he had not demonstrated that his weight was the result of a medical condition.as the district court pointed out,new york courts have determined that,under the nyshrl,weight,in and of itself,does not constitute a disability for discrimination qualification purposes and discrimination claims in that respect are unsustainable.delta air lines state div.of human rights.in order to succeed on a discrimination claim under the nyshrl,a plaintiff must proffer evidence or make a record establishing that he is medically incapable of meeting the employer weight requirements due to some cognizable medical condition.id.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that spiegel did present evidence to demonstrate that a medical condition rendered him incapable of losing point to the letter from spiegel physician diagnosing him with hypogonadism.that letter,on its own,however,does not connect spiegel weight to this diagnosis.further,spiegel argument that other evidence in the record demonstrated that his medical condition rendered him incapa
