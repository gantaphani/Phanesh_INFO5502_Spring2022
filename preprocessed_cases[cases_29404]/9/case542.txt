in september,the springfield massachusetts district court was obliged to lay off three of its nine assistant clerks because of a budget deficit.appellant james whalen,who had held his position since,was one of the clerks chosen for layoff.he subsequently brought a federal civil rights suit against the massachusetts trial court and four individuals,claiming that his procedural due process rights had been violated because he was given no opportunity to contest his selection for layoff.see he sought damages against the individual defendants and injunctive relief against the trial court.the district court dismissed the case against the individual defendants based on qualified immunity and,after whalen was reinstated to his position,dismissed the case against the trial court as moot.whalen appeals both decisions.
in two respects,whalen claims require us to look beyond basic principles,first in considering the procedural due process rights associated with a budgetary termination,and second in considering the nature of the injunctive relief permitted against a state under ex parte young.after careful review,we conclude that whalen suffered a due process injury,but that the individual defendants properly were granted immunity because the law was not clearly established that he was entitled to a hearing.because we also conclude that the eleventh amendment bars a federal court from ordering the injunctive relief whalen seeks,we agree with the district court that the remainder of the case should be dismissed as moot.
background 
after implementing a series of voluntary measures in the summer of,including reduced work weeks and extended leaves of absence,administrators for the massachusetts trial court determined that their anticipated budget shortfall also required a number of involuntary layoffs.in the springfield district court,the i nvoluntary personnel reductions affected a total of twelve employees,including three of the assistant clerks.in an affidavit,the trial court personnel administrator stated that the chief justice for administration and management cjam,barbara,had determined that managers had the discretion to consider such factors as prior discipline,attendance,work product and other relevant factors in selecting the employees to be laid off.
appellant whalen received a letter from dated august notifying him that,as a result of a budget shortfall,he had been selected for layoff effective september.the letter gave no reasons for his selection.it was accompanied by materials explaining the continuation of his health insurance benefits and the procedures for applying for unemployment compensation.at least two of the assistant clerks retained by the court had less seniority in the position than appellant.before the layoff went into effect,additional funding became available and one of the other assistant clerks selected for layoff was retained.that employee had held his job for less than three years.
the tenure and termination of assistant clerks is addressed by two massachusetts statutes.under.laws ann.ch,an assistant clerk who has held his position for three years before the effective date of the act shall hold office during good behavior,subject to applicable retirement laws.the provision goes on to state that such an employee may be removed from office under procedures authorized by.laws ann.ch.section provides that an employee covered by the provision may be removed for cause.such a removal must be reviewed by the advisory committee on personnel standards and is not final until approved by the committee.covered employees who have served three full years in a position have the right to appear personally before the committee before it renders a decision.
in his complaint,whalen contended that these provisions gave him a protected property interest in his job and that the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process thus entitled him to notice of the reasons why he was selected for layoff and a opportunity to respond to the reasons given.see,cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir he sought monetary damages from four justices of the springfield district court,the clerk of that court,and cjam an injunction ordering the court to reinstate him with back pay and benefits.
the defendants initially argued that whalen did not have the requisite three years of service to qualify for section tenure protection but abandoned that argument and conceded that plaintiff length of service was sufficient to qualify him under the statute.they maintained,however,that he was not entitled to the procedures outlined in section of chapter because the provision applies only to removal for cause and not layoff.moreover,the individual defendants claimed the shield of qualified immunity,arguing that whalen did not have a clearly established constitutional right to a hearing before a termination of his,indeed,had no right to such a hearing at all.
without articulating its reasons,the district court granted immunity to the individual defendants.it then certified to the massachusetts supreme judicial court the question whether section procedural requirements apply to an assistant clerk who is terminated when the court reduces the total number of such positions for budgetary reasons.in march,while that question was pending before the sjc,whalen was reinstated.in june,the defendants moved to dismiss the remainder of the case,which involved only injunctive relief,as moot.the district court granted the motion over whalen objection and ordered the certification question to be withdrawn from the sjc.
on appeal,whalen challenges both the grant of qualified immunity to the individual defendants and the mootness ruling.he claims that his constitutional right to some kind of process was clearly established,and that reasonable court officials would have understood that the property right he held in his position entitled him to notice of the reasons he was selected for layoff and an opportunity to respond.see harlow fitzgerald,d explaining qualified immunity inquiry mihos swift,cir same.he further maintains that his demand for injunctive relief did not become moot upon his reinstatement because he still seeks restoration of credit toward his retirement and pension benefits for the time he was out of work.
we consider each of these issues in turn.
ii.qualified immunity 
guided by supreme court precedent,we have consistently applied a test for evaluating an official claim to qualified immunity.riverdale mills pimpare,cir mihos,at suboh dist.attorney office,cir see also hope pelzer,d harlow,at.we first consider whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation.hope,at.mihos,at.the second question is whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.suboh,at.finally,we ask whether a similarly situated reasonable official would have understood that the challenged action violated that right.mihos,at suboh,at.we review qualified immunity determinations de novo,at least to the extent they turn on issues of law.mihos,at see also mitchell forsyth,d 
do the allegations add up to a constitutional violation 
whalen contends that he had a property right in continued employment that was created by state law and that,consequently,he had a right to procedural due process that was violated when he was given neither notice of the specific reasons for his layoff nor opportunity to respond.we agree that these allegations generally describe a constitutional injury and conclude,for reasons we shall explain,that the constitutional claim remains viable even when examined more particularly.
our court consistently has held that an employee who under state law can be terminated only for just cause has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment.see,wojcik,at cronin town of amesbury,cir perkins bd.of,cir see also gilbert homar,d w e have previously held that public employees who can be discharged only for cause have a constitutionally protected property interest in their tenure and can not be fired without due process.loudermill,at.property right to continued employment created by statute that gave classified civil service employees the right to retain their positions during good behavior and efficient service,with dismissal conditioned on misfeasance,malfeasance,or nonfeasance in office.the two massachusetts statutes at issue here,certainly when taken together,fit this model,specifying that an assistant court clerk has the right to retain his position during good behavior and to be removed only for cause.see supra discussing.laws ann.ch,and ch.
relying on the supreme court decision in bishop wood,d,defendants assert that the massachusetts statutes,rather than creating an enforceable expectation of continued employment,simply set out procedures to govern removal of employees.in bishop,the supreme court accepted the interpretation of a local ordinance by a north carolina judge who had concluded that an employee was terminable at will,even though the applicable ordinance o n its face may fairly be read as conferring a guarantee to continued employment.see id.at.the court noted that it had in the past accepted an interpretation of state law in similar circumstances even if an examination of the issue without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion.id.at.
no such contrary interpretation of the massachusetts statutes has been cited by defendants in this case,and their reliance on bishop is therefore misplaced.we see no basis upon which to depart here from our ordinary conclusion that a guarantee of tenure in the absence of good cause for removal creates a constitutionally protected property interest.whalen thus had a property right to continued employment as an assistant clerk.
whether that property interest gave rise to a right to procedural due process,however,is another matter.although a property right and procedural due process typically go a requirement for some kind of a hearing before discharge,bd.of regents roth,d we have recognized a limited reorganization exception to due process that eliminates the need for a hearing where a reorganization or other measure results in the dismissal of an employee.see duffy sarault,cir see also misek city of chicago,cir hartman city of providence,selya,milne sch.comm.of manchester,statutory notice and hearing requirements inapplicable to dismissal of tenured teacher due to decline in enrollment defendants assert that,even if whalen has a property right,this precedent establishes that no constitutional violation occurred.additionally,defendants contend that whalen was not removed from his job for cause,but merely laid off,and so the due process procedures were not triggered.
defendants arguments would have considerable force if an entirely neutral layoff were at issue,if the layoff decision were unrelated to individual qualifications.the case law that requires a hearing for an employee with a property interest in his job reflects a balancing of the competing interests at stake when an employee with a legitimate claim to permanence faces a for cause loss of his position.see loudermill,at.the government interests in the expeditious removal of unsatisfactory employees and the avoidance of administrative burdens are countered not only by the employee significant interest in retaining employment but also by the interest in avoiding an erroneous termination.id.at.
s ome opportunity for the employee to present his side of the case is recurringly of obvious value in reaching an accurate decision.dismissals for cause will often involve factual disputes even where the facts are clear,the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be in such cases,the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect.
when the termination at issue is in good faith directed at positions rather than individuals,hartman.at,however,the hearing contemplated by the supreme court due process precedent loses its relevance.in such cases,since there are no charges against the employee involved,there would be no occasion for a hearing,and it would be idle to hold one.kusza maximonis,quoted in hartman.at.in addition,because reorganizations often affect numerous employees,the governmental interest in efficient administration may weigh more heavily in such circumstances.see,mayfield kelly,a rif involves a large number of employees for whom it is impossible to have hearings.quoted in.teachers union local bd.of.
under this precedent,if the trial court had in good faith eliminated the position of assistant clerk,whalen clearly would have no constitutional claim.similarly,if the three assistant clerks originally selected for layoff had been chosen entirely based on factors unrelated to personal example,seniority or job reorganization exception case law would be on point.likewise,the distinction that defendants draw between a removal for cause and a layoff the latter connoting an absence of performance be pertinent if whalen selection had been directed solely at his position rather than at him.see.laws ann.ch,a layoff is a temporary discontinuance of employment for lack of work or lack of money.
here,however,the record indicates that performance factors played a role in whalen selection for layoff.as noted above,cjam authorized managers to take into account a variety of qualitative factors in choosing which three assistant clerks to lay off.those individualized considerations took on even greater significance for whalen when funds became available to retain one of the three clerks initially selected for termination,and he was passed over in favor of someone with considerably less experience who even lacked sufficient tenure to claim a property interest in his job.on these facts,it seems inescapable that whalen job performance was a deciding factor in his selection.and certainly,for purposes of considering the legal questions before us,we must presume that that was so.
consequently,we conclude that whalen had a right to the minimal procedural protections of notice and an opportunity to respond.as the supreme court has observed,the requisite procedures need not be elaborate,loudermill,at,and the opportunity to hear and respond to the employer reasons could be accomplished either in writing or in an informal meeting,id.at.it is fundamental,however,that some process is due when an employee with a protected property interest in his job is terminated in a rather than personnel action,hartman.at 
we thus conclude that whalen satisfied the first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry by stating a constitutional due process violation.
b.the clearly established right and reasonableness 
it is beyond debate that,as a general matter,the constitutional right to due process claimed by whalen was clearly established at the time he was laid off.as we have discussed,the law was unequivocal in that an employee with a property interest in his employment was entitled to notice of the reasons for his discharge and an opportunity to respond.
but the inquiry into whether a right is clearly established must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition,mihos,at quoting suboh,at quoting saucier katz,d see also brosseau haugen,d riverdale mills,at,and this is not a standard dismissal case.at the threshold level,the motivation behind whalen termination was budgetary.it is undisputed that,without the fiscal crisis,whalen would not have been targeted for dismissal,and,indeed,once the crisis passed he was reinstated.as the defendants have pointed out,this was not a termination intended to sever an employment relationship but a layoff accompanied by recall rights in the event fiscal conditions improved.in these circumstances,there is at least some merit to the defendants argument that the procedural protections outlined in section of chapter for a removal for cause are inapplicable.indeed,before it dismissed the case as moot,the district court certified that issue to the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
although the applicability of the procedural protections specified in section does not determine whalen federal due process rights,the uncertainty reflected by the certification is relevant to our inquiry.the statute,
