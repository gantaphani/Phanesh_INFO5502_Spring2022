following his conviction and sentencing for possessing two firearms while being an unlawful user of and addicted to a controlled substance marijuana,in violation of g,benjamin carter appealed,contending that g infringed on his right to bear arms,in violation of the second amendment.we vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the district court to allow the government to substantiate the fit between g and the government important interest in protecting the community from gun violence.see united states carter carter i,cir.after taking evidence from both sides,the district court held that the government had carried its burden in justifying the regulation of guns under g,and carter filed this second appeal.
because we agree with the district court that the government adequately demonstrated a reasonable fit between its important interest in protecting the community from gun violence and g,which disarms unlawful drug users and addicts,we now affirm.
in carter i,we recited the facts 
responding to complaints of suspected drug activity at central avenue,charleston,west virginia,a apartment building where carter was living at the time,charleston police investigated by knocking on doors and talking with persons who answered.after finding evidence of marijuana use in the first unit,the officers proceeded to knock on carter door.carter answered and allowed the officers to enter his apartment.upon smelling marijuana,the officers questioned carter,who acknowledged that he had been smoking marijuana and indeed that he had been using the drug for years.the officers recovered from the apartment grams of loose marijuana,grams of partially smoked blunts,a digital scale,in larger bills,and in smaller denominations.carter also informed the officers about two firearms in his pistol and a disclosed that he had purchased the weapons from a friend a week earlier for his defense.he later explained in more detail that he had purchased the guns because he lived in a bad neighborhood and needed weapons to protect himself and his nephew,who also lived with him in the apartment.indeed,at sentencing,carter attorney represented to the court that one month after carter arrest in this case,the other unit in the apartment building was burglarized,and his neighbor was shot eight times.
carter i,at.
after carter was indicted for violating g,he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the statute violated his second amendment rights.when the district court denied his motion,carter entered a conditional guilty plea that preserved his right to appeal the court ruling on the motion.after accepting carter guilty plea,the court sentenced carter to three years probation.
on appeal,we vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further consideration of carter second amendment challenge.we assumed that carter circumstances implicated the second amendment but held that,because he could not claim to be a citizen,any infringement of his right to bear arms would not have implicated a core second amendment right.carter i,at see also district of columbia heller.we therefore applied intermediate scrutiny to review carter challenge.carter i,at.under intermediate scrutiny,the question thus became whether there was a reasonable fit between g and a substantial or important government objective.id.quoting united states chester,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we readily concluded that the government had advanced an important governmental interest in protecting the community from crime and,in particular,from gun violence.carter i,at.on whether disarming drug users and addicts through g reasonably served that there was a reasonable fit between the important goal of reducing gun violence and the prohibition in g we noted that the government could resort to a wide range of sources,such as legislative text and history,empirical evidence,case law,and common sense,as circumstances and context require d.id.at.we found that while the government had made plausible commonsense arguments about the risks of mixing drugs and guns,it had presented no empirical evidence or data to substantiate them.id.at.therefore,in light of chester and united states staten,cir,we remanded the case to the district court to allow the government to develop a record sufficient to justify its argument that drug users and addicts possessing firearms are sufficiently dangerous to require disarming them.carter i,at.
on remand,both the government and carter submitted a number of publications and studies to the district court about the behavioral tendencies of drug users.after considering the evidence,the court concluded that the government had carried its burden,finding that the data indicated a correlation between violent crime and drug use.while the court acknowledged that the government studies did not prove a strict causal nexus between drug usage and violence,it found that the two factors frequently coincide.in addition,it pointed to notions that supported the fit between drug users and violence,noting that drug users are more likely to encounter law enforcement that their criminal associations increase the risk of violence that the high price of drugs is likely to lead to violent property crimes and that drug use impairs judgment.the court then concluded 
based upon the narrowed design of the statute,the empirical and scholarly evidence relied upon,the weight of precedent nationwide,and common sense,the united states has shouldered its burden of establishing that section g is reasonably fitted to achieve the substantial governmental objective of protecting the community from crime by keeping guns out of the hands of those impaired by their use of controlled substances.the court,accordingly,concludes that section g is constitutional as applied to carter.
from the district court judgment on remand,carter filed this second appeal.
carter contends that,on remand,the government still failed to prove that a regulation disarming drug users reasonably serves the important governmental interest of protecting the community from gun violence 
the government was required to show that the fit between g and the government important goal is reasonable,not perfect.carter i,at quoting united states marzzarella,cir.it was not required to prove that the regulation is the least intrusive means of achieving the relevant government objective,or that there be no burden whatsoever on the individual right in question.staten,at quoting united states masciandaro,cir.moreover,its burden in this case was lower than in other g second amendment cases because of g limited temporal reach,the fact that g prohibition lasts only as long as the individual remains an unlawful drug user or addict.carter i,at.
carter argues that the district court,in concluding that the government carried its burden,erred in two respects it improperly relied on factors other than empirical evidence in evaluating the soundness of g and it failed to recognize that the studies submitted by the government were inadequate because they related to drug use generally rather than marijuana use specifically and they failed to prove a causal link between marijuana use and violence.he maintains that the studies he submitted demonstrate that,in fact,marijuana users are not prone to violent behavior.emphasis added.we address these points seriatim.
on the scope of the district court consideration on remand,carter contends that the court improperly relied on factors other than empirical evidence in evaluating the validity of g.he asserts that in carter i,we rejected the government use of support,such as its reliance on common sense,and that therefore the court was required to consider only evidence presented in the crucible of an adversary proceeding.while he acknowledges that the district court did in fact receive empirical studies into evidence,he notes that its determination included a heavy reliance on other factors,such as the design of the statute,the weight of precedent nationwide,and common sense.without these other factors,he argues,the government showing was insufficient.
carter argument misreads our prior opinion in this case.in carter i,we
