plaintiffs,employees of baxter healthcare corporation of puerto rico,appeal from the district court decision granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs title vii claim.ramos baxter healthcare of puerto rico,d.that claim charged,and its,international,baxter with discriminating based on race and national origin in setting the terms of plaintiffs pension plan.the background facts are undisputed.
baxter is a major manufacturer of health care products.together with its numerous subsidiaries,it employs about people worldwide.it maintains a pension plan,called the domestic plan,covering employees of baxter and many but not all of its mainland subsidiaries.the domestic plan permits early retirement,before a worker reaches,but does not provide full retirement benefits to employees who retire early until,the domestic plan mechanically reduced benefits in set amounts depending on how early an employee retired.
in,baxter revised the domestic plan to employ a point system for early retirement that,in addition to age,took account of how many years the worker had been at baxter or a covered subsidiary.the net effect was to make the reduction less,and benefits greater,for early retiring workers who had served longer.this in turn made early retirement more attractive for workers covered by the domestic plan.baxter says some workers are better off with the change and others worse off.
about baxter employees work in puerto rico,mostly for.employees of are covered by the puerto rico plan,but this plan,like the domestic plan,is controlled by baxter through its administrative committee,the members of which are appointed by the compensation committee of baxter board of directors.although the plans had differed in the past,just prior to the retirement terms of the domestic and puerto rico plans were similar however,when baxter converted its domestic plan to the point system,it did not make a comparable adjustment in the puerto rico plan.
in baxter began the closing of a major plant in carolina,puerto rico.a number of employees,most of whom worked at the plant,responded in by filing the present law suit in the federal district court in puerto rico.the defendants were their employer,baxter itself,two other baxter subsidiaries doing business in puerto rico,and the members of the baxter committee that managed both plans.a principal claim,and the only one pursued on appeal,is that the different treatment of early retirees under the respective plans violates title vii.a.
on motion for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the defendants.ramos,d at.although class certification had been sought,that issue was not discussed and neither side complains.in a nutshell,the district court analyzed the evidence adduced on the title vii claim and concluded that there was no evidence of intentional discrimination sufficient to warrant a trial.after a brief analysis,the court also rejected a claim of disparate impact discrimination.this appeal followed 
our review of the granting of a motion for summary judgment is de novo,drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the party,here the plaintiffs.reckitt colman,cir.title vii,so far as pertinent,says an employer may not discriminate in compensation or terms of employment based,inter alia,on race or national origin.a.baxter assumes without argument that intentional discrimination in pension plan terms against puerto ricans would violate title vii.
baxter is less ready to concede that the domestic plan is more favorable to employees than is the puerto rico plan.it suggests that some employees are better off under the latter than the former.but its documents also show that it would have cost a substantial sum to switch over to the new point system.so we will also assume arguendo it does not alter the outcome that it would be discrimination under title vii to withhold the point system if the motive in whole or in part was hostility to puerto ricans.see stores,cir.
this brings us to the evidence of motive.typically at this stage title vii cases undertake a relentless survey of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and its main sequels but we can be spared this exercise.assuming the plaintiffs made out the prima facie case of discrimination,see id.at point which baxter disputes on the ground that not all of its mainland subsidiaries enjoy access to the point defendants provided a facially plausible reason for not adopting the point system in puerto rico.the reasons were the added cost,the financial climate,and the view that the benefits offered by were already competitive in puerto rico.see feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir,at.
whether the evidence in this case created a jury issue on improper motive depends simply on analyzing the sworn testimony and documents presented on summary judgment and deciding what commonsense inferences they permit.if the plaintiffs lack direct evidence of animus,it may yet be possible to infer it circumstantially,depending on the facts and if the defendants gave explanations that a jury could find to be false,this will count against them in the mix of inferences.reeves sanderson plumbing,d thomas eastman kodak,cir,cert.denied,d.
here no direct evidence exists of discriminatory example,there are no statements by baxter management disparaging puerto ricans.instead,plaintiffs concentrate their attack on the alleged inadequacy of baxter reasons for its differential treatment,on supposed discrepancies in its explanations,on its failure to produce documents,and on the inference that weak explanations are given to cover wicked motives.we set forth the sequence of events within baxter in more detail and then consider the plaintiffs arguments.
in and a baxter task force reporting to the board compensation committee undertook a review of baxter retirement program.according to the affidavit of a consultant,gregory hansen,who participated in the exercise,the decision to adopt the point system was made because the prior system created a strong disincentive for long serving employees to retire early.the politely unspoken inference is that baxter wanted to encourage retirements of employees whose long service also meant high salaries.
in all events,plaintiffs do not challenge the explanation but only the failure to extend the same courtesy to employees of.according to hansen,by the time of a june,meeting of the task force,baxter had decided to adopt the point system for the domestic plan as of january.when hansen asked in the meeting whether the system would also be adopted in puerto rico,he was told that there might be a delay because of translation and related problems but that his firm should develop an estimate of the increased costs if the puerto rico plan were to be similarly amended.
other baxter documents created at the same time suggest that baxter was inclined to delay any such change in puerto rico until,among other things,it could complete a survey of overall benefits and compensation for its puerto rico operations.an affidavit from mary barker,a former vice president of benefits management at baxter,says that baxter compensation at different locations around the world differs depending upon cost and competitive market conditions and that the benefits package in puerto rico differs in various respects from those in other favoring puerto rico and some not.
in all events,later documents and testimony covering the period show that baxter created a new task force on compensation early in to review benefits for puerto rico employees,and it conducted a study during the year.the study concluded that baxter base salaries in puerto rico were of the comparator group and that overall baxter benefits were generally competitive.in addition to the study,the task force also priced various enhancements for the puerto rico point system was estimated to cost per there was no consensus among task force members on the question whether to adopt the point system.
in her deposition,mary barker said that various task force proposals,including the possibility of switching to the point system,were considered by senior baxter management in october.she said that there were cost concerns about new benefits in puerto rico and that at the time business conditions were unfavorable baxter stock price was not doing well and changes then under review were thought to have potentially adverse effects on puerto rico operations.among the objectives of senior management was to be sure that puerto rico costs remained competitive with baxter other worldwide operations.ultimately,the decision was made not to adopt the point system for the puerto rico plan,although other benefits changes were adopted.
the following year baxter created an advisory counsel made up of representatives of its business units operating in puerto rico.this council eventually recommended that baxter adopt for puerto rico units the point system,or a new k type contribution plan,or both but baxter decided not to do either,partly because of cost and partly because a separate study of its competitors in puerto rico showed that baxter pension benefits were well above the median.the same study showed that baxter overall compensation package in puerto rico was below the median but this was,importantly,because baxter did not offer the k type plan.baxter did adopt such a plan for puerto rico in.
thus far there is nothing ominous in the story.about the most one could this were that baxter,although sometimes following a uniform approach,appears for the most part to have varied its compensation regimes based on location and that baxter considered adopting the point system in puerto rico,but concluded that it would be costly and was not needed to retain its employees.this shows that baxter management were capitalists,but not that they intentionally discriminated against puerto ricans within the meaning of title vii.
in attacking this scenario and the district court grant of summary judgment,plaintiffs very able brief presents four main themes that the failure to extend the point system to puerto rico contradicted a settled baxter policy of uniformity as to benefits that allegedly inconsistent statements were provided as to certain events that there are suspicious failures by baxter to produce documents or remember events and that the district court relied on factual propositions that were fairly controverted and drew inferences against plaintiffs.
plaintiffs broadest position,and the foundation for most of their other arguments,is that baxter had adopted prior to a general policy of uniformity of treatment in compensation for all employees of baxter enterprises whether located on the mainland or in puerto rico.from this it follows,according to the plaintiffs,that purported cost concerns about extending the point system to puerto rico were pretextual and that a reasonable inference from this deceit is an illicit motive.
whatever the logic,the premise is wrong.it is based mainly on statements in a corporate human resource policy and procedure manual adopted in described as having application.the manual says that u nless otherwise approved,each baxter unit is to participate in employee benefit programs including retirement programs designed by corporate benefits.plaintiffs take this as a commitment to uniform compensation at all locations,making the discrepant treatment of puerto rico a suspicious deviation.
but the manual,apart from other routine disclaimers,says that uniform treatment is provided unless otherwise approved.the evidence is clear that baxter did in certain respects vary benefits by location both before and after and the history of the puerto rico operations vis à vis mainland operations is a tangled one.the claim that uniformity was a strict policy from which this case was a unique,suspicious deviation is wrong on the facts and not one that a reasonable jury could accept.
plaintiffs second argument is narrower and comes closest to making out a conventional case against summary judgment.focusing primarily on the decision itself,plaintiffs point to one statement,already mentioned,that the extension of the point system to puerto rico was being delayed for six months or a year because of translation and related problems and,charging pretext,plaintiffs contrast this with the indefinite delays that followed and the concern with cost that was given as the reason for inaction.
this is a fair false reason coupled with other facts can suggest an illicit real reason,at context here greatly blunts its force.the focus of the task force was on the domestic plan,and hansen in a memorandum discussing the june,implementation meeting says that he brought up the subject of the puerto rico plan and whether comparable changes will be made.he then says that baxter said it might want to at least delay months and maybe a year because of translation and related issues 
then,the formal minutes of the june,task force meeting record that hansen again raised the issue and got the following reply 
judy coffey hedquist explained that,from a time perspective,it would not be possible to implement and communicate changes to the puerto rico plan by january.
herb walker pointed out that it would also be prudent to defer implementation so that the results of several employee surveys on compensation and benefits currently distributed to puerto rico employees become available.
a memorandum by hansen the next day says a survey is being conducted on compensation and benefits in puerto rico.it was decided not to extend the new early retirement or death benefit provisions to the puerto rico plan currently.
in other words,from the outset,cost and competitiveness were at issue.no juror could reasonably draw from this supposed discrepancy an inference that baxter lied about its reasons for not extending the point system to puerto rico and must have harbored animus toward puerto ricans.even plaintiffs foundational supposed policy of undercut by the documents.
next,the plaintiffs say that baxter failed to produce documents to back up its story and that the failures undercut or cast doubt on the reasons given by baxter for its actions.in particular,plaintiffs complain about the absence of the formal minutes of the june,meeting of the task force any formal study underpinning the decision to adopt the points system for the domestic plan any cost or competitive study leading to the refusal to do so for puerto rico and the results of any puerto rico surveys on compensation and benefits.
starting with the most specific absence of june,task force is simply no indication that such minutes ever existed,or if they did,were deliberately withheld.the task force appears to have been a working group,not a formal administrative unit like the administrative committee that ran the pension plans all of whose minutes were produced.baxter did produce an agenda for the june,task force meeting and hansen summary,and,although baxter did produce minutes for at least one other task force meeting,nothing suggests that any further documentary record of the june,meeting exists.
the lack of any formal study of adopting the point system as part of the domestic plan may or may not be surprising,but,again,there is no indication that baxter deliberately withheld any documents in its possession from the plaintiffs.the point system was one of a number of issues considered by the task force and anyone familiar with corporate culture would not be surprised that the remnants would be nothing more than agendas,scattered references in summaries and minutes,and a few memories secured by depositions.
plaintiffs also point out that a stated reason for deferring the point system for puerto rico was to await alleged surveys of compensation and benefits being conducted in puerto rico.yet the march,minutes of the administrative committee suggest that surveys and other studies were underway,and there is no dispute that by baxter had surveyed employees in puerto rico and also obtained a study of benefits from comparable companies in puerto made available to the plaintiffs 
the last missing item is any document formally explaining the decision not to extend the point system to puerto rico.but,as with many cases of inaction,there is no reason to think that any such formal document existed.what the documents taken together show is an initial decision to defer the issue
