officer christopher blair terry terry appeals the district court order denying his motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in reviewing the district court denial of terry motion for summary judgment,we view the facts in the light most favorable to brian yates yates,the party,as we are required to do.see plumhoff rickard,d waterman batton,cir.
on december,yates,a first sergeant and iraq war veteran,was driving a customized buick skylark on a highway in north charleston,south carolina.his mother,patricia yates,and brother,kelvin brown,were in a separate vehicle following behind him.yates drove past two police cruisers when one of the cruisers,driven by terry,pulled out and began to follow him.at some point,terry activated his lights however,there was a vehicle between terry and yates,which led yates to believe that the officer was attempting to stop another vehicle.yates then changed lanes,using his turn signal,to allow terry to pass.when yates realized that terry was behind him,yates pulled over at a gas station.at the gas station,terry approached yates vehicle and requested yates driver license.yates responded that he did not have his driver license but that he did have military identification.terry then opened the car door and forced yates out of the car.around this time,yates mother and brother arrived at the gas station.terry ordered yates to place his hands on the car.yates complied.terry informed yates that he was under arrest,which prompted yates to inquire as to the basis for the arrest.terry failed to provide an explanation.with yates hands on top of the car and terry behind him,yates turned his head to the left and terry deployed his taser in probe mode.yates fell to the ground.yates brother then asked terry why he tased yates,and terry responded,back up,or do you want some too.while yates was still on the ground and having made no attempt to get up,terry tased him a second time.following the second application of the taser,yates told his brother to call his commanding officer and then reached for his cell phone,which was clipped to his waist,when terry tased yates a third time.yates mother passed out after the third taser deployment.
following these events,other officers arrived on the scene and yates was placed into handcuffs.ems also arrived and provided medical care to patricia yates.the officers searched yates vehicle.yates was charged with an excessive noise violation,no license in possession,and disorderly conduct,all of which were nol prossed.
on july,yates filed this action in state court,alleging multiple state claims and federal claims against defendants terry,the city of north charleston,the north charleston police department,chief jon zumalt,and unnamed john does.the suit was removed to federal court and was stayed while yates was deployed to germany and kosovo.on may,defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing chief jon zumalt,the north charleston police department,terry in his official capacity,the john doe defendants,and various federal and state claims.however,the court denied the motion with respect to the excessive force claim against terry in his individual capacity and various state claims against the city of north charleston.defendants subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court granted in part and denied in part,dismissing the city of north charleston from the lawsuit.on april,the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal as to all claims except for the claim for excessive force against terry in his individual capacity.this appeal followed.
as an initial matter,though not raised by either party,we must address whether we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction quoting mitchell maurer.generally,a district court order denying summary judgment based on qualified immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see mitchell forsyth,d.however,when a district court denies a claim of qualified immunity based on the insufficiency of the facts then that determination is not immediately appealable see johnson jones,d winfield bass,cir.our jurisdiction over such an appeal extends only to a denial of qualified immunity to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.iko shreve,cir quoting mitchell,at.because in this case the district court determined at least one of the taser applications to which yates was subjected required further factual development,we must examine whether we have jurisdiction over yates excessive force claim under.
during the february,hearing on terry motion for summary judgment,the district court explained that terry was not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the first two taser applications.see at the first two occasions,it seems to me,are clear that qualified immunity does not apply.i think that they constituted unreasonable force and a constitutional violation,and i think that it was well known that that was a violation.the court then proceeded to address the third taser application,stating 
the third one is a little more problematic.and i frankly feel that it going to depend largely upon a greater focus on the facts of the case than we now can make but i do think that the third taser shot needs closer scrutiny.and timing is such an important factor in that case.when did the officer speak to the plaintiff w hen did the plaintiff start to grab the cell phone out of his waistband and throw it to his brother the facts are just not developed to the extent that i can make a decision there.
id.at.the court held that as to all three uses of the taser,qualified immunity does not apply,and that the defendant terry is not entitled to summary judgment on that constitutional claim.id.the court then entered an order denying terry motion for summary judgment on his claim,stating that t his order hereby memorializes that which was set forth on the record at the february hearing.id.at.further,in an order on a motion for reconsideration filed by terry,the district court stated that it denied terry motion for summary judgment on his claim,concluding that the facts were not sufficiently developed to support the granting of summary judgment.id.at.later in the same order,the court stated that it carefully conducted a thorough analysis pursuant to saucier and determined that officer terry conduct violated a constitutional right which was clearly established at the time of the violation.id.at quoting saucier katz,d.
though the district court used conflicting language in explaining its reasoning for holding that qualified immunity did not apply in this case,it is clear that the court did apply the saucier analysis to the first two deployments of the taser and concluded that they constituted unreasonable force and a constitutional violation which was well established.id.at.the court,however,did conclude that further factual development was needed before it could determine whether qualified immunity applied to the third taser deployment.the jurisdictional issue arises partly due to the court decision to evaluate each use of the taser independently.yates has raised one excessive force claim,and we have cautioned courts against using a segmented view of the sequence of events where each distinct act of force becomes reasonable given what the officer knew at each point in th e progression.rowland perry,cir.the better approach in a case such as the one before us is to view the reasonableness of the force in full context,with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of the totality of the circumstances.id.we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of terry motion for summary judgment on yates excessive force claim 
a district court denial of qualified immunity on summary judgment is reviewed de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court did on summary judgment.see danser stansberry,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.the role of the court is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but rather to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.in reviewing the district court denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we accept as true the facts that the district court concluded may be reasonably inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.waterman,at.to the extent that the district court has not fully set forth the facts on which its decision is based,we assume the facts that may reasonably be inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.t his usually means adopting the plaintiff version of the facts.iko,at quoting scott harris,d.
qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for civil damages,provided that their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights within the knowledge of a reasonable person.meyers baltimore,cir citing harlow fitzgerald,d.this protection balances two important interests the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.pearson callahan,d.
to determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity,courts engage in a inquiry set forth by the supreme court in saucier.the first step is to determine whether the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the,establish that the officer violated a constitutional right.saucier,at.at the second step,courts determine whether that right was clearly established.id.in this appeal,terry challenges the district court conclusion on both steps of the qualified immunity inquiry.we exercise our discretion to conduct the inquiry in the order originally provided by the supreme court in saucier.see pearson,at modifying the saucier approach such that lower courts may use their discretion to decide the sequence in which to conduct the two steps of qualified immunity analysis.therefore,our initial inquiry is whether the facts establish a constitutional violation.
the fourth amendment bars police officers from using excessive force to effectuate a seizure.jones buchanan,cir see graham connor,d.courts evaluate a claim of excessive force based on an objective reasonableness standard.graham,at.the subjective intent or motivation of an officer is irrelevant at this step.id.at.courts are to carefully balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.jones,at quoting graham,at.in doing so,we focus on the facts and circumstances of each case,taking into account the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.our inquiry into the reasonableness of the force also requires us to consider the facts at the moment that the challenged force was employed with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of all the circumstances.smith ray,cir.artificial divisions in the sequence of events do not aid a court evaluation of objective reasonableness.id.quoting waterman,at.ultimately,we examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the force used was objectively reasonable.see id.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to yates,we conclude that the factors enunciated in graham weigh heavily in yates favor.in reaching this conclusion,we find that the first graham factor,the severity of the crime at issue,strongly favors yates.while we accept yates position that he committed no traffic violations before being stopped by terry,even if he had committed the violations alleged by terry,it is undisputed that these alleged violations are nonviolent,minor traffic infractions in addition,the driving without a license offense that was the basis for terry initially detaining yates constitutes only a misdemeanor under south carolina law when the offense committed is a minor one,we have found that the first graham factor weigh s in plaintiff favor.jones,at see bryan macpherson,cir traffic violations generally will not support the use of a significant level of force.
regarding the second graham factor,whether yates posed an immediate threat to the safety of the police or others,we also conclude that this factor favors yates.the evidence shows that yates,who was unarmed,complied with terry orders to place his hands on the car before terry tased him for turning his head.after this taser application,yates fell to the ground where he remained when terry tased him a second time for no apparent reason although yates reached for his cell phone before being tased a third time,yates brother testified that t he officer let yates slide me the phone and knew yates was giving me the phone to call yates commander because he let him do it.this is not a case where the initial use of force was justifiable because the suspect had a weapon or was acting erratically,and the continued use of such force was unlawful because the threat was eliminated.see,meyers,at.in this case,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to yates,the evidence does not support an inference that yates was a danger to terry at any time during their encounter.
the third and final graham factor,whether yates was actively resisting arrest,also favors yates.according to yates,his mother,brother,and unrelated eye witnesses to the incident,yates was not attempting to flee or resist terry efforts to detain him.further,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to yates,he never attempted to get up after he fell to the ground following the first taser application as asserted by terry.nor did terry warn yates that he would be tased or that he could not move any part of his body.indeed,yates asserts that terry never gave any commands.see casey city of fed.heights,cir explaining that a reasonable jury could find that the officer committed a constitutional violation when the officer deployed her taser immediately upon arrival and without warning.
our analysis of the graham factors when measured against the level of force used by terry against yates leads us to conclude that such force was not objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances in this case.terry was ordered out of his car and subsequently tased three times over not having his driver license.we have explained that d eploying a taser is a serious use of force,that is designed to inflict a painful and frightening blow.estate of armstrong vill.of pinehurst,cir quoting orem rephann,cir.for these reasons,it may only be deployed when a police officer is confronted with an exigency that creates an immediate safety risk and that is reasonably likely to be cured by using the taser.id.at.as we held in estate of armstrong,t he subject of a seizure does not create such a risk simply because he is doing something that can be characterized as when that resistance includes physically preventing an officer manipulations of his body.id.the objective facts,when viewed in the light most favorable to yates,as we must do at this point in the proceedings,show that he was neither a dangerous felon,a flight risk,nor an immediate threat to terry or anyone else.yates has thus established that terry use of his taser constituted excessive force in violation of yates fourth amendment rights 
having concluded that yates constitutional rights were violated,we must determine whether those rights were clearly established at the time of terry conduct.a clearly established right is one that is sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he wa s doing violates that right.mullenix luna,d per curiam quoting reichle howards,d.ordinarily,to answer this inquiry,we need not look beyond the decisions of the supreme court,this court of appeals,and the highest court of the state i
