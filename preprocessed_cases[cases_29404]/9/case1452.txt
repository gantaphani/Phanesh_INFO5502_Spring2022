opinion of the court 
introduction 
in this discrimination action,plaintiff dorothy daniels appeals from an order for summary judgment entered on november,in favor of her former employer,the school district of philadelphia sdp.daniels alleged in her complaint that sdp violated the age discrimination in employment act adea.et title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.et,both substantively and by retaliating against her because she opposed what she believed was sdp discriminatory conduct in violation of the acts.although daniels was completely unsuccessful in the district court,we address only her retaliation claim as she does not raise any other issue on this appeal.we conclude that daniels did not provide sufficient evidence in opposition to sdp motion for summary judgment to support a conclusion that sdp acted with a retaliatory animus with respect to her.therefore,we will affirm the order for summary judgment.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in this opinion,we set forth undisputed facts and recite the facts in dispute in a light most favorable to daniels as the nonmoving party.see mccabe ernst young,cir.thus,we are not making findings of fact for any purpose beyond these proceedings.
daniels background 
daniels is an african american educator born on january.she has a masters degree in elementary education and is certified as a reading specialist.from to,daniels worked as a guest teacher with kelly educational staffing,and had a good relationship with the principals of the schools to which she was assigned.
in october,following the end of daniels relationship with kelly,sdp employed her as a teacher at bregy elementary school in philadelphia.her tenure at bregy seems to have been reasonably successful for during that time her students standardized test scores improved,and she received compliments from bregy principal and an sdp school superintendent.moreover,daniels principal rated her as satisfactory in all categories in a evaluation for the school year.at the end of that school year,however,daniels was subject to a forced transfer because her position was eliminated due to enrollment or budget allocation changes.accordingly,daniels participated in a june site selection process for the upcoming school year.she elected to teach english at thomas mifflin school,and sdp gave her that assignment.her troubles with sdp began almost immediately after that assignment.
thomas mifflin school 
leslie mason was mifflin principal when sdp assigned daniels to that school.on a parents night on or about september,mason stated that some of the teachers were old enough to be grandparents.daniels,who was the oldest teacher in the room,took offense to the remark and complained to mason that she found the statement ageist and offensive.daniels contends that,following this incident,mason became antagonistic toward her.
in accordance with sdp procedures regarding new teachers at a school,mason observed daniels teach several times during her year at mifflin.following these observations,mason evaluated daniels negatively,an assessment that daniels contends was unwarranted.for example,mason gave daniels a poor evaluation for not using technology,even though daniels did not have a smart board in her classroom and did allow her students to use laptops when she considered their use to be appropriate.mason also repeatedly commented on the terrible appearance of daniels classroom,despite the circumstance that daniels was one of just a few teachers not ordered to clean his or her classroom after an sdp inspection.
the relationship between daniels and mason was strained further because mason often sent another teacher,christine lokey,to provide daniels teaching support,an assignment that,in daniels view,interfered with her teaching regimen.daniels did not ask for lokey assistance,and mason did not send lokey to any other teacher classroom with the same frequency that she sent her to daniels classroom.the strain was exacerbated when daniels learned from a student that mason had called the student to her office to ask about daniels pedagogy.
at the end of the school year,mason reduced the number of budgeted teachers for the upcoming year from three to two,an action that required daniels to go through another forced transfer process.although sdp central office,rather than the local principal,decides which teachers to retain and which to transfer,mason told two students that she had written daniels out of the budget and that daniels would be returning in september.app.at.even though sdp had made the decision to transfer daniels months earlier,it did not notify daniels of the decision until september.consequently,daniels was unable to participate in that summer site selection process.
daniels sent a letter dated september,to sdp human resources and labor directors,complaining about mason treatment of her.in the letter,daniels again complained about mason comment from a year earlier regarding the age of certain of the school teachers.daniels also complained that another mifflin teacher told daniels,they call you old school.id.at.in the letter,daniels further stated that mason sent lokey to her classroom a lmost daily and that this was not her practice with any other teacher.id.at.daniels raised the following additional matters in her letter mason sent other individuals to observe her mason herself observed daniels teaching at least three times and gave her negative evaluations based on her use of technology and classroom appearance mason would not assist daniels in disciplining her students mason called students to her office to ask them about daniels pedagogy and mason had written daniels out of mifflin budget without notification to daniels notwithstanding daniels repeated request for information about her status for the upcoming year.daniels concluded in her letter that she experienced ageism,harassment,and a hostile environment continuously throughout the school year.id.at.
the next day,september,daniels met with lissa johnson,the deputy chief in sdp staffing office,to ascertain her teaching assignment for the upcoming year.although daniels and johnson did not reach a conclusion during the meeting determining daniels assignment for the upcoming year,sdp unilaterally assigned daniels to teach at vare middle school.however,daniels did not learn of her assignment to vare until september,a week after her meeting with johnson.consequently,daniels did not attend vare on september,and,days on which she would have been at vare if she had known of her assignment to that school.on september or,johnson directed vare administrators to designate daniels as on unauthorized leave without pay until she reported.id.at.the record indicates that johnson learned of daniels september letter on september,when she received an from one of its recipients notifying johnson that daniels had complained that mason had harassed her.
around october,after daniels had started teaching at vare,she filed a complaint with the pennsylvania human relations commission phrc in the complaint,daniels asserted an age discrimination claim based on mason comment at the parents night meeting and mason frequent monitoring of her through lokey and others,while younger teachers at mifflin were not scrutinized similarly.daniels also asserted a race discrimination claim based on her forced transfer from mifflin and mason failure to give her timely notice of the transfer.on december,daniels amended her phrc complaint to include an age discrimination claim based on the forced transfer.
vare middle school 
daniels troubles continued at vare,where rachel marianno and kenneth christy served as the principal and assistant principal,respectively.for her first week or two at vare,daniels was not assigned to a classroom instead,she was told either to remain in the main office or to go to the teachers lounge.moreover,even after she received a classroom assignment,it took weeks and repeated requests before she was provided with keys to her classroom.furthermore,daniels was required to float among different classrooms,whereas other teachers did not need to do so.
according to daniels,students with extreme disciplinary problems and academic challenges were dumped into her class,but when daniels wrote incident reports about her students,marianno and christy would not initiate appropriate disciplinary action.indeed,they did not take disciplinary action when a student stood on daniels desk,kicked papers onto the floor,and threatened to kick daniels ass,conduct that led daniels to file a police report.id.at.marianno and christy likewise failed to investigate or take disciplinary action when students wrote threats and profanities on the window of daniels classroom door.in addition,marianno refused to discipline one of daniels students who loudly used profanity when marianno observed daniels class.at some point during the year,marianno told daniels,if you are not comfortable with the children of this culture perhaps you should leave.id.at.in december,marianno assigned daniels to teach subjects for which daniels did not have a certification.
on december,after daniels had missed school on december due to illness,christy sent daniels a disciplinary attendance memorandum.the memorandum listed daniels absences on september,and as unauthorized leave without pay and warned daniels that additional absences or latenesses will lead to more severe disciplinary action.id.at.
on february,daniels filed a second phrc complaint,this time concerning her treatment at vare.in this complaint,daniels alleged that christy attendance memorandum falsely listed her as having taken unauthorized leave for a period during which she had not yet been assigned to vare.she also complained that marianno had assigned her to teach subjects for which she was not certified,had not provided her with a permanent classroom or keys to any classroom,and assigned students with the worst behavioral problems and the lowest academic scores to her.daniels claimed that sdp retaliated against her because she had filed her october,phrc complaint.the certificate of service of the february,complaint is dated april.marianno and christy each testified at depositions that they had no knowledge of daniels phrc complaints during the time that they took the adverse actions of which daniels complains.
during the school year while daniels was assigned to vare,daniels began seeing doctors for anxiety and depression,conditions that she attributed to her hostile treatment at school.starting in march,daniels began a period of medical leave from vare due to her anxiety.while daniels was on leave,marianno telephoned daniels requesting her students grades.after daniels faxed her the grades,marianno called again,screaming at daniels for the grades low quality.after the school year ended,daniels participated in the site selection process for the upcoming year,which resulted in her assignment to teach literacy at penrose elementary school beginning september.
penrose elementary school 
daniels troubles continued at penrose.on september,the principal at penrose,katherine pendino,called daniels into her office and,while reviewing daniels performance records,asked her,do you know what you doing id.at.on or about september,when referring to daniels,pendino shouted in the hallway within the hearing of students,staff,and faculty s he no good.i want her out of here.id.similarly,two days later,pendino stated to daniels in front of her students,y ou do know anything.id.at.pendino also attempted to write daniels up for not indicating her time of arrival on the sheet,even though pendino had told her that she did not need to do so.pendino likewise wrote daniels up for not submitting lesson plans that daniels actually had submitted weeks earlier.
on or about october,pendino commented to the school behavior therapist that daniels was no good.i want to get rid of her.id.during the same month,pendino instructed daniels students to write down anything derogatory or negative that daniels had said.when parents complained about this direction to their children,daniels received another write up.then,on or about november,pendino told daniels,d o not return after christmas break either retire or resign.id.as had marianno and christy,pendino testified that she did not know of daniels phrc complaints when she took actions that daniels regarded as adverse.on december,daniels supplemented her february phrc complaint with a letter listing grievances against pendino.daniels sch.dist.of,d,
dispute over medical leave 
daniels took another medical leave beginning december.during the leave,daniels expected to receive wage continuation benefits,which cover percent of an employee salary after the employee has exhausted other sick leave.
under sdp leave policy,if an employee misses ten consecutive workdays due to personal illness,notice automatically is sent to carol kenney,sdp director of employee health services.when kenney office receives such a notice,it schedules an appointment for the employee with an sdp physician to determine whether the employee has a need for continued leave.an employee who disagrees with the conclusion of the sdp physician can request that another physician,not in sdp employ,evaluate her.if the employee makes such a request,sdp selects that physician from a list of physicians on which sdp and the teachers union previously had agreed.
in keeping with this policy,kenney office scheduled an appointment for daniels to see aribelle jones,an sdp physician,on january.although jones is not a psychiatrist and,according to daniels,merely spoke with daniels without examining her,she concluded that daniels would be fit to return to work on february.daniels did not accept this evaluation and consequently requested that a physician not in sdp employ evaluate her.accordingly,sdp scheduled an appointment for her for this purpose with a psychiatrist,burton weiss,from the penn diagnostic center.
before daniels appointment with weiss,kenney wrote a letter to him with background information about daniels to the effect that she had taken sick leave the previous school year and had stated that she was not supported by the principal at her last school.id.at.kenney also wrote that daniels went out again on sick leave in december with the same complaints of being harassed by her new principal.id.at.the letter asked that weiss specifically opine on whether daniels should have returned to work on february.
weiss examined daniels on february,and,two days later,he wrote a letter to kenney opining daniels symptoms of anxiety and depression arise from her dispute with the principal and not from a definable psychiatric illness.her problem is legal and administrative,not psychiatric.id.at.he therefore determined that daniels should have returned to work on february,reasoning that psychiatric treatment would not solve the source of her distress.
on february,kenney notified daniels of weiss conclusion and informed her that if she did not return to work on february,sdp would institute disciplinary proceedings against her.in reliance on weiss determination,kenney also denied daniels wage continuation benefits.daniels,however,did not return to work as directed.rather,based on the opinion of her own physicians,daniels did not return to work until march.due to daniels failure to return to work as directed,kenney,who testified that she did not know at that time of daniels phrc complaints,recommended that sdp terminate her employment.on may,daniels received notice that sdp had initiated the proceedings that ultimately led to the termination of her employment.
present lawsuit 
on may,daniels filed suit in the district court against sdp,mason,marianno,christy,and pendino,asserting claims of age discrimination,race discrimination,and retaliation.defendants made a partially successful motion for summary judgment as the court granted the motion in an order entered november,with respect to most of daniels claims,including those of retaliation.see daniels,d at.the remainder of the case proceeded to trial,at which the jury returned a verdict in defendants favor.the court entered a final judgment on november.daniels then moved to alter the judgment and for a new trial,but the court denied that motion on january.daniels appeals but limits her appeal to challenging the november,order for summary judgment with respect to her retaliation claims against sdp in violation of the adea,title vii,and the phra 
iii.statement of jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had original federal question jurisdiction over daniels adea and title vii claims pursuant to c and f,respectively,and and.it had supplemental jurisdiction over daniels phra claim pursuant to.we have jurisdiction under.
we exercise plenary review of the district court order for summary judgment.budhun reading hosp.med,cir.to warrant summary judgment,the movant must show that,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see williams phila.hous.auth.police dep t,cir.the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmovant position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the nonmovant.anderson liberty lobby.
iv.discussion 
the adea prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a title vii prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of an employee race,a and the phra prohibits discrimination in employment based on both age and race.a.all three statutes also make it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for either oppos ing any practice made unlawful by their respective provisions or for participating in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under their respective provisions.d a.d.
daniels asserts retaliation claims under each of these statutes.we address these claims together as the circumstances of this case do not require that we make differing analyses.see barber csx distribution,cir because the prohibition against age discrimination contained in the adea is similar in text,tone,and purpose to the prohibition against discrimination contained in title vii,courts routinely look to law developed under title vii to guide an inquiry under the adea.burton teleflex,cir treating plaintiff phra claims as identical to her adea and title vii claims.in particular,we consider daniels claims in this case,in which there is not direct evidence of retaliation,using the framework that the supreme court announced in mcdonnell douglas green.see,moore city of philadelphia,cir title vii fasold justice,cir adea and phra.
under the mcdonnell douglas framework,a plaintiff asserting a retaliation claim first must establish a prima facie case by showing that she engaged in protected employee activity adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee protected activity and a causal connection between the employee protected activity and the employer adverse action.marra phila.hous,cir quoting fogleman mercy hosp,cir.if the plaintiff makes these showings,the burden of production of evidence shifts to the employer to present a legitimate,reason for having taken the adverse action.id.if the employer advances such a reason,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer proffered explanation was false,and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action.id.quoting moore,at.although the burden of production of evidence shifts back and forth,the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times.reeves sanderson plumbing.using this rubric,we conclude that daniels can not support her claims of retaliation and the district court correctly granted summary judgment against her.
protected activity 
for purposes of the first prong of a prima facie case of retaliation,protected opposition activity includes not only an employee filing of formal charges of discrimination against an employer but also informal protests of discriminatory employment practices,including making complaints to management.curay cramer ursuline acad.of wilmington,f d,cir quoting sumner postal,cir see crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson,when an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in a form of employment discrimination,that communication virtually always constitutes the employee opposition to the activity.alteration in original.that is,in determining whether a plaintiff adequately opposed discrimination,we look to the message conveyed by a plaintiff conduct rather than the means of conveyance.moore,at quoting curay cramer,at.the complaint must allege that the opposition was to discrimination based on a protected category,such as age or race.see slagle cnty.of clarion,cir barber,at.furthermore,although a plaintiff in a retaliation case need not prove the merits of the underlying discrimination complaint,she must have act ed under a good faith,reasonable belief that a violation existed.moore,at quoting aman cort furniture rental,cir.this standard requires an objectively reasonable belief that the activity the plaintiff opposed constituted unlawful discrimination under the relevant statute.wilkerson new media tech.charter sch,cir quoting moore,at.
in clark county school district breeden,per curiam,the supreme court rejected a plaintiff retaliation claim as the court concluded that no reasonable person could have believed that the conduct of which she had complained constituted sex discrimination under title vii.the plaintiff had complained about an incident in which,while she was reviewing job applicants with a male supervisor and another male employee,the supervisor commented to her that he did not understand a sexually explicit statement that one of the applicants had made.at that time,the other male employee responded,well,i tell you later,and both men chuckled.id.at.at.the court noted that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment so as to violate title vii,and held that the single incident described in that case could not remotely satisfy this standard.id.at.at quoting faragher city of boca raton.accordingly,the plaintiff complaint about this incident did not qualify as protected activity.see id.at.at.
daniels asserts that she engaged in the following instances of protected conduct she complained to mason about mason grandparents comment during the parents night meeting she complained to mason about excessive monitoring that other teachers did not experience she sent the september,letter to sdp administrators claiming that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment because of her age she filed the october phrc complaint and the december amendment to that complaint,in which she claimed age and race discrimination based on the hostile work environment she experienced at mifflin and her forced transfer from that school and she filed the february phrc complaint claiming that marianno and christy had retaliated against her at vare for engaging in protected activities.
our review satisfies us that daniels can not show that the first two of these activities constituted protected conduct,but that she can make that showing with respect to the last three activities.first,daniels complaint to mason about the grandparents comment is not a protected activity because no reasonable person could believe that mason statement,by itself,constituted unlawful age discrimination.daniels complained that it was ageist and offensive for mason to state publicly that some of the teachers are old enough to be grandparents.however,the term grandparents is not inherently derogatory,and mason isolated offhand comment did not name daniels or any other teacher or explicitly denigrate the ability of older teachers to perform their duties.see breeden,at.at kargbo phila.for aging,d,the supervisor comments about plaintiff age are more serious than the single remark in breeden because they were explicitly directed at plaintiff and referred to his ability to do his job.contrary to daniels contention,her subjective belief that mason statement violated the adea does not suffice for her complaint to qualify as protected conduct.see curay cramer,at the plaintiff subjective state of mind is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether she engaged in protected conduct.
likewise,with respect to her second alleged category of protected conduct,daniels does not point to any evidence in the record showing that she made complaints to mason about excessive monitoring.moreover,she fails to demonstrate that she related her complaints to age or race discrimination such that the complaints could have qualified as protected activity under the statutes.see slagle,at holding that plaintiff vague allegations of civil rights violations,without reference to discrimination based on any protected category,did not constitute protected conduct under title vii barber,at holding that plaintiff general complaint of unfair treatment d id not translate into a charge of illegal age discrimination under the adea.in considering what activities constitute protected conduct,we emphasize that employment statutes are not intended to establish general standards for conduct of employers in dealing with employees.see curay cramer,at slagle,f d at barber,at.
but even though daniels can not successfully predicate a claim based on her first two categories of what she claims was protected conduct,she has made a showing sufficient to satisfy the first prong of her prima facie case based on the other three categories of such conduct.in her september,letter,daniels complained not only of mason ageis t comment and her fellow teacher reference to her as old school but also of the frequent monitoring of her teaching and classroom preparation,the lack of assistance in disciplining her students,mason negative written evaluations,mason questioning of students about her pedagogy,and the failure of mason or sdp to inform her of her teaching status for the upcoming school year despite her repeated requests for such information.app.at.toward the end of the letter,daniels summarized her complaints by stating that she experienced ageism,harassment,and a hostile work environment throughout the school year.id.at.daniels reasonably and in good faith could have believed that such pervasive harassment constituted unlawful age discrimination,and a factfinder could conclude that the letter alleged age discrimination in terms sufficient to qualify the sending of the letter as protected conduct under the adea and the phra.furthermore,daniels formal complaints to the phrc containing similar allegations of mistreatment based on age,race,and prior protected conduct unquestionably qualify as protected activities.see woodson scott paper,cir jalil avdel,cir.we therefore turn to the second prong of daniels prima facie case.
adverse action 
for an employer action to satisfy the second prong of a prima facie case of retaliation,the plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,internal quotation marks omitted accord moore,at.we examine the challenged conduct from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances.burlington santa fe ry,at.at quoting oncale sundowner offshore.p etty slights,minor annoyances,and simple lack of good manners generally will not suffice.id.at.at.however,c ontext matters such that an act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.id.at.at quoting washington.dep t of revenue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
daniels alleges that sdp engaged in numerous instances of adverse conduct her forced transfer from mifflin in the summer of and sdp failure to inform her of the transfer in time for her to participate in that year site selection process the designation of her absences on september,and,as unauthorized leave without pay,even though sdp did not notify her of her assignment to vare until september,and christy related memorandum of december,warning daniels that additional absences or lateness would lead to more severe disciplinary action the hostile work environment that daniels experienced at vare and penrose from september to december,which caused her mental health injuries the denial of her wage continuation benefits and sdp eventual termination of her employment.
we need not consider the first alleged instance of adverse action as daniels forced transfer without notification preceded her first protected activity the september,letter to sdp administrators and therefore was not after or contemporaneous with her protected conduct.see marra,at slagle,at.each of the other instances of adverse action,however,occurred after daniels first protected activity,and each could have dissuaded a reasonable person in her position from charging discrimination.consequently,they satisfy the second prong of her prima facie case.see,moore,at pattern of harassment sufficed leboon lancaster jewish cmty.ctr.ass n,cir termination of employment clearly suffices abramson william paterson,cir same.thus,as is often true in retaliation cases,this case turns on whether the plaintiff,here daniels,can establish that there was a causal connection between her protected activities and sdp adverse actions.
causal connection 
we consider a broad array of evidence in determining whether a sufficient causal link exists for a plaintiff to survive a motion for summary judgment.leboon,at quoting farrell planters lifesavers,cir.to demonstrate a link between protected activity and an employer adverse action,a plaintiff may rely on the temporal proximity between the two if unusually suggestive.marra,at.in the absence of such a close temporal proximity,we consider the circumstances as a whole,including any intervening antagonism by the employer,inconsistencies in the reasons the employer gives for its adverse action,and any other evidence suggesting that the employer had a retaliatory animus when taking the adverse action.see leboon,at marra,at farrell,at.the plaintiff,however,can not establish that there was a causal connection without some evidence that the individuals responsible for the adverse action knew of the plaintiff protected conduct at the time they acted.see andreoli gates,cir moore,at ambrose twp.of robinson,cir it is only intuitive that for protected conduct to be a substantial or motiving factor in a decision,the decisionmakers must be aware of the protected conduct.
daniels did not proffer sufficient evidence of causation to survive sdp motion for summary judgment.as to the adverse action with respect to daniels classification for september,and,johnson,then deputy chief in sdp staffing office,on september or directed that daniels be designated as having taken unauthorized leave without pay.app.at.these absences then triggered christy december,attendance memorandum following daniels absence ten days earlier.the record,however,does not contain any evidence that johnson learned of daniels september,letter until september,when she received an referencing that complaint but not mentioning its claim of age discrimination id.at.likewise,christy testified at his deposition that he had no knowledge of daniels complaints.daniels offers nothing to rebut this evidence that the decision makers respectively responsible for her designation as having taken unauthorized leave without pay and the subsequent warning lacked knowledge of her protected conduct.she therefore can not establish that there was a causal connection between her protected activities and such adverse action.see sarullo postal,cir per curiam ambrose,at.
daniels similarly can not establish that there was a causal connection between her protected activities and the hostile work environment that she allegedly experienced from september to december.the persons responsible for this alleged harassment,marianno and christy at vare and pendino at penrose,all testified that they lacked knowledge of daniels protected conduct.as the basis for establishing such knowledge,daniels points to the unexplained hostility of these individuals toward her immediately upon her
