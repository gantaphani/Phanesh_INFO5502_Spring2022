opinion of the court 
on this consolidated appeal of two cases jointly adjudicated in the district court for the district of new jersey,junior samuel myrie and norwood white,both of whom are inmates of new jersey prisons,contend that the district court erred in sustaining the under several provisions of the constitution of the united states and cognate provisions of the constitution of new stat.ann.the statute provides 
an act concerning payment of crime compensation board assessments and supplementing title of the revised statutes.
be it enacted by the senate and general assembly of the state of new jersey 
collection of vccb surcharge by commissary in correctional facility.
every commissary in a county or state correctional facility operated for the sale of commodities shall collect a surcharge of of the sales price of every item sold.the surcharge shall be known as the vccb surcharge.all funds collected pursuant to this section shall be forwarded to the state treasurer for deposit in the victims of crime compensation board account,shall be subject to reporting and accounting procedures pursuant to the provisions of section of.l and shall be used in satisfying claims pursuant to the provisions of the criminal injuries compensation act of,et.a sale subject to surcharge under this section shall not be subject to any tax imposed under the sales and use tax act,et.
this act shall take effect immediately but section shall remain inoperative until the day following enactment.
section was enacted in january of and went into effect in july of that year.between august and december of ten lawsuits asserting,inter alia,the invalidity of were filed in the district court pursuant to.the of whom was myrie and another of whom was these several lawsuits were all persons incarcerated in state or county prisons in new jersey.the defendants were state officials,led by then governor whitman.the district court consolidated the several lawsuits for the limited purpose of dealing in unified fashion with their common constitutional claims involving.the federal constitutional claims were that the statute violated the double jeopardy,ex post facto,bill of attainder,and excessive fines clauses and also deprived the plaintiffs of due process and equal protection.the state constitutional claims were based on those provisions of the new jersey constitution that are counterparts of the federal constitutional clauses on for summary judgment with respect to those common constitutional claims,the district court,in a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion,granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.thereafter,because unlike some of the other lawsuits the lawsuits brought by myrie and white advanced no other claims,final judgment was entered against myrie and white.they have both appealed.
double jeopardy,ex post facto,and bill of attainder 
the double jeopardy,ex post facto,and bill of attainder provisions are discrete constitutional protections addressed to distinct types of impermissibly oppressive governmental constraints.but they have a common thread they only apply to those situations in which the injury complained of constitutes an imposition or exaction of a criminal rather than a civil nature.see rex trailer united states.
in hudson united states,d,a case in which the supreme court rejected a contention that criminal prosecutions undertaken following the imposition of sanctions imposed by a civil regulatory agency constituted double jeopardy,the court speaking through chief justice rehnquist,and building upon its earlier decision in kennedy,d,formulated the pertinent analytic scheme in the following terms 
whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is,at least initially,a matter of statutory construction.helvering mitchell.a court must first ask whether the legislature,in establishing the penalizing mechanism,indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.united states ward,d.even in those cases where the legislature has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty,we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,at,as to transfor m what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,rex trailer united states.
in making this latter determination the factors listed in kennedy,d,provide useful guideposts,including w hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of and deterrence whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.it is important to note,however,that these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,at,and only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.ward,supra at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in the cases under review the district court examined the double jeopardy,ex post facto,and bill of attainder challenges to through the prism of the court opinions in hudson and.on appeal the parties agree that is the appropriate constitutional template,but appellants junior myrie and norwood white argue that the district court misapplied it,while appellees the state officials argue that the district court got it right.
we concur in the parties acknowledgment that hudson is the proper rubric.we turn now to the application of its principles to appellants claims.
a.did the new jersey legislature intend to be a civil imposition or a criminal one 
as the chief justice explained in hudson,w hether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is,at least initially,a matter of statutory construction a court must first ask whether the legislature,in establishing the penalizing mechanism,indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.at.
in auge new jersey dep t of corrections,a case decided shortly after the district court dismissal of appellants claims,the appellate division of the new jersey superior court rejected a new jersey prison inmate contention that chapter of the laws of as contravened his double jeopardy,ex post facto,and due process rights.the auge court opinion provides an instructive summary of the back to led to the enactment of 
in,the legislature enacted the criminal injuries compensation act the act,to.the primary purpose of the act is to provide compensation to persons who have suffered bodily injury from the commission of a serious crime.white violent crimes compensation.however,the legislature failed during the to appropriate sufficient funds to provide adequate and timely compensation to violent crimes victims in accordance with the act.see assembly judiciary law,public safety defense committee,statement to assembly bill,sess.noting that as of the number of claims as well as insufficient funding had created a situation where a claimant had to wait up to years before receiving relief.to establish an additional source of funding,the legislature enacted chapter of the laws of,which required any person convicted of any crime or other enumerated offense to be assessed a penalty ranging from to and directed that the money collected from the penalty be deposited in a separate account for the compensation of victims of violent crimes.however,the penalties imposed under this legislation still failed to generate sufficient revenue to fully fund the program because they often could not be collected.sponsor statement to,sess.
the minimum amount of the penalty has since been increased to.
in an effort to make up for this continuing shortfall in the funding required to compensate the victims of violent crimes,the legislature enacted chapter of the laws of which imposes a surcharge upon the price of all commodities purchased in prison commissaries and directs that money collected from this surcharge be deposited in the victims of crime compensation board account.the assembly appropriation committee statement concerning the bill notes that 
the vccb violent crimes compensation board surcharge authorized under this bill is expected to generate between and million annually for the vccb.when coupled with federal matching funds,the vccb should have approximately million in new moneys available to compensate crime victims assembly appropriations committee,statement to senate committee substitute for,sess.
the statement of the assembly appropriations committee quoted in auge was dated december.on december,a fiscal note on the pending bill enlarged on the statement of the assembly appropriations committee.the fiscal note explained why the statutory surcharge was to be imposed on all inmate purchases,not just on purchases by inmates who still owed money to the victims of crime compensation board vccb according to the fiscal note,developing a computer system capable of identifying the inmates owing money to the vccb would have been prohibitively expensive.the fiscal note also pointed out that exempting correctional facility commissary sales from new jersey sales,as now,would reduce the aggregate anticipated annual surcharge revenue of by up to 
we think that the history of the auge court description of its provenance,together with the recital of the assembly appropriations committee and the supplementary fiscal note convincingly demonstrates that the intent of the legislature was to put in place a civil remedial program a program designed to generate funds that would help new jersey fulfill its but only partially realized commitment to compensate crime victims,not a program designed to add further punishment to those incarcerated.
to be sure,this history does not specify why the legislature looked to prison inmates as the source of the needed revenues.it would seem,however,not unreasonable to infer that the legislature regarded the inmate population as a cohort whose members were in large measure accountable for the victim harms for which adequate compensation had not been achieved.
such a legislative attribution of it was,in fact,not,of course,be flawless.as pointed out by the fiscal note,the program adopted by the legislature contemplated that the surcharge would be added to the price of all inmate purchases,including purchases by inmates who had already completed payment of sums owing to the vccb.also,the new jersey inmate population presumably continues to held in custody,not convicted of any crimes.but this lack of correspondence between a particular inmate purchase and an identifiable and precisely quantifiable dollar obligation to a victim does not undercut the general rationality of the attribution of accountability which,we assume,animated the legislature.more to the point,it does not undercut the conclusion that the surcharge regime was intended by the legislature to be civil and remedial.
does application of the seven factors mark as so punitive in effect as to transform the statutory surcharge it authorizes into a criminal punishment 
in section i a of this opinion we concluded that the text and history of s show it to have been intended by the new jersey legislature to be a civil remedial program,not a program intended to enhance the punishment of persons incarcerated in new jersey state and county prisons.
we now address the second question posed by the hudson court.that second question is whether,notwithstanding that the legislature has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to transfor m what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.at.in aid of that inquiry,the supreme court pointed lower courts to seven criteria identified in.
as previously noted,the seven criteria are as follows 
whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint,whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment,whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter,whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of and deterrence,whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it,and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry,and may often point in differing directions.
the sanction challenged in our case is a surcharge added by state law to the price of retail purchases at new jersey state and county prison commissaries.it has all the earmarks of a sales tax.indeed,it replaces the sales tax that new jersey imposes on purchases made in ordinary retail stores throughout the state.as of the time period covered by this litigation,the new jersey sales tax has been except for those categories of retail items,primarily food,clothes and prescription drugs,that new jersey law exempts from sales tax.thus the effective sanction is a commissary price increment of for items that would be exempt from sales tax at a retail store,while for other items the commissary price increment is,
the first inquiry is whether the asserted sanction is an affirmative disability or restraint.the phrase apparently derives from the court opinion in flemming nestor,d.in that case the court upheld,against constitutional challenge,the termination,pursuant to n of the social security act,of benefits of an alien deported for past communist party membership.among the grounds for constitutional challenge were contentions that the termination of appellee benefits amounts to punishing him without a judicial trial,see wong wing united states.that the termination of benefits constitutes the imposition of punishment by legislative act,rendering n a bill of attainder,see united states lovett.cummings missouri,wall.and that the punishment exacted is imposed for past conduct not unlawful when engaged in,thereby violating the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws,see ex parte garland,wall.at.the flemming nestor court went on to observe that e ssential to the success of each of these contentions is the validity of characterizing as punishment in the constitutional sense the termination of benefits under n.id.in the course of its extended discussion of whether the challenged sanction was a punishment in the constitutional sense,the court observed that h ere the sanction is the mere denial of a noncontractual governmental benefit.no affirmative disability or restraint is imposed,and certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment of imprisonment,as in wong wing,on which great reliance is mistakenly placed.id.at.
since the withdrawal of benefits challenged in flemming nestor was found not to constitute an affirmative disability or restraint,it is plain that the comparatively minor imposition complained of on this appeal can not be so characterized.
having determined that the statutory surcharge on prison commissary sales is not an affirmative disability or restraint,we find it possible to address with greater expedition the balance of the criteria.thus,to state the question whether such a surcharge has historically been regarded as a punishment,at,is,manifestly,to answer that question in the negative.similarly,it is plain that the addition of a surcharge to the price of a retail purchase is not an event that comes into play only on a finding of scienter.id.nor is there ground for supposing that the imposition of a surcharge on commissary purchases will promote the traditional aims of and deterrence.id.further,it is not the case that the behavior to which it the surcharge applies namely,purchasing items at a commissary is already a crime.id.
the sixth criterion is whether an alternative purpose to which the asserted sanction may rationally be connected is assignable for it.id.at.we understand this criterion to inquire whether an asserted sanction may be reasonably regarded as having a purpose other than punishment.the answer is that,as explained in the discussion of the history of in section i a of this opinion,the stated legislative intention in providing for the surcharge was to generate additional fund
