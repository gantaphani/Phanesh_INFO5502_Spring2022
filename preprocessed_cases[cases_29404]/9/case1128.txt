xiao xing ni,a native and citizen of china,seeks review of a december,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the july,decision of an immigration judge ij.in re xiao xing ni,no,aff g immig.city july.the ij determined that ni testimony was not credible,and denied her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the ij decision was supported by substantial evidence.more analysis is required,however,because i ni has given birth to one child ii certain documents mentioned in jin xiu chen department of justice,cir they are that the birth of one child could result in forced sterilization for a person who is returned to fujian province and iii our opinion in tian ming lin department of justice,cir per curiam,suggests in dicta that,although by statute we may not order the taking of additional evidence,a,we may have inherent power to do so in the circumstances presented here.we need not decide whether despite congress proscription there may be circumstances in which we retain an inherent power to remand to the bia for the consideration of additional evidence we hold more narrowly that regardless of whether such residual inherent power exists,we should not exercise it if i the basis for the remand is an instruction to consider documentary evidence that was not in the record before the bia and ii the agency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the bia for the taking of additional evidence.
ni arrived in the united states in april and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief based on her claim of persecution under china policy.her asylum application claimed she began living with a man in,became pregnant about two years later,was forced to undergo an abortion when the cadre discovered the pregnancy in november,and was fined for a violation of birth control policy.
at the july,hearing,ni testified that she and her boyfriend began living together in her parents house in when they were both fifteen years old,that they were unmarried because they were,that they had no traditional wedding ceremony because they were worried about what the neighbors would say,but that neighborhood opinion did not inhibit them from having wedding photographs taken,or from cohabiting unmarried at age fifteen.
ni further testified that she was given an abortion certificate,that her mother paid a fine imposed on ni for becoming pregnant outside marriage and was given a receipt,and that ni left china when she became pregnant again because she feared another forced abortion and forced sterilization.when asked to explain why the asylum application mentioned no fear of sterilization,ni twice said that she simply forgot to mention it.
ni son was born in the united states on november.the ij did not make an adverse credibility finding as to ni assertion that she has one child,and the government does not dispute the point.
the ij found that ni testimony was not credible and rejected her application for relief.the bia affirmed.where,as here,the bia decision affirms the ij adverse credibility finding without rejecting any portion of the ij decision,but emphasizing particular aspects of the reasoning,we review both decisions.see guan gonzales,cir per curiam.we review the agency findings,including credibility findings,for substantial evidence,ye dep t of homeland security,cir,treating the agency findings as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
when a factual challenge pertains to a credibility finding we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard,mindful that the law must entrust some official with responsibility to hear an applicant claim,and the ij has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant.zhou yun zhang,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.our review of an adverse credibility determination is exceedingly narrow,melgar de torres reno,cir,and ensures only that it is based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.zhang,at.
the adverse credibility finding here was supported by substantial evidence.the ij found that ni credibility was undermined by i the implausibility and inconsistency of ni testimony about her deference to the neighbors views regarding her boyfriend and her pregnancy ii ni failure to mention her claimed fear of sterilization on direct examination or in her asylum application,or until the very last part of the hearing when the court started to ask questions and iii the discrepancy between ni claim that she received an abortion certificate following her forced abortion and the state department country report which states that united states authorities are unaware of any abortion certificates and that the only document that might resemble such a certificate is a document issued by hospitals upon a patient request after a voluntary abortion.bureau of democracy,human rights and labor,dep t of state,china profile of asylum claims and country conditions,see also tu lin gonzales,cir.
the adverse credibility finding undermines the only record evidence of ni alleged past persecution or risk of future persecution.accordingly,the bia denial of ni application for asylum and withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence.see paul gonzales,cir.ni has pressed no meaningful challenge to the denial of her cat claim so any challenge is waived.yueqing zhang gonzales,cir.
in virtually all cases,the conclusion that substantial evidence supports the ij decision would end our inquiry our review of an ij findings is limited to determining whether any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b.absent a determination that a reasonable adjudicator would be so compelled,or that the ij committed an error of law,the petition must be denied.see id.however,in tian ming lin department of justice,cir per curiam,a panel of this court raised in dicta the prospect that we may be able nevertheless to remand for further.the tian ming lin panel i took judicial notice of certain documents that were in the record of another case,shou yung guo gonzales,cir ii relied on guo for the proposition that the documents,if authentic,apparently reflect governmental policy in the province in china where the petitioner lived,tian ming lin,at quoting guo,at and iii remanded to the bia for consideration of the guo documents because they may constitute evidence of an official policy of forcible sterilization in fujian province,tian ming lin,at.
the guo documents if authentic concern the possible sterilization of persons who have had two or more children.id.ni has had only one but suspect documents to similar effect regarding persons who have had any number of unauthorized births were in the record in another recent case of this court jin xiu chen department of justice,cir.thus,the question before us is whether,if we take judicial notice of the chen documents,we have inherent power to order a remand for the bia to consider documents that are not in the record of this case.to answer this question,the interplay of these recent cases and the underlying statutory framework requires some explication.
in shou yung guo,the petitioner moved to reopen her case before the bia and attempted to establish her risk of torture in china by submitting,inter alia,documents that purported to show that in fujian province her second child would be counted for purposes of chinese policies,and that in fujian the birth of a second child would result in forced sterilization.at.the panel observed that although the documents were unquestionably material,it was not apparent to us that the bia ever really paid any attention to the documents.id.at.accordingly,the guo panel remanded so that the bia could consider the evidence that had been casually and inexplicably dismissed.id.
in tian ming lin,the petitioner alleged similar factual circumstances he was the father of two united children and claimed that he too would face forced sterilization if returned to fujian province.at.unlike petitioner guo,however,lin did not submit the guo documents to the bia in support of his motion to reopen.instead,after the bia had denied lin motion,lin moved in this court to remand to the bia so that the bia could be given the opportunity to consider the guo documents.id.at.at a late stage of the appeal,the government joined lin request.id.at.
prior to the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,we had the authority to remand to the bia for the taking of additional evidence that authority was found in c,which provides that we may order additional evidence.to be taken by the agency if the petitioner shows that the additional evidence is material and there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence before the agency.see also tian ming lin,at.on remand,the bia could then modify its findings of fact,or make new findings,by reason of the additional evidence so taken,and may modify or set aside its order.c.
but iirira explicitly revoked our authority to remand to the bia for the taking of additional evidence pursuant to c judicial review of a final order of removal is governed only by chapter of title,except that the court may not order the taking of additional evidence under section c of title.a.accordingly,there remained no statutory mechanism by which petitioner lin could move for remand to the bia to consider the guo documents the tian ming lin panel thus denied the motion.at.
the panel nevertheless granted the relief for which lin had moved,and remanded to the bia.the court did not order the taking of additional evidence rather,it remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,and stated that the basis for the remand was that both parties ask ed us to remand.id.at.in extensive dicta,however,the tian ming lin panel offered two alternative bases for its decision i remand was appropriate because the government requested a remand,or ii remand was appropriate because we have inherent equitable power to remand cases to administrative agencies for further proceedings in sufficiently compelling circumstances.id.at see also id.at.we are unlikely ever to decide whether we have inherent power to remand for consideration of the guo documents,and,if so,whether we retain that power in the face of the government opposition to a government has been consenting to remand in those cases by stipulation.but since the government has not stipulated to a remand in ni case,we consider whether we can remand for consideration of the chen documents as an exercise of our inherent power.
as set out above,the guo documents are not material to claims by ni,who has had a single child.however,the chen in the record of jin xiu chen dep t of justice,cir could bear more directly on ni claims.the petitioner in chen submitted a document that purport ed to be a translation of a missive from the changle city family planning policy leading team,that states i that individuals in marriages below the statutory age of marriage who have a child must undergo sterilization after the first childbirth ii that unmarried women with a history of giving childbirth sic,no matter the number of childbirth s she had before,must comp ly with the sterilization policy and iii that t hose subjects who gave birth must be imposed with sic sterilization operation.id.at.if these chen documents are authentic,and if the policies described therein remain in force,they may be relevant to the question of whether ni would face forced sterilization if she were to return to fujian province.see id.noting that the bia has yet to consider the authenticity,scope,and import of the changle city document.
ni has not moved in this court for a remand to the bia to consider the chen documents but as tian ming lin makes clear,ni lacks a procedural means to make that motion and we lack the statutory authority to grant it.furthermore,the government does not stipulate to a remand in this case,as it did in tian ming lin.without the consent of the parties as an available basis for remand,we are confronted with the question left open by tian ming lin whether,despite the revocation of c,we have the inherent equitable power to remand to the bia and order the taking of additional evidence that was not submitted to the agency and that purports to establish the existence of a policy of forced sterilization that may apply to the petitioner.this is something of an odd question.as the supreme court has observed 
i t would be a strange rule which deprived a judge of power to do what was asked when request was made by the person most concerned,and yet allowed him to act without petition,and such an arrangement would almost certainly subject trial judges to private appeals or application by counsel or friends of one convicted.
carlisle united states,d quoting united states smith.nevertheless,this question is presented by circumstance,and we proceed to answer it.
when congress established the lower federal courts and vested them with the judicial power of the united states,const.art.iii,t he judicial power consisted of all the inherent powers of the courts of justice necessary to their functioning armstrong guccione,cir see also united states hudson,cranch.certain implied powers must necessarily result to our courts of justice from the nature of their institution.
however,t he lower federal courts are creatures of statute.armstrong,at.as such,their jurisdiction is defined by written law,and can not transcend that jurisdiction.ex parte bollman,cranch.t he power which congress possess es to create courts of inferior jurisdiction,necessarily implies the power to limit the jurisdiction of those courts to particular objects hudson,cranch at.accordingly,even where lower federal courts possess inherent power,the exercise of that power can be limited by statute and rule.chambers nasco,d.
we will not,however,lightly assume that congress has intended to depart from established principles,such as the scope of a court inherent power.id.at.quoting weinberger,d.for congress to displace or repudiate the lower federal courts inherent powers,the supreme court has demanded something akin to a clear indication of legislative intent.armstrong,at.it is not enough for congress to pass a statute that expressly grants power that is coextensive with the courts already existing inherent power.chambers,at.t he inherent power of a court can be invoked even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same conduct.therefore,it is possible for statutory and inherent sources of judicial authority to coexist.armstrong,at.and the subsequent revocation of a coextensive statutory grant of power does not necessarily act to circumscribe the courts inherent power that preexisted the statutory grant.ins cyr,d holding that the repeal of a statute can not be sufficient to eliminate what it did not originally grant ex parte yerger,wall.interpreting congress repeal of an act to affect only the jurisdiction conferred by that act.
the enactment of iirira altered our power to review orders of removal we may not order the taking of additional evidence under section c of title.a.neither c nor iirira mentions a court inherent power so if there existed such an inherent power to order the taking of additional evidence,the enactment of c would not operate to displace it,and the subsequent limitation of c would not operate to limit an argument could be made to the contrary 
t he inherent power of courts over their own officers,or to protect themselves,and their members,from being disturbed in the exercise of their functions is long established.ex parte bollman,cranch.this inherent power generally extends only to a court management of its own affairs to impose decorum,to maintain order,to control admission to the bar,to discipline attorneys,to punish for contempt,and to vacate its own judgments if tainted by fraud.chambers,at.see also degen united states,d courts have certain inherent authority to protect their proceedings and judgments in the courts of discharging their traditional responsibilities.
the inherent power posited by the tian ming lin panel has nothing to do with a court own affairs the power supposed is the inherent equitable power to remand cases to administrative agencies for further proceedings in sufficiently compelling circumstances,at,for consideration of new evidence,id.at.a remand to an administrative agency instructing the agency to reopen the record and take additional evidence is not the management of a court own affairs,and the supreme court has rejected assertions of inherent power that are remote from what courts require in order to perform their functions.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d ex parte bollman,cranch at stating the power of taking cognizance of any question between individuals,or between the government and individuals must be given to this court by a statute compatible with the constitution of the united states.we therefore conclude that,though we have some inherent powers,see,chambers,at,it is not immediately obvious that we have the inherent power suggested by the tian ming lin panel.
in support of its assertion of power,the tian ming lin panel relied exclusively on a passage in ford motor nlrb.see at.however,ford motor is not as useful an analog as the tian ming lin panel would have it.
the procedural posture of ford motor is as follows after the nlrb ordered ford to desist from described practices and to offer reinstatement,with back pay,to certain discharged employees,at,the nlrb moved in the court of appeals seeking the enforcement of its order,while ford instituted its own action asking the court of appeals to review and set aside the nlrb order.id.at.the supreme court considered these parallel proceedings essentially one proceeding,because they both hinged on the legality of the nlrb order.id.at.see also id.at.t he jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals is of the same character and scope in a proceeding for review brought by a person aggrieved by an order of the board as the jurisdiction which the court has in a proceeding instituted by the board.the nlrb moved to withdraw its enforcement action and remand th e cause to the nlrb for the purpose of setting aside its findings and the initial order.id.at.the court of appeals granted the motion,and the supreme court held that the court of appeals had jurisdiction to do so.
in so holding,the supreme court used the following language,upon which the tian ming lin panel relied 
it is familiar appellate practice to remand causes for further proceedings without deciding the merits,where justice demands that course in order that some defect in the record may be supplied the jurisdiction to review the orders of the nlrb is vested in a court with equity powers,and while the court must act within the bounds of the statute and without intruding upon the administrative province,it may adjust its relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action.
id.at.see also tian ming lin,at quoting the above passage.
the supreme court reasoned that t he statute with respect to a judicial review of orders of the nlrb follows closely the statute governing judicial review of federal trade commission orders,under which it was well established that the court may remand the cause to the commission for further proceedings to the end that valid and essential findings may be made.ford motor,at.moreover,there was no dispute that,under the governing statute,the court of appeals could have remanded the cause for further proceedings if the motion had been made by the petitioner.id.at.accordingly,the question was given that the court of appeals had jurisdiction to set aside the nlrb findings,did the court of appeals have jurisdiction to permit the nlrb to set aside its own findings on its own motion without confessing error.id.at.the court held that it did.id.at.
ford motor may not support the proposition that we have inherent power to remand and order the reopening of the record for the taking of additional evidence,in compelling circumstances or otherwise rather,it may suggest that the scope of our inherent power to remand might depend upon the request of the government nevertheless,a remand compelling the bia to reopen the record would be hard to square with the statutory framework.
on the other hand,we can not and should not attribute dispositive weight to the government stipulation to a remand.rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that t he circuit clerk may dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement but n o mandate or other process may issue without a court order.emphasis added.thus,as we explained in khouzam ashcroft,a lthough the parties are free to agree to a dismissal on their own,federal rule of appellate procedure b does not mandate that an appellate court issue an order simply because the parties agree to it,cir 
still,we can not imagine all possible circumstances that might arise in future cases,and we therefore decline to forswear categorically all inherent power to remand for additional in agency cases that present extraordinary and compelling circumstances rather,we conclude that the exercise of such an inherent power is not warranted if,as here i the basis for the remand is an instruction to consider documentary evidence that was not in the record before the bia and ii the agency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the bia for the taking of additional evidence.
because of their very potency,inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.chambers,at.the existence of evidence that was not in the record before the bia and therefore was not examined by the bia does not present a sufficiently compelling situation to warrant the exercise of inherent power to order the taking of additional evidence.nor are these circumstances unusual,tian ming lin,at nothing is easier than to submit to an appellate court for the first time documents that,if authentic,would appear to be official statements of the chinese government.id.at.if not these documents or those documents,some others would do.
the test proposed by the tian ming lin panel is to remand for the taking of additional evidence if there are sufficiently compelling circumstances.id.at.evidence may be compelling if it is authentic,but we are in no position to make such a determination.according to the tian ming lin dicta,all that is needed is to notice only that another panel of our court remanded a case to the bia for reconsideration of previously unexamined evidence that,in the opinion of that panel,apparently reflects governmental policy regarding forced sterilization.id.at.but a prior panel remand based on unexamined but potentially material evidence that was in the record of that case does not establish that the evidence is compelling,much less that it is sufficiently compelling to warrant remand for consideration of that evidence in other cases it merely establishes the unremarkable proposition that a remand is appropriate when the bia fails to consider potentially material evidence that was in the record before it.see shou yung guo,at.
more fundamentally,the agency regulations provide an avenue for the reopening of proceedings,and specify conditions and parameters that amount to a set of standards for what is compelling and what is not.thus,a person in ni position is afforded an opportunity to move to reopen proceedings before the bia.the motion may be granted if i the petitioner presents new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,c ii the motion is filed within ninety days of the final administrative decision,id.c and iii the petitioner has not already filed a motion to reopen,id.these time and numerical limitations do not bar a motion to reopen if it is based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered.id.c.in deciding the motion to reopen,the bia can evaluate the petitioner new evidence,and determine its import in the first instance.if the motion is denied under such circumstances that the bia was compelled to grant it,a petition may be taken to this court,and this court can grant calling upon extraordinary inherent powers.see,hasirah dep t of homeland security,cir per curiam we review the denial of a motion to reopen a removal proceeding for abuse of discretion.
principles of deference counsel restraint in resorting to inherent power,and require its use to be a reasonable response to the problems and needs that provoke it.degen,at.internal citations omitted.a court inherent power is limited by the necessity giving rise to its exercise.id.at.where,as here,existing statutes and regulations provide an alternative means of protecting the petitioner interests,and say when and how the record may and may not be reopened,there is a lack of necessity,id.at,for the resort to inherent powers 
the ability of a particular petitioner to successfully reopen proceedings in the agency does not bear on the question.it therefore does not matter whether the bia would grant a hypothetical motion to reopen filed by ni at some future time.the question is whether we should exercise some inherent power to remand to the bia and order the taking of additional evidence when the bia itself has not had the opportunity to consider the evidence in the context of the petitioner case.the mere opportunity to file a motion to reopen means that regardless of the disposition in this court,a petitioner has the ability to put additional evidence before the agency,and the agency will consider whether to reopen proceedings in light of that evidence.if the agency grants the motion,then the need for this court to review its decision is eliminated.if the agency denies the motion based on a determination that the evidence is either immaterial or fraudulent,then we can review that decision on a full record,which would include the relevant evidence.if the agency denies the motion based on a determination that the motion is untimely or otherwise procedurally barred,see c,then we can review that decision as well.but our power inherent or otherwise to review that decision is unrelated to any inherent power to remand and order the taking of additional evidence,which would be unnecessary in such a case,because the relevant evidence would have been in the record before the bia on the motion to reopen proceedings 
neither hoxhallari gonzales,cir,nor latifi gonzales,cir,both cited in tian ming lin,at are to the contrary.in latifi,we remanded due to numerous errors in the ij adverse credibility finding as to the albanian petitioner.at.in a closing footnote,we recognized that the democratic party returned to power in albania.id.at.but this observation was not the basis for our remand we did no more that suggest that the bia may wish to consider this event,and that the government had the burden of showing the significance,if any,of the change in power.id.
in hoxhallari,we upheld an ij conclusion that changed country conditions in albania defeated the petitioner presumption of future persecution.at.while the ij discussion of the changed conditions was perfunctory,the ij recognized th e political transformation occurring in albania.see id.at.we concluded that this recognition was sufficient,and did not require a detailed and specific recitation of country conditions,id.at,because we assumed that the ij was aware of the salient historical events and conditions of countries that are the subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,id.at.
thus,these cases stand for the uncontroversial propositions that i this court is not ignorant of indisputable historical events such as the partition of india,the of the ottoman empire,or the fall of communist regimes in the balkans,and ii we will not assume that the agency suffers from such ignorance.neither proposition has any import here.
for the reasons set forth above,the petition is hereby denied.
i concur in the result.there is much in the majority opinion with which i agree,as to matters both central and peripheral to its decision.in the latter category,i find very helpful,for instance,the majority treatment of latifi and hoxhallari.latifi gonzales,cir per curiam hoxhallari gonzales,cir per curiam see op.at.
more centrally,like the majority,i believe that the question of whether we have inherent equitable power to remand for additional,given the removal of our statutory authority to do so,is not yet fully resolved.a.there are clearly strong feelings on that question.see tian ming lin dep t of justice,cir per curiam op.at.and,as the majority opinion says,one should be hesitant to assume the nonexistence or the casual statutory abrogation of any such inherent equitable powers.op.at.i fully concur with the majority,however,that such inherent equitable powers,if they exist,should be exercised only very sparingly,for example,where there is no other way to correct manifest injustice.moreover,in the case before us,i think it obvious that,at least at this time,no manifest injustice will result from our decision not to remand to the bia.
broadly speaking,the petitioner may have two alternative avenues for relief.
first,she has the option of asking the bia to reopen the original proceedings.normally,a motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of the board decision,c,but this time limit does not apply to petitioners relying on new evidence of changed country conditions,where that evidence could not have been discovered or presented at the original hearing.c iii the documents proffered by the petitioner in very well establish changed country conditions.jin xiu chen dep t of justice,cir per curiam.and even if the chen documents themselves describe conditions which predate ni petition,they may represent the equivalent of changed country conditions notwithstanding the date of their issuance because they might vary the perception of the state department,upon which the immigration courts rely,which would warrant reopening under c.fong chen gonzales,cir.
second,the regulations seem to permit the petitioner to make a new request for asylum.the statute allows a repeat application based on changes that have occurred since the original application was denied,if these changed circumstances materially affect her eligibility for asylum.a d.this provision apparently includes changed personal conditions as well as changed country conditions.see a i jian huan guan bia,cir per curiam ai ming dong dep t of justice,cir.the subsequent discovery of the chen documents may well constitute such changed circumstances.
a petitioner,like ni,must file her new request within a reasonable period,but in deciding whether she has done so,the authorities are obliged to consider the fact that the changed circumstances were only discovered long after her original request was denied.a ii.it seems more than plausible,then,that ni,even if she could not reopen before the bia,could present a new asylum petition.her claim of persecution would,as a result,be heard on its merits.
given these possibilities,it seems to me quite clear this case,at this exercise of inherent equitable powers is called for to prevent manifest injustice.since that is all that is needed to decide the case,i fully agree that the petition must be denied without determining whether or not we have such inherent equitable powers to remand.
as to most of the interesting,learned and often useful dicta in the majority opinion,i express no ultimate view.there is,however,one implication in the opinion which is dicta and with which i expressly disagree.the opinion states that w here existing statutes and regulations provide an alternative means of protecting the petitioner interests,there is a lack of necessity for the resort to inherent powers.op.at second alteration in original citation omitted.the opinion then adds that t he ability of a particular petitioner to successfully reopen proceedings does not bear on the question.id.this language could be taken to mean that the mere existence of a procedure which permits some petitioners to have their cases heard by the bia,but excludes others,would be sufficient to bar the exercise of any inherent equitable powers we have,even when the excluded applicants would suffer manifest injustice.
if that is what the majority means to say this dictum strikes me as wrong and,ind
