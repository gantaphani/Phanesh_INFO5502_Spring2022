opinion of the court 
anthony sides brought this suit under against various prison officials at sci greene,a correctional facility in pennsylvania,alleging violations of his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights.the case proceeded to trial in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,where the jury reached a verdict in favor of the defendants.sides appeals that decision,contending that he was denied a fair trial because the district court required that he be restrained by handcuffs and leg irons throughout the trial.though we have concerns regarding the manner in which the court handled this issue,any error here was nonetheless harmless.thus we affirm 
background 
in his complaint,sides,a former inmate at sci greene,alleged that officer james cherry entered his cell and attacked him in april.sides further alleged that other prison officials denied his repeated requests for medical care.the case proceeded to trial in january.
a.the district court imposition of physical restraints 
following jury selection,the district court held an informal conference in chambers and raised the possibility that sides would be physically,appear in leg irons and trial.sides counsel objected to the imposition of any physical restraints,and precedent from another circuit the district court should employ a balancing test to determine whether physical restraints were warranted in terms of the interest of the plaintiff and the need to have him in handcuffs.counsel also urged the court not just to defer to any type of department of corrections policies on the issue.
in response,defendants counsel noted that he did not represent the department of corrections,and thus could not really give guidance to the court on the issue.when the judge asked whether counsel would make some calls to see if somebody could come up and represent the department of corrections,counsel responded that sides was considered very high risk,had been a very assaultive inmate,and was currently in a special needs unit at sci greene.though defendants counsel stated that he would be willing to proffer testimony on the issue,he argued that,in light of sides track record of misconduct and violence,it would be appropriate to have him handcuffed and shackled and certainly placed under guard.
the judge then informed the parties that he had spoken with a united states deputy marshal that morning regarding the issue 
i was told by the deputy marshal,who is in charge of security for the courts,that sides is a category five security risk,which is the highest category of security risk the department of justice has or department of corrections has.that he is in a special needs unit at the prison.that if ordered,i could have the shackles removed however,he recommended against it.
i asked him what could be done to minimize this and he ha s agreed to place some type of a curtain at the desk so that the shackles would not be obvious throughout the trial.
we agreed that when he is called to testify,we will take take the jury out of the room,put him in the witness box.i mean,the guards will take the shackles off.the marshal will put extra people in the courtroom while he testifies.
accepting the court ruling,sides counsel raised the additional concern that,if corrections officers sat directly behind sides during trial,anything he want ed to discuss with counsel ha d the potential of being heard by the officers.the court acknowledged that this is an obvious prejudicial issue,but suggest ed that they whisper.
the district judge put in place preventive measures during trial to mitigate the prejudice to sides of appearing in shackles.those measures were a jacket be placed over sides hands and wrists to hide the handcuffs while he sat at the plaintiff table a paper apron be wrapped around the plaintiff table to obscure sides leg irons and sides would not testify wearing either the handcuffs or leg irons.because the apron did not reach the bottom of the floor,boxes were placed underneath the table to obscure completely the leg irons though no similar measures were taken with respect to the defendants table.in addition,the judge addressed the fact that sides would be physically restrained during trial in his preliminary instructions to the jury.
b.the trial 
despite the measures the judge called for,sides handcuffs were not always obscured.when sides stood up as the judge entered or left the courtroom,the jacket shifted off his hands,exposing the handcuffs.the jacket also shifted off sides hands whenever he raised them to write a note to his lawyer or take a drink of water.on each such occasion,sides trial counsel readjusted the jacket to conceal the handcuffs.in addition,two uniformed correctional officers sat approximately five feet directly behind sides throughout the trial.
before sides took the witness stand to testify,the jury was taken out of the courtroom.contrary to the district court order,however,reasons not apparent from the record,and despite the reminder of sides counsel to the court of its prior instruction trial tr,testified while wearing handcuffs and leg irons.when he motioned with his hands during his testimony,the jacket covering his handcuffs shifted and the handcuffs became visible.
sides testified as follows.he and officer cherry got into an argument on the morning of april.cherry became increasingly agitated,and ultimately instructed officer brown to unlock sides cell.cherry entered sides cell and began striking sides with his fists.immediately after the attack,sides requested medical attention from officers rush and brown,who denied his requests.according to sides,officer juliani also denied medical attention to sides when he requested it later that day.sides claimed he did not receive medical attention until nearly a month later,when a prison physician assistant examined him.he testified as well that he still suffers neck pain from the attack.
the officers also testified at trial.officer cherry stated that sides was agitated and threatening the morning of april,but denied he had entered sides cell or attacked him.officers rush,brown,and juliani also disavowed any knowledge of the incident,and denied that sides had ever requested medical treatment.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.sides filed a motion for a new trial,which the district court summarily denied.he timely appeals to us.
ii.discussion 
physical restraints and the right to a fair trial 
in illinois allen,the supreme court recognized that requiring a criminal defendant to appear in shackles before a jury may result in an unfair trial.as the allen court explained,n ot only is it possible that the sight of shackles might have a significant effect on the jury feelings about the defendant,but the use of th e technique is itself something of an affront to the very dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to uphold.id.at.because shackling a defendant during trial is an inherently prejudicial practice,it should be permitted only where justified by an essential state interest specific to each trial.holbrook flynn,see also deck missouri,noting that the appearance of a criminal defendant in shackles almost inevitably affects adversely the jury perception of the character of the defendant.
several of our sister circuit courts have reasoned that the concerns expressed in allen also apply in the context of civil trials.see davidson riley,cir t he concerns expressed in allen are applicable to parties in civil suits as well.woods thieret,cir t he principles from allen extend to include not just criminal defendants,but inmates bringing civil actions and as well.holloway alexander,cir in prisoner civil rights cases,the district court has a responsibility to ensure reasonable efforts are made to permit the inmate and the inmate witnesses to appear without shackles during proceedings before the jury.tyars finner,cir discussing allen and reasoning that t he likelihood of prejudice inherent in exhibiting the subject of a civil commitment hearing to the jury while bound in physical restraints is simply too great to be countenanced without at least some prior showing of necessity.
we agree with these courts,as fairness in a jury trial,whether criminal or civil in nature,is a vital constitutional right.bailey.innovation,cir see also estelle williams,the right to a fair trial is a fundamental liberty secured by the fourteenth amendment.thus,we join them,and hold that requiring a party in a civil trial to appear in shackles may well deprive him of due process unless the restraints are necessary.davidson,at.we reject the officers argument that,because have no absolute constitutional right to be present during a civil trial,they necessarily do not have a right to appear at such a trial without physical restraints.see lemons skidmore,cir.
abuse of discretion 
we also follow our sister circuits in reviewing for abuse of discretion a district court decision to restrain an inmate physically during a civil trial see davidson,at lemons,at.the principles consistently applied are that the trial court has discretion to order physical restraints on a party or witness when the court has found those restraints to be necessary to maintain safety or security.davidson,at.thus,district courts should balance the prejudice to the against the need to maintain safety or security.woods,at see also davidson,at district courts have a responsibility to determine whether a due process right not to appear before the jury in shackles is outweighed by considerations of security.when a district court determines that restraints are necessary,it should impose no greater restraints than are necessary,and must take steps to minimize the prejudice resulting from the presence of the restraints.davidson,at see also holloway,at when physical restraints are necessary,a district court should take appropriate action to minimize the use of shackles,to cover shackles from the jury view,and to mitigate any potential prejudice through cautionary instructions.
what process should trial courts use to seek the proper balancing of interests at the least,they should hold a proceeding outside the presence of the jury to address the issue with counsel.however,where there are genuine and material factual disputes regarding the threat to courtroom security posed by a,an evidentiary hearing is called for see davidson,at district court abused its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing as to disputed allegations that the was a flight risk see also lemons,at.
in determining whether an inmate should be physically restrained during trial,district courts may rely on a variety of sources,including but not limited to records bearing on the inmate proclivity toward disruptive violent conduct such as the inmate criminal history and prison disciplinary record,and the opinions of correctional law enforcement officers and the federal marshals.woods,at.indeed,though a district court may rely heavily on advice from court security officers,it bears the ultimate responsibility of determining what restraints are necessary,and may not delegate the decision to shackle an inmate to the marshals.see also hameed mann,cir same.thus,when a trial court delegates the shackling decision to court security officers,that is not an exercise of discretion but an absence of and an abuse of discretion.lemons,at.
sides contends that the district court impermissibly delegated to the deputy marshal its authority to determine whether and what physical restraints were necessary,and thus necessarily abused its discretion.we disagree.though the court adopted the deputy marshal advice,it nonetheless acknowledged that the marshal view was only a recommendation and that the court could have the shackles removed.see hameed,at though the court plainly indicated that it relied heavily on the expertise of the prison personnel,it also indicated that the ultimate decision was that of the court.accordingly,this case is not similar to those where a district court has no doubt delegated the shackling decision to security personnel.see davidson,at district court stated that the decision on physical restraints was up to the officers who accompanied the plaintiff,and that it would not do anything different than what they advise lemons,at district court left the decision on physical restraints entirely in the hands of the department of corrections.
that said,it appears from the record we have that the district judge inquiry into the need for physical restraints was limited to an ex parte communication with the deputy marshal.we do not know,for example,whether the deputy marshal disclosed to the judge the basis for sides designation as a category five security risk,his placement in a special needs unit,or the meaning of those classifications.it is also from the assertions of defendants counsel that sides had been a very assaultive inmate and had a track record of misconduct and violence whether the judge inquired as to the particulars of sides criminal history or prison disciplinary record,and whether that history further suggested that sides posed a safety risk during court proceedings.woods,at magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion by ordering inmates shackled during a civil trial where the inmates were undeniably dangerous as evidenced from their criminal records,which include d two murders,numerous armed robberies,rape and aggravated assault.to the extent the district judge chose to defer to the deputy marshal recommendation,we believe he should have received it on the record,thus allowing sides an opportunity to challenge the rationale for that recommendation.see hameed,at district court abused its discretion by,inter alia,relying on ex parte communications from unidentified corrections officials in determining that shackles were necessary.
it is also unclear on this record whether the district judge simply accepted the deputy marshal recommendation without,as sides urged,balancing the need for physical restraints against the potential prejudice to him in determining whether,and to what extent,physical restraints were required.the judge plainly was concerned by the prejudicial effect of shackling sides during trial,and took measures to ameliorate that prejudice.however,he did not explain his reasons for determining that the measures recommended by the deputy,leg irons,and having corrections officers sit directly behind sides throughout the no greater than necessary to secure the courtroom.davidson,at see also woods,at trial judge approved the use of restraints for numerous reasons,including the poor design of the courtroom,which required to travel through the courtroom in close proximity to the bench,counsel tables and jury box to reach the stand the number of five entering and exiting the courtroom and the presence of only one court security officer in the court lemons,at unless the district court discretion is to be absolute and beyond review,the reasons for its exercise must be disclosed in order that a reviewing court may determine if there was an abuse of discretion.quoting united states samuel,cir.on this record,we are unsure whether the court balanced the relevant interests before deciding that sides would be restrained,or considered whether the security measures recommended by the deputy marshal were collectively necessary but not sufficient individually to secure the courtroom.lemons,at a determination that some restraints are appropriate does not mean that and handcuffs are required.
for example,it appears that even the deputy marshal did not believe sides posed such a security risk that it was necessary he be restrained in handcuffs and leg irons at all times.indeed,both the deputy marshal and the district court agreed that it was unnecessary for sides to be shackled when he testified from the witness stand,where he presumably was in far closer proximity to the jury and the judge than while seated at the plaintiff table.
moreover,we are troubled that sides testified while wearing handcuffs and leg irons,despite the reminder of sides counsel shortly before sides testified to the court of its prior direction to dispense with shackling during his testimony.in that light,we stress that where a district court has found certain preventive measures advisable to reduce the prejudice to a who
