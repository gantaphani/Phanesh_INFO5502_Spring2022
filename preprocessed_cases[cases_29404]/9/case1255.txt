background 
shabaka shakur filed a pro se complaint in the united states district court for the western district of new york.he was and remains in the custody of the new york state department of correctional services docs.shakur appeals from the district court dismissal of his complaint.the following are the facts as alleged in the complaint.see,ortiz mcbride,cir.
the christmas eve confiscation,
in,shakur spent christmas eve in a special housing unit shu at great meadows correctional facility as the subject of a facility investigation.defendant hurlburt,a great meadows correctional officer,searched shakur property and discovered and then confiscated books and pamphlets of new afrikan political literature,which he characterized as nubian gang materials.on christmas day,shakur received an inmate misbehavior report charging him with possession of gang material s in violation of docs institutional rule of conduct.rule provides that i nmates shall not possess or use unauthorized organizational insignia or materials.regs.tit,b iii.an unauthorized organization,under rule,is any gang or any organization which has not been approved by the deputy commissioner for program services.id.
shakur was given a hearing by defendant dolan,a great meadows correctional officer,on the rule charge.hurlburt testified that the confiscated materials were and shakur argued that they were simply political tracts and were not.dolan found that the materials referred to a revolutionary organization designed to create and mobilize a war movement.he then determined that the organization was not authorized by docs and thus found shakur guilty of a rule violation,imposing a penalty of months in shu.shakur appealed the disposition to defendant selsky,the docs director of special housing,who decreased the penalty to months.
during his hearing,shakur requested that dolan forward the confiscated materials to great meadow facility media review committee fmrc,a committee that reviews inmate literature pursuant to established guidelines.regs.tit.new york regulations provide that i t is departmental policy to encourage inmates to read publications from varied sources,id.a,but that w hen there is a good faith belief that a publication in the possession of an inmate violates one or more of the media review guidelines,said publication shall be confiscated and referred to the fmrc for review and decision,id.b.neither dolan nor selsky referred shakur materials to the fmrc.
the january,confiscation 
two years later,on january,defendant foley,a correctional officer at the attica correctional facility,searched shakur he found and confiscated materials he characterized as a new afrikan self development program.shakur again requested that these materials be sent to the fmrc foley declined to do so.instead,foley filed a report charging shakur with a second rule violation.
defendant lomanto,a lieutenant,gave shakur a hearing on this second rule charge,determined that shakur materials were from a group that is not authorized,and found shakur in violation of the rule,imposing a penalty of thirty days in keeplock.shakur appealed the disposition on the grounds that foley had failed to send the materials to the fmrc,that rule did not apply to his literature,and that rule was unconstitutionally vague.defendant conway,first deputy superintendent at attica,found no error in the hearing.shakur then filed an article petition.see consol.the new york supreme court,appellate division,confirmed the docs determination and dismissed the petition.see matter of shakur goord,dep t.
the eid ul fitr feast,
shakur also contends that he was prevented from attending an important religious feast held at attica on january.shakur does not name the religious feast in his complaint,but on appeal claims that it was eid ul fitr.shakur asserts that he was scheduled to attend but that defendant beyler,an attica officer,prevented him from participating in the feast and from receiving a required meal.shakur filed a grievance with the inmate grievance resolution committee and asked that beyler malicious and intentional failure to perform his duties be reprimanded.the committee found that beyler should have released shakur for the event.conway reversed that finding and the central officer review committee affirmed conway determination.
the summer confiscations and fmrc review,
in july,defendant stack,a correctional officer at attica,searched shakur cell and confiscated pages of additional new afrikan materials that he characterized as unauthorized gang materials.shakur requested that the materials be sent to the fmrc and stack refused.stack charged shakur with a third rule violation.
defendant sticht,a captain at attica,gave shakur a hearing on this third rule charge.shakur argued that the materials should be sent to the fmrc and requested that stack appear as a witness.sticht adjourned the hearing to review the materials and to secure stack appearance.upon reconvening the hearing,sticht found shakur guilty of violating rule.sticht found that the new afrikan program literature talks about overthrow ing and liberat ing parts of the for th e group own country,and that the group was not authorized by docs and is therefore an unauthorized group.sticht imposed a penalty of days in keeplock.selsky affirmed the disposition.
in august,foley again searched shakur property,found more new afrikan literature,and confiscated it.foley ordered shakur to destroy the literature,but shakur refused and requested that it be sent to the fmrc.the sergeant on shakur block granted the request.the fmrc reviewed these materials,found that three pages contained drawings that would incite disobedience and violence,and approved the remainder of the literature.the materials were returned to shakur with the objectionable portions redacted.
shakur complaint 
shakur filed a complaint in late november.on the basis of the above factual recitation,shakur alleged,inter alia,violations of the freedom of speech clause of the first amendment the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and both the free exercise clause of the first amendment and rluipa.shakur complaint contained other claims not the subject of this appeal.the district court dismissed shakur complaint with prejudice sua sponte pursuant to before the service of process on any defendant.the district court explained the reasons for its dismissal in an opinion dated december.
the district court first considered shakur claim that defendants violated what shakur characterized as his rights to freedom of political expression and to hold and express political beliefs.shakur alleged that defendants violated these rights by improperly confiscating his new afrikan political literature.the district court disagreed.it noted that t he new african organization,also known as the new african liberation movement nalm,is a group which has been identified as an unauthorized organization by docs,and this identification by docs has been upheld in federal court as reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.citing duamutef moran,wl,pooler,duamutef i and duamutef hollins,cir duamutef ii,the court held that it has already been settled that the limitations imposed in the new york state prison system on written materials related to the new african liberation movement comport with first amendment requirements.
the district court then considered shakur claim that defendants denied him due process.the court held that t o the extent the claim is that the materials should have be sic reviewed by the fmrc,the claim fails because docs had already determined that the new african organization is not authorized,and thus the possession of any written materials related to it are,a priori,a violation of prison rules.the court held further that t o the extent that plaintiff claims to have been deprived of written materials in which he has a property interest,such a deprivation was not without due process of law because new york provides an adequate remedy in the form of an article proceeding.
the district court also examined shakur equal protection claim.shakur alleged that defendants in subjecting plaintiff to continuous searches,confiscations and punishment in clear disregard to plaintiffs sic constitutional rights evidence a pattern of political and racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the amendment.the district court found that shakur failed to allege either that other inmates who possessed materials related to an unauthorized organization were treated differently than he or that defendants had disciplined him based on impermissible considerations.the court thus found no ground for an equal protection claim.
finally,the district court considered shakur claim that beyler violated shakur right to freely exercise his religious belief by preventing him from attending the january religious feast that shakur now contends was eid ul fitr.the district court cited ford mcginnis,d,for the proposition that a denial of a single religious meal is a de minimis burden on the free exercise of religions and,as such,is not of constitutional dimension.the court likewise concluded that the fact that shakur missed a single religious feast simply does not amount to a substantial burden on his religious exercise under rluipa.accordingly,the court concluded that shakur failed to state a claim for a violation of either the free exercise clause of the first amendment or rluipa.
the district court entered an order dismissing shakur complaint with prejudice.shakur filed a notice of appeal and moved for in forma pauperis status.this court granted shakur motion and assigned pro bono counsel the office of the attorney general of the state of the new york submitted a brief as amicus curiae.
discussion 
we review the district court dismissal of shakur complaint de novo.see liner goord,cir.section provides 
a court shall review,before docketing,if feasible or,in any event,as soon as practicable after docketing,a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.
b grounds for review,the court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint,or any portion of the complaint,if the complaint 
is frivolous,malicious,or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted 
the court also cited e b ii as a statutory predicate for its dismissal of the complaint.section governs proceedings in forma pauperis,while appl ies to all civil complaints brought by prisoners against governmental officials or entities regardless of whether the prisoner has paid a filing fee.carr dvorin,cir per curiam.sections and recite identical grounds for dismissal,compare b with e b i ii,and we have found both sections applicable to prisoner proceedings in forma pauperis,see,giano goord,cir applying carr,at applying mceachin mcguinnis,cir applying both.
we limit our review here to.the supreme court has held that the version of did not permit dismissals with prejudice,see denton hernandez,d,and the fourth and seventh circuits have applied that rule to the present,see nagy butner,cir see also gladney pendleton corr.facility,cir.we see no need to resolve that question at this time as permits dismissals with prejudice.although the supreme court has not commented on in this regard,both the seventh and circuits agree that authorizes dismissals with prejudice.see gladney,at davis district of columbia.we have already tacitly held as much,see liner,at,and now abide by that precedent.
no portion of a complaint stating a claim upon which relief may be granted should be dismissed by the screening mechanism of.this sufficiency authorizes a court to dismiss a claim on the basis of a dispositive issue of law.neitzke williams,d discussing standard of federal rule of civil procedure b.it operates without regard to whether a claim is based on an outlandish legal theory or on a close but ultimately unavailing one.id.at.the settled rule is that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.mceachin,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether a claim is legally sufficient,we accept all of the facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in the plaintiff favor.larkin savage,cir per curiam.further,when the plaintiff proceeds pro se,as in this case,a court is obliged to construe his pleadings liberally,particularly when they allege civil rights violations.mceachin,at.liberally construing shakur complaint,we find his free expression,free exercise,and rluipa claims to be legally sufficient,and vacate the district court dismissal with regard to those claims.
however,we find that shakur due process allegations fail to state a claim on which relief may be granted moreover,we find them frivolous.a claim is frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.neitzke,at.section does not require that process be served or that the plaintiff be provided an opportunity to respond before the dismissal of a frivolous claim.carr,at.accordingly,we affirm the district court sua sponte dismissal with regard to shakur due process claim.
the freedom of speech claim 
shakur first claim is that the defendants violated his constitutional right to free expression.reading shakur complaint liberally,we find the complaint alleges that rule is unconstitutional,and in the alternative,that rule did not authorize defendants confiscations,and,accordingly,that such confiscations were improperly made for reasons of personal prejudice as opposed to legitimate penological interests.we hold that shakur states a legally sufficient first amendment claim.
a prison inmate retains those first amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.giano senkowski,cir senkowski.the governing standard is one of reasonableness benjamin coughlin,cir.w hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner safley,d.the bears the burden of proving that a disputed regulation is unreasonable.senkowski,at.
the reasonableness of a prison regulation is measured by the analysis outlined by the supreme court in turner,at.see allen coughlin,cir.first,we ask whether the governmental objective underlying the regulations at issue is legitimate and neutral,and whether the regulations are rationally related to that objective.thornburgh abbott,d.second,we look to see whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.third,we examine the impact that accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on others guards and inmates in the prison.id.at.
the first turner factor is multifold.id.at.a governmental objective must be legitimate and neutral.id.conduct expressly aimed at protecting prison security is legitimate beyond question and is in fact central to all other correctional goals.id.at.quoting pell procunier,d.as for neutrality,w here prison administrators draw distinctions between publications solely on the basis of their potential implications for prison security,the regulations are neutral in the technical sense id.at.however,where regulations fairly invite prison officials and employees to apply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards for prisoner censorship,they are decidedly not neutral in the relevant sense.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
a legitimate and neutral governmental objective must be rationally related to a challenged course of action.id.at.where the regulations at issue concern publications in prison,a regulation which gives prison authorities broad discretion is appropriate.id.at.it is rational to censor any materials found to create an intolerable risk of disorder under the conditions of a particular prison at a particular time.id.at.the supreme court has permitted censorship of such materials where the censorship occurred via individualized review.see id.
the second turner prong cautions that,when other avenues for exercising an asserted right remain available,courts should defer to the informed discretion of prison officials to gauge the validity of the regulation.senkowski,at.the right in question must be viewed sensibly and expansively,thornburgh,at,to allow for flexibility in determining what qualifies as another means of expression,senkowski,at.as far as the regulation of free expression is concerned,a regulation can not deprive prisoners of all means of expression,turner,at,and must leave effective means for substitutable exercises of expression,see allen,at.but,generally,if a regulation permit s a broad range of publications to be read,this factor is clearly satisfied.thornburgh,at.
under the third and final turner factor,the supreme court has instructed that,w here the right in question can be exercised only at the cost of significantly less liberty and safety for everyone else,guards and other prisoners alike,the courts should defer to the informed discretion of corrections officials.id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.however,the existence of obvious,easy alternatives may be evidence that the regulation is not reasonable.turner,at.while there is no requirement that prison officials adopt the least restrictive alternative to their preferred policy,senkowski,at,if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard,turner,at.the degree to which the cost of an alternative is burdensome is an issue of fact allen,at.
shakur has stated a legally sufficient claim that defendants confiscation of his new afrikan political literature violated the first amendment.the complaint in this case is akin to the complaint in thomas scully,cir per curiam.in thomas,the plaintiff challenged a prison confiscation of nude photographs of his girlfriend.id.at.this court later upheld similar confiscations in senkowski,at,as reasonable under turner.however,in thomas,we concluded that,whatever its merit,the complaint did state a claim on which relief could be granted.at.the distinction between thomas and senkowski is that senkowski came to us on summary judgment rather than on a dismissal for failure to state a legally sufficient claim.at the point of summary judgment,plaintiff had been able to assemble evidence to attempt to meet his burden of proof,see senkowski,at,and defendants had been able to articulate rationales for the policy,see id.at.this court could thus find the government explanation valid and rational,see id.at,and hold that the plaintiff could not meet his burden of proof,see id.at.the holding of thomas,by contrast,indicates that we would not reach such a conclusion on the face of the complaint alone thomas,at.likewise,although we are unable now to determine whether the challenged conduct is reasonable or not,we hold that shakur has stated a claim on which relief may be granted.
defendants predicated their confiscations on rule.that rule distinguishes between authorized and unauthorized organizations.regs.tit,b iii.an unauthorized organization is any gang or any organization which has not been approved by the deputy commissioner for program services.id.rule prohibits the possession of unauthorized organizational insignia or materials.id.defendants classified shakur new afrikan political literature as unauthorized organizational materials.
on its face,rule appears to ban all literature from outside organizations,unless those organizations have been approved by the deputy commissioner.this regulation would sweep more broadly than the regulations upheld in turner,thornbugh,senkowski,and allen.an exclusion of materials of unauthorized organizations may not be rationally related to any governmental objective.assuming that rule is targeted at the legitimate goal of securing prisons,we are not sure how a complete ban on the materials of unauthorized organizations is rationally related to that goal.the district court articulated no such relationship,and none appears to us on the face of the regulation.
moreover,supreme court precedent suggests that rule may be too broad to meet the turner standard.in thornburgh,the supreme court upheld the facial validity of a prison regulation permitting the warden to reject publications pursuant to articulated standards.at.the court noted that it was comforted by the individualized nature of the determinations required by the regulation,and that the regulations expressly reject ed certain shortcuts that would lead to needless exclusions.id.at.emphases added.rule,by contrast,does not provide any standard against which docs officials will conduct an individualized review of the publication in question.
indeed,the needless exclusions apparently made possible by rule exceed even the exclusions that the supreme court suggested would be unconstitutional in thornburgh.in thornburgh,the supreme court cited with approval a regulation prohibiting the establishment of an excluded list of subscription publications,suggesting that the shortcut of listing banned publications would lead to needless exclusions.id.at.the shortcut in thornburgh would,by default,subject the universe of publications to individualized review,and ban only a discrete set of enumerated publications.rule appears to take a much more serious shortcut.it seems to ban all the publications of unlisted organizations and allow only a discrete set of enumerated organizational materials.this shortcut greatly circumscribes the universe of reading materials accessible to inmates.it thus appears that rule ban is not sufficiently related to any legitimate and neutral penological objective.
the second prong of turner may also support shakur.at this point,we do not know what alternative avenues exist by which shakur might exercise his right to free expression.defendants were never served in this case and,consequently,have not been asked to explain the range of materials available to shakur.nor do we know how rule has been applied we do not know how many materials are considered to be organizational materials,how many organizations are authorized,or how difficult it is to obtain such authorization.thus,we can not say that this prong weighs in favor of dismissal.
most clearly,the third turner prong supports shakur argument.there is an obvious alternative in this case.as shakur has continually pointed out,docs has established an fmrc in every correctional institution.the purpose of the fmrc is to review inmates reading materials.shakur thus points to evidence that docs might be able to accommodate shakur rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.turner,at.indeed,his final confiscation was subjected to fmrc review,with no obvious harm to penological interests.while we recognize that forcing an individualized fmrc review of materials might put a strain on prison resources,allen counsels that the nature of those costs is an issue of fact.see allen,at.in the absence of a determination that the costs are claim that is somewhat unlikely given that fmrc review procedures are already in third prong weighs in shakur favor.thus,with regard to
