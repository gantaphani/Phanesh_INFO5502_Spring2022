racial stigmas and stereotypes are not impairing unless we internalize them.and there is no reason for us to do that when we know that the history of black culture in america is rich and reaffirming.we may live in a society that will only grudgingly and inconsistently acknowledge our equality,but that does not mean that we must live as if we are victims.i understand that avoiding the effects of racial stigmas and stereotyping is not always easy because many studies have shown that most people harbor implicit biases and even people unknowingly act on racist attitudes.however,this merely confirms that we alone can not carry the burden of ameliorating racism in our country.this responsibility must be assumed by all good people without regard to race,sex,and ethnicity.
this appeal requires us to consider whether it is plausible to believe that,in century america,a municipal government may seek to contract with a enterprise under some conditions,yet,on account of race,avoid contracting with a company under other conditions.
in april,black network television ad agency,llc bnt,a television network,was granted and then subsequently denied a economic development loan from the city of greensboro,north carolina the city,prompting bnt to file this action asserting a claim,among others,for racial discrimination pursuant to.the city argued,in support of its motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,that its willingness to grant bnt a loan fully secured by a lien on the personal residence of bnt principals,notwithstanding its unwillingness to grant bnt a loan fully secured by a lien on that residence,foreclosed a claim of race discrimination as a matter of law.bnt responded that,to the contrary,the city refusal to make the loan was based upon stereotypes about the risk of lending to a minority business and that,at the pleading stage,its allegations suggesting the pretextual character of the city explanation for the denial of the loan are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court agreed with the city arguments,concluded that bnt factual allegations were so insubstantial as to render its claim implausible,and therefore dismissed the complaint with prejudice 
we hold that the district court crabbed plausibility analysis,see woods city of greensboro,wl,at,misinterpreted and misapplied the controlling pleading standard.the key issue in this case is not whether the city would contract with a business,but whether the city would contract with bnt on the same conditions and under substantially the same circumstances as it would with a business.because bnt has plausibly pled that the conditions under which the city was willing to grant it a loan were more stringent than those the city applied to similarly situated applicants,we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing bnt claim of discrimination at the pleading stage.accordingly,for the reasons explained within,we reverse the district court order dismissing this action and remand for further proceedings.
we begin by summarizing the cardinal facts surrounding bnt application for,and the city ultimate denial of,the economic development loan.additional factual allegations are discussed infra pp.throughout,we consider as true all allegations in the complaint,matters of public record,and documents attached to the motion to dismiss that are integral to the complaint and of unquestioned authenticity.philips pitt cty.mem l,cir.
in april,members of the city economic and business development office recommended that michael and ramona woods referred to by the parties,and hence herein,as the woods submit an application for a economic development loan for their company,bnt,as part of the city economic development efforts.the woods offered to secure the loan by way of a note and deed of trust to their home.on may,appraisals,appraised the home at a value of resulting in equity well over the loan,after consideration of all existing loans on the residence.
pursuant to greensboro code of ordinances section,the city may make economic development loans only after receiving authorization from its elected city council.on june,at a regularly scheduled meeting,the city council considered a resolution authorizing the city to enter into a loan agreement with bnt.the resolution,which was drafted by the greensboro city attorney office,stated that the city interest would be secured by no more than a second lien on the real property and improvements.assistant city manager of economic development,andy scott,discussed with the city council in open session the financial statements of the woods and the collateral requirements of the proposed loan agreement and stated to the council that the city would be placed in the second loan position on the residence being used as collateral.the city council voted seven to two in favor of adopting resolution,which authorized the city to enter into an agreement with bnt for the loan.the resolution provided the following conditions 
whereas,the borrower is required to confirm compliance with the following conditions prior to the city loan closing to protect the public funds invested in the project 
city will complete a title search confirming no additional liens are outstanding on the carlson dairy road property that will secure the city loan beyond the first mortgage that is currently outstanding.
city will confirm that the first mortgage balance does not exceed.
city loan will be secured by a note and deed of trust with the city interest secured by no more than a lien on the real property and improvements located at carlson dairy road.
now,therefore,be it resolved by the city council of the city of greensboro 
the city of greensboro is hereby authorized to execute the necessary note and agreements with bnt ad agency llc in accordance with the above terms and conditions.
as it turned out,in addition to a first mortgage,the woods had a home equity line of credit on the property.the city informed the woods that the resolution would have to be amended to reflect that the city security interest would be a third lien,rather than a second lien.on july,at a second meeting,the city council considered modifying the resolution.according to the minutes,the following occurred 
assistant city manager of economic development andy scott summarized the difference between the approved loan at the june council meeting and the modifications made in the presented resolution and spoke to the financial assessment of the woods collateral in terms of loan repayment.
council discussed the capped equity limits by carolina bank referenced three previous loans where the city had been in the third position the desire to support minority owned small businesses and concerns expressed about the city going from second to the third position in loan repayment.
city attorney shah khan advised that if council chose to move forward with the transaction,it would be necessary to comply with the changes with what council was now aware of and stated the decision was a policy matter for council.
mayor perkins stated there were speakers to the item.
george hartzman,stated there was not enough equity in the property to fund the city portion of a potentially defaulted loan and encouraged council to respect their fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers.
scott stated there was sufficient collateral in the house based on the appraisal to support the loan.
ramona woods stated she had not intended to not disclose her loan positions commented on ashtae products sic role in the black network television and provided a status report on marketing the television show.
mayor perkins clarified that the former resolution stated that the city would not take worse than a second mortgage.
the city council then voted not to modify the resolution to make a loan secured by a lien,but left in effect the original resolution and its terms.subsequently,on february,the city council officially revoked the resolution authorizing the city to enter into a loan agreement with bnt.
the woods and bnt filed suit in federal district court alleging violations of,and,the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment and the north carolina constitution,as well as state law claims for breach of contract,civil conspiracy,and unfair and deceptive trade practices.the district court dismissed all of the woods and bnt claims.see woods,wl,at.the court dismissed all claims asserted against the city and the councilmembers in their individual capacities on the basis of legislative immunity.id.at.the court dismissed the breach of contract,due process,conspiracy,and claim for failure to state a cause of action.id.at.
the court considered together the plaintiffs claims that the city discriminated against them on the basis of race by failing to modify the terms of the resolution to provide bnt a loan.id.at.the court first concluded that the woods and bnt did not have standing to assert discrimination claims on the alleged facts.id.at.the court also concluded that the plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege discrimination based upon race.id.at.specifically,the court reasoned that the plaintiffs failed to allege the existence of valid comparators,which in its view was essential to allegations of intentional disparate treatment.id.at.the court also reasoned that it could not infer an intent to discriminate where the initial resolution was approved in part because plaintiffs are minorities.woods,wl,at.
bnt,alone,timely appealed the court dismissal of its claim that the city discriminated against it in violation of.
we first address bnt appeal of the district court determination that it lacked standing to assert a claim under.we review this question of law de novo.frank krasner,montgomery,cir.there being no dispute in this case as to whether the requirements of a constitutional case or controversy are present,the sole issue here is whether both bnt itself and its particular claim fall within the zone of interest protected by.see lexmark int l,static control components,d see also bank of am.city of miami,d,wl may,holding that the city of miami claimed injuries at least arguably fell within the zone of interest protected under the fair housing act.
the district court reasoned that under our decision in carnell construction corporation danville redevelopment housing authority,cir.certification appears to be a requirement for standing in the fourth circuit and,as a result,bnt lacked standing to bring a racial discrimination claim.woods,wl,at.we conclude that the district court erred in this regard.
section protects all persons from racial discrimination in making and enforcing contracts.in thinket ink information resources,sun microsystems,the ninth circuit explained that although a corporation is not a person,it may acquire standing under if it has acquired an imputed racial identity,cir.when a corporation either suffers discrimination harm cognizable under,or has acquired an imputed racial identity,it is sufficiently within the statutory zone of interest to have prudential standing to bring an action under.id.at in thinket,the plaintiff was a technology services contractor certified by the united states small business administration as a firm owned and operated by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,eligible to receive federal contracts under the sba business development program.id.at.each of the plaintiff shareholders was african american.id.the thinket court found that under these circumstances,the corporation had acquired an imputed racial identity.id.at.
in carnell,we adopted the thinket approach,holding that if a corporation has acquired an imputed racial identity,it falls within the statutory zone of interest and may bring an action under.carnell,at carnell held that a corporation that is and has been properly certified as such under applicable law can be the direct object of discriminatory action and establish standing to bring an action based on such discrimination.id.however,carnell holding was more limited than the district court analysis in this case suggests.carnell did not state that standing was available only to a corporation that had been certified.carnell was certified by the commonwealth of virginia as a small,women and minority owned business because its president and sole shareholder is african american.id.emphasis added.in addition,the carnell court noted that carnell publicly represented itself as a minority business enterprise when it contracted to work with the housing authority.id.
other cases make clear that certification is not a requirement to establish standing under.
circumstances in which a corporate entity may bring suit under section include cases in which a corporation is owned entirely by shareholders of a single race,cases in which a corporation has acquired a protected identity pursuant to a government designation,or cases in which a corporation is established for the very purpose of advancing minority interests 
new louisiana holdings,llc arrowsmith,wl,at,internal citations omitted surveying case law.other courts have interpreted the holding from thinket to depend on the identity of the shareholders or owners and not any government designation or certification.see bains,llc arco products,cir.holding that a corporation acquires an imputed racial identity from its shareholders amber pyramid,buffington harbor riverboats,fed app x,cir.same see also contemporary personnel,godiva chocolatier,wl at,while courts have adopted the imputed racial identity concept from trinket sic,those courts have only found corporations to have an imputed racial identity when the owner,majority of shareholders president are members of a specific class that is alleged to have been discriminated against.
in this case,the operative complaint alleges that bnt is entirely owned and led by a protected minority group and represented itself as a minority business enterprise when it sought to contract with the city.see,bnt is a limited liability company.while bnt does not allege that it was certified as such under the law of north carolina,it need not do so in order to establish standing we hold that the district court erred because bnt has set forth sufficient factual allegations to establish an imputed racial identity,which confers standing to assert a racial discrimination claim under.
we next review the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see fed.civ.b.we review dismissals under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo.du pont de nemours kolon,cir.
as a preliminary matter,the parties dispute the correct pleading standard.bnt argues that it has sufficiently pleaded a race discrimination claim and that it was not required to plead a prima facie case.appellant br.bnt relies on swierkiewicz sorema,d,which explained that the prima facie case is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.the city does not dispute that bnt need not establish a prima facie case,but argues that bnt relies on a superseded pleading standard articulated in conley gibson,d.appellee br.
in swierkiewicz,the plaintiff alleged discrimination based on his age and national origin in violation of the age discrimination in employment act of and title vii of the civil rights act of.at.swierkiewicz was a hungarian native employed by sorema as a senior vice president and chief underwriting officer.id.at.according to swierkiewicz,the ceo demoted him and gave many of his duties to a french national.id.the district and appellate courts found that swierkiewicz had not adequately alleged circumstances that support an inference of discrimination,but the supreme court held that an employment discrimination plaintiff need not plead a prima facie case of discrimination to survive a motion to dismiss,id.at,because t he prima facie case is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement,id.at.the court explained that applying mcdonnell douglas to rule b motions would establish a heightened pleading standard in contravention of rule a.id.at.see also fed.civ.a providing that a plaintiff need only state a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.as further support,the swierkiewicz court cited the pleading standard as articulated in conley gibson,which required the plaintiff need only provide fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.see also conley gibson,d.
in bell atlantic twombly,the supreme court announced a new pleading standard,d abrogating the conley standard.twombly required that allegations must be more than conclusory.id.at.in addition,under twombly,allegations must be sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,id.at,including sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face,id.at.this requires that the plaintiff do more than plead facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability the facts alleged must allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting twombly,at.
in iqbal,the court made clear that this heightened standard applied to all civil actions,including claims of discrimination.id.at.the iqbal court considered allegations that the government discriminated against a pakistani man detained by federal officials in new york city following the september attacks.id.at.iqbal brought claims against attorney general john ashcroft and fbi director robert mueller,arguing that they had adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race,religion,or national origin.id.a majority of the supreme court deemed iqbal claims of discrimination implausible in light of the fact that the september attacks were perpetrated by arab muslim hijackers.id.as between that obvious alternative explanation for the arrests,and the purposeful,invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer,discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.id.at.quoting twombly,at.citation omitted.iqbal allegations had not nudged his claims of invidious discrimination across the line from conceivable to plausible,id.at.alteration in original quoting twombly,at.
following the supreme court decisions in iqbal and twombly,we of course have had several occasions to explicate the new pleading standards.we did so,for example,in an employment discrimination case,mccleary evans maryland department of transportation,cir,in which the plaintiff,an african american woman,alleged that a state agency discriminated against her when it refused to hire her.in support,she stated that she was a qualified applicant and that she was denied a position in favor of someone who was white.id.at.she did not offer any comparison between herself and the individual who was hired.id.at.a majority of the panel found that mccleary evans allegations were fatally conclusory without additional facts to support a reasonable inference that the decisionmakers were motivated by race.to be sure,the court explained,swierkiewicz remained binding precedent and the plaintiff was not required to plead facts establishing a prima facie case of discrimination to survive a motion to dismiss.id.at.the court further reasoned,however,that a plaintiff is nonetheless required to allege facts to satisfy the elements of a cause of action created by the relevant statute in compliance with iqbal.id.applying this standard,the mccleary evans court wrote t he defendant decision to select someone other than her,and the cause that she asks us to infer,invidious discrimination is not plausible in light of the obvious alternative explanation that the decisionmakers simply judged those hired to be more qualified and better suited for the positions.id.at quoting iqbal,at.
the correct application of the above principles is straightforward.bnt need not plead facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination to survive a motion to dismiss,but as the city argues,the more stringent pleading standard established in iqbal and twombly applies,not the superseded standard that bnt cited in its brief.see twombly.at.reaffirming swierkiewicz francis giacomelli,cir.the pleading standard that the plaintiffs quoted from swierkiewicz,however,was explicitly overruled in twombly.
finally,we consider whether bnt has offered sufficient factual allegations to support a plausible claim that the city acted,pretextually,on the basis of insufficient security or,perhaps put differently,on the basis of an arguably irrational insistence on taking a second lien position without regard for the level of security supporting the requested loan or,instead,actually on the basis of race.at this stage,bnt need only allege sufficient factual matter taken as true to suggest a cognizable cause of action.twombly,at.
bnt argues that the city council refused to modify the terms of the resolution to allow defendant greensboro to take a third,but fully secured,position for discriminatory reasons.unlike the allegations before the court in mccleary evans,bnt pleaded allegations beyond a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully,iqbal,at.bnt allegations include the results of a disparity study demonstrating a pattern of the city almost exclusively lending to businesses facts which suggest that the woods residence had sufficient equity to fully secure a lien and examples of how the city has treated nonminority businesses differently,including taking a lien in approving a loan to a nonminority corporation.taken together,we hold that these allegations are more than sufficient to nudge bnt claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.twombly,at.
first,bnt alleges that a june disparity study for the business enterprise program demonstrates that of million in economic development expenditures,less than or was disbursed to minority businesses,despite the fact that the city is over african american.appellant br.this court may infer discriminatory intent from evidence of a general pattern of racial discrimination in the practices of a defendant.moore city of charlotte,nc,cir.reynolds abbeville county school district,cir.in this case,the june study of racial disparities in contracting by the city necessarily informs this court common sense analysis of whether bnt allegations are plausible.iqbal,at.
second,bnt alleges that,as a practical matter,there was no difference in risk between a lien and lien because there was sufficient equity in the property to fully secure the city loan under either condition.this does not seem to be in dispute and,in fact,was stated in the open session during the july city council meeting.but even if it could be disputed at some appropriate stage of these proceedings,this case had not arrived at that stage when the district court dismissed the case.we do not doubt that there may yet be sound,rational reasons why the city has insisted that it must take no worse than a second lien position in these circumstances,but again,that kind of factual exploration must await discovery and,if appropriate,summary judgment proceedings.however sound the city position may be,there is nothing on the face of the city position that is material to bnt claim of pretext.
whether the city nondiscriminatory explanation for rejecting the position is in fact pretext is a question to be analyzed under the shifting burdens regime of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and not under rule b.still,under iqbal and twombly,the court must consider the plausibility of inferring discrimination based on bnt allegations in light of an obvious alternative explanation for the conduct.iqbal,at.in other words,while bnt need not establish a prima facie case at this stage,as discussed supra in part,we must be satisfied that the city explanation for rejecting the loan does not render bnt allegations implausible.
viewed in the light most favorable to bnt,the operative complaint contains allegations of fact which undermine the city explanation for rejecting the loan,in particular the allegation that there was sufficient equity to secure the loan whether the second or third lien condition applied.the city has not yet disputed this allegation for it has yet to file its answer to the complaint.there may well be,of course,other reasons that the city decided to deny the loan,such as a general unwillingness to change the terms of a resolution once it has been adopted,or perhaps a concern that bnt had failed to disclose important information,the existence of the second lien.the question is not whether there are more likely explanations for the city action,however,but whether the city impliedly proffered reason that a lien presented too great a risk is so obviously an irrefutably sound and unambiguously nondiscriminatory and explanation that it renders bnt claim of pretext implausible.see houck substitute tr,cir.criticizing substitution of a probability standard for plausibility standard.we discern no such weakness in the inferences to be drawn based on the factual allegations here.
third,and even if the above considerations were deemed insufficient to nudge the claim over the plausibility threshold,bnt actually alleges particular examples of how the city has treated similarly situated white businesses differently.bnt alleges that the city accepted liens as collateral in other contemporary deals with nonminority firms.specifically,in january,the city council voted to give an loan to kotis holdings,a nonminority developer,which was secured by a lien on a private residence.
bnt also alleges that the city was generally more willing to afford accommodating treatment to companies.according to bnt allegations taken as true,the city provided nonminority company gerbing a grant without amending its policy to create a new incentive program.in another example,mel pressure washing,a nonminority company,received in business over a period without any contract on record or a bid approval for the work that was done.in addition,bnt alleges that the city entered into other deals with nonminority businesses that had a history of default,and therefore carried greater default risks.for example,the city allegedly provided a forgivable loan to a nonminority borrower,self help,as well as a second installment of to greensboro parking group,llc,a nonminority company that had defaulted in the past.bnt also alleges that the city converted the nussbaum center for entrepreneurship loan into a grant,despite the fact that it had defaulted on two initial loans.bnt asserts it had no such history or suggested risk of default,and that the city refusal to modify its resolution,despite its continued willingness to work with defaulted nonminority entities,evidences disparate treatment based on race.these allegations support an inference of disparate treatment at this stage.
there yet more.bnt alleges that the city has backed out of commitments to other minority companies,but does not treat white companies this way.in support of this assertion,bnt alleges that in,the city council attempted to renege on a million dollar loan given to the international civil rights museum,relying on a technicality that the documents on the loan were never signed,despite the fact that the city had already paid out of the loan.the civil rights museum interim chairwoman,deena hayes,stated that there seems to be a higher standard when it comes to the city lending to african american companies.
the district court reasoned that many of the allegedly similarly situated businesses proffered by bnt are not valid comparators.woods,wl,at.the court further reasoned that the specific security position of the city is a financial decision that is not immediately subject to drawing inferences of racial discrimination within the context of minority promotion.id.this amounts to fact finding,not the conduct of a common sense plausibility analysis.
so viewed,we decline to credit this reasoning.while differences exist between the facts alleged in the case at bar and each of the comparative exemplars that bnt offers,as would be expected,evidentiary determinations regarding whether the comparators features are sufficiently similar to constitute appropriate comparisons generally should not be made at this point.see swierkiewicz,at.challenges to the merits of a plaintiff claim should be dealt with through summary judgment under rule see generally charles sullivan lauren walter,employment discrimination law practice e.the similarly situated analysis typically occurs in the context of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,not at the b stage.haywood locke,cir.at this point,bnt has pleaded sufficient facts to justify an inference,plausibly and reasonably indulged,that the city treated it differently from the way it has treated nonminority businesses under arguably similar circumstances,and that it did so on account of race.
central to the district court analysis was its conclusion that since the initial resolution was approved in part because bnt principals are minorities,it is implausible that they were later denied a loan because of the same consideration.id.at.we disagree.we break no new ground in observing that it is not implausible that the city was willing to contract with bnt on one set of terms,but,on account of race,it was unwilling to contract with bnt on another set of terms,although nonminority firms might meet with approval under both regimes.
a claim similar to bnt was recognized in williams staples,cir.the plaintiff,williams,brought a claim of discrimination after he was prevented from purchasing a printer cartridge at a staples office supply and photocopying store.id.at.when williams presented a check,the clerk informed him that staples did not accept checks.id.later that day,a white customer was permitted to make a purchase using an check.id.at.the disparate treatment was replicated by a black and white tester.id.we concluded that williams had presented sufficient evidence to establish that staples refusal to take his check was a pretext for unlawful discrimination in violation of,id.at,even though staples would sell to black customers if they did not use checks.invidious discrimination steeped in racial stereotyping is no less corrosive of the achievement of equality than invidious discrimination rooted in other mental states.
we have previously admonished district courts,albeit in unpublished,decisions,that imposing unique burdens or stereotypical expectations on an individual based on her membership in a protected group is illicit discrimination,even though the defendant may not discriminate consistently against every woman or minority under all conditions.see,wagner dillard dep t stores,cir.per curiam affirming a district court decision finding that an employer stereotypical assumption that pregnant women will eventually require substantial absences from work violated title vii.it is past the time when that admonishment should be given precedential force.
it is well established that an actor may consider another individual race or gender to be an asset in some circumstances but a motivation for unlawful discrimination in other circumstances.see,price waterhouse hopkins,d plurality opinion recognizing that stereotypical notions can play a role in a employment discrimination case,even when the suspect comments were made by individuals who supported promoting the defendant superseded on other grounds.indeed,it is unlikely today that an actor would explicitly discriminate under all conditions it is much more likely that,where discrimination occurs,it does so in the context of more nuanced decisions that can be explained based upon reasons other than illicit bias,which,though perhaps implicit,is no less intentional.while a company may generally seek to hire women,it may also unfairly deny women positions once they become pregnant.while a school may affirmatively recruit minority students,the race of a student may simultaneously lead to harsher scrutiny when the individual has a disciplinary record.and while a lender may generally grant loans to african american applicants,it may also view african american borrowers as less creditworthy and more challenging risks than similarly situated white borrowers under some conditions.see,stephen ross john yinger,the color of credit mortgage discrimination,research methodology,and fair lending enforcement.
in reaching our conclusion,we note that discrimination claims are particularly vulnerable to premature dismissal because civil rights plaintiffs often plead facts that are consistent with both legal and illegal behavior,and civil rights cases are m
