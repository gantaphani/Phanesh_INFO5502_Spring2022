following a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of connecticut gerard goettel,judge,in which the jury awarded gregory bracey in compensatory damages on his claim of retaliatory discharge,and the judgment of the district court entered thereon,the new haven board of education the board moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and moved for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or,alternatively,relief from judgment.the district court denied the board motions.because we agree with the board that the evidence did not support the compensatory damages award,we vacate the award and remand to the district court for further proceedings.we affirm the judgment of the district court in all other respects.
background 
the trial record discloses the following largely undisputed facts.from november through december,bracey was a school teacher at the urban youth middle school urban,a public school for special needs students in new haven,connecticut.during his first year at urban,bracey received positive evaluations he was given no reprimands.
in,urban instituted a behavior modification program called area cooperative educational services aces that incorporated crisis management techniques and permitted school personnel to use physical force to restrain children who the teachers perceived to be acting aggressively or violently.bracey,several other teachers,and the school social worker objected to the program,giving rise to conflict between them and the school administration.
on two occasions,bracey interceded to stop what he viewed as physical abuse of students.the first incident took place in september,when,according to aces employee larry cates,a student at urban named david was angry and out of control,trial,at.david classroom had been torn apart.id.as part of the aces program,cates physically removed david from the classroom and brought him to a closed and windowless room to allow him to calm down.when cates and another aces employee got david into the room,they performed a takedown,pinning david to the floor.id.at.
at the end of the school day,david complained to bracey,his former teacher,that he,david,was having difficulty breathing.without first informing or obtaining permission from his superiors,bracey drove david and his mother to a local hospital,where bracey reported the incident to a social worker,as he thought he was required to do by law.he then drove david and his mother to a police station so that they could report the incident.
when bracey arrived for work at urban the next morning,he was reprimanded by urban principal,dorinda sizemore,for failing to tell her in advance of his trip to the hospital and the police station.a similar reprimand was delivered in writing by sizemore to bracey shortly thereafter.
some three months later,in december of that year,bracey objected to the physical removal and subsequent takedown of another student who,according to sizemore,had become belligerent while in the cafeteria,trial,at.an aces employee physically picked up the student and carried him out of the cafeteria.the employee then put his knee in the student back,incapacitating him.bracey confronted the employee,challenging the propriety of his actions.for this,bracey was given another disciplinary warning and was suspended for one day.
following these incidents,bracey and other urban personnel complained to the connecticut department of children and families the dcf about what they considered to be harsh treatment of the 
urban students,prompting the dcf to interview the personnel involved 
in january,sizemore recommended to reginald mayo,the new haven superintendent of schools,that bracey be suspended without pay and transferred to another school and that his contract as a teacher not be renewed.sizemore explained at trial that she made these recommendations because bracey hindered the program and undermin ed her authority with his report to the dcf,trial,at.bracey was subsequently transferred to another school.based on sizemore recommendation to mayo and mayo recommendation to the board,bracey employment by the board as a teacher ended in june.sizemore testified that the fact that bracey had reported the use of force to the dcf played a great role in her decision to recommend that his contract not be renewed,trial,at.
mayo testified at trial that bracey complaints about students being improperly restrained and about the use of force to subdue the students were part of the reason he recommended to the defendant that it not renew bracey contract,trial,at.mayo also testified that he was sure there was some discussion with sizemore before recommending bracey termination to the board,id.at,and that the dcf investigation was brought to his attention at some point,id.at.
more than a year later,bracey applied to the board of education of the city of bridgeport becb for a teaching position at a public school in bridgeport,connecticut.the becb denied bracey application.
bracey then brought this action in state court against the becb alleging intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and discrimination in violation of in connection with its failure to hire him.becb removed the action to federal court pursuant to a bracey then filed an amended complaint in federal court,adding claims against the board and the stamford board of education.after several further amendments of the complaint by bracey and motions for summary judgment by various defendants,the substance of which is not material to this appeal,only claims against the board for retaliatory discharge and tortious interference remained.bracey alleged in his final amended complaint that the board violated a connecticut statute.by subjecting bracey to retaliatory discipline and discharge because of his complaints regarding the treatment of david,in particular his report to the dcf.bracey asserted that the subject of his complaint to the dcf was a matter of public concern.he further alleged that the board had tortiously interfered with his right to contract.
the board moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,noting that the remaining claims were state claims over which the court should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction through the concept of pend e nt jurisdiction.defendant second motion to dismiss fourth amended complaint.the motion was not filed until the second day of trial the district court characterized the motion as having a lot of merit to it,trial,at.the court noted,however,that trial had by then begun.using what the court referred to as its discretion to decide the state court issues even if the federal ones were thrown out,id.at,the court concluded the jury going to decide it.id.
the district court dismissed the tortious interference claim as a matter of law at the close of bracey.bracey does not contest this dismissal on appeal.his section claim,however,was submitted to the jury,which returned a verdict for bracey for in compensatory damages.
the board then filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law for the first time,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,for a new trial,pursuant to rule,or for relief from judgment,pursuant to rule.the board argued that the rule b motion should have been granted.with respect to the remaining portions of the motion,the board contended that the evidence did not support the compensatory damages award and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.
the district court concluded that the rule b motion had been filed only a few days before the trial began and therefore was not ripe for decision until the trial was in progress.bracey bd.of,glg,at.with respect to the jury damages award,the district court concluded that the jury had sufficient basis for it.id.in response to the board motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or relief from judgment,the district court remarked,t rial judges are continually cautioned by the appellate court not to take matters from the jury and not to overturn jury verdicts except in the most extreme circumstances.id.while commenting that the evidence in th e case was not strongly in plaintiff favor,the court said that the circumstances required for overturning the jury verdict are not present here.id.the district court thereupon denied the board motions.
the board appeals the judgment of the district court on the ground that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims on which the judgment was based.it also challenges the amount of the award and the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or relief from judgment.

ii.subject matter jurisdiction 
the board contends,as an initial matter,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over bracey remaining claims against the board and that even if the district court had such jurisdiction,it abused its discretion in exercising it.bracey responds that his claims raise a substantial federal question because they necessarily turn on the construction of federal law.we agree with bracey.
federal court jurisdiction over claims 
the propriety of hearing bracey case in federal court turns on whether the case falls within the original federal question jurisdiction of the federal courts.merrell dow pharms.thompson,d.under,federal courts have original jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law.
federal jurisdiction is typically based on the fact that federal law creates the plaintiff asserted cause of action.see am.well works layne bowler.a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.but a plaintiff need not allege a cause of action created by federal law for the case to arise under federal law.if the plaintiff statement of his or her claim in a complaint necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law,franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d,then the case may also arise under federal law within the meaning of section,barbara stock,cir.
as the quoted language from franchise tax board suggests,the mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer jurisdiction.merrell dow,at.accord commercial owners,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d.the federal question to be resolved must be substantial.greenblatt delta plumbing heating,cir quoting,inter alia,merrell dow,at.we have pointed to language in supreme court opinions to the effect that in determining federal question jurisdiction,courts must make principled,pragmatic distinctions,engaging in a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.id.quoting,inter alia,merrell dow,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has instructed that a federal question is sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction if the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turn s on some construction of federal law.franchise tax,at.leading commentators have suggested that for purposes of an action arises under federal law if in order for the plaintiff to secure the relief sought he will be obliged to establish both the correctness and the applicability to his case of a proposition of federal law.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also harms eliscu,cir friendly,even though the claim is created by state law,a case may arise under a law of the united states if the complaint discloses a need for determining the meaning or application of such a law,cert.denied,d.
in merrell dow,the supreme court indicated that when a claim is based on federal law but congress has chosen not to create a private right of action for violation of that federal law,the federal issue is not sufficiently substantial to confer federal jurisdiction.see merrell dow,at.some circuit courts read merrell dow as requiring that there be a federal right of action for there to be jurisdiction.see,seinfeld austen,cir,cert.denied,d merrell dow interpreted the word substantial in this phrase to mean a congressional choice to include a private right of action in favor of plaintiffs.see also richard fallon,daniel meltzer,and david shapiro,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed discussing the differing views among the circuits 
although cases in this circuit have not read merrell dow categorically to preclude federal question jurisdiction in the absence of a private remedy for violation of the relevant federal law,see,at,the existence vel non of such a private right of action is the starting point for our inquiry into the substantiality of the federal questions involved in a lawsuit.barbara,at.
jurisdiction over bracey claim 
the rights protected by connecticut general statute section relate to the exercise by an employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the united states constitution or section of article first of the constitution of the state of connecticut.bracey claims that the board violated section by retaliating against him because he exercised his free speech rights as guaranteed by the united states and connecticut constitutions when complaining to the dcf and reporting to the hospital and police department.
to begin at the starting point,barbara,at,congress has provided a cause of action with respect to such a claim.bracey asserts that he lost his employment as a teacher because of his exercise of his right to speak to the dcf,the hospital,and the police department about a matter of public interest the physical treatment of students.congress,through enactment of what is now,created a cause of action applicable to,among many other things,just such circumstances.see,melzer bd.of,cir addressing section claim brought against the new york city board of education for retaliatory termination of the plaintiff teaching position allegedly in violation of his constitutional rights to freedom of association and expression,cert.denied,d see also scott coughlin,cir addressing under section a prisoner claim of retaliatory disciplinary infraction charges against him for exercise of first amendment rights phillips bowen,cir considering under section the plaintiff claim of retaliatory adverse employment action for her exercise of first amendment rights mccullough wyandanch union free sch,cir addressing under section the plaintiff claim of retaliatory discharge for exercise of first amendment rights clue johnson,cir same,in the context of retaliatory job suspension mitchum foster,d the very purpose of was to interpose the federal courts between the states and the people,as guardians of the people federal protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law,whether that action be executive,legislative,or judicial.citation and internal quotation marks omitted fletcher,cir holding,in the context of the free exercise of religion,that s ection creates a cause of action against any person who,acting under color of state law,deprives another of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states,including first amendment right s,cert.denied
