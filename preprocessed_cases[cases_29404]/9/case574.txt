eric donnelly donnelly appeals from a sentence imposed following his guilty plea to conspiracy to violate the civil rights of jail detainees under his supervision,conspiracy to obstruct justice,obstruction of justice,and four counts of deprivation of rights under color of law.on appeal,donnelly argues that the sentencing court erred when it included a enhancement pursuant to vulnerable victim.because we find that the district court committed no reversible error in its determination that one of donnelly victims was a vulnerable victim,we affirm the sentence.
background 
from december,through december,donnelly was employed by the suffolk county sheriff department.donnelly worked at the nashua street jail in boston,massachusetts,a detention center which houses detainees.donnelly was an officer and supervisor at the jail and sometimes served as the lieutenant of the sheriff emergency response team.
from at least june,through february,donnelly and several other officers and supervisors had an unwritten agreement to use unjustified,excessive force to punish detainees who disrespected the officers,put hands on the officers,or otherwise misbehaved.the agreement led to the use of excessive force in order to teach the inmates a lesson.donnelly and other officers and supervisors assaulted at least four detainees between april,and october.it is the factual circumstances surrounding the assault on one of the detainees,which give rise to this appeal.
during september and october of,was detained at the nashua street jail.suffers from tourette syndrome,a neurological disorder which affects his ability to control his verbal and physical acts.tourette outbursts consisted of repetitious and involuntary physical movements,or tics,and uncontrollable verbal outbursts,which often included the use of profanity.
on october,in violation of jail rules,got up from his table to wash a piece of fruit.officer william benson benson admonished for getting up without permission,but permitted him to wash his fruit before sitting back down.what happened after returned to his seat is disputed.one version of the story is that sat down and said of benson,what an attitude.another officer claims that said,you fat.regardless of what was said,was dismissed from dinner and returned to his locked cell in the medical unit.
once back in his cell,began to feel his tourette symptoms act up.to lessen the effects of the tourette outburst,engaged in physical activity,which consisted of shadowboxing and bench pressing his bed.benson,hearing the commotion,approached cell and said,shut the up,to which responded,you shut the up.you people make fun of me around here all the time and i ca say nothing about it.you.no.the exchange between and benson prompted donnelly,who was in the medical unit watching a baseball game on television,to approach cell.donnelly then said to,you will not talk to my officers that way.donnelly and benson then entered cell where they hit him repeatedly in the face,head,and body.during the assault,one or both of the officers yelled,we beat the tourette out of you.
on may,donnelly was charged with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of detainees being held at the nashua street jail.in particular,donnelly was charged with seven counts consisting of conspiring to obstruct justice,in violation of obstruction of justice,in violation of b conspiring to violate rights,in violation of and deprivation of rights under color of law,in violation of.the indictment contained four individual counts of deprivation of rights under color of law,which included the assault.
on march,donnelly entered into a plea agreement with the united states attorney office,wherein donnelly agreed to plead guilty to all counts with which he was charged.the plea agreement provided that the government would take the position that donnelly total offense level was.the plea agreement further provided that the government would recommend that donnelly be sentenced at the low end of the guideline sentencing range.in the event of an appeal,however,the agreement preserved the government right to argue the correctness of defendant sentence and the manner in which the district court determines it.at the sentencing hearing on june,the court considered the presentence report psr,which included a enhancement under for each of the four counts charging donnelly with deprivation of rights under color of law.the probation officer included the enhancement citing the fact that donnelly victims were detained in a jail cell when they were assaulted.this fact,the probation officer believed,supported a finding that those victims were vulnerable victims under section.accordingly,the probation officer concluded that donnelly total offense level was.both the government and donnelly objected to the applicability of section to each of the four counts.
the district court found that section was not applicable on the grounds set forth in the psr by the probation officer.rather,the sentencing judge,relying on the psr and his own observations of during the trial of several of donnelly advised the parties that he would apply the vulnerable victim enhancement to the assault on.the district judge stated that he believed the enhancement should be applied in case because in very large part the assault on occurred because he had tourette syndrome.at donnelly request,the district court suspended the hearing to allow donnelly time to prepare to address the district court position that the vulnerable victim enhancement be applied with respect to donnelly assault on 
on july,the sentencing hearing was.on that same day,just prior to the hearing,donnelly filed an objection to the psr,specifically objecting to the district court taking the statement,we beat the tourette out of you,into account in its consideration of the applicability of section.finding the objection untimely,the sentencing judge declined to consider it.
after hearing the arguments of counsel,the court determined that the enhancement provided for by section should be included in the sentencing calculation as it related to the incident.the court found that the assault occurred because of tourette syndrome.accordingly,the court determined donnelly total offense level to be,with a guideline range of months.donnelly was sentenced to months imprisonment.donnelly appeals his sentence.in accordance with the plea agreement,the government pursues its option to argue that the sentencing court imposed the correct sentence.
ii.standard of review 
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must determine the appropriate standard of review.a sentencing court must make two distinct and separate findings to apply section that the victim is a vulnerable victim and that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim unusual vulnerability.both parties agree that the district court findings of fact as they relate to whether or not is a vulnerable victim,by virtue of his tourette syndrome,are reviewed for clear error and that the legal determinations of the district court are subject to plenary review.see united states gill,cir.
the government and donnelly disagree,however,as to the appropriate standard of review as it relates to the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement whether donnelly knew or should have known of unusual vulnerability.the government argues that,although donnelly objected to the enhancement on the grounds that was not a vulnerable victim,he did not argue to the sentencing court that donnelly did not know of vulnerability,and therefore the issue of donnelly knowledge of vulnerability was not properly preserved below.the government,therefore,urges us to review this claim for plain error.donnelly argues that the plain error standard does not apply because he is not raising a new claim on appeal,but rather that he properly preserved the issue below by arguing against the application of section generally.
we have said that an appellant must specifically raise before the district court any issues he or she wishes to preserve for our consideration.see united states dietz,cir noting that arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the fi
