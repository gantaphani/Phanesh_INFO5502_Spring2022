this appeal arises from a failed discrimination lawsuit brought on behalf of marika steir by her mother,linda steir,against the girl scouts of the usa girl scouts and spar spindle council,a regional agency that supervises local girl scout troops.because the case was ultimately dismissed for reasons that are not a reflection on the merits of the complaint,we will only lightly sketch the underlying allegations.
marika steir has been afflicted with cerebral palsy since birth.although marika requires the use of a wheelchair for mobility,and a computer console for communication,she leads an active life.she became a member of spar spindle girl scout troop in atkinson,new hampshire,as a in,and remained a girl scout until when she entered the seventh grade.for most of that time,marika was happy with scouting,earning numerous merit badges and enjoying a good relationship with her fellow scouts and troop leaders.
marika alleges that beginning in,discriminatory conduct on the part of girl scout troop leaders cast a pall over her scouting experience.specifically,marika cites a camping trip planned for the girls of her troop to a campground that lacked restrooms,an excursion taken the same year to an indoor amusement park which offered no activities in which she could participate,and meetings that were held at a troop leader home,the front steps of which marika could not negotiate in her wheelchair.marika mother sought to transfer marika to a neighboring troop whose leader she thought would be more sensitive to marika physical limitations.the troop leader,however,refused to enroll marika,allegedly because of her disabilities.although marika remained an active member of troop during the scouting season,linda steir was unable to obtain a firm guarantee of appropriate accommodations for marika from officials of spar spindle.on september,in response to an invitation to register marika for the scouting year,linda steir wrote to marika troop leader that marika will not be joining girl scouts this year.marika thereafter ceased all participation in scouting.
on february,marika filed a discrimination charge against the girl scouts and spar spindle with the new hampshire commission for human rights.on july,at the request of marika counsel,the commission terminated its investigation and authorized the filing of a lawsuit.
on august,a complaint was filed by linda steir as mother and next friend of marika against the girl scouts and spar spindle in the rockingham county superior court.the complaint asserted violations of new hampshire law against discrimination.ann,and claims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.on september,the case was removed by the defendants to the united states district court on diversity of citizenship grounds.on november,the district court permitted marika to amend her complaint by adding a claim for injunctive relief under title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada,et the negligent infliction of emotional distress count was voluntarily dismissed.
on november,the district court adopted the parties jointly proposed scheduling order.the order provided that discovery would be concluded on november,that motions for summary judgment would be filed by january,and that the parties would be ready for trial on april.on december,a week after the agreed date for the close of discovery,marika moved to amend her complaint further by adding a claim for money damages under the federal rehabilitation act.with the motion to amend,marika also filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that the girl scouts and spar spindle are places of public accommodation within the meaning of title iii of the ada on december,the district court denied the motion to amend shortly thereafter,the court continued the april,trial date while it considered the parties motions for summary judgment.
on september,the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.the court also indicated in its memorandum that it had come to the tentative conclusion that marika lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief under the ada.after inviting submissions on the issue from the parties,the district court on april,definitively so ruled.on october,the new hampshire supreme court,answering a question certified by the district court,ruled that the disability tolling provision of.ann.did not relieve marika of strict observance of the limitation period on the filing of a charge under the new hampshire law against discrimination and that her statutory claims were therefore.steir girl scouts of the.final judgment entered for the girl scouts and spar spindle on november.a timely notice of appeal was filed,claiming error in the district court denial of the motion to amend the complaint and in its ruling that marika lacked standing under title iii of the ada.
discussion 
a.the motion to amend 
a motion to amend a complaint will be treated differently depending on its timing and the context in which it is filed.a plaintiff is permitted to amend a complaint once as a matter of right prior to the filing of a responsive pleading by the defendant.a.thereafter,the permission of the court or the consent of the opposing party is required.the default rule mandates that leave to amend is to be freely given when justice so requires,unless the amendment would be futile,or reward,inter alia,undue or intended delay.resolution trust gold,cir.
as a case progresses,and the issues are joined,the burden on a plaintiff seeking to amend a complaint becomes more exacting.scheduling orders,for example,typically establish a date for amendments as was apparently the case here once a scheduling order is in place,the liberal default rule is replaced by the more demanding good cause standard of.b.hyatt hotels of,cir.this standard focuses on the diligence or lack thereof of the moving party more than it does on any prejudice to the id.where the motion to amend is filed after the opposing party has timely moved for summary judgment,a plaintiff is required to show substantial and convincing evidence to justify a belated attempt to amend a complaint.gold,at.
regardless of the context,the longer a plaintiff delays,the more likely the motion to amend will be denied,as protracted delay,with its attendant burdens on the opponent and the court,is itself a sufficient reason for the court to withhold permission to amend.hilton int l of,cir.particularly disfavored are motions to amend whose timing prejudices the opposing party by requiring a of discovery with additional costs,a significant postponement of the trial,and a likely major alteration in trial tactics and strategy id.at.we review the denial of a motion to amend under rule a for an abuse of discretion,and we defer to the district court if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.grant news group boston,cir.
that the motion to amend by adding the rehabilitation act claim,if granted,would have prejudiced the girl scouts and spar spindle by injecting a new theory of relief into the litigation,goes without saying.title iii of the ada,the gravamen of the original amended complaint,permits only equitable relief,while the rehabilitation act has been judicially construed to permit the recovery of money damages.see schultz young men christian ass of the united states,cir.in defending against the steirs lawsuit,the girl scouts and spar spindle made a tactical decision to forego any attempt to explore the basis and extent of marika claim for compensatory damages to delve into this issue at the penultimate phase of the litigation would have required the of discovery to permit a deposition of marika and the obtaining of any relevant medical records,a postponement of the hearing scheduled on the pending motions for summary judgment,and almost certainly,the delay of any trial.the issue thus is not whether allowing the amendment would have been would have whether it would have been unfairly so.
marika argues that no unfairness was involved because the reason for the delay lies squarely at the feet of the girl scouts and spar spindle.an indispensable jurisdiction
