this is a title vii suit for sexual harassment and retaliation.priscilla huston appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer,procter gamble paper products corporation p g.huston appeal hinges on whether two p g employees qualify as management level so that their knowledge may be imputed to p g for purposes of liability under title vii.the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania determined that the two employees were not management level and that p g took prompt and adequate remedial measures as soon as it had notice of huston harassment allegations.we will affirm the district court judgment,and in so doing,clarify the definition of management level.we will also affirm the district court judgment that huston can not make out a retaliation claim.
the events underlying huston lawsuit allegedly occurred in the spring of,by which time huston had been employed at p g mehoopany plant for more than a decade.huston worked as a technician on the teams that operated large paper manufacturing machines.the teams worked shifts monitoring the machines and their gauges and instruments to make sure that they ran smoothly and safely to manufacture paper products.
the first incident huston relies on to support her title vii claim allegedly occurred on may.although she did not witness this incident,huston alleges that she heard that one of her male teammates had exposed himself in the plant control room in the presence of three other male teammates according to huston,someone informed supervising technicians pete romanchick and jack traver of this incident the next day.huston indicates that a similar incident occurred on may.once again,she was not a witness and contends only that she heard that another male teammate had similarly exposed himself in front of four male teammates.
huston also alleges that,on june,she was in the control room with her teammates when one of them exposed himself while explaining that he had shaved his testicles.she further alleges that the same man exposed himself again the next day in front of her and three male p g employees.
huston reported these incidents to manager regina gray and human resources manager linda sheehan on june.at the same time,she complained that her male teammates looked at pornography using the control room computer and that they kept pornographic magazines on the work site as well.p g launched an investigation into huston allegations on the same.francisco lanza,the manager of huston team,assisted gray and sheehan with the investigation.they interviewed various individuals named by huston in her allegations.each interviewed employee denied either exposing himself or witnessing another teammate expose himself.one teammate did admit making sexually explicit comments to two female temporary employees in the control room,and another teammate admitted sending male an containing images of topless women.
at the conclusion of its investigation,in july,p g sanctioned everyone on huston the framework of its disciplinary program.under this program,an employee in breach of p g policies is disciplined by being placed on a step with attendant sanctions and notice.an employee who is already on one of the steps can be advanced to a higher step if p g decides that a more stringent warning is called for.the fifth step in the program is termination.
each of huston teammates was placed on,or advanced,a disciplinary step for various transgressions discovered through the investigation into huston allegations.huston herself was disciplined along with her teammates because p g determined that the entire team used vulgar language at practice p g sought to eliminate.huston was already on step four due to prior transgressions,including a safety violation from.she was not advanced to step five,however instead,her file was simply annotated to record that she was asked to be mindful of her language at work.
in the fall of,p g identified a costly problem with production quality at the mehoopany plant.management traced this problem to a lack of care on the part of technicians monitoring and maintaining the machines.as a result,the plant management convened a meeting for all technicians working on the machines.the purpose of the meeting was to reiterate that the technicians were to be diligent and thorough in monitoring gauges and recording machine data to ensure that the manufacturing processes ran properly.to drive the point home,management warned technicians,including huston,that they risked termination if they were caught fabricating data for the machine data logs.
notwithstanding this warning from management,huston falsified machine log data on october.when confronted by romanchick about her log entries,she admitted to the falsified data.p g terminated her employment.
on november,huston filed a complaint against p g in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania asserting claims for sex discrimination and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,a,a,and under the pennsylvania human relations act phra.the district court granted summary judgment against huston on may.huston now appeals from that judgment.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under and f.we have jurisdiction under and our review is plenary.knabe boury,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we draw all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of huston,the party.knabe,at.where the record taken as a whole could not lead a reasonable trier of fact to find for the party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d citation omitted.
under title vii,an employer may not discharge or discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of such individual sex.a a plaintiff may further establish that an employer violated title vii by proving that sexual harassment created a hostile work environment.kunin sears roebuck,cir citing meritor sav.bank vinson,d.to establish a hostile work environment claim against an employer,a plaintiff must prove the following 
the employee suffered intentional discrimination because of their sex the discrimination was pervasive and regular the discrimination detrimentally affected the plaintiff the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position and the existence of respondeat superior liability.
weston pennsylvania,cir citing andrews city of,cir.the first four elements of this claim establish that a hostile work environment existed.the fifth element,which is the only element at issue in this appeal,establishes the basis on which to hold the employer liable.the basis of an employer liability for hostile environment sexual harassment depends on whether the harasser is the victim supervisor or merely a coworker.parkins civil constructors of,cir citations omitted.in the present case,huston concedes that the employees who performed or witnessed the alleged harassing incidents were not supervisors all were merely technicians.when the hostile work environment is created by a victim coworkers,the employer is not automatically liable.kunin,at.rather,employer liability for harassment exists only if the employer failed to provide a reasonable avenue for complaint or,alternatively,if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action.see weston,at citing kunin,at that is,an employer may be directly liable for sexual harassment only if the employer was negligent in failing to discover the harassment or in responding to a report of such harassment.huston does not argue that p g failed to provide a reasonable avenue for complaint.instead,she contends that p g knew or should have known of harassment through the technicians romanchick and traver,as of may,and that p g failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action.
we have explained that an employer knew or should have known about workplace sexual harassment if employees had actual or constructive knowledge about the existence of a sexually hostile environment.andrews,at citing katz dole,cir emphasis added.we have also recognized that management level employees have constructive notice of a hostile work environment when an employee provides management level personnel with enough information to raise a probability of sexual harassment in the mind of a reasonable employer.kunin,at 
huston argues that romanchick and traver were management level employees because they held the supervisory positions of process coach and machine leader,respectively,and they had the authority to turn in employees who were in breach of plant policies.in particular,huston suggests that romanchick qualifies as management level because he facilitated the termination of her employment by reporting on huston data falsification to her manager,francisco lanza.p g counters that romanchick and traver were merely technicians,like huston,and that their duties were limited to ensuring that the production line machines ran smoothly.while charging that romanchick facilitated the termination of her employment,huston does not dispute that neither romanchick nor traver had the authority to discipline technicians on behalf of p g or otherwise change their employment status.
in deciding whether romanchick and traver qualified as management level employees,the district court observed that the third circuit ha s given little guidance as to what management level exactly means in the context of imputing constructive notice of sexual harassment to the employer.huston proctor gamble paper prods,wl,at.may.our decision in kunin did not turn on the status of the employee alleged to have notice of the harassment but rather on the inadequacy of that notice.kunin,at t here is simply no evidence that the supervisor had knowledge that the rude language was gender specific.similarly,in andrews,a case which involved the pervasive use of derogatory and insulting sexist terms directed at women in a division of the philadelphia police department,the meaning of management level was not at issue and was not developed.andrews,at.huston appeal thus provides us with the opportunity to offer some guidance to the district courts as to who qualifies as a management level employee.
in this endeavor,w e turn to principles of agency law,for the term employer is defined under title vii to include agents.b in express terms,congress has directed federal courts to interpret title vii based on agency principles.burlington,ellerth,d referring to agency principles in deciding that an employer is vicariously liable for a supervisor sexual harassment when the supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate internal citation omitted.the relevant agency principles here are those governing when to impute an agent knowledge of particular facts to the agent principal.on this score,the restatement third of agency explains 
for purposes of determining a principal legal relations with a third party,notice of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know is imputed to the principal if knowledge of the fact is material to the agent duties to the principal,unless the agent a acts adversely to the principal as stated in,or b is subject to a duty to another not to disclose the fact to the principal.
restatement third of agency emphasis added.according to this rule,not all facts known by an agent are imputed to the principal.rather,there are two parameters limiting when knowledge of facts known by an agent is imputed to the principal the agent duties to the principal and the the facts in question to those duties.
first,t he scope of an agent duties delimits the content of knowledge that is imputed to the principal.id.cmt.b.the restatement third of agency illustrates this point with the following example 
p corporation manufactures construction supplies,using numerous chemicals in its manufacturing processes.governmental regulations applicable to p corporation require that it dispose of chemicals used in manufacturing in a manner that does not degrade the natural environment and that it promptly investigate and rectify environmentally damaging spills of chemicals.p corporation employs a,an environmental engineer,whose duties include monitoring p corporation facilities for compliance with applicable environmental regulations and reporting the results of a findings to s,a superior agent within p corporation.while touring the exterior of p corporation plant,a inspects a pipe that drains used chemicals into storage vats.a observes that a chemical is leaking from a pipe into the ground in close proximity to a stream.notice of the fact that the pipe leaks,known to a,is imputed to p corporation but under a different scenario where the leaky pipe is observed by b,a clerk in p corporation department,and where b duties do not include monitoring p corporation compliance with environmental regulations,n otice of the fact that the pipe leaks,known to b,is not imputed to p corporation.
id.cmt.b,illus.emphasis added.in this example,b knowledge of the pipe leak is not imputed to p corporation because that knowledge is beyond the scope of b duties.p corporation does not employ b to monitor compliance with environmental laws but rather to work as an accounting clerk.in contrast,a knowledge of the leak is imputed to p corporation because p corporation employs a specifically to monitor and report on its compliance with environmental laws.a knowledge of the chemical leak thus lies squarely within the scope of a employment duties.id.cmt.e the breadth of notice imputed to a principal of facts that an agent knows or has reason to know mirrors the agent duty to the principal.
the restatement third of agency notes further that the scope of an agent duties is especially relevant in the context of an organization that may employ many different individuals to perform different tasks.id.cmt.the nature and scope of the duties assigned to an agent are key to imputation within an organization.under this approach,a corporation is not charged with the legal consequences of an employee knowledge of a fact that lies outside the scope of the employee duties to the corporation.id.
second,even if knowledge lies within the scope of an employee duties,that knowledge is not necessarily imputed to the employer.rather,to justify imputation,the knowledge must also be,important or the employee duties to the employer.see restatement second of agency cmt.a the principal is affected by the agent knowledge whenever the knowledge is of importance in the act which the agent is authorized to perform.emphasis added see also oxford english dictionary ed defining material as of serious or substantial import of much consequence important black law dictionary ed defining material as of such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person significant essential.thus,to justify imputing an employee knowledge of facts to an employer,the facts must be important or significant to the employee duties to the employer.this is the case when the employee uses that knowledge in the performance of the employee duties to the employer.in other words,the employee knowledge of facts may be imputed to the employer only if that knowledge is important to the function the employee is employed to perform.
under this approach,an employee knowledge of sexual harassment may be imputed to the employer when the employee is employed to report or respond to sexual harassment.we thus conclude that an employee knowledge of allegations of coworker sexual harassment may typically be imputed to the employer in two circumstances first,where the employee is sufficiently senior in the employer governing hierarchy,or otherwise in a position of administrative responsibility over employees under him,such as a departmental or plant manager,so that such knowledge is important to the employee general managerial duties.in this case,the employee usually has the authority to act on behalf of the employer to stop the harassment,for example,by disciplining employees or by changing their employment
