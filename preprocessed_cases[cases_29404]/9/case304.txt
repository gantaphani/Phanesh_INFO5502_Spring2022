azell malone appeals the district court grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b before the motion was granted,a jury had entered a verdict and award in favor of malone and against lockheed martin corporation and carl supancic.the jury found the defendants guilty of employment discrimination based on race,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,the rhode island fair employment practices act rifepa,laws et,and the rhode island civil rights act of ricra,laws et as well as retaliation based on malone alleged activities,in violation of the rhode island whistleblowers protection act riwpa,laws et.the jury entered an award of million in compensatory and punitive damages 
in a thorough and extensive opinion,the district court subsequently granted defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to rule b.as to the racial discrimination claims brought under title vii,rifepa,and ricra,the district court made three separate determinations.first,it concluded that only two alleged discriminatory acts fell within the actionable time periods of the federal and state statutes respectively,days and one year,and that malone failed to present any evidence whatsoever that those two acts were the result of racial discrimination.
second,the district court noted that acts that occurred outside the actionable time period may constitute relevant background evidence.malone lockheed martin,wl,at july,quoting national passenger morgan,see also rathbun autozone,cir a discriminatory act or practice that is not the basis for a timely charge of discrimination nonetheless may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the same type of discriminatory act or practice has been timely challenged.however,upon reviewing this background evidence the court determined that it revealed no sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury finding of racial animus.
third,the district court concluded that the wrongful acts alleged by malone which fell outside the relevant limitations periods did not make out a hostile work environment claim under a continuing violation theory because his supervisors repeated disciplinary actions were taken in response to malone undisputed and well documented habit of taking unscheduled vacation days over a period of several years,and there was otherwise no objective evidence of a racial motivation for the discipline.malone,wl,at.essentially,the district court determined that it had erred in allowing this evidence before the jury on a continuing violations theory.
as to the retaliation claim brought under the riwpa,the district court concluded that malone report to his superiors that two employees under his supervision were suspected of accepting improper gifts from a federal employee was not the kind of act protected by the riwpa.in the alternative,the court also concluded that malone failed to put forth any evidence that his subsequent reprimands and demotion were caused by his report of the improper gifts rather than by his recurring absenteeism the court concluded that the jury determination of causation amount ed to nothing more than speculation.malone,wl,at.
having reviewed the record carefully,we affirm the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law against malone as to all claims we conclude,as the district court did and for substantially the same reasons,that the record reveals no sufficient evidentiary basis for the verdict.because our reasoning does not differ substantially from that of the district court,we outline the relevant facts and law only to the extent necessary to explain our conclusions a fuller treatment of the case background is available in the district court opinion.
standard of review 
we generally review a district court grant of a rule motion de novo.visible syst.unisys,cir in so doing,we use the same standard as the district court in evaluating the motion,meaning that a ll of the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence are considered in the light most favorable to the party,here malone.see espada lugo,cir.further,i n reviewing the record,we will evaluate neither the credibility of the witnesses nor the weight of the evidence,cir,rev on other grounds.however,and crucially in this case,the plaintiff is not entitled to inferences based on speculation and conjecture.id.at quoting ferrer zayas,cir.
the standard for granting a rule motion is stringent.courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury determination when the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.rivera castillo autokirey,cir quoting keisling for progress,cir.
background facts 
as noted above,we leave the myriad details of this case to the district court comprehensive opinion.essentially,malone,an male engineer,received a series of escalating reprimands,deteriorating performance reviews,and eventually a demotion while employed at lockheed martin facility in newport,rhode island.the reprimands,at least six between and,were issued by two consecutive supervisors,carl supancic and james higson in response to malone continued practice of requesting vacation days without prior notice,on the morning of the day he wished to take off,or failing to report for work without seeking permission at all despite being told repeatedly and in writing that such actions were disruptive,disfavored,and could lead to job termination,malone continued the practice.he also continued the practice despite imposition of a performance improvement plan,which was designed by lockheed human resources managers and legal department.perhaps the most egregious example of this behavior occurred on two consecutive days in october,when malone failed to receive advance permission for time off or report to work despite the delivery of letters via courier to his home each day demanding his attendance at work.
as for evidence that the reprimands,performance reviews,and eventual demotion may have been caused by animus,we agree with district court that such evidence was lacking from the trial record.malone theory was that his first supervisor,carl supancic,who directed a majority but not all of the reprimands and discipline of malone,was racially biased against him.malone admitted,however,that he only reached this conclusion after ruling everything else out.there was no other evidence submitted that suggested supancic actions were motivated by racial animus the only racially tinged incident put forth by malone was that coworkers,not including supancic,once joked that malone was driving miss daisy because he had to drive a white colleague to and from a work site 
racial discrimination claims 
the district court correctly determined that only two discrete acts of alleged discrimination occurred within the statute of limitations for purposes of claims made under title and the state statutes.these two events were an updated final warning regarding malone attendance issues that was issued by malone subsequent supervisor,higson and a performance review that rated malone as a basic contributor that was likewise issued by higson.there was no claim that higson himself took these actions based on racial animus,only an assertion that higson fell under supancic influence.in addition,malone submitted little other than his own conjecture that higson issuance of either of these reports was influenced by supancic.thus,as a matter of law,these two events could not have formed an adequate basis for the jury finding of liability,at rejecting inferences based on speculation and conjecture alone ferrer,at same.
as correctly noted by both parties in supplemental briefing,evidence of events that fall outside the statute of limitations may still be admitted as relevant background evidence to show that discriminatory animus motivated the acts that occurred within the statute of limitations.see rathbun,at.however,this rule does nothing to help malone cause because he offered no evidence that the acts that fell outside the limitations periods including supancic reprimands,performance reviews,and
