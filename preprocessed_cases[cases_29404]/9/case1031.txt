this case calls upon us to review a district court refusal to enforce an administrative subpoena filed by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc requested information about how religious exemptions to united parcel service,ups uniform and personal appearance guidelines appearance guidelines,which apply to every ups facility across the country,are handled nationwide.the district court concluded that this nationwide information was not relevant to the two individual charges being investigated by the eeoc.we hold that the district court applied too restrictive a standard of relevance and we therefore reverse its order.
background 
ups appearance guidelines prohibit employees in positions at all ups facilities from wearing any facial hair below the lower lip.until,employees who refused to comply with the appearance guidelines for religious reasons were not placed in positions.in,ups formalized a religious accommodation policy to allow for the granting of limited exemptions from the appearance guidelines for religious beliefs.a memo dated october,established a process by which requests for exemption from the appearance guidelines for religious reasons should be evaluated,so that ups could ensure that all future requests for exemption will be handled in a consistent manner.pursuant to the process,an employee seeking such an exemption can submit a request to his or her immediate supervisor and manager,who then forwards the request to the district human resources manager.
the district human resources manager will communicate with his or her district manager,district labor relations manager,and region manager,that a request for exemption has been received region human resources will contact corporate workforce planning,who will coordinate with all necessary corporate,labor relations,procurement,obtain a consistent answer the resolution will flow back to the district in reverse order of the initial request,namely,from corporate through the region human resources manager to the district manager.
id.this process was updated on january,to provide that region human resources would only contact corporate workforce planning if necessary.despite these memoranda,according to ups corporate workforce planning manager craig owen,in practice,requests for accommodation are reviewed and decisions made,on a basis by the human resources staff at the ups facility where the request is made.
on november,bilal abdullah,a practicing muslim who wears a beard,interviewed with ups rochester,new york facility for the position of seasonal driver helper and sorter.when told by the interviewer that he would have to shave his beard,he explained that maintaining a beard was part of his religion.according to the ups interviewer,she responded that other seasonal positions were available that would not require abdullah to shave his beard.on november,abdullah attended an orientation,where he was asked to fill out a form that stated he would be clean shaven.he again stated that he could not shave his beard because of his religion.he was then logged out of ups computer system and was not hired.according to ups,abdullah was not hired because,on november,ups learned that he had provided a false social security number with his application,thereby rendering him ineligible for employment.
abdullah filed a charge with the eeoc buffalo office on january,alleging religious discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii.
muhammed farhan,also a muslim,began working at ups in dallas,texas as a package handler in.the position did not require any contact with the public.in january,ups accepted his bid for a driver position.in or about february,farhan started to become more religious and began to grow a beard.in april,he was told to report for a driver position.when he did so,he was told that ups does not allow anyone with a beard to be a driver.farhan spoke with his manager and union representative and asked for a religious accommodation to allow him to drive a ups truck.the manager said that farhan could not drive for ups if he had a beard,and would have to return to his position as package handler which is not a position.later that week,farhan went to the local human resources office and asked for a form to request a religious accommodation.both human resources officers to whom he spoke said they knew of no such form.two days later,he went to the ups hub in mesquite,texas,to ask for a religious accommodation.the human resources officer there also did not know about any form to request an accommodation.
farhan filed a charge with the texas workforce commission and the eeoc on april,alleging that he had been prevented from working as a driver because of his beard,as ups refused to accommodate his religious practice.moreover,farhan alleged i also believe that respondent has a pattern or a practice of refusing to accommodate the religious observances,practices and beliefs of its employees.in june,the ups district manager for human resources contacted farhan and told him that he could come fill out a form to request a religious accommodation for the driver position.farhan did so,and the request was granted later that month.
in the course of its investigation of abdullah charge,the eeoc buffalo office sent ups a request for information seeking,inter alia all documents related to the appearance guidelines and a list of all jobs which are subject to the guidelines identifying information for all job applicants denied employment because of their refusal to adhere to the appearance guidelines since january,identifying information for all employees who requested a religious accommodation to the appearance guidelines and the outcomes of those requests since january,and identifying information for all employees who were terminated for reasons relating to the appearance guidelines since january.ups objected to the request,explaining that it did not have the information sought in any centralized location and did not keep records on job applicants who requested religious accommodation to the appearance guidelines.
on november,the eeoc filed a petition in the united states district court for the western district of new york to enforce the subpoena.by order dated september,the district court denied the petition,holding that the subpoena was overly broad and sought national information not relevant to the individual charges being investigated.this appeal followed.after oral argument,held on august,we directed the parties to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of this case.we were informed by letter dated october,that those discussions failed.hence,we issue this opinion.
discussion 
under title vii,the eeoc is required to investigate charges of discrimination to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that an employer is engaged in an unlawful employment practice,see b,and may issue subpoenas in connection with its investigation,id.it is entitled to any evidence of any person being investigated that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by title vii and is relevant to the charge under investigation.id.a.
as we recently clarified,the district court role in a proceeding to enforce an administrative subpoena is extremely limited.am.med.response,at internal quotation marks omitted.to obtain enforcement of an administrative subpoena,a n agency must show only that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose,that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose,that the information sought is not already within the agency possession,and that the administrative steps required have been followed.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a subpoena that satisfies these criteria will be enforced unless the party opposing enforcement demonstrates that the subpoena is unreasonable or that compliance would be unnecessarily burdensome.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis omitted.
as the supreme court has explained 
t he eeoc is entitled to access only to evidence relevant to the charge under investigation.that limitation on the commission investigative authority is not especially constraining.since the enactment of t
