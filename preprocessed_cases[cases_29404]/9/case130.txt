we seldom do our best thinking in the murky hours when late night seeps into early morning.what strikes one as a fine idea in the darkness may reveal itself to be a brilliant mistake in the cold light of dawn.decisions made well past by two men one a suspect,the other a police officer are at the heart of this appeal.jonathan mitchell,once the suspect,now the plaintiff,decided to break in to his estranged wife apartment to talk about their relationship,and then opted to lead police on a car chase.he now contends that officer robert miller violated his fourth amendment rights when miller shot him as he sped away.the district court granted summary judgment to miller,finding that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity.although mitchell appeals that judgment,because we find the district court reached the right decision,we affirm.
background 
on the evening of april,in portland,maine,jonathan mitchell spent time drinking at a bar and smoking marijuana before deciding to help himself to a friend volkswagen jetta.in the wee small hours of the,mitchell had the idea of visiting his estranged wife to talk about their relationship.perhaps anticipating the reception he might receive,instead of calling or ringing the bell,mitchell broke into the sleeping woman apartment.he then woke her and talked to her in what he characterizes as an attempt to rekindle their relationship.unsurprisingly,she viewed his behavior as more of a criminal act than a display of ardor,and,once mitchell made his exit,she called the police.the woman reported the at,and provided a description of the jetta,as well as the direction in which mitchell was driving when he left.
the police dispatcher,in turn,passed along the information to patrol officers and added that mitchell driver license had been revoked as a habitual offender he was a convicted felon and he was reported to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs and possibly unstable.portland police officer robert miller was on patrol that evening when he heard the report of the residential burglary,spotted the jetta,and began to follow mitchell.a video camera mounted to mitchell cruiser recorded the subsequent events 
mitchell turned into a residential neighborhood and drove at a normal rate of speed,stopping at stop signs and using his turn signal.after miller confirmed that this was the jetta he had been looking for,he turned on his blue lights and siren.rather than pull over,mitchell continued to drive at a moderate speed for over a minute.at this point,officer david schertz joined the pursuit in his own cruiser.
mitchell,now tailed by two cruisers,sped up and drove down residential side streets at speeds of up to miles per hour.after another forty seconds,mitchell turned down a residential street and,at the end of the street,veered up onto an embankment,coming to rest three to four feet above street level.the remainder of the incident,captured on video,took only seconds to unfold.
as miller parked his cruiser behind the jetta,and schertz parked behind miller,mitchell began backing the jetta down the embankment.miller emerged from the cruiser,and mitchell pulled the jetta abruptly forward two to three feet before stopping.miller approached the jetta with his gun drawn,yelling loudly to mitchell to get out of the car.schertz then exited his cruiser and followed miller.when mitchell did not obey his commands,miller opened the driver side door of the jetta with his left hand,keeping the gun pointed at mitchell with his right.as miller held the door,the jetta again lurched forward.schertz also grabbed the door of the jetta with his left hand.miller then reached into the passenger compartment and began to grapple with mitchell.at one point,miller stepped back slightly and the car rolled backwards.as miller continued to try to get hold of mitchell,the jetta lurched forward several feet,and its wheels turned sharply to the left.both officers sidestepped to keep pace with the moving car.
miller continued to tussle with mitchell as the car once again rolled backwards.schertz repositioned himself somewhat,moving from miller left and in front of the open driver side door,to behind miller.the jetta engine began to rev and its tires squealed as mitchell threw the car into a rapid to the left the side where the officers were standing.miller,still holding the door,was briefly pulled around by the car,but did not fall.miller then fired two shots in mitchell direction.
the jetta sped away.mitchell,with one bullet lodged in his shoulder the other having passed through his neck,drove to a friend house and ingested some opiates.he was later apprehended at the friend house.
in april,mitchell filed suit against miller,the city of portland,and its chief of police.the lawsuit originally alleged four counts,two of which,against the city and the police chief,were voluntarily dismissed.as to the remaining counts,mitchell alleged that miller had violated his fourth amendment rights,and had committed common law assault.miller moved for summary judgment,arguing that he had used reasonable force,and that he was protected by qualified immunity.on september,the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendant on the grounds of qualified immunity for the claim and discretionary act immunity for the assault claim.this appeal followed.
discussion 
mitchell argues that the district court erred by concluding that defendant miller could reasonably have believed at least one other person in the immediate vicinity was in great danger,and by holding that miller was entitled to qualified immunity

a claim that a police officer used excessive force is governed by the fourth amendment reasonableness standard.plumhoff rickard,d.to determine whether an officer actions were objectively reasonable,we must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in so doing,we analyze the totality of the circumstances,taking the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than the vision of hindsight.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
even if it is not clear that the use of force was reasonable,under the doctrine of qualified immunity,a police officer is protected from liability for civil damages under unless it is shown that the officer violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.mcgrath tavares,cir quoting plumhoff.at.an officer can not be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in his shoes would have understood that he was violating it,meaning that existing precedent placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.city and cnty.of san francisco,california sheehan,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted alterations in original.
