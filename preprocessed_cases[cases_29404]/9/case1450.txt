opinion of the court 
leonard young,a pennsylvania prisoner with a long history of mental illness,filed suit alleging that appellees violated his eighth amendment rights by securing him in a restraint chair,naked,for fourteen hours,although he did not pose a threat to himself or others.because we agree with young that the district court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment against him,we will vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
for over six years,young has been held in solitary confinement,housed in either the restrictive housing unit rhu or the mental health unit of different pennsylvania prisons because of his extensive disciplinary history and history of mental illness.since childhood,young has been diagnosed with various forms of mental illness,including bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder.however,since his detention over these past several years in solitary confinement,consisting of isolation for hours per day and one hour of recreation time in a solitary pen on weekdays,young symptoms of mental illness have intensified,including visual and auditory hallucinations,paranoid thoughts,throwing and smearing his own feces,episodes of,and suicidal impulses.indeed,since living in these conditions of prolonged isolation,his numerous suicide attempts have included efforts to hang himself and to break his own neck by banging his head against the wall.
on the evening of september,while young was confined in the rhu at state correctional institution sci greene,his cell door was mistakenly unlocked and left open by a corrections officer co in the control room.he exited his cell,walked up the stairs to the second tier of the rhu,and seated himself on an internal ledge above the law library.what next transpired was captured in the ordinary course by prison surveillance cameras and handheld video cameras operated by 
when other inmates saw young on the roof they began calling to him from their cells.in the meantime,lieutenant kirby and a group of cos gathered on the floor below young.from his perch,young shouted that he was protesting for prisoners rights and for the return of some of his property.two cos watching young from the balcony chatted with each other and laughed as he talked.young remained crouched on the roof voicing his complaints for approximately seven minutes before following the cos orders to step back onto the second tier and to close himself inside the shower.once there,he again complied with orders,placed his hands behind his back,and pushed his forearms through the shower tray slot so the cos could handcuff and then remove him,secured,from the shower.as the cos escorted him to the stairs,young passively refused to walk by laying down on the ground.his ankles then were shackled and the cos carried him down the stairs.young again passively refused to walk when they reached the bottom of the staircase.at no time throughout this incident did young verbally threaten or attempt to physically engage any of the.
after the cos carried young to a nearby corridor and placed him face down on the ground with his hands and ankles cuffed,four cos stood over him and further restrained his limbs.young remained motionless on the ground and did not struggle during this process.however,rather than asking young to submit to a routine strip search and although he had not spit on anyone,the cos placed a spit mask on him and cut off young clothes to perform a prone strip search young complained but did not physically resist the search no contraband was found.
after the search was complete,young,naked,cuffed,and compliant,was hoisted to his knees and photographed for several minutes to record any injuries he may have sustained during the incident.while the pictures were taken,lieutenant kirby left the scene to obtain the requisite authorization for placing young in a restraint chair.young repeatedly asked why he was going to be placed in a restraint chair,but received no answer when the restraint chair arrived,he was strapped into it,naked,and a smock was placed over his lap.again,young did not physically resist the cos but he did object to his treatment.he complained several times that the restraints were too tight and he cried out in pain while being strapped into the chair and again when he was wheeled to a psychiatric observation cell.young also repeatedly asked that the smock on his lap be adjusted to fully cover his genitals,but the cos refused to comply with his request.
at approximately,young was wheeled into the cell and left naked,except for the smock on his lap.upon his arrival,a nurse determined that his straps were too tight and loosened them accordingly.as reflected in the reports generated over the time he spent in the psychiatric observation cell,medical personnel continued to monitor young condition.around,young told a nurse that he wanted to move his hands a bit and was talkative and joking with staff in no distress or pain.young fell asleep in the chair sometime after and woke up at,requesting a shot in the ass of pain medication.he was cooperative,agreed to see a psychiatrist and take medication,and lamented the next time he would be in the restraint chair because that just how it is with him.
later in the morning,young was still naked in the chair and became agitated because of his continued restraint.upset,he told the cos that he would act out when released.because he was loud and making demands,prison officials declined to remove him from the restraint chair.he was finally released a couple hours later once officials were satisfied that he had calmed down.
all told,young was confined in the restraint chair from approximately to approximately the next morning a nearly period that significantly exceeded the maximum recommended by the chair manufacturer and the maximum,absent special authorization,permitted by the prison regulations.see.upon release,young was shaking uncontrollably and repeatedly complained that he was cold down to his bones because of the air conditioning blowing on his naked body for fourteen hours.his legs were so numb that he could not walk,and he had to be wheeled back to the rhu in the chair as defendants counsel conceded at oral argument,there is no evidence in the record that anyone provided the requisite authorization to exceed the prison maximum.oral argument at,available at.martin.
ii.procedural background 
young initiated suit in march and,in august,filed an amended complaint,claiming,among other things,that his placement in the restraint chair was purely punitive and constituted excessive force in violation of the eighth amendment.the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that their actions were justified by young extensive disciplinary history.in addition,young filed a motion to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of an investigative report by the department of justice doj regarding the treatment of mentally ill prisoners in the pennsylvania prison system and also requested that the district court provide him with funding for a mental health expert.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,denied young motion to stay,and declined to allocate funds for an expert.focusing on young paramount claim that defendants violated his eighth amendment rights by subjecting him to a prolonged period of strict mechanical restraint in the restraint chair,the district court concluded that the defendants acted professionally and within constitutional parameters in subduing and placing plaintiff in a restraint chair for about fourteen hours young beard,civ,wl,at.specifically,the district court found that young was agitated and the defendants brought him under control using minimal force especially since he indicated he would act out when released and he was,mentally ill,and suicidal.id.at.the district court also found the record lacked evidence that young suffered actual harm,let alone any risk of serious harm,considering not only the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood that the harm will actually occur,but any evidence that unwilling exposure to that risk violate d contemporary standards of decency.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that the defendants did not use excessive force and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.young timely appealed.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court order granting summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.see tri m,at.we will affirm only if drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ruehl viacom,cir citation omitted see also.a.if,on the other hand,reasonable minds could differ then an issue of material fact remains for the trier of fact,and the grant of summary judgment must be reversed.mamiye sons,fid.bank,cir citations omitted.
iv.analysis 
the main issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants by concluding that they did not violate young eighth amendment rights when they strapped him in a restraint chair,naked,for fourteen hours,in the absence of any imminent threat of bodily harm to himself or others.young argues that his placement in the restraint chair constituted use of excessive force,relying on the supreme court decision in hope pelzer,d appellant br.the defendants argue that we should analyze this as a conditions of confinement case under fuentes wagner,cir.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because it did not analyze the case under hope and failed to draw all reasonable inferences from the facts in young favor.
a.the applicable eighth amendment framework 
the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii whitley albers,d.the supreme court has interpreted this prohibition both to bar prison officials from using excessive force against inmates,see hudson mcmillan,d,and to impose affirmative duties on prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement,see farmer brennan,d.depending on which of these eighth amendment claims a plaintiff seeks to pursue,different elements must be proven and different lines of cases applied.while claims of use of excessive force require consideration of the need for the application of force,the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used,and the extent of injury inflicted,whitley,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,claims concerning conditions of confinement require a plaintiff to show that the prison conditions pos ed a substantial risk of serious harm and that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to that risk,farmer,at.
the parties dispute whether young claims regarding the use of the restraint chair,a mechanical restraint,fall into the category of excessive force or conditions of confinement,and,as one district court has observed,our c ase law does not provide a clear answer for which analysis applies.zimmerman schaeffer,d.we last addressed the issue of whether the use of a restraint chair constituted an eighth amendment violation in fuentes.however,that case,decided before hope,is distinguishable on its facts and left open the issue of whether the use of mechanical restraints should be analyzed under the supreme court excessive force or conditions of confinement jurisprudence.
in fuentes,the inmate began kicking his cell door and yelling for a co,while complaining that another inmate urinated in his cell.at.the cos cuffed fuentes through his food slot and entered his cell to conduct a search.id.a struggle ensued,and the cos eventually wrestled fuentes to the floor.id.fuentes continued to yell while one co held him on the ground as another cuffed his legs.id.at the same time,the assistant warden authorized use of the restraint chair for eight hours,in accord with the prison regulations.id.at.fuentes argued that use of the restraint chair was purely punitive and violated his eighth amendment rights because he was no longer a threat once he was restrained.id.at.because it was undisputed that the prison policy for the use of the restraint chair was followed,we concluded that the prison officials were not deliberately indifferent to fuentes health or wellbeing,consistent with a conditions of confinement analysis.id.at.we also concluded that the prison officials did not place fuentes in the chair maliciously and sadistically to cause harm,consistent with an excessive force analysis.id.at.
despite some facial similarities to young case,the facts of fuentes are sufficiently different that its holding is of limited applicability here for three reasons.first,fuentes placement in the restraint chair occurred contemporaneously with the physical altercation with the.that is,the chair was an instrument used by prison officials to subdue an actively combative prisoner.in contrast,young never engaged in a physical altercation and was placed in the restraint chair while entirely docile.
second,fuentes placement in the restraint chair was in accord with prison regulations,as he posed an immediate threat to the cos,and he was released after eight hours.young,on the other hand,was not an immediate threat to himself or others,as he was shackled and face down on the ground,and there is no evidence that any prison official authorized young confinement in the restraint chair in excess of the maximum otherwise permitted under the prison regulations.see oral argument at,available at http oralargument.martin.
finally,fuentes does not answer the question of what legal framework applies in the face of a claim that the use of mechanical restraints violated a prisoner eighth amendment rights.see zimmerman,d at the third circuit has not since considered the constitutionality of mechanical constraints,but to the extent that fuentes conflict s with hope,the supreme court case is binding authority.the supreme court more recent decision in hope,however,does.
in hope,the supreme court specifically addressed the issue of whether the use of mechanical restraints constituted cruel and unusual punishment.larry hope,an alabama prisoner,fell asleep during a morning bus ride to his chain gang worksite.hope,at.he was less than prompt in responding to an order to get off the bus and eventually got into a wrestling match with a guard.id.hope was handcuffed,placed in leg irons,and transported back to the prison where he was cuffed on a hitching post.id.the guards made him take off his shirt,and he remained shirtless all day while the sun burned his skin.id.at.he was chained to the post for seven hours and was given water only once,denied bathroom breaks,and taunted by the guards.id.at.
after noting that unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain are those that are totally without penological justification,the supreme court concluded that,on the facts alleged by hope,the eighth amendment violation is obvious.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court explained 
any safety concerns had long since abated by the time petitioner was handcuffed to the hitching post because hope had already been subdued,handcuffed,placed in leg irons,and transported back to the prison.he was separated from his work squad and not given the opportunity to return to work.despite the clear lack of an emergency situation,the respondents knowingly subjected him to a substantial risk of physical harm,to unnecessary pain caused by the handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a hour period,to unnecessary exposure to the heat of the sun,to prolonged thirst and taunting,and to a deprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.the use of the hitching post under these circumstances violated the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment,which is nothing less than the dignity of man.trop dulles,d.this punitive treatment amounts to gratuitous infliction of wanton and unnecessary pain that our precedent clearly prohibits.
id.at footnote omitted.
the defendants do not dispute that hope controls as to which eighth amendment test applies to analyze the use of mechanical restraints.see zimmerman,d at hope is the controlling case on the constitutionality of mechanical restraints.they contend,however,that the supreme court in hope applied the conditions of indifference test of farmer brennan.appellees br.we disagree because the language and reasoning of the opinion reflect that the court,in fact,was applying the excessive force test.
after reciting the facts,the supreme court reaffirmed that unnecessary and wanton infliction s of pain constitute cruel and unusual punishment,including those that are totally without penological justification.hope,at quoting whitley,at and rhodes chapman,d internal quotation marks omitted.the court referred to farmer briefly but its analysis of whether the use of mechanical restraints violated the eighth amendment indisputably began and ended in terms drawn from its excessive force jurisprudence,whitley,because it held that hope punitive treatment amounted to the gratuitous infliction of wanton and unnecessary pain that was clearly prohibit ed.id.at.thus,in hope,the supreme court applied its excessive force jurisprudence for the first time to a prisoner allegation that his placement in mechanical restraints was unconstitutional.
we conclude,under hope,that young claims should be analyzed under the excessive force test and that such analysis demonstrates that the district court grant of summary judgment was in error.we now turn to the task of applying this test to the record before us 
application of the excessive force test in light of hope 
the district court concluded that there was no eighth amendment violation because young was violent,was exposed to minimal force,promised to act out if released,and was not punched,kicked or otherwise manhandl ed by the.young,wl,at.we conclude from our independent review of the videotape and record evidence that the district court failed to draw all reasonable inferences in young favor and that,when those inferences are properly drawn,there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the defendants use of the restraint chair in this case violated the eighth amendment.
force that is used maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm violates the eighth amendment.whitley,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.while not every malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action,hudson,at,the a pplication of force by prison guards exceeding that which is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances may be actionable,davidson,cir.see also giles,at an officer may not use gratuitous force against an inmate who has been subdued.
as applied to mechanical restraints,the supreme court in hope identified particular criteria relevant to the use of excessive force test,holding that where the inmate had already been subdued,handcuffed,and placed in leg irons,and there was a clear lack of an emergency situation such that a ny safety concerns had long since abated,then subjecting the inmate to substantial risk of physical harm and unnecessary pain serves no penological justification.hope,at see also rhodes,at among unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain are those that are totally without penological justification.quoting gregg georgia,d.measured by this yardstick,young has raised genuine disputes of material fact for a jury to ascertain whether he suffered an eighth amendment violation.
first,like the inmate in hope,it appears that young was already subdued when subjected to mechanical restraint.he was not violent,combative,or at any point during the incident leading up to his prolonged confinement in the restraint chair.on the contrary,he was safely secured and shackled after voluntarily complying with the cos instructions to step into the shower.and immediately prior to being placed in the restraint chair,he was naked and subdued,face down on the ground and held by four cos,with his hands and legs cuffed.see hope,at see also giles,at striking and kicking a subdued,nonresisting inmate in the side was not reasonable or necessary under established law.given these facts,reasonable minds could differ as to whether young posed a risk to himself or others when he was placed in the restraint chair.see mamiye,at citations omitted.
while the district court found that young threats of future harm were sufficient to justify his extended placement in the restraint chair,the record,when drawing all inferences in young favor,supports a contrary interpretation.video recording reflects that after being strapped in the chair for nearly eight hours,young did comment that he would likely be placed back in the restraint chair because that just how it is,and that,following the stress of nearly fourteen hours of confinement,he was agitated and told two cos he would act out when released.when considered on the whole,however,any number of reasonable inferences could be drawn in young favor from these statements,not the least of which being that the defendants had consistently used the chair to punish young,and that young was upset and angry about an unjustified,punitive confinement.
second,there is ample evidence that the events of september did not rise to the level of an emergency situation,hope,at,despite the district court characterization of a highly energized situation,young,wl,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.young only left his cell because a co inadvertently opened his cell door far from a prison break the incident lasted a mere seven minutes,during which two cos chatted and laughed while they watched the scene unfold and young voluntarily complied with the cos instructions within that short time frame.the cos then removed young,shackled and subdued,from the common area and subjected him in a more controlled space to a prone strip search without resistance.by this point,a reasonable jury could find that a ny safety concerns had long since abated.hope,at.
finally,there is a dispute of fact as to whether,despite the lack of an emergency situation and the evidence that young was already subdued,the prison officials exposed young to a substantial risk of physical harm and unnecessary pain by placing him in the restraint chair.see id.the prison own regulations authorize use of the restraint chair only for protection of self or others,to prevent an inmate from injuring himself or other persons,and to safely restrain a combative or person,id.yet the cos and prison officials not only placed young in the restraint chair but did so for nearly fourteen hours,far exceeding the maximum permitted without special authorization.see hope,at.
at the outset,young restraints were so tight that he cried out in pain,and during the extended period he remained in the restraint chair,young was naked,with his genitals partially exposed and an air conditioner blowing cold air on him.when he was finally released from this extreme confinement,young was shaking uncontrollably and complained that he was cold down to his bones.his legs,numb from the restricted position his body was forced to endure over fourteen hours,could no longer hold his weight and he had to be wheeled back to the rhu.on this record,young is entitled to have a jury determine whether he was subjected to a substantial risk of physical harm without penological justification and whether the defendants thus violated the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment.see hope,at quoting trop,at quotation marks omitted.
in sum,applying the use of excessive force test,analyzing the record under the criteria identified in hope,and drawing all inferences in favor of young as the nonmoving party,we can not say that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
c.the issue of qualified immunity 
the defendants also ask us in a single sentence to affirm on the ground of qualified immunity.the district court did not reach the issue and the availability of the defense was not briefed on appeal.in hope,the supreme court held that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity because their actions violated clearly established sta
