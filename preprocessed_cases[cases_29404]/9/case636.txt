joseph benoit benoit appeals an award of summary judgment to defendant technical manufacturing corporation tmc on his claims of discrimination and retaliation on account of disability,race,color,and national origin in violation of a number of federal and massachusetts statutes.agreeing with the district court that no genuine issue of material fact exists,we affirm.
factual background 
benoit is a black male of haitian origin.in october,tmc hired benoit as a finisher.tmc manufactures specialized optical and laboratory tables and tabletop platforms.benoit job duties included checking the flatness of completed tables,installing table siding and corners,building wooden crates for the tables,and crating the finished tables for shipping.benoit was an employee.
job performance 
benoit was a capable worker who consistently received annual ratings for his job performance.his skills and ability were recognized by his former supervisors,david byrne and manuel eugenio,as well as by the owner of tmc,ulf heide.heide described benoit as a very talented employee who was capable of very good work.but this did not mean that benoit experience at tmc was a smooth one.although benoit displayed technical proficiency,he was late or absent during the work week for out of weeks in,out of weeks in,and out of weeks in,the year in which he was fired.tmc fired seven employees for excessive absenteeism between and,five of whom were white.
benoit annual performance evaluations reflected both his work performance and his problems with tardiness and absenteeism.in and,benoit received many ratings of exceptional for his work ability,yet received the lowest possible rating for attendance and punctuality.his boss,eugenio,frequently reprimanded benoit about this behavior.
on september,benoit received a formal written warning that identified his lateness as habitual and cautioned him that if it continued,he would be disciplined with a suspension.tmc employment handbook states that p oor attendance and excessive tardiness are disruptive.either may lead to disciplinary action,up to and including termination of employment.the handbook also describes the various kinds of disciplinary action that may be taken at tmc discretion,including verbal warnings,written warnings,suspension,and termination.although the section entitled progressive discipline indicates that these steps will normally be followed in order,the handbook also states that under some circumstances one or more of the steps may be bypassed altogether.
on march,eugenio,heide,teresa drelick tmc vice president and chief financial officer,and jim hansen tmc vice president of manufacturing spoke with benoit about his attendance problems.after this meeting,benoit punctuality and dependability improved somewhat.in october,benoit performance evaluation noted this improvement but stated that benoit attendance still needed work.benoit more regular attendance additionally allowed him to compete in the attendance pool an incentive scheme that allowed those employees who had perfect attendance for one month to submit their names for a cash prize.benoit won this pool on three or four separate occasions.
despite his improved attendance,benoit was ultimately fired on march,without any further written warning,and without any suspension prior to termination.
work relations 
benoit had other conflicts at work,all of which involved eugenio and hansen.one day in july,benoit wanted to leave early,and he and a,steve maxwell,agreed that maxwell would finish benoit work for him.when benoit told eugenio that he would be leaving early,eugenio questioned his decision but allowed him to go.
immediately upon his return the next day,benoit was told by eugenio to complete the work he had left unfinished the previous day.when benoit asked maxwell why the work was not completed,maxwell explained that eugenio would not let him finish benoit work.benoit confronted eugenio,who began to yell at benoit for failing to finish the work.benoit asked to see hansen immediately.eugenio agreed,but told benoit that he had to wait outside.interpreting this comment as a demand that he leave the building,benoit waited outside in the equipment yard until hansen arrived.benoit felt that this treatment was unfair and demeaning.after speaking with benoit,hansen supported eugenio.
benoit eventually complained to hansen,on february,that eugenio routinely treated him worse than his white and asian.benoit stated that eugenio disparate treatment was evident from eugenio practices of disciplining him in front of everyone and writing him up for his poor attendance even when he had an excuse.benoit also made reference to a number of specific incidents,including the unfinished work incident in,an incident during which eugenio screamed at benoit because he left his work station two minutes before break to use the men room,and an incident during which eugenio told benoit that if he left early on a friday,he would not be eligible to work overtime on saturday.a written summary of these complaints was made,and tmc began a formal inquiry into the matter.
on february,benoit signed a more detailed complaint,which was sent to drelick.benoit additionally complained about discriminatory treatment at a meeting with drelick,hansen,heide,and eugenio on march.in notes written by heide at the meeting,heide observed that eugenio was a very demanding boss,but stated that he was also their best supervisor when it comes to knowing what a good day work is.heide suggested that the real problem was not race,but benoit failure to appreciate the disruptive effect he caused by continually arriving at work late and leaving early.heide further stated that eugenio treatment of benoit was not picking on him but was a simple expectation of department efficiency.
benoit believed that his treatment by eugenio only worsened after making these complaints.on february,eugenio ordered benoit to clean up a mess another employee had left in the workroom.benoit told eugenio that the mess was not his,but eugenio insisted that benoit clean it anyway.hansen later discussed this incident with benoit on the assembly floor,stating if i drop this cup of coffee on the ground,and ask you to come and clean it up,you just have to do it.hansen then approached benoit and told him that if he did get off the shop floor,he could get hurt.benoit interpreted hansen demeanor as threatening.although there is no record of any formal complaint,benoit states that he reported this incident to heide,and shortly afterwards was approached by hansen,who told him never to discuss the incident with anyone again.benoit also stated that hansen apologized for his behavior after the incident.
physical effects of employment 
benoit job was physically demanding.benoit and his often had to move tables measuring up to twenty feet long and weighing up to pounds.benoit began complaining orally to eugenio about back pain in.he suggested that tmc install simple stands to take the pressure off his back when crating and packaging tables.at least one other department at tmc used stands similar to those benoit was requesting,but in benoit department,tmc supplied a forklift,which was rarely used because it was quite time consuming to operate.in,tmc also made a pulley available for assistance with lifting.other than the addition of the pulley,which was made available independent of any requests by benoit,no accommodation was made.
benoit did not see a doctor regarding his back pain until march.the day before his doctor appointment,on march,benoit hand slipped off a table and he twisted his back.he immediately reported the injury to eugenio.the next day,benoit went to his previously scheduled appointment,where he told the doctor that his back pain had begun about six weeks after he began working for tmc,and had steadily worsened.the doctor diagnosed low back strain and strain of the knees with possible early osteoarthritis.he further explained that some of the pain was caused by improper lifting techniques,and that a major contributing factor may have been the fact that benoit had gained pounds over the last years.the doctor did not prescribe any drug treatment for the pain,nor did he give benoit any instructions to limit himself to light duty at work.he did,however,schedule benoit for further tests,and he suggested that benoit talk to his employer about the problem.
benoit returned to work on friday,march,and told hansen about his recent work injury and doctor visit.benoit did not have a similarly detailed conversation with eugenio.benoit was subsequently put to work as a grinder,grinding the tops and edges of the tables in preparation for finishing.although the duties of a grinder require no bending and are less strenuous than those of a finisher,hansen denies having officially put benoit on light duty.benoit had worked as a grinder on previous occasions,despite the fact that grinding was not part of his job description.
benoit continued to work as a grinder on the following monday,march.at the end of the day,hansen met with benoit and told him that he had been fired.he did not give benoit any reason for his termination other than,i have to let you go.although hansen informed benoit of his termination,it is undisputed that drelick alone made the decision to fire benoit.drelick had no knowledge of benoit recent injury or longstanding back problems when she made this decision.
ii.procedural background 
approximately two months after his termination,on may,benoit filed a charge of discrimination against tmc with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad,alleging discrimination and reprisal.in response,tmc filed an mcad position statement dated july,stating that benoit was not discriminated against,but was fired for repeated refusal to perform his job duties and repeated failure to meet performance standards.
on february,benoit filed this action,claiming that tmc discriminated against him on the basis of his race,national origin,or color in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,title vii and.laws ch.chapter tmc unlawfully retaliated against him for his complaints about his treatment based on race,national origin,or color in violation of title vii tmc discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of title ix of the americans with disabilities act,ada and chapter tmc retaliated against him in violation of the ada and tmc retaliated against him in violation of.laws ch,the commonwealth workers compensation act workers compensation act.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support benoit claims.in granting the motion,the district court concluded that benoit had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability and retaliation,and that benoit had failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that tmc stated reason for his termination was a pretext for racial discrimination.this appeal followed.
iii.legal analysis 
summary judgment standard 
we review summary judgment rulings de novo,construing the record evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.straughn delta air lines,cir feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.even in employment discrimination cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue,summary judgment is appropriate if the party rests merely upon conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.feliciano,at quoting reynolds tobacco,cir internal quotations omitted.
discrimination under title vii and chapter 
benoit first contends that the district court erred in awarding tmc summary judgment on his discrimination claims.where,as here,there is no direct evidence of discrimination we apply the mcdonnell framework.see straughn,at feliciano,at see also mcdonnell douglas green,d texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d mary honor ctr.hicks,d.although created for use in title vii cases,this framework is also applied when evaluating discrimination claims under chapter.mullin raytheon,cir see also lewis city of boston,cir employing the framework in analyzing a discrimination claim under chapter.under this rubric,benoit carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas,at.
to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination,benoit must show that he belonged to a protected class,a racial minority he was performing his job at a level that rules out the possibility that he was fired for job performance he suffered an adverse job action by his employer and his employer sought a replacement for him with roughly equivalent qualifications.smith stratus computer,cir see also hicks,at.mcdonnell douglas,at.this initial burden is not an onerous one,burdine,at,and we shall assume arguendo that benoit has satisfied it 
having made this assumption,we take the second step in our inquiry whether tmc has articulated a legitimate,reason for its adverse employment action.straughn,at citing mcdonnell douglas,at.tmc claims that it discharged benoit because of his persistent tardiness and frequent absences,and because of his unwillingness to work cooperatively with his supervisor.this explanation satisfies tmc burden of providing a reason for its conduct.
where,as here,the employer proffers a nondiscriminatory reason for its action,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the reason was a coverup for a discriminatory decision.straughn,at internal quotations omitted.in assessing pretext,the court must look at the total package of proof offered by the plaintiff.see mesnick,cir.
here,benoit has not provided sufficient evidence for a jury to disbelieve tmc stated reasons for termination,let alone that those reasons masked racial discrimination.benoit has not shown that any other similarly situated employee was treated differently.perkins brigham women,cir holding that the individuals with whom a plaintiff seeks to be compared must have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances as would distinguish their conduct or the employer treatment of them for it.nor has he established that tmc failed to fire other employees despite habitual or frequent absences,tardiness,or conflicts with their supervisors.to the contrary,the record shows that tmc discharged seven employees for excessive absenteeism between and,five of whom were white.
it is true that benoit attendance improved somewhat during the last six months of his employment.but one performance review stating that benoit attendance was better but still needs improvement is insufficient to create a trialworthy issue as to pretext,especially since attendance issues were not the only reasons given by tmc for firing benoit.in any event,benoit was late or absent during eight out of his last twelve weeks of work.no rational factfinder could find for benoit on the pretext evidence that has been adduced.byrd ronayne,cir deeming insufficient plaintiff evidence of one favorable performance review months prior to termination,mixed performance evaluations later in that year,and two performance bonuses.
retaliation under title vii 
benoit next argues that the district court erred in awarding tmc summary judgment on his claim that he was discharged in retaliation for engaging in conduct protected by title vii.as a matter of law,benoit retaliation claim may be viable even if the underlying discrimination claim is not.mesnick,at citing petitti new england,cir.moreover,the employment activity or practice that benoit opposed need not be a title vii violation so long as benoit had a reasonable belief that it was,and he communicated that belief to his employer in good faith.higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir.
to establish his prima facie case of retaliation under a,benoit must show that he engaged in protected activity he suffered an adverse employment action after or contemporaneous with such activity and there existed a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse job action.wyatt city of boston,cir.benoit has failed to establish a trialworthy issue as to the last of these three elements.
