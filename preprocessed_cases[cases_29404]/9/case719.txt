gary collins was once a used car dealer,operating a lot called the car place along the revere beach parkway in everett,massachusetts.he did so by grace of a license from everett board of aldermen.collins fell out of grace,having repeatedly violated the terms of his license,and his relationship with the board was marked by acrimony and litigation.the board in denied his application for a new annual license.collins thought the board was retaliating for his having sued them.to make matters worse in collins eyes,the new licensee who operated on collins old site was given more generous license terms.
collins responded by filing this suit against the board in late.the complaint alleged that the board denied collins application arbitrarily and maliciously,partly in retaliation for his lawsuit,depriving him of his constitutional rights.one board member,david ravanesi,was singled out as having particular personal animosity against collins and as having defamed him.in collins heard that someone,he suspected ravanesi,was spreading the word that collins sold more than cars at the lot and collins,understandably,did not like the suggestion he was selling drugs.thus,he amended his complaint in to add a state law claim for defamation against ravanesi.
invoking the stringent standards for substantive due process and equal protection claims against public officials for denying licenses,the district court concluded that collins evidence did not meet the mark.the court reached the same conclusion on the retaliation claim.the court also concluded that collins should have acted sooner on the defamation claims in light of the applicable statute of limitations,and rejected collins claim that the discovery rule excused his late filing.summary judgment was entered against collins.he appeals.the civil rights claims are easily disposed of,and we affirm.application of the statute of limitations to the defamation claim in light of the discovery rule presents a closer question.
on review of a grant of summary judgment,we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.thomas eastman kodak,cir,cert.denied,d.
