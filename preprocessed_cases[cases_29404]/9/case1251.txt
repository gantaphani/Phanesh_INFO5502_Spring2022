john canzoneri,superintendent of schools of the chester union free school district,and michael mallon,mary luciana,christine,michael monroe,and john behler,members of board of education for the district collectively,the individual defendants,appeal from an interlocutory order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant.the order rejected the defense of qualified immunity interposed by the individual defendants in response to a claim brought against them by jacqueline under for violation of the uniform services employment and reemployment rights act userra.
cross appeals from an interlocutory order by the same court denying reconsideration of the dismissal of one of her claims against,board of education of the chester union free school district the board.the claim charged violations of userra and the new york military law and was dismissed by the district court on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity,the court having classified the board as an entity of the state of new york.for the reasons that follow,we dismiss both the appeal and the.
background 
was hired by the board as an elementary school principal in the chester union free school district,and commenced employment in that capacity in august of.at the time of her employment,the board was aware that held a commission as a major in the united states army reserve and,as such,was subject to calls to military training and active duty.on six separate occasions from october through october,submitted leave requests to the board for brief periods of military service.the military orders giving rise to the requests called for training service for periods of days at a time.during those periods,was unable to perform her duties as elementary school principal,and some of the individual defendants apparently expressed their displeasure over her absences.
according to the complaint,defendant behler,a board member,asked in july of to place his child in a looping class so that the child,a student,would remain with the same teacher for the fifth grade.denied the request as inconsistent with the policy for such placement.the school district superintendent,defendant canzoneri,then told her that behler child should be placed in the class.alleges that when she alluded to the appearance of favoritism in such a request,defendant canzoneri told her that there were rumors that she was taking too much time with her military reserve obligations,with specific reference to her military leave in june,which had coincided with day.on december,defendant canzoneri notified,who was serving a probationary term as elementary school principal,that he would recommend to the board that her employment be terminated.in response to a request for a statement of the reasons for the termination,defendant canzoneri,on december,sent a letter to setting forth his reasons.as pleaded in the complaint 
canzoneri claimed that plaintiff was inaccessible to staff and parents that she failed to organize student activities for board of education recognition night that she failed to honor his request to meet with clerical staff in her office failed to timely complete class lists at the beginning of the school year and had failed to note that certain aspects of the curriculum were not referenced on lesson plans and that certain requirements imposed by the mentor teachers were unrealistic.
provided a written response to the canzoneri letter,with copies to the board.in the letter,she disputed the reasons given by defendant canzoneri and expressed the opinion that his recommendation was based on her military service requirements and her failure to accommodate the request of board member behler regarding class placement for his son.on january,the board terminated the employment of,effective february.
the original complaint in this action was filed on january,and included two claims.in the first claim,charged all of the defendants with violations of the userra,et,and new york military law in terminat ing her employment on account of her military service.in the second claim,charged all of the defendants with deprivation of her first amendment rights,under,for terminat ing her employment on account of her speech resisting defendant behler improper attempt to influence class placement.
by motion filed on january,the board,as well as the individual defendants,moved for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the claims asserted by in her original complaint.the contentions put forward in the motion were the board is the only entity against which the userra and new york military law claims could be asserted,and it is immune from suit in federal court on those claims under the eleventh amendment claims against the board under userra must be brought in the state court the board is entitled to assert eleventh amendment immunity as to the section claim and the new york military law claim is barred by section of the new york education law,requiring service of a notice of claim before an action may be brought against a school district.
by unpublished memorandum and order dated march,entered march,the district court dismissed the claims made against the board under the userra and the new york military law and denied the motion in all other respects.the district court determined that the board is an arm of the state of new york,applying the test set forth in rosa connelly,cir to determine whether a local board of education is an arm of the state and thus entitled to eleventh amendment protection from suit in federal court,a court must determine the degree to which the entity is supervised by the state and the entity source of funds for satisfying judgments against it.also cited was a new york court of appeals decision,lanza wagner,describing a school district as an independent corporation created by the state for the purpose of carrying on a purely state function,as well as two unpublished opinions issued by the district court itself.
as to the userra and new york military law claims against the individual defendants,the district court determined that they were not employers within the statutory definition of those prohibited from discriminating on the basis of military service.the court noted that new york education law b authorizes termination of probationary employees only by boards of education,that a majority vote of the board is required for termination,and that was fired by the board as an entity,not by the individual members of the board or the superintendent.
after putting forth the reasons for the dismissal of the userra and new york military law claims against the board and the individual defendants,the district court expressed its deep concern that a member of the military in time of war should be denied the protection of an act of congress,of universal application,simply because she happens to be employed by an arm of the state of new york.the court observed that,if there was any discrimination because of military service,it would represent the unauthorized act of a few individuals acting under color of state law and in violation of their public trust.
in view of the foregoing observations,the court determined that an action under could be maintained by against the individual defendants to redress the denial of her federal statutory rights under userra.to support that determination,the court cited annis county of westchester,cir,for the proposition that a claim may be maintained whenever a defendant acting under color of state law denies a plaintiff her federal rights.the district court concluded that the individual defendants acting under color of state law violated federal statutory rights as a military reservist,and that t his wrong doing is actionable under,as is retaliation for speaking out against favoritism in class assignment,a matter of public interest and therefore first amendment protected speech.the court noted that enforcement of the userra through section was not briefed by the parties but provided that could if so advised,file an amended complaint consistent with the foregoing,but this was not required.the court declined to enter final judgment as to any parties or claims pursuant to.b.
did in fact file an amended complaint on march,adding a claim alleging as follows defendants wilfully and knowingly terminated plaintiff employment on account of her military service,violating her federal statutory rights as a military reservist,as made actionable through.in response to her request for clarification,the district court on march,issued a further memorandum and order.it provided that all claims against the board were dismissed,that the userra and new york military law claims against the individual defendants were dismissed,and that a ll claims pursuant to as against the i ndividual defendants remain ed,and were not dismissed.it also provided that n o interlocutory judgment will be signed.
prior to the issuance of the memorandum and order of march,had moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of her claim against the district and to certify the eleventh amendment issue to this court.after the issuance of the march memorandum and order,the individual defendants sought dismissal on the ground of qualified immunity as to the claim added in the amended complaint.in an oral decision issued from the bench on april,the district judge rejected the claim of qualified immunity,stating,in part i do see how anybody in education is so foolish or so uninformed to think that you can lawfully discriminate against somebody in connection with his work because he or she has a military obligation.i just ca imagine that.as to the eleventh amendment immunity issue,the court adhered to its prior determination that precedent dictated that the board of education be considered an arm of the state.challenging those determinations,this appeal and followed.
a the appeal qualified immunity and the enforceability of userra under section.
title provides 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
it is settled that authorizes actions to enforce the rights of individuals under federal statutes as well as under the constitution.see maine thiboutot,d.userra is a federal statute that contains a protected federal right.it provides 
a person who is a member of,applies to be a member of,performs,has performed,applies to perform,or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,application for membership,performance of service,application for service,or obligation.
in accordance with her amended pleading asserting an additional claim under,proposed to prove that the individual defendants acted under color of state law when,as members of the board,they terminated her employment and that as a result of their actions she suffered denial of her federal rights under userra,which protects against employment discrimination based on military service obligations.see annis county of westchester,cir setting forth the elements of a claim.the individual defendants sought to defeat this claim in the district court on the basis of qualified immunity.as public officials,they are protected by qualified immunity from civil liability for actions taken in their official capacity,if those actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established rules then extant.see anderson creighton,d poe leonard,cir.
accordingly,can not prevail without a showing that the individual defendants violated clearly established statutory rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on qualified immunity when the immunity can be ascertained as a matter of law on the version of the facts advanced by plaintiff.bizzarro miranda,cir.an interlocutory order denying qualified immunity is appealable because it answers the question of whether or not there will be a trial.see latrieste rest.cabaret village of port chester,cir.
addressing the issue of qualified immunity,the district judge stated that he did not see how anybody in education is so foolish or so uninformed to think that you can lawfully discriminate against somebody in connection with his work because he or she has a military obligation.in effect,the district court determined that the actions of the individual defendants in firing were not objectively reasonable and therefore rejected the defense of qualified immunity.
although this interlocutory appeal is properly before us in the first instance because it challenges the denial of qualified immunity as a defense to the enforcement of userra through,we find it unnecessary to pass on the viability of the qualified immunity defense in this case.instead,we hold that userra is not a statute for which redress is available against the individual defendants under.we therefore dismiss the appeal on the ground that the issue of qualified immunity is moot.
it is that does not create a federal right or benefit it simply provides a mechanism for enforcing a right or benefit established elsewhere.see oklahoma city tuttle,d.but even where it can be demonstrated that a particular federal statute establishes an individual right,
there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.because the inquiry focuses on congressional intent,dismissal is proper if congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under.congress may do so expressly,by forbidding recourse to in the statute itself,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.

in issuing the interlocutory orders in this case,the learned district court did not have the benefit of the supreme court opinion in city of rancho palos verdes,california,et abrams,d,which was decided on march.the respondent there proposed to construct an antenna tower on his property and sought to enforce against the petitioners the limitations on local zoning authority set forth in c b v of the telecommunications act of,c,as amended by the telecommunications act of tca.specifically,the supreme court inquiry was directed to whether the respondent could enforce his federal statutory rights under the tca by bringing an action under.id.at inquiring whether the rights created by the tca may be asserted within the remedial framework of alteration and emphasis in original.
under c of the tca,local governments may not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services,c b i i,take actions that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services,c b i ii,or limit the placement of wireless facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,c b iv.id.at.local governments must act on request for authorization to locate wireless facilities within a reasonable period of time,c b ii,and each decision denying such a request must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record,c b iii.id.at.
most importantly,the supreme court noted that 
a ny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may,within thirty days after such action or failure to act,commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
id.quoting c b v.moreover the court noted that the tca provides that courts must hear and decide such an action on an expedited basis.id.at quoting c b v.in reversing the ninth circuit,which allowed the petitioner to maintain an action grounded in the provisions of the tca but enforced by an action brought under section,the supreme court explained that does not provide an avenue for relief every time a state actor violates a federal law and that permits the enforcement
