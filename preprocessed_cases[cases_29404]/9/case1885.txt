plaintiffs who prevail in suits to vindicate civil rights are entitled to attorneys fees unless special circumstances make a fee award unjust.
here,plaintiff steven lefemine,leader of the columbia christians for life,successfully sued various greenwood county sheriff office officials for first amendment violations.but the district court deemed the defendants qualified immunity,the absence of a policy or custom of discrimination against abortion protestors by the greenwood county sheriff office,and the limited nature of lefemine injunctive relief to be special circumstances that made the award of attorneys fees to lefemine unjust we,however,hold that the relief lefemine obtained was notably broader than the district court suggested and that the other two circumstances are not special and do not render a section fee award unjust.accordingly,we reverse.
in november,lefemine and other members of his group columbia christians for life demonstrated on a public sidewalk at the busiest intersection in greenwood county,south carolina.lefemine wideman,hmh,wl,at.they held large signs with graphic images of aborted fetuses hoping to shock the consciences of those who saw the signs and thereby convey columbia christians for life message.lefemine wideman,cir,vacated.

the following year,an attorney for the national legal foundation sent a letter on behalf of columbia christians for life to sheriff dan wideman.the letter informed sheriff wideman that volunteers will be returning to the greenwood area again in the near future to exercise their first amendment freedoms by highlighting the national tragedy of abortion.the letter asserted that major smith actions the previous year constituted discrimination and a clear violation of its members first amendment rights.id.finally,the letter warned that any further interference with columbia christians for life message by you or your officers will leave us no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies without further notice.id.

in october,lefemine filed a suit alleging first amendment violations and seeking a declaratory judgment,a permanent injunction,damages,and attorneys fees.following a hearing on the parties for summary judgment,the district court held that the officers had violated lefemine first amendment rights and enjoined the officers from engaging in restrictions on lefemine display of graphic signs without narrowly tailoring the restriction to serve a compelling state interest.lefemine davis,d.
nevertheless,the district court held that lefemine could not recover damages.it concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitutionality of their conduct had not previously been clearly established.the court further held that lefemine failed to establish that the sheriff office had a custom or policy of infringing on citizens first amendment rights.finally,the district court refused to award lefemine attorneys fees.
on appeal,this court affirmed on all issues.lefemine sought and was granted certiorari by the united states supreme court,which ultimately rebuffed our holding that lefemine did not qualify as a prevailing party under section and thus was not entitled to attorneys fees.the supreme court held that the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff,thereby making him a prevailing party.lefemine wideman.however,because n either of the courts below addressed whether any special circumstances exist ed in this case making a fee award unjust,id.at,the supreme court remanded to us,and we,in turn,remanded to the district court to award fees unless the court determined by express findings that special circumstances rendered such an award unjust.
on remand,the district court found three special circumstances that made an attorneys fees award to lefemine unjust the defendants qualified immunity,the absence of a policy or custom of discrimination against abortion protestors by the greenwood county sheriff office,and the limited nature of the injunctive relief.lefemine,wl,at.with this appeal,we now review the district court ruling denying lefemine his attorneys fees under the abuse of discretion standard.mercer duke,cir a district court decision to grant or deny attorney fee s under s ection is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
