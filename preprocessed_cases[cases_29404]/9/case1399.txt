this appeal requires us to determine whether in the law was clearly established that a police officer must have probable cause to seize another police officer in the course of a criminal investigation.thomas cerrone,a new york state police trooper,was detained and questioned by fellow officers during a criminal investigation of a suspected of a accident.cerrone sued the investigating officers,including lieutenant scott brown and captain thomas fresenius of the inspection section of the new york state police,and others,for damages pursuant to for violations of his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights to be free from an unreasonable seizure.on january,the united states district court for the northern district of new york thomas mcavoy,senior district judge denied appellants motion for summary judgment and found that issues of fact precluded finding them entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.this appeal followed.
in his complaint,cerrone alleges that the defendants held him for questioning without probable cause.in support of their claim of qualified immunity,appellants argue that in,the time of the seizure in this case,the law was not clearly established that probable cause was required to detain a police officer for questioning in the context of an investigation arising out of the performance of his official duties.in the alternative,appellants argue that if probable cause were required,the district court misapplied the standard for determining whether the defendants conduct was nonetheless objectively they had arguable probable cause to justify the seizure in this case.
we hold that in the law was clearly established that a seizure of a police officer in the context of a criminal investigation required probable cause.however,because we agree with the appellants that the district court applied the wrong standard to determine whether their conduct was objectively reasonable,and failed to examine whether reasonable police officers could disagree as to the existence of probable cause given the information the arresting officers had,we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
the district court has described the facts of this case in considerable detail.see cerrone cahill,d.we summarize only those facts most relevant to this appeal.
in september,the new york state police received a letter describing a accident that had occurred in april or may of.the letter identified the driver as one rory knapp and alleged that rory knapp brother timothy knapp,a new york state police trooper,had assisted him in covering up the accident.the letter stated that rory knapp had hidden his car in trooper knapp garage to avoid detection,and suggested in cryptic terms that several state troopers in the peekskill barracks were aware of the the truth lies within the four walls of that barracks.though the letter appeared to have been authored by a man named ed scott,the author identity was never verified.the letter did not mention cerrone by name nor did it suggest that he was involved in a.
the letter sparked an investigation into the incident.appellants fresenius and brown were assigned to the investigation under the supervision of defendant inspector michael cahill,who is not a party to this appeal.their investigation revealed that on april,a car accident had taken place as described in the letter rory knapp,driving a car owned by his companion,dawn brissett,crossed into the wrong lane of traffic and struck maureen hunt vehicle.hunt suffered minor injuries.brissett later told police investigators that rory knapp had told her about his involvement in the accident.she stated that the day after the accident,rory knapp hid the car beside his brother trooper knapp house,leaving it there until he took it to be destroyed.
the investigators ultimately concluded that the trooper who responded to the scene and prepared an accident report,robert gregory,had failed to conduct a thorough investigation.appellant brown learned from witnesses that the victim had provided gregory with a description of the car,a partial license plate number,and items of the perpetrator clothing found at the accident scene.however,it was apparent from a review of gregory report that gregory did not follow up on these leads instead he wrote in his report that further investigation revealed no new clues,leads,suspects.operator of vehicle could offer no new information.cerrone signed gregory report as a supervisor.
margaret murphy,a bartender at an establishment near the accident scene,told an investigator that she was friends with both rory knapp and sergeant welsh,cerrone direct supervisor and the state police officer in charge of the zone in which the peekskill state police station was located.she stated that knapp and welsh were friends with each other and that rory knapp had admitted to her that after the accident he had called welsh,who told him not to worry about it as he would take care of it.
based upon the investigation,appellant brown concluded that it was reasonable to believe that sergeant cerrone was directly implicated in the as a result of at least the following facts,which reasonably appeared to be true to the investigation team cerrone was station commander at the peekskill station,and thus would be expected to be aware of all of the activities at the station cerrone was on duty when the accident occurred and went to the scene to the extent that zone sergeant welsh,cerrone direct supervisor,had assisted in the,he could not have done it without including cerrone cerrone failed to find the car involved in the accident,despite having been given a detailed description of the car and the fact that it was placed in two locations that were frequently passed by officers of the peekskill barracks cerrone signed the accident report prepared by trooper gregory,which the appellants had determined was incomplete.see cerrone,d at.
on january,appellant brown met with defendant gerald connolly of the westchester county district attorney office,who is not a party to this appeal,to discuss possible criminal charges arising out of the.according to brown,connolly indicated to him that they would have a stronger case if they were able to get an oral admission from one of the targets.
on january,the investigative team discussed a possible criminal case based on the alleged.on that day,the district court found,d efendants decided to stop cerrone on his way home from work,question him in connection with the april accident,and determine if he would cooperate with the investigation.id.at.an agent of the new york state bureau of criminal investigation,lieutenant john edward grant,provided the investigators with a psychological profile of cerrone in order to assist them in conducting the planned interview.see id.
on january,using an unmarked police car,the defendants stopped cerrone.they asked whether he was carrying a weapon,allegedly placed him in the felony position,placed him in the back of an unmarked police car where he was guarded,transported him to a hotel room,read him his miranda rights,and informed him that he was the target of a criminal investigation.id.after approximately six hours of questioning,cerrone was told he could leave after he agreed to take a polygraph examination,which he took the next day.id.cerrone was never charged with a crime.
cerrone sued the defendant police officers under for damages based on the deprivation of his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.appellants brown and fresenius moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity.appellants appeal the district court denial of that motion.
discussion 
we review de novo a decision denying a government official motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.see tellier fields,cir.
the district court held that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on summary judgment because the law was clearly established at the time of the seizure that probable cause was required to seize a police officer for the purpose of a criminal investigation and an issue of fact existed as to whether defendants actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.see cerrone,d at.
appellants concede for purposes of this appeal that their actions with respect to cerrone on january,amounted to a seizure under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.they argue,however,that the district court erred in two respects,asserting that the law was not clearly established in as to the level of individualized suspicion necessary to seize a police officer in order to investigate misconduct arising out of the performance of his official duties and even if the law were clearly established that probable cause was required,appellants conduct was objectively reasonable because they had arguable probable cause to seize cerrone.in this regard,they argue that the district court applied the wrong legal standard and thus erroneously found material facts in dispute to deny their qualified immunity claim.we consider each argument in turn.
a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity from liability for his discretionary actions if either his conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,harlow fitzgerald,d,or it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.lennon miller,cir citing anderson creighton,d.
focusing on the first element in a qualified immunity analysis,the existence of a clearly established right,the supreme court has explained this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.anderson,at.internal citation omitted.thus,
i n deciding whether a particular right was clearly established as of a particular time,we must determine i whether the right at issue was defined with reasonable clarity ii whether the supreme court or the second circuit had affirmed the existence of the right and iii whether reasonable police officers in the defendants position would have understood from the existing law that their conduct was unlawful.
townes city of new york,cir,cert.denied,d.
there can be little doubt that at the time of cerrone seizure,it was clearly established law that the fourth amendment prohibited police seizures of persons for custodial brief detentions falling short of probable cause.see dunaway new york,d holding that detention for custodial interrogation intrudes so severely on interests protected by the fourth amendment as necessarily to trigger the traditional safeguards against illegal arrest and to require probable cause davis mississippi,d holding that the fourth amendment applies during the investigative,as well as accusatory,stage katz united states,d.the fourteenth amendment extends this constitutional guarantee to searches and seizures by state officers.see elkins united states,d.
appellants,however,maintain that the law was not clearly established in that the fourth and fourteenth amendments prohibited police seizures of other police officers without probable cause.they assert that regardless of whether such a seizure is for the purpose of a criminal investigation,probable cause is not required when the suspected police misconduct occurs during the performance of an officer official duties.like the district court,we disagree.
the fact that the person seized was a police officer does not alter a fourth amendment analysis,for policemen,like teachers and lawyers,are not relegated to a version of constitutional rights.garrity new jersey,d holding that police officers enjoy the same rights as other citizens.
in support of their argument,appellants point to several cases in which this court has upheld searches or seizures of police officers or other government employees in the absence of probable cause,see,biehunik felicetta,cir,and maintain that the distinction between those cases requiring probable cause and those requiring something less should be whether the investigation arises out of the performance of the employee duties,regardless of its purpose.they assert that police employment gives rise to special considerations that must be taken into account in considering the reasonableness of searches and seizures.steps taken to assure employees trustworthy performance of their assigned tasks as policemen are reasonable under the fourth amendment,quoting biehunik,at.appellants also assert that this exception rests upon the substantial public interest in ensuring the appearance and actuality of police integrity,again quoting biehunik,at.
we are not persuaded by appellants argument,as it would erode the principle that a criminal suspect who is a policeman enjoys the same rights as other suspects.see garrity,at.the crucial question is not whether the investigation involves actions arising out of a police officer duties,but whether the investigation objective is to discipline the officer within the department or to seek criminal prosecution.
we have permitted police seizures of police officers based upon less than probable cause in connection with internal administrative or disciplinary proceedings.in biehunik,for example,we upheld as reasonable,despite the absence of any individualized suspicion,a lineup of police officers for identification in the context of an internal investigation of police misconduct.the biehunik court found that investigations with different purposes require different degrees of individualized suspicion 
in the familiar criminal arrest context,the reasonableness of a seizure of the person is indeed usually measured by the existence vel non of probable cause.but we can not accept the contention that this principle,well established as it may be,must be applied inflexibly even in cases far removed from the criminal arrest arena.
biehunik,at.distinguishing the facts there from the typical criminal investigation the court noted 
the lineup was ordered by that official of the police department charged with running an efficient and police was clearly and highly relevant to the legitimate end of assuring his employees trustworthy performance of their assigned tasks.commissioner felicetta reference in his order directing the lineup to a possible criminal prosecution did not dilute the potential usefulness of the lineup in administering disciplinary measures.we therefore need not consider at this time the propriety of enjoining a similar lineup conducted exclusively with criminal prosecution in mind.
id.at footnote omitted.thus,biehunik drew a distinction based upon whether the purpose of a seizure is exclusively to aid a criminal investigation,or simply to seek internal discipline 
we do not believe that the public must tolerate failure by responsible officials to seek out,identify,and appropriately discipline policemen responsible for brutal or unlawful behavior in the line of duty,merely because measures appropriate to those ends would be improper if they were directed solely toward the objective of criminal prosecution.
id.at.biehunik is also factually distinguishable from this case,as biehunik did not involve custodial interrogation,which the supreme court expressly held,several years after biehunik was decided,requires probable cause.see dunaway new york,d.
it therefore is clear,as it was in,that biehunik exception to the probable cause requirement is limited to internal disciplinary investigations.nothing in biehunik disturbs the principle,established long before,that probable cause is required for a seizure for custodial interrogation in the criminal context.
the supreme court decision in ortega,d,further clarified that a lesser standard of individualized suspicion is permissible only in internal disciplinary investigations of government employees by their government employers.indeed,as appellants correctly point out,the court in specifically limited its holding to the facts before it 
because the parties in this case have alleged that the search was either a noninvestigatory intrusion or an investigatory search for evidence of suspected employee misfeasance,we undertake to determine the appropriate fourth amendment standard of reasonableness o
