laurie chadwick brought a claim of sex discrimination under title vii,et,against wellpoint,and anthem health plans of maine,collectively,wellpoint,after she was denied a promotion she alleged that her employer failed to promote her because of a stereotype that women who are mothers,particularly of young children,neglect their jobs in favor of their presumed childcare responsibilities.having carefully reviewed the record,we are convinced that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of wellpoint and therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.as to the second issue presented on appeal,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert testimony proffered by chadwick.
background 
it is elementary that at summary judgment a court must view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the same.see,flowers fiore,cir.we emphasize this basic rule here because the district court grant of summary judgment was due in part to a misapplication of this rule.thus,we relate the factual basis for chadwick claim against wellpoint with this dictate in mind 
chadwick was a employee of wellpoint,an insurance company,in its maine office.she was hired by wellpoint in,and was promoted in to the position of recovery specialist ii,which involved the pursuit of overpayment claims and claims for reimbursement from third parties.in,encouraged by her supervisor,she applied for a promotion to a management position entitled recovery specialist lead or team lead.in this position,the successful candidate would be responsible for the recovery function for the region encompassing maine,new hampshire,and connecticut.because chadwick was already performing several of the responsibilities of the team lead position and based on her supervisor comments,chadwick believed she was the frontrunner for the position.in addition,on her most recent performance evaluation in,she had received excellent reviews,scoring a out of a possible points.
there were two finalists for the team lead position,chadwick and another candidate,donna ouelette.while chadwick had held the recovery specialist ii position for seven years,ouelette had only been promoted to that position about a year earlier.in addition,ouelette had scored lower than chadwick,though satisfactorily,on her most recent performance review,receiving a out of a possible points.
three managers interviewed the two finalists linda brink,who had previously supervised and worked closely with chadwick dawn leno,the director of recovery and nanci miller,chadwick immediate supervisor.nanci miller was the ultimate decisionmaker for the promotion but she considered input from brink and leno in reaching her decision.based on her own perceptions and those of brink and leno,miller graded ouelette interview performance higher than chadwick.miller subsequently offered the promotion to ouelette over chadwick.
at the time of the promotion decision,chadwick was the mother of an son and triplets in kindergarten.there is no allegation,insinuation,or for that matter evidence that chadwick work performance was negatively impacted by any childcare responsibilities she may have had.indeed,miller,the decisionmaker,did not know that chadwick was the mother of young triplets until shortly before the promotion decision was made.apparently,chadwick husband,the primary caretaker for the children,stayed home with them during the day while chadwick worked.he also worked shifts,presumably nights and weekends,when chadwick was at home with the children.during the same period,chadwick was also taking one course a semester at the university of southern maine.
chadwick alleges that wellpoint denied her the promotion based on the stereotype that mothers,particularly those with young children,neglect their work duties in favor of their presumed childcare obligations.to support this claim,chadwick points to the fact that she was significantly more qualified for the promotion than was ouelette,and also highlights three statements made by management around the time of the promotion decision.
first,on may,two months before the decision was reached,miller,the decisionmaker,found out that chadwick had three children in addition to an son.miller sent an email to chadwick stating,oh did not know you had triplets.bless you 
second,during chadwick interview with brink,her former supervisor,she was asked how she would respond if an associate did not complete a project on time.unhappy with chadwick answer,brink replied,laurie,you are a mother.w ould you let your kids off the hook that easy if they made a mess in their room w ould you clean it or hold them accountable 
third,and most important,when miller informed chadwick that she did not get the promotion,miller explained 
it was nothing you did or did do.it was just that you going to school,you have the kids and you just have a lot on your plate right now.
in the same conversation,miller said that,if the three interviewers were in your position,they would feel overwhelmed.finally,miller also told chadwick that,there would be something better down the road,and that chadwick would look back and say it a good thing that that opportunity did work out because i happier with this down the road.
in her deposition,miller said that she decided not to promote chadwick because she interviewed poorly,and that she miller only told chadwick that she had too much on her plate in an attempt to soften the blow.in addition,in its brief,wellpoint makes much of its assertion that ouelette was apparently the mother of two children,ages nine and fourteen.however,unlike the district court,we do not give weight to this assertion 
procedurally,wellpoint moved for summary judgment following discovery.a magistrate judge recommended the motion be granted,and the district court,in a separate opinion,agreed.the district court concluded that chadwick claim could not proceed to a jury because n othing in miller words show ed that chadwick was not promoted because of her sex,nor was there a general atmosphere of assumptions in the workplace.chadwick wellpoint,d.chadwick now appeals.
ii.discussion 
summary judgement motion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.whitman miles,cir.summary judgment is granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.importantly,as we explained above,we view the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,here chadwick,and also draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.flowers,at.
legal background 
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits discrimination based on sex.a.notably,the act does not prohibit discrimination based on caregiving responsibility chadwick claim can be characterized as a sex plus claim.this denomination refers to the situation where an employer classifies employees on the basis of sex plus another characteristic.barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law ed emphasis in original.the terminology may be a bit misleading,however,because the plus does not mean that more than simple sex discrimination must be alleged rather,it describes the case where not all members of a disfavored class are discriminated against.back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir.in other words,i n such cases the employer does not discriminate against the class of men or women as a whole but rather treats differently a subclass of men or women.lindemann.here,chadwick alleges that the subclass being discriminated against based on sex is women with children,particularly young children.ultimately,regardless of the label given to the claim,the simple question posed by sex discrimination suits is whether the employer took an adverse employment action at least in part because of an employee sex.see m a n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that sex was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.emphasis added.
the type of discrimination chadwick alleges involves stereotyping based on sex.the supreme court identified stereotyping as an impermissible form of discrimination in price waterhouse.there,a woman was denied partnership at the accounting firm for which she worked and was told by the partnership that she was too aggressive and macho,should attend a charm school,and should dress and behave more femininely.price waterhouse hopkins,d.the supreme court held that such remarks were evidence of stereotyping,which in turn suggested that sex discrimination was the cause of the failure to promote.id.at.the court pointedly said,w e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group.id.
the supreme court and several circuits,including this one,have had occasion to confirm that the assumption that a woman will perform her job less well due to her presumed family obligations is a form of and that adverse job actions on that basis constitute sex discrimination.see nevada dep t of human res.hibbs,d back,at identifying where employer stated that a woman could not be a good mother and work long hours,and that a woman would not show the same level of commitment because she had little ones at home lust sealy,cir found where decisionmaker admitted he did promote plaintiff because she had children and he did think she want to relocate her family,though she had told him that centennial wireless,cir finding proof of discriminatory animus where direct supervisor questioned whether the plaintiff would be able to manage her work and family responsibilities sheehan donlen,cir in a pregnancy discrimination act case,finding direct evidence of discrimination where supervisor told employee that she was being fired so that she could spend more time at home with her children because statement invoked widely understood stereotypes the meaning of which is hard to mistake.
in its decision in hibbs,the supreme court took judicial notice of the stereotype that women,not men,are responsible for family caregiving.the court noted that the family medical leave act fmla was enacted by congress because,beliefs about the allocation of family duties remained firmly rooted in society.hibbs,at.the court acknowledged the pervasive stereotype that caring for family members is women work.id.at.it explained that congress created the fmla leave program in order to attack the formerly stereotype that only women are responsible for family caregiving,thereby reducing employers incentives to engage in discrimination by basing hiring and promotion decisions on stereotypes.id.at.
in the simplest terms,these cases stand for the proposition that unlawful sex discrimination occurs when an employer takes an adverse job action on the assumption that a woman,because she is a woman,will neglect her job responsibilities in favor of her presumed childcare responsibilities.it is undoubtedly true that if the work performance of a woman or a man,for that matter actually suffers due to childcare responsibilities or due to any other personal obligation or interest,an employer is free to respond accordingly,at least without incurring liability under title vii.however,an employer is not free to assume that a woman,because she is a woman,will necessarily be a poor worker because of family responsibilities.the essence of title vii in this context is that women have the right to prove their mettle in the work arena without the burden of stereotypes regarding whether they can fulfill their responsibilities.
chadwick claim 
we turn now to the specific facts of chadwick claim,mindful that we are judging merely the claim viability under summary judgment,rather than as to ultimate liability.chadwick presses her claim under two separate,though related,theories.she puts forth a mixed motives claim,under desert palace,costa,d and a traditional discrimination claim under the familiar mcdonnell douglas burden shifting scheme our decision here,however,is not dependent on analyzing chadwick claim under each of these theories because under both approaches,plaintiffs must present enough evidence to permit a finding that there was differential treatment in an employment action and that the adverse employment decision was caused at least in part by a forbidden type of bias.hillstrom,at discussing the interaction between desert palace and mcdonnell douglas.
in the opinion below,the district court acknowledged two important pieces of the puzzle.first,it found that stereotypes regarding women,families,and work are alive and well in our society.chadwick,d at.second,it concluded that the statements made to chadwick were based on an assumption or generalization about the demands of continuing education coupled with child rearing responsibilities.id.yet the district court granted summary judgment to wellpoint because,as the court explained,miller did not explicitly say that chadwick sex was the basis for her assumption that chadwick would not be able to handle the demands of work and home.id.at.the district court complained that the decisionmaker did not refer explicitly to women,id.at,and that nothing in miller words,id.at,showed that the decision was based on a stereotype about female caregivers,not about caregivers generally,id.presumably,the district court was looking for miller to say explicitly that she thought chadwick would be overwhelmed because she is a woman with kids,rather than,as miller actually said,you have the kids.but this critique is not an adequate basis upon which to grant summary judgment in this case.
a plaintiff is entitled to prove discrimination by circumstantial evidence alone.see m requiring a plaintiff merely to demonstrate that an employer used a forbidden consideration as a motivating factor with respect to an employment decision desert palace,at.holding in the context that title vii does not mention,much less require,that a plaintiff make a heightened showing through direct evidence thomas eastman kodak,cir finding that under a direct evidence requirement,the mcdonnell framework would no longer serve the purpose for which it was designed allowing plaintiffs to prove discrimination by circumstantial evidence.in thomas,a case involving race discrimination,we rejected the district court requirement that in order to survive summary judgment a plaintiff must allege at least one piece of evidence that explicitly referred to the plaintiff membership in a protected class.id.at quoting thomas eastman kodak.instead,we concluded that t here can be no rigid requirement that plaintiffs introduce a separate plus factor,such as a negative employment comment about the plaintiff protected class,in order to prove discrimination.id.at.
we apply this same lesson to chadwick claim.we reject the district court requirement that miller words explicitly indicate that chadwick sex was the basis for miller assumption about chadwick inability to balance work and home.to require such an explicit reference presumably use of the phrase because you are a woman,or something similar to survive summary judgment would undermine the concept of proof by circumstantial evidence and would make it exceedingly difficult to prove most sex discrimination cases today.see id.at use of circumstantial proof of discrimination is all the more important now than it was when mcdonnell douglas was written,since smoking gun evidence is rarely found in today sophisticated employment world citing hodgens general dynamics,cir.
instead of adopting a mechanical formula,as the district court below proposed,we conduct a analysis and consider the individual facts of chadwick claim.thomas,at.given what we know about societal stereotypes regarding working women with children,we conclude that a jury could reasonably determine that a stereotype was behind miller explanation to chadwick that,it was nothing you did or did do.it was just that you going to school,you have the kids and you just have a lot on your plate right now.particularly telling is miller comment that,it was nothing you did o
