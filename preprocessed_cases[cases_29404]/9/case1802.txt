opinion of the court 
appellant james bailey filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against his former employer united airlines,united,alleging he was terminated in violation of the age discrimination in employment act of adea,et.the district court granted united motion for summary judgment and bailey appeals.
bailey worked as a commercial airline pilot for pan american world airways pan am for most of his career.in,after pan am declared bankruptcy,united purchased some of pan am south american routes and agreed to hire a number of pan am former pilots.bailey was one of the pan am pilots hired by united.bailey was years old at the time united hired him in october.
based upon his seniority,bailey was able to bid for a first officer,or copilot,position.to qualify to fly as a first officer,bailey was required to pass united first officer training.he passed the training in november and began working as a first officer.bailey turned years old on march,four months after completing his first officer training with united.
federal aviation regulations provide that n o person may serve as a pilot on an airplane if that person has reached his birthday.c.in compliance with this regulation,united notified bailey that he was no longer qualified to work as a first officer.however,bailey was qualified to bid for a position as a second officer,or flight engineer,upon the successful completion of the transition training required by united.
united second officer training consists of a combination of ground school classroom work and participation in aircraft simulator exercises.after probationary second officer candidates complete this preliminary training,they take an oral and written exam and a simulator check ride,which is the final test designed to present candidates with various flying conditions.according to united policy,if a candidate fails a check ride or requires excessive additional training periods,a board of review is convened and can render a decision that could lead to remedial action,up to and including discharge of the candidate.at.
bailey began the probationary second officer training in april and received a number of low ratings unsatisfactory or needs improvement during the training exercises.a written evaluation by bailey trainer,james grimm,commented that bailey was not able to perform standard operating procedures.the authenticity of this evaluation has been challenged by bailey.grimm deposition testimony was that he had created and signed only one evaluation form for bailey,but when confronted with a second version of the evaluation uncovered by bailey,grimm conceded that another evaluation existed.the second version of bailey evaluation suggested that bailey performed the standard operating procedures with uncertainty and slowness,which resulted in his failure to complete certain items,but did not say he was unable to perform standard operating procedures.app.at.however,grimm gave bailey a rating of needs improvement on both versions of the evaluation.
in later evaluations,bailey continued to have difficulties with ground operations.training records report that bailey was slow and appeared unsure of how to deal with unusual or irregular problems during all phases of ground operations.at.however,one training evaluator,pierson,commented that bailey has worked incredibly hard to master the,and he be a fine second officer for united.see bailey united airlines,d.bailey also received an above standard rating in.id.
on april,bailey failed his simulator check ride.bailey was informed by his instructor immediately after the check ride that he did not pass.he was also told that united would probably hold a board of review,although bailey maintains he was initially given assurances that united would provide additional simulator training and another check ride.bailey claims he returned home to pennsylvania for the weekend knowing some action would be taken,but confident that he would be given another chance.the board of review met on may,to evaluate bailey performance.after considering bailey record and training,the board decided to terminate bailey employment.
upon bailey return to work after the weekend,a united official told bailey things did look good and that the board was not going to recommend him for further training.at.bailey testified that eric clethen,the new pilot supervisor,called him a day later,approximately may,and told him to report to the chief pilot office in san francisco the next day.at.the substance of the telephone conversation is the subject of dispute.the parties agree that bailey informed clethen that he could not make a meeting on may,but would be available on may.bailey arrived in san francisco on may and met with captain daly,the chief pilot,and clethen.clethen gave bailey the option of resigning his employment upon the condition that he sign a release of claims against united or have his employment terminated.bailey refused to sign the release and he was terminated.
bailey filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc on march,claiming that united terminated his employment in violation of the adea.the adea requires that a charge of discrimination be filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc prior to the initiation of a lawsuit in federal court so that the eeoc has an opportunity to resolve the dispute.see bihler singer,cir.in a deferral state such as pennsylvania that has a procedure for conciliation by a state agency,the eeoc charge must be filed within days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurs.d colgan fisher scientific,cir en banc.
bailey commenced this action on a pro se basis on august,and later filed two amended complaints after bailey retained counsel,he commenced discovery.on june,united submitted a motion for summary judgment.the magistrate judge granted an extension of the discovery deadline and dismissed united motion for summary judgment without prejudice to at the close of discovery.on september,bailey filed another motion to extend discovery and a motion to amend the complaint to assert claims dealing with fraud,evidence tampering,and civil rico.the magistrate judge denied both of these motions.united then renewed its motion for summary judgment.after all briefing was complete on june,the district court granted united renewed motion for summary judgment,finding that bailey claim was.bailey sought reconsideration,which the district court denied on july.bailey timely filed this appeal on august.bailey seeks reversal of the grant of summary judgment,as well as several other determinations of the magistrate judge and the district court.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,a court must draw all reasonable inferences from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party.see battaglia mckendry,cir quotations omitted.a district court grant of summary judgment is subject to plenary review.see pittston.ultramar america allianz ins,cir.
the threshold inquiry in evaluating the timeliness of bailey adea claim is to identify the precise unlawful employment practice of which he complains.see.state coll.ricks,d.here,bailey claims that united decision to terminate his employment was motivated by unlawful age discrimination.
it is well established that for purposes of filing a charge claiming unlawful discharge,the limitations period must be measured from the date on which the employee was advised of the decision to terminate his or her employment.see ricks,at.holding that the limitations period commenced to run when the decision not to offer tenure was made and communicated to plaintiff bouker cigna,wl,at,explaining that the applicable limitations period begins to run when the employee knew or should have known of the harm inflicted by the adverse employment decision,aff,cir guarnaccia john wanamaker,wl,at limitations period must be measured from the date the plaintiff was advised he was to be discharged as opposed to the date of separation.thus,for bailey charge to have been timely,he must not have known prior to may,days earlier that united had decided to discontinue his employment.
bailey argues that the statute of limitations began to run on may,the undisputed day on which he was officially presented by united with the option to resign or be terminated united argues that the limitations period began to run on may,the day united alleges that clethen called bailey and told him a board of review had been held and that his employment would be terminated.thus,the question before the district court on the motion for summary judgment was whether there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the date bailey was advised that united had decided to terminate his employment.the district court granted summary judgment to united,holding that there was no genuine issue of material fact with regard to this date,that bailey knew of his termination prior to may,and that therefore bailey claim was untimely.
the supreme court has held that the period begins to run on a claim of unlawful discrimination when the employer establishes its official position and communicates that position by giving notice to the affected employee.ricks,at.an employer establishes its official position when it decides,unconditionally,to terminate an individual employment and provides the employee with notice of the unconditional decision to terminate his or her employment.id.at.
this court has stated that the period begins to run on a claim of wrongful discharge under the adea when the employer has reached a definitive conclusion to terminate the individual employment.colgan fisher scientific,cir en banc.the period begins to run only when the employee receives unequivocal notice of the adverse employment decision.grayson k mart,cir.therefore,the statute of limitations began to run when bailey first learned unconditionally that his employment with united had or would come to an end.
it is that date that is the subject of conflicting evidence.bailey contends that he did not know he would be terminated until may,and alternatively that even assuming he knew prior to may,united offer to allow him to resign in lieu of termination delayed accrual of the limitations period until his response to that offer.it is undisputed that on may,bailey traveled to san francisco and met with the chief pilot,where he was officially presented with the option of resigning upon the condition that he sign a release of claims against united or be terminated.
the central focus of the factual dispute regarding when bailey was advised that united intended to terminate his employment is bailey deposition testimony.app.at.at his deposition,bailey was asked what happened upon returning to denver after the weekend of may,having failed to pass his check ride the previous week.he stated that he was told i t did look good and that the board was not going to recommend him for further training.app.at.bailey continued to state that he received a call from the chief pilot office in san francisco a day later and told sic to come to san francisco to be terminated.app.at emphasis added.bailey further testified that in the interim between being told to report to the chief pilot office in san francisco and the time he actually went to san francisco,he called a number of people and asked them to call the chief pilot on his behalf in an effort to reverse the decision.it was bailey understanding the local chief pilot was the final determiner of a position in the company.app.at.
the evidence before the district court also included an affidavit by eric clethen,a member of bailey board of review.clethen affidavit differs from bailey testimony in one material respect.clethen attests that after the board met on may,and concluded that bailey employment would be terminated,he called bailey,informed him of the board decision and asked him to travel to san francisco on may,where he would be removed from united payroll and offered the opportunity to resign in lieu of termination.app.at.the district court relied on these two statements for its holding that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the date of termination.
in response to united motion for summary judgment,bailey submitted an affidavit dated november,in which he stated the following 
n o sooner had i learned that the board of review had met than i was asked to travel to san francisco to meet with the chief pilot.i promptly traveled from denver to san francisco to meet with the chief pilot.at the time,i did not know what the chief pilot decision was nor did i know what the board of review recommendation had been.i hoped for the best,but i affirmatively prepared for negative repercussions,and i sought out colleagues who knew my reputation,my professionalism,and my range of experience to articulate that to the chief pilot so as to help assure the best possible outcome.
app.at.bailey also stated in the affidavit that when i arrived in san francisco on may,i was surprised to hear that a decision had already been made,and that i was to be terminated.app.at.the district court found unpersuasive the fact that bailey attempted to garner advocates prior to traveling to san francisco to affect the decision,since requests to reconsider can not extend the limitations period.bailey united airlines,d,quoting ricks,at.alteration in original.
the district court held that bailey could not avoid summary judgment by submitting an affidavit that contradicted his deposition testimony without offering a satisfactory explanation for the apparent inconsistency.bailey,d at citing hackman valley fair,cir martin merrell dow,cir blackburn united parcel,d,aff,cir.
the inconsistency to which the district court referred was bailey deposition testimony that clethen called and told him to come to san francisco to be terminated.the district court viewed this testimony as an admission by bailey that he was informed of united decision to terminate his employment in the may,phone conversation.however,as bailey has articulated,that sentence can be interpreted to reflect what bailey later came to understand as the purpose of his meeting.in his affidavit,dated november,bailey said that when he arrived in san francisco on may for his meeting with the chief pilot,he was surprised to hear a decision to terminate his employment had been made.the district court held that because of this contradiction,the affidavit does not create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to withstand summary judgment.
the martin court recognized situations where sworn testimony can quite properly be corrected by a subsequent affidavit.at.in a situation w here the witness was confused at the earlier deposition or for some other reason misspoke,the subsequent correcting or clarifying affidavit may be sufficient to create a material dispute of fact.id.in his memorandum of law opposing united motion for summary judgment,bailey explains that his comment to be terminated was merely referencing,in hindsight,the irony that he had to travel a long distance in order to be fired.at.bailey suggests that clethen did not notify him of the board decision to terminate his employment during their phone call.instead,his statement to be terminated simply referred to the irony that he later learned he had traveled from denver to san francisco to be fired and that this meaning was obvious at the deposition from the tone and cadence of his voice.at.
in a second affidavit dated june,submitted with bailey motion for reconsideration of the district court grant of summary judgment to united,bailey asserted that clethen did not inform him during the may,phone call that a decision had been made regarding his employment with united.furthermore,bailey reiterated that he did not know united intended to terminate his employment until may,and submitted the affidavits of two individuals who accompanied bailey to the meeting on may,who stated that bailey expressed surprise upon learning of his termination on that day.
in his brief and reply brief on appeal,bailey does not deny that he uttered the words to be terminated.rather,he disputes the meaning of this phrase as it was transcribed in his deposition
