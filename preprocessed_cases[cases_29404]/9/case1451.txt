the appellees in these consolidated appeals challenge the preventive services requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act aca,stat,under the religious freedom restoration act rfra,u.to.particularly,the appellees object to the aca requirement that contraceptive coverage be provided to their plan participants and beneficiaries.however,the nonprofit appellees are eligible for an accommodation to the contraceptive coverage requirement,whereby once they advise that they will not pay for the contraceptive services,coverage for those services will be independently provided by an insurance issuer or administrator.the appellees urge that the accommodation violates rfra because it forces them to facilitate or trigger the provision of insurance coverage for contraceptive services,which they oppose on religious grounds.the appellees affiliated with the catholic church also object on the basis that the application of the accommodation to catholic nonprofit organizations has the impermissible effect of dividing the catholic church,because the dioceses themselves are eligible for an actual exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement.the district courts granted the appellees motions for a preliminary injunction,and,in one of the cases,converted the preliminary injunction to a permanent injunction.because we disagree with the district courts and conclude that the accommodation places no substantial burden on the appellees,we will reverse.
background 
statutory and regulatory.the affordable care act,the preventive services coverage requirement,and the accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations 
in,congress passed the aca,which requires group health plans and health insurance issuers offering health insurance to cover preventive care and screenings for women,without cost sharing such as a copayment,coinsurance,or a deductible,as provided for in guidelines established by the department of health and human services hhs.a hhs requested assistance from the institute of medicine iom,a nonprofit arm of the national academy of sciences,to develop guidelines regarding which preventive services for women should be required.group health plans and health insurance issuers relating to coverage of preventive services under the patient protection and affordable care act,codified at pt.pt.and pt.the iom issued a report recommending a list of preventive care services,including all contraceptive methods approved by the food and drug administration fda.the regulatory guidelines accordingly included a ll food and drug administration approved contraceptive methods,sterilization procedures,and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity,as prescribed by a health care provider.at alteration in original.the relevant regulations require coverage of the contraceptive services recommended in the guidelines.see a iv a iv a iv.
the implementing regulations authorize an exemption from contraceptive coverage for the group health plan of a religious employer.a.the regulations define a religious employer as a nonprofit organization described in the internal revenue code provision referring to churches,their integrated auxiliaries,and conventions or associations of churches,and the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.id.citing a a i,iii.
after rulemaking,the department of the treasury,the department of labor,and the department of health and human services the departments published final regulations in july that provided relief for organizations that,while not religious employers,nonetheless oppose coverage on account of their religious objections.these regulations include an accommodation for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations and group health coverage provided in connection with such plans.see a,a,b coverage of certain preventive services under the affordable care act.july,codified at pt.pts.and pts.an eligible organization means a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as a religious organization and opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services required to be covered on account of religious objections.b.to invoke this accommodation,an employer must certify that it is such an organization.id.b.here,there is no dispute that the nonprofit religious organization appellees are eligible organizations under these regulations.
to take advantage of the accommodation to the contraceptive coverage requirement,the eligible organization must complete the form,ebsa form,issued by the department of labor employee benefits security administration,indicating that it has a religious objection to providing coverage for the required contraceptive services.the eligible organization then is to provide a copy of the form to its insurance issuer or administrator.at 
the submission of the form has no real effect on the plan participants and beneficiaries.they still have access to contraception,without cost sharing,through alternate mechanisms in the regulations under these regulations,an eligible organization is not required to contract,arrange,pay,or refer for contraceptive coverage to which it objects on religious grounds.at.as a result,either the health insurance issuer or the administrator is required by regulation to provide separate payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries.the aca prohibition on cost sharing for preventive services,including contraception,bars the insurance issuer or administrator from imposing any premium or fee on the group health plan,or plan participants and beneficiaries.furthermore,the accommodation prohibits the insurance issuer or administrator from imposing such fees on the eligible organization.see a b,c ii c ii.the insurance issuer or administrator must e xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the eligible organization group health plan and segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.c i a,ii c i a,ii.the administrator may seek reimbursement for payments for contraceptive services from the federal government.b.
furthermore,the health insurance issuer or administrator,not the eligible organization,provides notice to the plan participants and beneficiaries regarding contraceptive coverage separate from materials that are distributed in connection with the eligible organization group health coverage,specifying that the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits,but that the third party administrator or issuer,as applicable,provides separate payments for contraceptive services,and must provide contact information for questions and complaints.see d d d this is in accordance with the preventive services requirement of the aca.
rfra challenge to the accommodation 
the appellees challenge the aca contraceptive coverage requirement as posing a substantial burden on their religious exercise,in violation of rfra.rfra places requirements on all federal statutes that impact a person exercise of religion,even when that federal statute is a rule of general applicability.a under rfra,the g overnment may substantially burden a person exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.id.b.
congress enacted rfra in in response to the supreme court decision in employment division,department of human resources of oregon smith,d.in smith,the supreme court rejected the balancing test for evaluating claims under the free exercise clause of the first amendment set forth in sherbert verner,d,and wisconsin yoder,d,under which the court asked whether the challenged law substantially burdened a religious practice and,if it did,whether that burden was justified by a compelling governmental interest.the smith court concluded that the continued application of the test would produce a constitutional right to ignore neutral laws of general applicability and would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civil obligations of almost every conceivable kind,which the first amendment does not require.at.the government ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct,like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy,can not depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector spiritual development.id.at quoting lyng nw.indian cemetery protective ass n,d.making an individual obligation to obey a generally applicable law contingent upon the individual religious beliefs,except where the state interest is compelling,permits that individual,by virtue of his beliefs,to become a law unto himself,which contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.id.quoting reynolds united states.
congress then passed rfra to legislatively overrule the smith standard for analyzing claims under the free exercise clause of the first amendment.rfra stated purposes are to restore the test as set forth in sherbert and yoder and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by the government.b.the supreme court has characterized rfra as adopt ing a statutory rule comparable to the constitutional rule rejected in smith.gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d.
factual background and procedural 
we review here the following district court opinions two preliminary injunctions issued in geneva college sebelius,and a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction issued in the related cases of most reverend david zubik sebelius and most reverend lawrence persico sebelius.the zubik and persico appeals were consolidated and now have also been consolidated with the geneva appeal.
geneva appellee 
appellee geneva college geneva is a nonprofit institution of higher learning established by the reformed presbyterian church of north america.geneva believes that it would be sinful and immoral for it to intentionally participate in,pay for,facilitate,enable,or otherwise support access to abortion including emergency contraceptives plan b and ella,and two intrauterine devices,all of which geneva characterizes as causing abortion because such participation violates religious prohibitions on murder.geneva contracts with an insurance issuer for its student and employee health insurance plans.
geneva district court opinions 
the district court granted geneva motion for a preliminary injunction with respect to its student plan on june,and enjoined the government from applying or enforcing a and requiring that geneva student health insurance plan,its plan broker,or its plan insurer provide abortifacients contrary to geneva religious objections.the district court began by stating that the supreme court has cautioned courts to be reluctant to dissect religious beliefs when engaging in a substantial burden analysis.quoting thomas review bd.of.emp t sec,d.
the district court concluded that geneva had shown a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to the presence of a substantial burden under rfra and found that three supreme court free exercise cases supported geneva argument regarding the presence of a substantial burden under rfra.first,it noted that in yoder,at,a state compulsory education law for children up to age sixteen,with a penalty of a criminal fine,violated the free exercise rights of the amish plaintiffs.second,in sherbert,at,the state could not withhold unemployment benefits from a worker who refused employment on the grounds that working saturdays violated her religious beliefs.third,in thomas,at,the state could not deny unemployment benefits to a worker whose religious beliefs forbade his participation in manufacturing tanks for use by the military.the district court interpreted these cases as standing for the proposition that these indirect burdens on religious exercise are substantial enough to be cognizable under rfra.the district court concluded that geneva had only two choices under the regulations either provide the coverage or drop its health insurance and by being forced to choose between those two options,both repugnant to its religious beliefs geneva faced a substantial burden.
the district court then granted geneva second motion for a preliminary injunction,this time with respect to its employee plan,on december.the district court again enjoined the government from enforcing a and requiring that geneva employee health insurance plan,its plan broker,or its plan insurer provide abortifacients contrary to geneva religious objections.the district court concluded that geneva had shown a likelihood of success on the merits as to the presence of a substantial burden because the process forced geneva to facilitate access to services it finds religiously objectionable.first,the district court emphasized that a court must assess the intensity of the coercion and pressure from the government,rather than looking at the merits of the religious belief.citing korte sebelius,cir,cert.denied sub nom.burwell korte,d,and hobby lobby stores,sebelius,cir,aff sub nom.burwell hobby lobby stores,d.the district court analogized to cases involving the contraceptive coverage mandate for entities not eligible for the accommodation,such as the hobby lobby opinion in the court of appeals for the tenth circuit,which found that the substantial fines and penalties imposed on an entity that refused to offer health care coverage to its employees at all,or refused to provide coverage for the mandated preventive services,constituted a substantial burden.
the district court was convinced by geneva explanation that,although geneva must engage in the same conduct that it did before the aca namely,notify the insurance carrier that it would not provide coverage for the services the effect of that conduct is now different.before the aca,geneva notification resulted in its employees being unable to obtain coverage for contraceptive services after the aca,geneva employees are still provided access to the services as a matter of law.under the aca,geneva has two choices provide insurance coverage to its employees,which will result in coverage for the objected to services or refuse to provide insurance coverage for its employees,which will result in fines,harm to its employees and competitive disadvantages.both options require geneva to act contrary to its religious duties and beliefs.
geneva argues that the district court was correct that a substantial burden is present here because complying with either the contraceptive coverage requirement or the accommodation would cause geneva to trigger,facilitate,or be complicit in the commission of acts that it likens to abortion and the fines that geneva faces for its refusal to comply with the contraceptive coverage requirement or the accommodation would pressure it to conform.
appellees in the zubik and persico cases include the bishop of pittsburgh,david zubik,and the bishop of erie,lawrence persico the diocese of pittsburgh and the diocese of erie,both of which qualify for the exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement under a and catholic charities of the diocese of pittsburgh,prince of peace center,martin center,and erie catholic cathedral preparatory school,which are all nonprofit organizations affiliated with the catholic church.the catholic religious nonprofit organizations are controlled by their respective dioceses and operate in accordance with catholic doctrine and teachings.the bishops oversee the management of the affiliated nonprofits with regard to adherence to catholic doctrine.the catholic faith prohibits providing,subsidizing,initiating,or facilitating insurance coverage for sterilization services,contraceptives,other drugs that the catholic church believes to cause abortion,and related reproductive educational and counseling services.the dioceses provide health plans to the nonprofits and contract with administrators to handle claims administration of the plans.as a result of their provision of coverage to the nonprofits,the dioceses,which are otherwise exempt,must comply with the contraceptive coverage requirement as to the nonprofits.
district court opinions 
the district court issued a preliminary injunction that applied to both the zubik and persico cases on november,and converted that injunction into a permanent injunction on december.
the district court characterized the issue before it as whether the appellees,being in nature,are likely to succeed on the merits of proving that their right to freely exercise their religion has been substantially burdened by the accommodation which requires the bishops of two separate dioceses to sign a form which thereby the provision of contraceptive products,services,and counseling.the appellees conceded that they have provided similar information as is required by the form to their administrator in the past.however,their past actions barred the provision of contraceptive products,services,or counseling.now,under the aca,this information will be used to the provision of contraceptive products,services,or counseling in direct contravention to their religious tenets.id.accordingly,the district court concluded that the government is impermissibly asking the appellees for documentation for what the appellees sincerely believe is an immoral purpose,and thus they can not provide it.in conclusion,the district court acknowledged that the accommodation allows the appellees to avoid directly paying for contraceptive services by shifting responsibility for providing contraceptive coverage.despite this fact,because the appellees had a sincerely held belief that this shift in responsibility did not exonerate them from the moral implications of the use of contraception,the accommodation imposed a substantial burden.
furthermore,the district court held that the differing application of the exemption and the accommodation the former applying to the catholic church,and the latter applying to catholic nonprofit organizations has the effect of dividing the catholic church,thereby imposing a substantial burden.t he religious employer accommodation separates the good works faith in action employers from the houses of worship employers within the catholic church by refusing to allow the good works employers the same exercise of their religion under the exemption.the district court questioned why religious employers who share the same religious tenets are not exempt,or why all religious employers do not fall within the accommodation,such that even though the appellees here share identical,religious beliefs,and even though they share the same persons as the religious heads of their organizations,the heads of the appellees service organizations may not fully exercise their right to those specific beliefs,when acting as the heads of the charitable and educational arms of the church.the district court concluded that the religious employer exemption enables some religious employers to completely eliminate the provision of contraceptive products,services,and counseling through the dioceses health plans and third parties,whereas the religious employer accommodation requires other religious employers often times the same member with the same beliefs to take affirmative actions to the provision of contraceptive products,services,and counseling albeit from a.
the appellees argue that the district court was correct in finding a substantial burden because they interpret the accommodation to require them to authorize and designate a third party to add the objectionable coverage to their plans,in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs that they can not provide or facilitate that coverage and the different scope of the religious employer exemption and the accommodation impermissibly splits the catholic church.
the government,as appellant in both the and geneva appeals,argues that the district courts were incorrect and the appellees are not subject to a substantial burden,because the submission of the form is not in itself burdensome and does not give rise to the coverage.rather,federal law requires third parties insurance issuers and administrators to provide coverage after the appellees refuse to provide contraceptive coverage themselves.by invoking the accommodation process,the appellees do not facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage by third parties.rather,the third parties providing coverage do so as a result of legal obligations imposed by the aca.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we employ a tripartite standard of review for preliminary injunctions.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.legal conclusions are assessed de novo.the ultimate decision to grant or deny the injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.ex rel.ayers pocono mountain sch,cir quoting sypniewski warren hills reg l bd.of,cir.the same framework applies to the review of a grant of a permanent injunction.see united states bell,cir because we conclude that the appellees have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their rfra claim,we need not reach the other prongs of the injunction analysis.
likelihood of success as to substantial burden 
we first must identify what conduct the appellees contend is burdensome to their religious exercise.it is not the act of filling out or submitting ebsa form itself.the appellees conceded at oral argument that the mere act of completing ebsa form does not impose a burden on their religious exercise.
the appellees essential challenge is that providing the form to the insurance issuer or administrator triggers the provision of the contraceptive coverage to their employees and students.the appellees reframed this proposition at oral argument,stating that the accommodation requires them to be complicit in sin.appellees urge that there is a causal link between providing notification of their religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage and the offering of contraceptive coverage by a third party.that link,they argue,makes them complicit in the provision of certain forms of contraception,which is prohibited by their religious beliefs.
without testing the appellees religious beliefs,we must nonetheless objectively assess whether the appellees compliance with the procedure does,in fact,trigger,facilitate,or make them complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage.through rfra adoption of the supreme court free exercise jurisprudence,congress has required qualitative assessment of the merits of the appellees rfra claims.see korte,at rovner,dissenting it is virtually that the free exercise clause does not require an exemption from a governmental program unless,at a minimum,inclusion in the program actually burdens the claimant freedom to exercise religious rights.tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor,d.furthermore,the supreme court has stated that a governmental burden on religious liberty is not insulated from review simply because it is indirect but the nature of the burden is relevant to the standard that the government must meet to justify the burden.bowen roy,d citation omitted.these principles were applied in lyng,where the supreme court recognized that the native american respondents beliefs were sincere,and that the government proposed actions would have severe adverse effects on their religious practice.however,the court disagreed that the burden on the respondents belief was heavy enough to violate the free exercise clause unless the government can demonstrate a compelling need to complete the road to engage in timber harvesting in the challenged area.at emphasis added.
while the supreme court reinforced in hobby lobby that we should defer to the reasonableness of the appellees religious beliefs,this does not bar our objective evaluation of the nature of the claimed burden and the substantiality of that burden on the appellees religious exercise.this involves an assessment of how the regulatory measure actually works.indeed,how else are we to decide whether the appellees religious exercise is substantially burdened t here is nothing about rfra or first amendment jurisprudence that requires the court to accept the appellees characterization of the regulatory scheme on its face.catholic conference catholic family,cir quoting roman catholic archbishop of sebelius,d.we may consider the nature of the action required of the appellees,the connection between that action and the appellees beliefs,and the extent to which that action interferes with or otherwise affects the appellees exercise of religion all without delving into the appellees beliefs.see,korte,at rovner,j,dissenting.for example,the court in kaemmerling lappin,a ccept ed as true the factual allegations that kaemmerling beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature but not the legal conclusion,cast as a factual allegations,that his religious exercise is substantially burdened.the court further explained we conclude that kaemmerling does not allege facts sufficient to state a substantial burden on his religious exercise because he can not identify any exercise which is the subject of the burden to which he objects.id 
the supreme court in hobby lobby evaluated whether the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage absent the accommodation procedure substantially burdened the religious exercise of the owners of,corporations.the issue of whether there is an actual burden was easily resolved in hobby lobby,since there was little doubt that the actual provision of services did render the plaintiffs complicit.and in hobby lobby,the court came to its conclusion that,without any accommodation,the contraceptive coverage requirement imposed a substantial burden on the religious exercise of the corporations,because those plaintiffs were required to either provide health insurance that included contraceptive coverage,in violation of their religious beliefs,or pay substantial fines see.at see also priests for life,at.here,the appellees are not faced with a provide or pay dilemma because they have a third option notification pursuant to the accommodation to avoid both providing contraceptive coverage to their employees and facing penalties for noncompliance with the contraceptive coverage requirement.
the appellees urge that a burden exists here because the submission of the form triggers,facilitates,and makes them complicit in the provision of services.but after testing that assertion,we can not agree that the submission of the form has the effect the appellees claim.first,the form does not trigger or facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage because coverage is mandated to be otherwise provided by federal law.federal law,rather than any involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting the form,creates the obligation of the insurance issuers and administrators to provide coverage for contraceptive services.as judge posner has explained,this is not a situation where the form enables the provision of the very contraceptive services that the appellees find sinful.rather,f ederal law,not the religious organization signing and mailing the form,requires insurers,along with administrators of plans,to cover contraceptive services.notre dame,at.thus,federal law,not the submission of the form,enables the provision of contraceptive coverage.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit adopted judge posner logic that the obligation to cover contraception is not triggered by the act of.rather,it is triggered by the force of law the aca and its implementing regulations.see.catholic conference,at submitting the form to the insurance issuer or administrator does not trigger contraceptive coverage it is federal law that requires the insurance issuer or the administrator to provide this coverage.most recently,and after the supreme court opinion in hobby lobby,the court of appeals for the circuit agreed with these courts explanations of the mechanics of the accommodation.see priests for life,at as the sixth and seventh circuits have also concluded,the insurers or the administrators obligation to provide contraceptive coverage originates from the aca and its attendant regulations,not from plaintiffs or alternative notice.thus,submitting the form means only that the eligible organization is not providing contraceptive coverage and will not be subjected to penalties.by participating in the accommodation,the eligible organization has no role whatsoever in the provision of the contraceptive services 
moreover,the regulations specific to the zubik and persico appellees plan are no different in this respect,and in no way cause the appellees to facilitate or trigger the provision of contraceptive coverage.those department of labor regulations state that ebsa form shall be treated as a designation of the third party administrator as the plan administrator under section of erisa for any contraceptive services required to be covered.b.the appellees argue that these regulations cause it to facilitate the provision of contraceptives because the signed form authorizes the administrator to serve as the plan administrator.however,this purported causal connection is nonexistent.the eligible organization has no effect on the designation of the plan administrator instead,it is the government that treats and designates the administrator as the plan administrator under erisa.see notre dame,at.the appellees submit forms to communicate their decisions to opt out,not to authorize the administrators to do anything on their behalf.the regulatory treatment of the form as sufficient under erisa does not change the reality that the services are made available because of the regulations,not because the appellees complete a.priests for life,at.indeed,this is just that an indication that the eligible organization chooses not to provide coverage for the services.
moreover,the submission of the form does not make the appellees complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage.if anything,because the appellees specifically state on the form that they object on religious grounds to providing such coverage,it is a declaration that they will not be complicit in providing coverage.ultimately,the regulatory notice requirement does not necessitate any action that interferes with the appellees religious activities.the organization must send a single sheet of paper honestly communicating its eligibility and sincere religious objection in order to be excused from the contraceptive coverage requirement.id.at.the appellees need only reaffirm their religiously based opposition to providing contraceptive coverage,at which point third parties will provide the coverage separate and apart from the appellees plan of benefits.priests for life dep t of health human,d,aff,priests for life.the appellees real objection is to what happens after the form is provided that is,to the actions of the insurance issuers and the administrators,required by law,once the appellees give notice of their objection.rfra does not grant the appellees a religious veto against plan providers compliance with those regulations,nor the right to enlist the government to effectuate such a religious veto against legally required conduct of third parties.priests for life,at.the fact that the regulations require the insurance issuers and administrators to modify their behavior does not demonstrate a substantial burden on the appellees.catholic conference,at 
thus,we can not agree with the appellees characterization of the effect of submitting the form as triggering,facilitating,or making them complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage.at oral argument,the appellees argued that it was not merely the filing of the form that imposed a burden,but,rather,what follows from it.but free exercise jurisprudence instructs that we are to examine the act the appellees must perform not the effect of that act to see if it burdens substantially the appellees religious exercise.the supreme court has consistently rejected the argument that an independent obligation on a third party can impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion in violation of rfra,as we discuss below.free exercise cases,which rfra was crafted to resurrect,have distinguished between what a challenged law requires the objecting parties to do,and what it permits another party specifically,the government to do.
in bowen,the supreme court determined that the free exercise clause did not require the government to accommodate a religiously based objection to the statutory requirement that a social security number be provided to applicants for certain welfare benefits.roy,a native american,argued that the government use of his daughter social security number would rob the spirit of his daughter and prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power.at.roy claim was unsuccessful because t he federal government use of a social security number for his daughter d id not itself in any degree impair roy freedom to believe,express,and exercise his religion.id.at.rather,roy was attempting to use the free exercise clause to dictate how the government should transact its business.
never to our knowledge has the court interpreted the first amendment to require the government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family.the free exercise clause simply can not be understood to require the government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.just as the government may not insist that appellees engage in any set form of religious observance,so appellees may not demand that the government join in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to identify their daughter.t he free exercise clause is written in terms of what the government can not do to the individual,not in terms of what the individual can extract from the government.the free exercise clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion it does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the government internal procedures.
id.at quoting sherbert,at douglas,concurring.
and,echoing the principles of bowen,in lyng,members of native american tribes claimed that the federal government violated their rights under the free exercise clause by permitting timber harvesting and construction on land used for religious purposes.at.the supreme court concluded that the free exercise clause does not and can not imply that incidental effects of government programs,which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs,require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions.id.at.
building on this line of cases,the court of appeals for the circuit concluded that a federal prisoner failed to state a rfra claim when he sought to enjoin application of the dna analysis backlog elimination act on the basis that dna sampling,storage,and collection without limitations violated his religious beliefs about the proper use of the building blocks of life.kaemmerling,at.kaemmerling could not state a claim that his religious exercise was substantially burdened because he did not identify any religious exercise that was subjected to the burden to which he objected 
the government extraction,analysis,and storage of kaemmerling dna information does not call for kaemmerling to modify his religious behavior in any way it involves no action or forbearance on his part,nor does it otherwise interfere with any religious act in which he engages.although the government activities with his fluid or tissue sample after the bop takes it may offend kaemmerling religious beliefs,they can not be said to hamper his religious exercise because they do not pressure him to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.
id.at alteration in original quoting thomas,u.at.like the parents in bowen,kaemmerling opposition to government collection and storage of his dna profile does not contend that any act of the government pressures him to change his behavior and violate his religion,but only seeks to require the government itself to conduct its affairs in conformance with his religion.id.at.
thus,the case law clearly draws a distinction between what the law may impose on a person over religious objections,and what it permits or requires a third party to do.although that person may have a religious objection to what the government,or another third party,does with something that the law requires to be provided whether it be a social security number,dna,or a form that states that the person religiously objects to providing contraceptive coverage,rfra does not necessarily permit that person to impose a restraint on another action based on the claim that the action is religiously abhorrent.
these cases confirm that we can,indeed should,examine the nature and degree of the asserted burden to decide whether it amounts to a substantial burden under rfra.furthermore,we must assess how the action relates to the appellees religious exercise,and whether the appellees objections focus on the action itself or the result of the action,the obligations placed upon a third party.
far from triggering the provision of contraceptive coverage to the appellees employees and students,ebsa form totally removes the appellees from providing those services.t he regulations provide an mechanism that shifts to third parties the obligation to provide contraceptive coverage to which health insurance beneficiaries are entitled,and that fastidiously relieves the appellees of any obligation to contract,arrange,pay,or refer for access to contraception priests for life,at.the form requires the eligible organization or its plan to provide a copy to the organization insurance issuer or administrator in order for the plan to be administered in accordance with both the eligible organization religious objection and the contraceptive coverage requirement.the aca already takes into account beliefs like those of the appellees and accommodates them.the accommodation in this case consists in the organization washing its hands of any involvement in contraceptive coverage,and the insurer and the administrator taking up the slack under compulsion of federal law.notre dame,at.the regulations accommodate the interests of religious institutions that provide health services,while not curtailing the public interest that motivates the federally mandated requirement that such services shall be provided to women free of charge.id.at.
because we find that the procedure does not cause or trigger the provision of contraceptive coverage,appellees are unable to show that their religious exercise is burdened.even if we were to conclude that there is a burden imposed on the appellees religious exercise,we would be to find that it is substantial.whether a burden is substantial under rfra is a question of law,not a question of fact.see mahoney doe.rfra reference to substantial burdens expressly calls for a qualitative assessment of the burden that the accommodation imposes on the appellees exercise of religion.korte,at rovner,dissenting.rfra calls for a threshold inquiry into the nature of the burden placed on the appellees free exercise of religion substantial is a term of degree that invites the courts to distinguish between different types of burdens.id.at.
we have stated that a substantial burden exists where a follower is forced to choose between following the precepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise generally available to other persons versus abandoning one of the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit or the government puts substantial pressure on an adherent to substantially modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.see washington klem,cir interpreting a related statute,the religious land use and institutionalized persons act,which applies to prisoner and land use cases.however,a government action does not constitute a substantial burden,even if the challenged action would interfere significantly with private persons ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious beliefs,if the government action does not coerce the individuals to violate their religious beliefs or deny them the rights,benefits,and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.lyng,at.under this definition,can the submission of the form,which relieves the appellees of any connection to the provision of the contraceptive services,really impose a substantial burden on the appellees free exercise of religion we think not.while hobby lobby rejected the argument that the burden was too attenuated because the actual use of the contraceptive methods was a matter of individual choice,here,where the actual provision of contraceptive coverage is by a third party,the burden is not merely attenuated at the outset but totally disconnected from the appellees.
the reasoning of the district courts was misguided in two ways.first,the district courts accepted the appellees characterization of the accommodation as causing them to facilitate,act as the central cog,or serve as the necessary stimulus for the provision of the contraceptive services.for the reasons we have detailed,we can not accept that characterization as a matter of fact or law.second,the district courts focused on the coercive effect,the fact that the appellees faced a choice submit the form and facilitate the provision of contraceptive coverage,or pay fines for noncompliance.however,now that we have dispelled the notion that the procedure is burdensome,we need not consider whether the burden is substantial,which involves consideration of the intensity of the coercion faced by the appellees.we will accordingly reverse the challenged injunctions.
dividing the catholic church argument in 
the appellees in argue that a second substantial burden is imposed on their religious exercise in that the contraceptive coverage regulatory scheme improperly partitions the catholic church by making the dioceses eligible for the exemption,while the catholic nonprofits can only qualify for the accommodation,even though all the catholic entities share the same religious beliefs.the district court agreed with the appellees and concluded that the contraceptive mandate would cause a division between the dioceses and their nonprofit,religious organizations which fulfill portions of dioceses mission.further,any nonprofit,religious organizations expelled from the dioceses health insurance plans would require significant restructuring of the plans which would adversely affect the benefits received from pooling resources.citation omitted.we conclude that the inclusion of houses of worship in the exemption and religious nonprofits in the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on the appellees.
the definition of a religious employer who receives an exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement under the regulations is based on longstanding internal revenue code provisions.see a citing a a i,iii.r eligious employers,defined as in the cited regulation,have long enjoyed advantages notably tax advantages over other entities,without these advantages being thought to violate the establishment clause.notre dame,at citation omitted citing walz tax comm of,d.the departments chose this definition from the internal revenue code to categorize the entities subject to the exemption and the accommodation because that provision was a bright line that was already statutorily codified and frequently applied the departments believe that the simplified and clarified definition of religious employer continues to respect the religious interests of houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries in a way that does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage requirement.at see also coverage of certain preventive services under the affordable care act,proposed,codified at pt.pt,and pts,t his definition was intended to focus the religious employer exemption on the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.quoting group health plans and health insurance issuers relating to coverage of preventive services under the patient protection and affordable care act,codified at pt.pt.and pt.
furthermore,we are not persuaded that the challenged accommodation poses any burden on the exempted appellees religious exercise,particularly a burden that would require the appellees to expel the religious nonprofit organizations from the dioceses health insurance plans.see,roman catholic archdiocese of sebelius,d,first,it is not at all clear why the diocesan plaintiffs would have to expel their affiliates from their health plans second,even if the law did pressure the diocesan plaintiffs to expel their affiliates,plaintiffs do not state that the diocesan plaintiffs religious beliefs require them to have all their affiliate organizations on a single health plan,such that expelling the affiliates would be an act forbidden by their religion.
thus,we can not agree that the different treatment afforded to the catholic church as a house worship versus the catholic nonprofit organizations imposes a substantial burden in violation of rfra.
iii.conclusion 
we will reverse the district courts orders granting the challenged injunctions.because we conclude that the appellees have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their rfra claim,based on the determination that the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on their religious exercise,we need not reach the question of whether the accommodation is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.
eligible organizations may be either insured or.an employer has an insured plan if it contracts with an insurance company to bear the financial risk of paying its employees health insurance claims.an employer has a plan if it bears the financial risk of paying its employees claims.many employers use administrators to administer their plans and process claims.see cong.budget office,key issues in analyzing major health insurance proposals.the appellees here fall into both categories.
the aca preventive care requirements apply only to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage.see.exempting grandfathered plans coverage provided by a group health plan,or a group or individual health insurance issuer,in which an individual was enrolled as of march,the date on which the aca was enacted for as long as it maintains that status under the rules of this section.
after these suits had been filed,the supreme court granted an injunction pending appeal in wheaton college burwell,d,and ordered that the eligible organization applicant need not use ebsa form to notify its insurance issuer or administrator of its religious objection to the contraceptive coverage requirement instead,if the organization notifies the government in writing of its objection,the government is enjoined from enforcing the contraceptive coverage requirement against the organization.id.at.in response,interim final regulations were issued in august allowing an eligible organization to opt out by notifying hhs directly,rather than notifying its insurance issuer or administrator the eligible organization also need not use ebsa form.coverage of certain preventive services under the affordable care act,codified at pt.pts.and pt.see also b ii b,c ii c ii.we conclude here that the accommodation,even when utilizing ebsa form,poses no substantial burden.to the extent that the supreme court order in wheaton may be read to signal that the alternative notification procedure is less burdensome than using ebsa form,we also conclude that the alternative compliance mechanism set forth in the august regulations poses no substantial burden.
the supreme court has recognized that the accommodation ensures that employees of entities with religious objections have the same access to all contraceptives as employees of entities without religious objections to providing such coverage.the effect of the accommodation on the women employed would be precisely zero.under that accommodation,these women would still be entitled to all contraceptives without cost sharing.burwell hobby lobby stores,d.
