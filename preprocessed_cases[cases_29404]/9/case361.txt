in,police commissioner paul evans terminated william broderick as a police captain in the boston police department.broderick sued and in the district court a jury returned a verdict against evans under and against the city of boston under the massachusetts whistle blower statute.laws ch.the defendants now appeal and broderick has.on sufficiency issues,we recite the facts favorably to the verdict.
broderick began working for the boston police department in as a patrolman and was promoted to sergeant in.in broderick was elected president of the superior officers union the federation,a position he held until.from this early time dates a relationship between broderick and certain of his superiors,including evans,of conflict and distrust.the history includes public charges and law suits by broderick and,on the department side,disciplinary proceedings against broderick and orders that he undergo psychiatric examinations.
highlights are described in the district judge decisions and orders in this case,including his detailed but unreported decision denying evans and the city motion for summary judgment.other litigation occurred in federal and state court,broderick roache,cir broderick roache,and before the state labor relations commission.several episodes are important to the present case.
first,soon after he became union president,broderick began to have disagreements with francis roache and with evans,who was then police superintendent.in,broderick sued them claiming that he had been denied a promotion to lieutenant due to his union activity.evans suspended him and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric exam.in the state labor relations commission found that roache and evans had acted out of spite and animus and awarded broderick back wages and ordered rescission of disciplinary sanctions.
in,the parties settled broderick law suit.he was promoted to lieutenant retroactively with compensation,and got a commitment that his eligibility for promotion to captain would be arbitrated.in,the arbitrator found that broderick had been denied promotion to captain based on his union activities and ordered his promotion retroactive to.according to broderick,at his promotion ceremony evans said that broderick lacked the integrity for the position.
second,when broderick lost his bid for reelection as union president in,evans appointed him as supervisor of cases in the suffolk superior court,a position normally given to a sergeant admittedly,broderick had not been engaged in policing for some years.in his new position,broderick signed officers overtime slips when they were needed in court,concluded that officers were abusing the system,and complained about it.this led to embroilment with commanders of other units and individual officers,to the filing of internal complaints by broderick against others and their complaints against him,and to an internal investigation in which broderick refused to cooperate.
third,in february,broderick according to his testimony was cursed by occupants of a van at downtown crossing in boston,was almost run down leading to an accidental discharge of his gun,pursued the van,and found it occupied by suffolk county investigators who worked with the police broderick had been investigating for overtime abuses.the van occupants were arrested,but evans arranged for their release and placed broderick on administrative leave.
broderick was later exonerated of wrongdoing in the gun discharge by the state police,although he was criticized for how he handled the incident,which included commandeering a taxi to chase the van after the insults were shouted at him.an internal affairs investigation also initially cleared him of other wrongdoing in the incident.
fourth,on april,after internal affairs initially cleared him,broderick was told he could go back to work in two days but that he had to submit to a physical and psychiatric exam.broderick objected to the psychiatric exam,did not attend it or various hearings on pending disciplinary charges,was given brief suspensions,and his mental and physical health began to deteriorate.in july,broderick sued in state court the city,evans and another superior for retaliating against him for his complaints about overtime abuses.
finally,at the beginning of august,broderick advised the city that he would be seeking early retirement and asked that further disciplinary action be placed on hold,and he later applied for a disability retirement.evans refused to postpone pending disciplinary action broderick refused to attend,although saying he would now submit to a psychiatric exam.after much further maneuvering and further warnings,broderick was terminated effective november 
in the meantime,evans and the city had removed broderick pending state court lawsuit to federal court.following his termination,broderick amended his complaint to include the termination.on pretrial motions,claims and defendants were pared down,but three relevant claims survived and proceeded to a jury based on broderick dismissal and incidents connected to it 
first,that in violation of,evans had contravened broderick right under the first amendment to be free from retaliation for engaging in protected speech about the overtime abuses 
second,that evans,also in violation of section,had retaliated against broderick for exercising his constitutional right to petition courts and 
third,that through evans and others the city had retaliated against broderick in violation of the state whistle blower statute.laws ch.
after a trial in april,the jury found in favor of broderick on all three counts,and it awarded him in back pay,in forward pay,and compensation of to cover taxes on the award.it rejected broderick claim to damages for emotional distress.the district court precluded the jury from awarding punitive damages on the section counts,finding that the evidence did not support the necessary heightened showing.
the district court denied various motions by evans and the city with one exception on march,it granted evans renewed motion for qualified immunity as to the first of the three claims listed above,ruling that under a supreme court decision broderick speech about the overtime abuses was not protected under the first amendment but this did not affect the award of damages based on the law suit.
a defense motion for remittitur was denied and broderick was eventually awarded attorney fees and costs.final judgment entered and both parties now appeal,raising multiple claims of error.we begin with the claims by evans and the city attacking the adequacy of the evidence to support liability,the denial of qualified immunity for evans,and the refusal of the court to order remittitur.
the claim that the evidence of liability was inadequate comes in two parts that no rational jury could have found that broderick discharge was substantially motivated by an aim to retaliate for his lawsuit or reports of overtime abuses,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d the showing needed for liability and that,in any case,the defendants showed that broderick would have been fired even absent the protected conduct,id.the mount healthy defense.
so far as the defendants claim that a verdict should have been entered in their favor,fair inferences and credibility issues are resolved in favor of the verdict and our review of the district court refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law is de novo.sauro,cir stiefel,cir.the district court also declined to grant a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence on this issue our review is for abuse of discretion.sears roebuck de puerto rico,cir.
although broderick complained about various other ordered physical exam,the handling of disciplinary complaints against him,the refusal to delay is simplest and sufficient to focus on his discharge,which was the culminating event.the city and evans say that the evidence revealed no more than a temporal connection between broderick protected activities and the adverse employment actions.see,cir.
some of broderick activities may have been justified others,less so,but either way he was clearly a difficult subordinate.he publicly accused evans and the d
