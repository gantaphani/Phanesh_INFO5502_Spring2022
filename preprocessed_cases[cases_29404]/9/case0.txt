two guards james madigan and petitioner michael ross undertook to move respondent shaidon blake,a maryland inmate,to the prison segregation unit.during the transfer,madigan assaulted blake,punching him several times in the face.blake reported the incident to a corrections officer,who referred the matter to the maryland prison system internal investigative unit iiu.the iiu,which has authority under state law to investigate employee misconduct,issued a report condemning madigan actions.blake subsequently sued both guards under,alleging excessive force and failure to take protective action.a jury found madigan liable.but ross raised as an affirmative defense the exhaustion requirement of the prison litigation reform act of plra,which demands that an inmate exhaust such administrative remedies as are available before bringing suit to challenge prison conditions.a.ross argued that blake had filed suit without first following the prison prescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy,while blake argued that the iiu investigation was a substitute for those procedures.the district court sided with ross and dismissed the suit.the fourth circuit reversed,holding that special circumstances can excuse a failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements particularly where the inmate reasonably,even though mistakenly,believed he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.
the fourth circuit unwritten special circumstances exception is inconsistent with the text and history of the plra.
a the plra speaks in unambiguous terms,providing that n o action shall be brought absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies.a.aside from one significant qualifier that administrative remedies must indeed be available the text suggests no limits on an inmate obligation to exhaust.that mandatory language means a court may not excuse a failure to exhaust,even to take special circumstances into account.when it comes to statutory exhaustion provisions,courts have a role in creating exceptions only if congress wants them to.so mandatory exhaustion statutes like the plra establish mandatory exhaustion regimes,foreclosing judicial discretion.see,mcneil united states.time and again,this court has rejected every attempt to deviate from the plra textual mandate.see booth churner,porter nussle,woodford ngo.all those precedents rebut the fourth circuit special circumstances excuse for.
b the plra history further underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime.the plra replaced a largely discretionary exhaustion scheme,see nussle,at,removing the conditions that administrative remedies be plain,speedy,and effective,that they satisfy federal minimum standards,and that exhaustion be appropriate and in the interests of justice.the court of appeals exception,if applied broadly,would resurrect that discretionary regime,in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust.and if the exception were confined to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison grievance procedures,it would reintroduce the requirement that the remedial process be plain.when congress amends legislation,courts must presume it intends the change to have real and substantial effect.stone ins.but the court of appeals acted as though no amendment had taken place.
blake contention that the prison grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below.
a blake suit may yet be viable.the plra contains its own,textual exception to mandatory exhaustion.under a,an inmate obligation to exhaust hinges on the availab ility of administrative remedies.a prisoner is thus required to exhaust only those grievance procedures that are capable of use to obtain some relief for the action complained of.booth,at.
as relevant here,there are three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy,although officially on the books,is not capable of use to obtain relief.first,an administrative procedure is unavailable when it operates as a simple dead end with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates.next,an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes,practically speaking,incapable of use,some mechanism exists to provide relief,but no ordinary prisoner can navigate it.and finally,a grievance process is rendered unavailable when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of it through machination,misrepresentation,or intimidation.
b the facts of this case raise questions about whether,given these principles,blake had an available administrative remedy to exhaust.ross exhaustion defense rests on blake failure to seek relief through maryland administrative remedy procedure arp process,which begins with a grievance to the warden.that process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the state prisons.but maryland separately maintains the iiu to look into charges of prison staff misconduct,and the iiu did just that here.blake urged in the courts below that once the iiu commences such an inquiry,a prisoner can not obtain relief through the arp process.and in this court,the parties have lodged additional materials relating to the interaction between the iiu and the arp.both sides submissions,although scattershot and in need of further review,lend some support to blake account.
blake filings include many administrative dispositions indicating that maryland wardens routinely dismiss arp grievances as procedurally improper when parallel iiu investigations are pending.in addition,blake has submitted briefs of the maryland attorney general specifically recognizing that administrative practice.and ross own submissions offer some confirmation of blake view ross does not identify a single case in which a warden considered the merits of an arp grievance while an iiu inquiry was underway.on remand,the fourth circuit should perform a thorough review of such materials,and then address whether the remedies blake did not exhaust were available under the legal principles set out here.

michael ross,petitioner shaidon blake 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the prison litigation reform act of plra mandates that an inmate exhaust such administrative remedies as are available before bringing suit to challenge prison conditions.a.the court below adopted an unwritten special circumstances exception to that provision,permitting some prisoners to pursue litigation even when they have failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.today,we reject that freewheeling approach to exhaustion as inconsistent with the plra.but we also underscore that statute exception to the exhaustion requirement a prisoner need not exhaust remedies if they are not available.the briefs and other submissions filed in this case suggest the possibility that the aggrieved inmate lacked an available administrative remedy.that issue remains open for consideration on remand,in light of the principles stated below.
respondent shaidon blake is an inmate in a maryland prison.on june,two guards james madigan and petitioner michael ross undertook to move him from his regular cell to the facility segregation unit.according to blake version of the facts,ross handcuffed him and held him by the arm as they left the cell madigan followed close behind.near the top of a flight of stairs,madigan shoved blake in the back.ross told madigan he had blake under control,and the three continued walking.at the bottom of the stairs,madigan pushed blake again and then punched him four times in the face,driving his head into the wall.after a brief pause,madigan hit blake one last time.ross kept hold of blake throughout the assault.and when the blows subsided,ross helped madigan pin blake to the ground until additional officers arrived.
later that day,blake reported the assault to a senior corrections officer.that officer thought madigan at fault,and so referred the incident to the maryland prison system internal investigative unit iiu.under state law,the iiu has authority to investigate allegations of employee misconduct,including the use of excessive force.code of,tit,a.after conducting a inquiry into the beating,the iiu issued a final report condemning madigan actions,while making no findings with respect to ross.see app.madigan resigned to avoid being fired.
blake subsequently sued both guards under,alleging that madigan had used unjustifiable force and that ross had failed to take protective action.the claim against madigan went to a jury,which awarded blake a judgment of.but unlike madigan,ross raised the plra exhaustion requirement as an affirmative defense,contending that blake had brought suit without first following the prison prescribed procedures for obtaining an administrative remedy.as set out in maryland inmate handbook,that process called,not very fancifully,the administrative remedy procedure arp begins with a formal grievance to the prison warden it may also involve appeals to the commissioner of correction and then the inmate grievance office igo.see maryland div.of correction,inmate handbook.blake acknowledged that he had not sought a remedy through the arp because,he thought,the iiu investigation served as a substitute for that otherwise standard process.the district court rejected that explanation and dismissed the suit,holding that the commencement of an internal investigation does not relieve prisoners from the plra exhaustion requirement.blake maynard,d,app.to pet.for cert,wl.
the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed in a divided decision.stating that the plra exhaustion requirement is not absolute,the court adopted an exception originally formulated by the second circuit.repeated the court of appeals t here are certain special circumstances in which,though administrative remedies may have been available,the prisoner failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements may nevertheless have been justified.ibid.quoting giano goord.in particular,that was true when a prisoner reasonably even though mistakenly believed that he had sufficiently exhausted his remedies.at.and blake,the court concluded,fit within that exception because he reasonably thought that the iiu investigation removed his complaint from the typical arp process.at.judge agee dissented,stating that the plra mandatory exhaustion requirement is not amenable to j exceptions.at.this court granted certiorari.
the dispute here concerns whether the plra exhaustion requirement,a,bars blake suit.statutory text and history alike foreclose the fourth circuit adoption of a special circumstances exception to that mandate.but blake suit may yet be viable.under the plra,a prisoner need exhaust only available administrative remedies.and blake contention that the prison grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below.
statutory interpretation,as we always say,begins with the text,see,hardt reliance standard life ins,but here following that approach at once distances us from the court of appeals.as blake acknowledges,that court made no attempt to ground its analysis in the plra language.see,at brief for respondent,labeling the court of appeals rule an exception to the plra exhaustion requirement and that failure makes a difference,because the statute speaks in unambiguous terms opposite to what the fourth circuit said.
section a provides no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.as we have often observed,that language is mandatory an inmate shall bring no action or said more conversationally,may not bring any action absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies.woodford ngo,accord,jones bock,there is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the plra as later discussed,that edict contains one significant qualifier the remedies must indeed be available to the prisoner.see infra,at.but aside from that exception,the plra text suggests no limits on an inmate obligation to exhaust irrespective of any special circumstances.
and that mandatory language means a court may not excuse a failure to exhaust,even to take such circumstances into account.see miller french,explaining that t he mandatory shall normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion no doubt,exhaustion doctrines,even if flatly stated at first,remain amenable to exceptions.see mckart united states,the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is,like most judicial doctrines,subject to numerous exceptions but a statutory exhaustion provision stands on a different footing.there,congress sets the rules and courts have a role in creating exceptions only if congress wants them to.for that reason,mandatory exhaustion statutes like the plra establish mandatory exhaustion regimes,foreclosing judicial discretion.see,mcneil united states,we are not free to rewrite the statutory text when congress has strictly bar red claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies time and again,this court has taken such statutes at face value refusing to add unwritten limits onto their rigorous textual requirements.see,at shalala illinois council on long term care,see also pierce,administrative law treatise,ed.collecting cases.
we have taken just that approach in construing the plra exhaustion provision rejecting every attempt to deviate as the fourth circuit did here from its textual mandate.in booth churner,for example,the prisoner argued that exhaustion was not necessary because he wanted a type of relief that the administrative process did not provide.but a,we replied,made no distinctions based on the particular forms of relief sought and offered,and that legislative judgment must control we would not read exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where congress has provided otherwise.at.the next year,in porter nussle,the court rejected a proposal to carve out claims like blake from the plra exhaustion regime,viewing that approach too as inconsistent with the uncompromising statutory text.and most recently,in woodford,we turned aside a requested exception for constitutional claims,at.our explanation was familiar we are interpreting and applying not a doctrine but a statutory requirement,and therefore must honor congress choice.ibid all those precedents rebut the court of appeals adoption of a special circumstances excuse for.
so too,the history of the plra underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime.section a precursor,enacted in the civil rights of institutionalized persons act cripa,stat,was a weak exhaustion provision.woodford,at.under cripa,a court would require exhaustion only if a state provided plain,speedy,and effective remedies meeting federal minimum standards and even then,only if the court believed exhaustion appropriate and in the interests of justice.a,stat.that statutory scheme made exhaustion in large part discretionary.nussle,at.and for that reason among others,cripa proved inadequate to stem the tide of prisoner litigation.in enacting the plra,congress thus substituted an invigorated exhaustion provision.woodford,at.d iffer ing markedly from its predecessor,the new a removed the conditions that administrative remedies be plain,speedy,and effective and that they satisfy minimum standards.nussle,at.still more,the plra prevented a court from deciding that exhaustion would be unjust or inappropriate in a given case.as described earlier,see supra,at,all inmates must now exhaust all available remedies exhaustion is no longer left to the discretion of the district court.woodford,at.
the plra history just like its text thus refutes a special circumstances exception to its rule of exhaustion.that approach,if applied broadly,would resurrect cripa scheme,in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust available remedies.but as we have observed,such discretion is now a thing of the past.booth,at.and the conflict with the plra history as again with its text becomes scarcely less stark if the fourth circuit exception is confined,as the court may have intended,to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison grievance procedures.understood that way,the exception reintroduces cripa requirement that the remedial process be plain that is,not subject to any reasonable misunderstanding or disagreement.a,stat.when congress amends legislation,courts must presume it intends the change to have real and substantial effect.stone ins.the court of appeals instead acted as though the amendment from a largely permissive to a mandatory exhaustion regime had not taken place 
yet our rejection of the fourth circuit special circumstances exception does not end this case because the plra contains its own,textual exception to mandatory exhaustion.under a,the exhaustion requirement hinges on the availab ility of administrative remedies an inmate,that is,must exhaust available remedies,but need not exhaust unavailable ones.and that limitation on an inmate duty to exhaust although significantly different from the special circumstances test or the old cripa standard has real content.as we explained in booth,the ordinary meaning of the word available is capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,and that which is accessible or may be obtained.at quoting webster third new international dictionary see also random house dictionary of the english language ed.suitable or ready for use oxford english dictionary ed.capable of being made use of,at one disposal,within one reach black law dictionary ed.useable present or ready for immediate use accordingly,an inmate is required to exhaust those,but only those,grievance procedures that are capable of use to obtain some relief for the action complained of.booth,at.
to state that standard,of course,is just to begin courts in this and other cases must apply it to the workings of prison grievance systems.building on our own and lower courts decisions,we note as relevant here three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy,although officially on the books,is not capable of use to obtain relief.see tr.of oral arg.solicitor general as amicus curiae acknowledging these three kinds of unavailability.given prisons own incentives to maintain functioning remedial processes,we expect that these circumstances will not often arise.see woodford,at.but when one or more does,an inmate duty to exhaust available remedies does not come into play.
first,as booth made clear,an administrative procedure is unavailable when despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise it operates as a simple dead end with officers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates.see,at.suppose,for example,that a prison handbook directs inmates to submit their grievances to a particular administrative office but in practice that office disclaims the capacity to consider those petitions.the procedure is not then capable of use for the pertinent purpose.in booth words s ome redress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute requirement of an available remedy where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief,the inmate has nothing to exhaust.at,and.so too if administrative officials have apparent authority,but decline ever to exercise it.once again t he modifier available requires the possibility of some relief.at.when the facts on the ground demonstrate that no such potential exists,the inmate has no obligation to exhaust the remedy.
next,an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes,practically speaking,incapable of use.in this situation,some mechanism exists to provide relief,but no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it.as the solicitor general put the point when rules are so confusing that no reasonable prisoner can use them,then they no longer available.tr.of oral arg.that is a significantly higher bar than cripa established or the fourth circuit suggested the procedures need not be sufficiently plain as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate with respect to their meaning.see a,stat,at supra,at.when an administrative process is susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations,congress has determined that the inmate should err on the side of exhaustion.but when a remedy is,in judge carnes phrasing,essentially unknowable so that no ordinary prisoner can make sense of what it demands then it is also unavailable.see goebert lee county,turner burnside,remedies that rational inmates can not be expected to use are not capable of accomplishing their purposes and so are not available accordingly,exhaustion is not required.
and finally,the same is true when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination,misrepresentation,or intimidation.in woodford,we recognized that officials might devise procedural systems including the blind alleys and quagmires just discussed in order to trip up all but the most skillful prisoners.at.and appellate courts have addressed a variety of instances in which officials misled or threatened individual inmates so as to prevent their use of otherwise proper procedures.as all those courts have recognized,such interference with an inmate pursuit of relief renders the administrative process unavailable and then,once again,a poses no bar.
the facts of this case raise questions about whether,given these principles,blake had an available administrative remedy to exhaust.as explained earlier,ross exhaustion defense rests on blake failure to seek relief through maryland arp process,which begins with a grievance to the warden and may continue with appeals to the commissioner of correction and the igo.see supra,at inmate handbook,at.that process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the state prisons the inmate handbook provides that prisoners may use the arp for all types of grievances subject to four exceptions not relevant here,including those relating to the use of force,at see app.but recall that maryland separately maintains the iiu to look into charges of staff misconduct in prisons,and the iiu did just that here.see supra,at.blake urged in the courts below that once the iiu commences such an inquiry,a prisoner can not obtain relief through the standard arp process whatever the handbook may say to the contrary.see,at app.to pet.for cert,wl,at.and in this court,that issue has taken on new life.both blake and ross as represented by the maryland attorney general have lodged additional materials relating to the interaction between the iiu and the arp.and both sides submissions,although scattershot and in need of further review,lend some support to blake account while also revealing maryland grievance process to have,at least at first blush,some bewildering features.
blake filings include many administrative dispositions gleaned from the records of other prisoner suits indicating that maryland wardens routinely dismiss arp grievances as procedurally improper when parallel iiu investigations are pending.one warden,for example,wrote in response to a prisoner complaint your request for administrative remedy has been received and is hereby dismissed.this issue has been assigned to the division of correction internal investigative unit case c,and will no longer be addressed through this process.lodging of respondent see also,at admin.dismiss final this is being investigated outside of the arp process by in addition,blake has submitted briefs of the maryland
