background 
arroyo was born in.in,he began working as a sales representative for the puerto rico telephone company prtc.he was promoted to a supervisory position seven years later.in,he began working for prtc wireless telephone division as a store supervisor.in,he successfully applied to become a sales manager in the retail sales department.also in,verizon became the parent company of prtc and implemented a reorganization that eliminated some positions and created others.one of the eliminated positions was retail sales manager,which arroyo and four other verizon employees held.the reorganization led to the creation of two district manager positions.arroyo applied to become a district manager in late,when he was years old.although verizon human resources department certified that he met the minimum requirements for the job,he was not selected.instead,the job went to one of arroyo fellow displaced retail sales managers,gustavo ca√±as,who was then years old.the other unsuccessful candidates were,and years old.
at roughly the same time,given that the reorganization had eliminated arroyo old position,verizon offered arroyo a newly created position of retail store manager,at the same salary as his former job of retail sales manager.although he considered it a demotion,he accepted the position,as did two other former retail sales managers,whose ages were and.he was allowed to choose the store where he would work,and selected the store in humacao,which was near his home.
in march,arroyo applied for the position of associate director of corporate sales.verizon human resources department certified arroyo and three other candidates as meeting the minimum requirements for the position.three of the four were older than years of age.rather than hiring any of the internal candidates,verizon turned to a headhunter,to look for external candidates within the wireless industry.william cuebas was selected from a group of candidates.he was years old.
near the end of,the other district manager position created in the reorganization became available due to a retirement.arroyo applied for the job,as did three other verizon employees over the age of.only arroyo had the minimum educational requirements for the job.the opening was internally,and two additional candidates were certified by the human resources department as meeting the minimum job cuesta and vivianette menendez.both were,like arroyo,retail store managers.menendez was years old cuesta was.general sales manager jose saez conducted the interviews.during arroyo interview,saez said,this position is like stepping in a train station,sometimes the doors open and sometimes they do.arroyo interpreted the comment to mean that the position could already be closed to him.for his part,saez explained that he used the analogy with all interviewees currently employed by verizon because he wanted them to remain focused on their jobs while waiting for an open position.in addition,arroyo testified that saez yawned during his interview,which arroyo took to mean that saez found his answers boring or he did care for them.saez testified that cuesta and menendez were his first two choices for the job.he noted in a written summary his opinion that although arroyo was a good candidate,he lacked professional maturity,meaning that arroyo did not express himself with the necessary confidence for the job in question.after the interviews,saez supervisor,walter forwood,asked saez for his top two choices,as he had a job opening and wanted to interview them.forwood hired menendez as distribution channels director.saez then chose cuesta for the district manager position.
cuesta was promoted in may,and arroyo applied for her former district manager job.the interview process consisted of an english test,a sales aptitude test,and a structured interview,wherein all candidates would be asked the same questions by interviewers.the process is designed to be objective,as there are specific subjects to be covered and responses deemed acceptable.arroyo did not pass the structured interview.sometime after the interview,arroyo spoke with one of the interviewers,human resources manager vivian sanabria.she told arroyo that he needed to improve his organizational and planning skills.cuesta,participating in the interview for her old job,testified that arroyo answers were superficial,incomplete and indirect.frances rodriguez,whose interview score was higher than arroyo was chosen to be the new district manager.rodriguez was years old at the time.

before we undertake the analysis of the summary judgment record,we address certain subsidiary issues.arroyo complaint alleged both that he was improperly denied specific promotions and that he was victimized by verizon policy of discrimination that closed the doors of promotion to older workers.the district court found that the statute of limitations barred consideration of the promotion denials in and march as specific claims of discrimination.the court did,however,allow consideration of the claim of a discriminatory policy if it continued after july.verizon wireless,d,arroyo has not appealed this ruling,and we therefore do not revisit it.
