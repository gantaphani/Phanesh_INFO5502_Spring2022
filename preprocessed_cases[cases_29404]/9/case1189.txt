we consider whether the government may employ random,suspicionless container searches in order to safeguard mass transportation facilities from terrorist attack.the precise issue before us is whether one such search regime,implemented on the new york city subway system,satisfies the special needs exception to the fourth amendment usual requirement of individualized suspicion.we hold that it does.
shortly after new york city implemented its search program,brendan macwade,andrew schonebaum,joseph gehring,partha banerjee,and norman murphy each attempted to enter the subway system.each plaintiff either submitted to a baggage search and entered the subway or refused the search and consequently was required to exit the subway system.disturbed by their treatment,they sued new york city and police commissioner raymond kelly pursuant to,asserting that the search regime violated the fourth and fourteenth amendments.they sought a declaratory judgment,preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,and attorney fees.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard berman,judge found the search program constitutional pursuant to the special needs exception and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.macwade kelly,wl.
plaintiffs timely appealed,raising three claims the special needs doctrine applies only in scenarios where the subject of a search possesses a diminished expectation of privacy,and because subway riders enjoy a full expectation of privacy in their bags,the district court erred in applying the special needs exception here the district court erred in finding that the search program serves a special need in the first instance and even if the search program serves a special need,the district court erred in balancing the relevant factors because a the searches are intrusive b there is no immediate terrorist threat and c the city evidence fails as a matter of law to establish that the program is effective.
as set forth more fully below,we hold that the special needs doctrine may apply where,as here,the subject of a search possesses a full privacy expectation.further,we hold that preventing a terrorist attack on the subway is a special need within the meaning of the doctrine.finally,we hold that the search program is reasonable because it serves a paramount government interest and,under the circumstances,is narrowly tailored and sufficiently effective.
background 
i.the subway system and the container inspection program 
the new york city subway system is a singular component of america urban infrastructure.the subway is an icon of the city culture and history,an engine of its colossal economy,a subterranean repository of its art and music,and,most often,the place where millions of diverse new yorkers and visitors stand elbow to elbow as they traverse the metropolis.quantified,the subway system is staggering.it comprises interconnected train lines and passenger stations.it operates every hour of every day.on an average weekday,it carries more than million passengers and,over the course of a year,it transports approximately billion riders.by any measure,the new york city subway system is america largest and busiest.
given the subway enclosed spaces,extraordinary passenger volume,and cultural and economic importance,it is terrorists view it as a prime target.in fact,terrorists have targeted it before.in,police uncovered a plot to bomb brooklyn atlantic avenue subway massive commuter hub that joins different subway lines and the long island railroad.in,police thwarted another plot to bomb the herald square subway station,which networks eight different subway lines in midtown manhattan.
other cities have not been so fortunate in protecting their mass transportation systems.in,terrorists killed over people by using concealed explosives to bomb commuter trains in madrid and moscow.on july,using concealed more than people and wounded another individuals by launching a coordinated series of attacks on the london subway and bus systems.two weeks later,on july,terrorists launched a second but unsuccessful wave of concealed explosive attacks on the london subway system.
that same day,the new york city police department nypd announced the container inspection program the program that is the subject of this litigation.the nypd designed the program chiefly to deter terrorists from carrying concealed explosives onto the subway system and,to a lesser extent,to uncover any such attempt.pursuant to the program,the nypd establishes daily inspection checkpoints at selected subway facilities.a checkpoint consists of a group of uniformed police officers standing at a folding table near the row of turnstiles disgorging onto the train platform.at the table,officers search the bags of a portion of subway riders entering the station.
in order to enhance the program deterrent effect,the nypd selects the checkpoint locations in a deliberative manner that may appear random,undefined,and unpredictable.in addition to switching checkpoint locations,the nypd also varies their number,staffing,and scheduling so that the deployment patterns are constantly shifting.while striving to maintain the veneer of random deployment,the nypd bases its decisions on a sophisticated host of criteria,such as fluctuations in passenger volume and threat level,overlapping coverage provided by its other initiatives,and available manpower.
the officers assigned to each checkpoint give notice of the searches and make clear that they are voluntary.close to their table they display a large poster notifying passengers that backpacks and other containers are subject to inspection.the metropolitan transportation authority,which operates the subway system,makes similar audio announcements in subway stations and on trains.a supervising sergeant at the checkpoint announces through a bullhorn that all persons wishing to enter the station are subject to a container search and those wishing to avoid the search must leave the station.although declining the search is not by itself a basis for arrest,the police may arrest anyone who refuses to be searched and later attempts to reenter the subway system with the uninspected container.
officers exercise virtually no discretion in determining whom to search.the supervising sergeant establishes a selection rate,such as every fifth or tenth person,based upon considerations such as the number of officers and the passenger volume at that particular checkpoint.the officers then search individuals in accordance with the established rate only.
once the officers select a person to search,they limit their search as to scope,method,and duration.as to scope,officers search only those containers large enough to carry an explosive device,which means,for example,that they may not inspect wallets and small purses.further,once they identify a container of eligible size,they must limit their inspection to what is minimally necessary to ensure that the item does not contain an explosive device,which they have been trained to recognize in various forms.they may not intentionally look for other contraband,although if officers incidentally discover such contraband,they may arrest the individual carrying it officers may not attempt to read any written or printed material.nor may they request or record a passenger personal information,such as his name,address,or demographic data.
the preferred inspection method is to ask the passenger to open his bag and manipulate his possessions himself so that the officer may determine,on a purely visual basis,if the bag contains an explosive device.if necessary,the officer may open the container and manipulate its contents himself.finally,because officers must conduct the inspection for no longer than necessary to ensure that the individual is not carrying an explosive device,a typical inspection lasts for a matter of seconds.
ii.the bench trial and the district court decision 
two weeks after the program commenced,plaintiffs sued to halt it.during discovery,plaintiffs requested that the nypd produce confidential data reflecting the number and location of checkpoints deployed since the program inception.the district court conditioned discovery of that information on a showing of need.instead of attempting to establish that need at an evidentiary hearing,plaintiffs elected to proceed to trial but reserved their right to reopen the record.
the bench trial lasted two days.of the evidence elicited,most relevant to this appeal is the testimony of three defense expert witnesses david cohen,the nypd deputy commissioner for intelligence,michael sheehan,the nypd deputy commissioner for,and richard clarke,former chair of the security group of the national security council.because each witness offered nearly identical opinions as to the program efficacy,and supported their opinions with nearly identical reasons,we summarize their testimony in one piece.before doing that,we pause briefly to note the basis of each witness expertise,as their credentials are essential to understanding why the district court credited their testimony.
cohen served for years in the analysis and operations divisions of the central intelligence agency.early in his career,he established the cia first terrorism analysis program.when he later became the deputy director of the cia directorate of operations,he oversaw the cia entire analysis program on a daily basis,including its preparation of political,military,and economic assessments for the president and his senior national security advisors.later,as the director of the directorate of operations,he bore responsibility for the agency worldwide operations.at that time,he created the cia al qaeda osama bin laden unit.in he joined the nypd and assumed responsibility for its intelligence programs.
like cohen,sheehan has considerable experience.he began his career as a member of a unit in the army special forces.he served under two presidents as the national security council director of international programs,and later served as the state department for.in he joined the nypd,where he commands its division and its contingent of the joint terrorism task force.in his current post,he bears responsibility for critical infrastructure protection.
clarke also possesses substantial experience.for seven years he served in the department of state,holding the positions of assistant secretary for affairs and deputy assistant secretary for intelligence.for the following years he held a number of positions on the national security council,including chair of its security group,national coordinator for security,infrastructure protection,and counterterrorism,and special advisor to four presidents.
the expert testimony established that terrorists place a premium on success.accordingly,they seek out targets that are predictable and they ascertain through surveillance and a careful assessment of existing security measures.they also plan their operations carefully they rehearse the attack,they train it,they do dry runs.in light of these priorities,the al qaeda manual advises that terrorists traveling on a mission should avoid security check points along the way.
the witnesses also testified that the program flexible and shifting deployment of checkpoints deters a terrorist attack because it introduces the variable of an unplanned checkpoint inspection and thus throws uncertainty into every aspect of terrorist planning to implementation.terrorists do want to be in a situation where one of their bombs does go off,because on the day that they chose to go in subway station x,there were police doing searches.that unpredictability deters both a attack and an attack consisting of multiple,synchronized bombings,such as those in london and madrid.
because the program deters a terrorist from planning to attack the subway in the first place,the witnesses testified,the fact that a terrorist could decline a search and leave the subway system makes little difference in assessing the program efficacy.similarly,the precise number of checkpoints employed on any given day is relatively unimportant because the critical aspects of the program are that it is random and routine,the combination of which creates an incentive for terrorists to choose an easier target.finally,the testimony established that each of the city programs incrementally increases security and that taken together,the programs address the broad range of concerns related to terrorist activity and have created an environment in new york city that has made it more difficult for terrorists to operate.
after the close of testimony,plaintiffs renewed their request for discovery of data reflecting the number of subway station checkpoints established throughout the city since the program inception.the district court ordered defendants to produce the data for in camera inspection.see macwade,wl,at.after that inspection,the district court entered the data in the record under seal,allowed plaintiffs lead counsel to view it,and ordered sealed any documents revealing or tending to reveal it,such as submissions.
after taking those submissions under consideration and hearing closing arguments,the district court issued an opinion in which it concluded that the program was constitutional pursuant to the special needs exception.in its analysis,the district court determined that the program served a special need because it aimed to prevent,through deterrence and detection,a terrorist attack on the subways.id.at.
having established that the program served a special need,the district court proceeded to balance several factors.it concluded that the government interest in preventing a terrorist attack on the subway was of the very highest order.id.at.as to the program efficacy,the district court credited the expert testimony of sheehan,cohen,and clarke in concluding that the program was a reasonable method of deterring and detecting a terrorist bombing on the subway.id.at.although the district court concluded that scrutinizing the sealed nypd checkpoint data was neither necessary or probative,id.at,it reviewed the data and concluded,in relevant part,that the program was ongoing and with one exception,the nypd established checkpoints on a daily basis between july,and november.id.at.
finally,the district court resolved that the searches were narrowly tailored and only minimally intrude upon privacy interests.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that on balance the program was constitutional,denied plaintiffs application for declaratory and injunctive relief,and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.id.at.this appeal promptly ensued.
discussion 
standard of review 
because this appeal follows a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,but we review de novo its conclusions of law and its resolution of mixed questions of fact and law.see,rose amsouth bank of florida,cir.
ii.the special needs doctrine 
the fourth amendment to the constitution provides that,the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause as the fourth amendment text makes clear,the concept of reasonableness is the touchstone of the constitutionality of a governmental search.bd.of educ.earls,d.what is reasonable,of course,depends on all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or seizure itself.skinner railway labor exec.ass n,d internal quotation marks omitted.as a general matter,a search is unreasonable unless supported by a warrant issued upon probable cause treasury employees union von raab,d.however,neither a warrant nor probable cause,nor,indeed,any measure of individualized suspicion,is an indispensable component of reasonableness in every circumstance.id.
in light of those longstanding principles,we upheld a program employing metal detectors and hand searches of baggage at airports.see united states edwards,cir.we determined that the purpose of the search program was not to serve as a general means for enforcing the criminal laws but rather to prevent airplane hijacking by terrorists.id.at.we then dispensed with the traditional warrant and probable cause requirements and instead balanced the need for a search against the offensiveness of the intrusion.id.we concluded that,
when the risk is the jeopardy to hundreds of human lives and millions of dollars of property inherent in the pirating or blowing up of a large airplane,the danger alone meets the test of reasonableness,so long as the search is conducted in good faith for the purpose of preventing hijacking or like damage and with reasonable scope and the passenger has been given advance notice of his liability to such a search so that he can avoid it by choosing not to travel by air.
id.although at the time we lodged our decision within the broad rubric of reasonableness,id.at,our reasoning came to be known as the special needs exception roughly one decade later.see new jersey,d blackmun,concurring only in those exceptional circumstances in which special needs,beyond the need for normal law enforcement,make the warrant and requirement impracticable,is a court entitled to substitute its balancing of interests for that of the framers.both before and after the doctrine formal denomination,courts have applied it in a variety of contexts relevant here,including random airport searches,see united states marquez,cir,and highway sobriety checkpoints,see michigan dep t of state police sitz,d.see also illinois lidster,d highway checkpoints united states,d border patrol checkpoints united states green,cir random checkpoint stops near military installation.
the doctrine central aspects are as follows.first,as a threshold matter,the search must serve as its immediate purpose an objective distinct from the ordinary evidence gathering associated with crime investigation.nicholas goord,cir second,once the government satisfies that threshold requirement,the court determines whether the search is reasonable by balancing several competing considerations.see,id.at.these balancing factors include the weight and immediacy of the government interest,earls,at.the nature of the privacy interest allegedly compromised by the search,id.at.the character of the intrusion imposed by the search,id.at.and the efficacy of the search in advancing the government interest,id.at.
iii.the program is constitutional 
we address in turn each of plaintiffs arguments as delineated in the introduction.
a.the special needs doctrine does not require that the subject of the search possess a diminished privacy interest 
plaintiffs first raise the purely legal contention that,as a threshold matter,the special needs doctrine applies only where the subject of the search possesses a reduced privacy interest.while it is true that in most special needs cases the relevant privacy interest is somewhat limited,see earls,at.considering the privacy interest of public schoolchildren,the supreme court never has less actually a reduced privacy expectation is a sine qua non of special needs analysis.for example,in ferguson charleston,d the court struck down a warrantless,suspicionless search regime in which a hospital subjected prenatal care patients to drug tests and then disclosed the test results to the police for law enforcement purposes.the court expressly noted that the patients had a full privacy expectation in their medical test results but that the existence of such a privacy expectation was not critical.ferguson,at.instead,the critical difference upon which the decision turned was that the policy failed to serve a special need divorced from the state generalized interest in law enforcement.id.at.
that approach comports with our view that the nature of the relevant privacy interest must not be treated in isolation or accorded dispositive weight,but rather must be balanced against other considerations.in united states albarado,we dismissed the notion that a full expectation of privacy,by itself,rendered unconstitutional warrantless,suspicionless magnetometer searches 
it has been suggested that those who seek to travel on a common carrier have a lower expectation of privacy regarding their person and the bags they carry such a suggestion has little analytical significance if it were announced that all telephone lines would be tapped,it could be claimed that the public had no expectation of privacy on the telephone.what is clear is that the public does have the expectation,or at least under our constitution has the right to expect,that no matter the threat,the search to counter it will be as limited as possible,consistent with meeting the threat.
neither united states lifshitz,cir,nor nicholas,upon which plaintiffs rely,contradicts that principle.although in those cases we noted that the nature of the privacy expectation is an important factor in the special needs analysis,we did not impose a threshold requirement that the relevant privacy interest be diminished.indeed,since each of those cases concerned individuals with reduced privacy interests,we had no occasion to consider whether the special needs exception might sometimes apply even to those with a full expectation of privacy.nicholas,at prison inmates lifshitz,at probationer.
further,in nicholas we expressly rejected the contention that application of the special needs doctrine turns on the type of privacy interest at stake nicholas,at the problem with this argument is that neither ferguson nor edmond rested upon plaintiffs undiminished expectation of privacy.instead,we identified the existence of a special need and then treated the privacy interest as a factor to be weighed in the balance.id.at lifshitz,at see also earls,at.noting that a student limited privacy interest was a hefty weight on the side of the school balance skinner,at.when faced with such special needs,we have not hesitated to balance the governmental and privacy interests.
accordingly,to the extent that the principle needs clarification,we expressly hold that the special needs doctrine does not require,as a threshold matter,that the subject of the search possess a reduced privacy interest.instead,once the government establishes a special need,the nature of the privacy interest is a factor to be weighed in the balance.
b.the container inspection program serves a special need 
plaintiffs next maintain that the district court erred in concluding that the program serves the special need of preventing a terrorist attack on the subway.plaintiffs contend that the program immediate objective is merely to gather evidence for the purpose of enforcing the criminal law.
as a factual matter,we agree with the district court conclusion that the program aims to prevent a terrorist attack on the subway.defendants implemented the program in response to a string of bombings on commuter trains and subway systems abroad,which indicates that its purpose is to prevent similar occurrences in new york city.in its particulars,the program seeks out explosives only officers are trained to recognize different explosives,they search only those containers capable of carrying explosive devices,and they may not intentionally search for other contraband,read written or printed material,or request personal information.additionally,the program voluntary nature illuminates its purpose that an individual may refuse the search provided he leaves the subway establishes that the program seeks to prevent a terrorist,laden with concealed explosives,from boarding a subway train in the first place.
as a legal matter,courts traditionally have considered special the government need to prevent and discover latent or hidden hazards,von raab,at,in order to ensure the safety of mass transportation mediums,such as trains,airplanes,and highways.see sitz,d highway sobriety checkpoint skinner,d drug testing of railroad employees edwards,airplane baggage search.we have no doubt that concealed explosives are a hidden hazard,that the program purpose is prophylactic,and that the nation busiest subway system implicates the public safety.accordingly,preventing a terrorist from bombing the subways constitutes a special need that is distinct from ordinary post hoc criminal investigation.see united states hartwell,cir alito,rejecting fourth amendment challenge to airport checkpoints and recognizing the need to prevent terrorist attacks on airplanes united states marquez,cir noting that airport searches are condu
