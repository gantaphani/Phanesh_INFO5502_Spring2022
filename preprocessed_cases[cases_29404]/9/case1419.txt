brandon palakovic,a mentally ill young man who was imprisoned at the state correctional institution at cresson,pennsylvania sci cresson,committed suicide after repeatedly being placed in solitary confinement.his parents,renee and darian palakovic,brought this civil rights action after their son death.the district court dismissed the family eighth amendment claims against prison officials and medical personnel for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.we write today to clarify and elaborate upon the legal principles that apply to eighth amendment claims arising out of prison suicides.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the district court dismissals.
the following allegations appear in the amended complaint brandon palakovic was convicted of burglarizing an occupied structure in perry county,pennsylvania,and was sentenced by the state court to a term of months imprisonment.in april,he arrived at the state correctional institution at camp hill,pennsylvania sci camp hill,for processing and classification.those procedures included a mental health screening.
brandon informed sci camp hill mental health staff that he had attempted suicide in the past and had engaged in as recently as august.he also advised staff that he experienced periodic thoughts of and suicide,and that he had made plans about how to kill himself.brandon was diagnosed with a number of serious mental disorders,including alcohol dependence,personality disorder,and impulse control disorder.he was identified as a suicide behavior risk,and was classified as stability rating d,signifying a substantial disturbance of thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment,behavior,capacity to recognize reality,or cope with the ordinary demands of life.it is the lowest stability rating given a prisoner in the pennsylvania department of corrections doc system.he was,accordingly,placed on the prison mental health roster.
brandon was transferred to sci cresson in june.during his incarceration at sci cresson,he reported feeling depressed,exhibited signs of depression,and acknowledged suicidal thoughts and a wish to die.his nickname within the prison became suicide.yet no comprehensive suicide risk assessment was performed.brandon did not receive psychological counseling,drug and alcohol counseling,group therapy,or interviews in clinically appropriate settings any mental health interviews were conducted through the cell door slot in the solitary confinement unit.
according to the amended complaint,mental healthcare at sci cresson was seriously deficient in many respects.specifically,the amended complaint alleged that sci cresson had insufficient psychiatric staff,failed to ensure adequate frequency of mental health appointments,failed to provide proper oversight of medication regimes,kept poor medical records,and did not train staff on the proper response to prisoners with mental illness.in addition,it was allegedly the practice at sci cresson that medications to treat mental illness were inadequately monitored for effectiveness and were used as a substitute for other,more effective treatments.
the amended complaint further alleged that sci cresson practice for dealing with mentally ill prisoners like brandon was to relegate them to solitary confinement.this meant that because of brandon particular mental illnesses and lack of proper treatment,his behavior was going to continually land him in solitary confinement unless there was an intervention on his behalf.therefore,over the course of his thirteen months at sci cresson,brandon was repeatedly subjected to solitary confinement via placement in the prison restricted housing unit rhu,characterized by extreme deprivations of social interaction and environmental stimulation,abusive staff,and inadequate to mental health care.footnote omitted.
during his multiple stints in solitary confinement,brandon was exposed to extreme and trying conditions.he was isolated for approximately to hours each day,in a tiny cement cell of less than square feet with only small slit windows affording him minimal outside visibility.he was not permitted to make phone calls,his possessions were limited to one small box,and his social interaction and environmental stimulation were severely reduced.brandon was permitted just one hour of exercise five days out of each week,which took place in an outdoor cage only slightly larger than his cell.
according to the amended complaint,prison officials were aware that exposure to these conditions carried mental health risks.the majority of incidents of at sci cresson including suicides and suicide attempts took place in solitary confinement.in,of the documented suicide attempts more than occurred in the prison solitary confinement units.there also were dozens of incidents in which prisoners on the mental health roster engaged in,while just two such incidents occurred in the general population.
notably,during brandon incarceration,the united states department of justice doj announced that it would be undertaking an investigation into allegations that sci cresson provided inadequate mental health care to prisoners who have mental illness,failed to adequately protect such prisoners from harm,and subjected them to excessively prolonged periods of isolation,in violation of the eighth amendment to the constitution.as part of that investigation,the doj conducted a site visit from march to,also while brandon was incarcerated during which it interviewed administrative staff,medical staff,and prisoners.that investigation,as described in a report issued on may,the doj report,revealed a wide array of policies and practices that were responsible for systemic deficiencies in sci cresson treatment of mentally ill and intellectually disabled prisoners.department of justice may,findings letter,https last visited april.
among other things,the doj reported a failure of security staff to consider mental health issues appropriately,a fragmented and ineffective mental healthcare program,insufficient mental healthcare staffing to meet the prison population needs,p oor screening and diagnostic procedures,poor recordkeeping contributing to a dysfunctional system that undermined continuity of care,d eficient oversight mechanisms,including the failure to collect necessary information on critical incidents,such as acts of,and a lack of training in the proper response to warning signs by prisoners with serious mental illness.citing doj report.although brandon was incarcerated at sci cresson while the doj conducted its investigation,he died before it issued its report.
brandon committed suicide on july,while in solitary confinement.he was years old.
as executors of their son estate,brandon parents filed a civil rights complaint on july,in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,naming a number of prison officials and mental healthcare providers in that complaint,the palakovics presented claims under the eighth amendment that all defendants had been deliberately indifferent to both inhumane conditions that brandon experienced while in solitary confinement and to brandon serious medical need for mental healthcare the defendants filed motions under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
on june,the district court entered a memorandum opinion and order granting the motions to dismiss.rejecting the palakovics arguments to the contrary,the district court concluded that,because the case involved a prison suicide,the vulnerability to suicide legal framework applied and required the palakovics to establish that the detainee had a particular vulnerability to suicide,the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that vulnerability,and those officers acted with reckless indifference to the detainee particular vulnerability.palakovic wetzel,wl,at.june,first dismissal quoting colburn upper darby township colburn ii,cir.because they did not plead facts sufficient to satisfy the vulnerability to suicide framework,the district court dismissed the claims with leave to amend.
on august,the palakovics filed their amended complaint.they did not the claims set forth in the original complaint and instead presented four vulnerability to suicide claims against four groups of defendants they also pled an eighth amendment failure to train claim against the supervisory officials 
two groups of defendants filed a second set of motions under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on february,the district court granted the motions and dismissed the eighth amendment claims.see palakovic wetzel,wl,second dismissal.the district court again granted leave to amend,but the palakovics declined to file a second amended complaint.instead,on april,they filed a motion to voluntarily withdraw the claims against the three remaining defendants kushner,reed,and dous pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure for the express purpose of filing this appeal.the district court granted the motion,noting that the palakovics had indicated an intention to stand on the amended complaint.the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants,and the palakovics timely appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and.we have jurisdiction to review a final order of the district court under.although we generally do not exercise jurisdiction where a district court dismisses a complaint without prejudice and grants leave to amend,see borelli city of reading,cir,such an order is final and reviewable under where,as here,a party declares an intention to stand on the complaint,id.at 
we conduct a plenary review of an order granting a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.see allen ex rel.martin lasalle bank,cir.the rules of civil procedure demand that a plaintiff present only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.bell atl.twombly,quoting conley gibson,alteration in original.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.

the palakovics seek to appeal the district court first dismissal,although they did not their original conditions of confinement and serious medical need claims in the amended complaint.nor did they express an intention to preserve those claims for appeal.as an initial matter,then,we must consider whether appellate review of the first dismissal has been waived.
in general,an interlocutory order like the first dismissal order here merges with the final judgment and is reviewable on appeal from the final judgment entered in the case.see in re westinghouse sec,cir.also in general,an amended pleading like the amended complaint here supersedes the earlier pleading and renders the original pleading a nullity.see run student hous,llc huntington bank,cir.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.obviously,there is considerable tension between these two principles as we consider the matter before us a tension that can be resolved only by deciding which principle prevails.under the circumstances presented,we conclude that,while it would have been preferable for the palakovics to have taken express,affirmative measures to ensure the preservation of their original claims for appellate review they have not waived those claims.we may therefore review the district court first dismissal.
in united states ex rel.atkinson pennsylvania shipbuilding,we observed that the proper rule allows plaintiffs to appeal dismissals despite amended pleadings that omit the dismissed claim provided repleading the particular cause of action would have been futile,cir.we went on to explain that r epleading is futile when the dismissal was on the merits.a dismissal is on the merits when it is with prejudice or based on some legal barrier other than want of specificity or particularity.id.emphasis added.thus,when a pleading error goes to the legal requirements of a cause of action,the dismissal is likely on the merits and should be reviewable on appeal.id.at.
here,the district court first dismissal states that the eighth amendment claims in the original complaint were dismissed for factual insufficiency.yet that conclusion rested upon the district court application of the vulnerability to suicide framework.the palakovics contend that application of that framework was legal error.
we conclude that the claims in the original complaint were dismissed on legal grounds,rather than due to a lack of factual specificity.see id.at.it is apparent that the district court would not have been satisfied by a more detailed factual account to support the palakovics claims.additional facts simply would not have addressed the legal flaw that provided the basis for dismissal,the failure to plead allegations supporting a vulnerability to suicide claim.because repleading would have been futile,the legal argument that the vulnerability to suicide framework never should have been applied is properly raised on appeal.moreover,if there were any doubt,atkinson directs that such doubt must be resolved in favor of the palakovics and,thus,in favor of appellate review.id.accordingly,the eighth amendment claims as set forth in the original complaint have not been waived and we will consider whether the district court properly dismissed them 
before turning to our review of the district court first dismissal,it is necessary that we take a close look at the vulnerability to suicide framework that guided the district court decisionmaking process.our vulnerability to suicide jurisprudence is set forth in three primary cases colburn upper darby township colburn i,cir.colburn upper darby township colburn ii,cir.and woloszyn county of lawrence,cir.these cases addressed claims that prison officials violated the constitution by failing to protect detainees from harming themselves.we discuss each in turn.
in colburn i,melinda lee stierheim was arrested for public intoxication.colburn i,at.four hours after her arrest,while in police custody,she died from a gunshot wound.id.at.sue ann colburn,melinda mother and administratrix of her estate,filed a complaint against prison officials alleging,inter alia,that they violated melinda constitutional rights because they knew or should have known that melinda was a suicide risk and therefore had an obligation to protect her against that risk.id.the district court granted the officials motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.id.
we reversed we first examined cases holding that inmates who had been victims of violence by other inmates could bring claims under the eighth amendment against their custodians where those custodians deliberately or recklessly disregarded the risk to those inmates safety.id.at.we reasoned that such cases can be analogized to the scenario in which the acts causing the injury to the prisoner are those of the prisoner herself.id.at.we further concluded that the fundamental protections afforded to prisoners under the eighth amendment,like personal security,are also afforded to detainees.id.although the eighth amendment does not apply directly to detainees,see fuentes wagner,cir,we concluded that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides detainees at least as much protection for personal security as the level guaranteed to prisoners by the eighth amendment.colburn i,at.
we recognized that it would be inappropriate to place custodial officials in a position in which they must guarantee that an inmate will not commit suicide.id.at.we decided,however,that this consideration should not preclude the possibility of a cause of action 
of course we agree that custodial officials can not be placed in the position of guaranteeing that inmates will not commit suicide.on the other hand,if such officials know or should know of the particular vulnerability to suicide of an inmate,then the fourteenth amendment imposes on them an obligation not to act with reckless indifference to that vulnerability.
id.at.because colburn adequately alleged that the defendants in her case acted with such reckless indifference,we held that colburn could and did state a claim against prison officials for their failure to prevent melinda suicide.id.at.
after remand and a period of discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in the prison officials favor.the matter then returned to this court via a second appeal.colburn ii.
in colburn ii,we recognized that colburn i established the standard of liability to be applied in this circuit in prison suicide cases.id.at.we explained that the vulnerability to suicide framework is simply a more specific application of the general rule set forth in estelle gamble,which requires that prison officials not be deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of prisoners.in essence,a particular vulnerability to suicide is just one type of serious medical need.colburn ii,at.
we then examined more closely what it means to have a particular vulnerability to suicide.we observed that an individual particular vulnerability to suicide speaks to the degree of risk inherent in the detainee condition.id.at.that degree of risk must be a strong likelihood,rather than a mere possibility,that harm will occur.id.citations omitted.we explained that a detainee strong likelihood of suicide must be so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for preventative action.id.at citing monmouth cty.corr.inst.inmates lanzaro,cir.
in addition to the particular vulnerability of the detainee,we also required a relatively high level of culpability on the part of prison officials before holding them accountable,reckless or deliberate indifference to that strong likelihood of suicide.we declined to precisely define these terms,instead observing that liability may attach only where the officials culpability is something beyond mere negligence.colburn ii,at.we noted other situations in which custodians had been found to know of a particular vulnerability to suicide including,for example,where they have had actual knowledge of an obviously serious suicide threat,a history of suicide attempts,or a psychiatric diagnosis identifying suicidal propensities.id.at.
applying these principles in colburn ii,we determined that colburn failed to establish a violation of melinda fourteenth amendment right to due process based upon prison officials deliberate indifference to her particular vulnerability to suicide.viewing the developed record in the light most favorable to colburn,a rational trier of fact could have concluded only that,upon her arrest,prison officials knew or should have known that melinda was intoxicated,had had an argument with her boyfriend,had tried to ingest three pills,had a bullet in her pocket,and had faint scars on her forearm.id.at.given these facts,we upheld the district court determination that,as a matter of law,melinda particular vulnerability was not sufficiently obvious to hold the prison officials accountable for failing to prevent her suicide.id.at.
finally,we revisited this framework in woloszyn county of lawrence,cir.in that case,richard lee woloszyn was arrested for attempted burglary and was taken into police custody.id.at.several hours later,he was found hanging by his neck in his cell.id.at.his estate filed a action seeking to hold prison officials accountable for failing to prevent the suicide.id.at.after discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison officials.id.at.
on appeal,we first considered the culpability element set forth in colburn i and colburn ii,that officials knew or should have known of a strong likelihood of suicide.as we did in the colburn cases,we once again recognized that while eighth amendment standards do not directly control in pretrial detainee cases,the deliberate indifference standard that applies to officials under the eighth amendment probably is the equivalent to the should have known element in a vulnerability to suicide case involving a detainee.woloszyn,at.to the extent the issue remained open,we opted not to conclusively resolve it because we determined that the developed record was devoid of evidence of woloszyn particular vulnerability to suicide.id.at.
among other things,the record demonstrated that woloszyn had been in good spirits and had specifically denied being suicidal.id.at.while there was one witness who testified that woloszyn had been remorseful and distant and had discussed both a recent drug and alcohol binge and his feelings of failure as a father,the court concluded that such statements,without more,are not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding knowledge of woloszyn vulnerability to suicide.they do not show that there was a strong likelihood,rather than a mere possibility,that harm will occur.id.at.we therefore affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
in sum,our case law teaches that,when a plaintiff seeks to hold a prison official liable for failing to prevent a detainee suicide,a detainee may bring a claim under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment that is essentially equivalent to the claim that a prisoner may bring under the eighth amendment.thus,whether a detainee or a convicted prisoner,a plaintiff must show that the individual had a particular vulnerability to suicide,meaning that there was a strong likelihood,rather than a mere possibility,that a suicide would be attempted that the prison official knew or should have known of the individual particular vulnerability and that the official acted with reckless or deliberate indifference,meaning something beyond mere negligence,to the individual particular vulnerability we must now consider the application of these principles,where appropriate,to brandon palakovic circumstances.
returning to the first constitutional claim presented in the original complaint,plaintiffs contend that defendants were deliberately indifferent by placing brandon in solitary confinement,given his mental health vulnerabilities,which deprived him of basic human needs of environmental stimulation,social interaction,mental health,and physical health.first dismissal,wl at.considering this claim,the district court determined that this case involves a prison suicide and that the vulnerability to suicide standard used by courts in this circuit applies to plaintiffs allegations.id.it concluded that the original complaint failed to state a claim because it did not allege facts sufficient to satisfy any of the three prongs of a vulnerability to suicide claim id.at.
the palakovics have consistently argued that this claim should not have been considered through the lens of the vulnerability to suicide framework.they sought to hold prison officials accountable for injuries that brandon experienced during his periods of isolation in solitary confinement while he was alive,not to hold officials accountable at least,not directly accountable for failing to prevent his death.their claim was independent of a particular vulnerability to suicide on brandon part.
to at least some degree,the district court was persuaded to apply the vulnerability to suicide framework to the palakovics claims because of our language in colburn ii that colburn i established the standard of liability to be applied in this circuit in prison suicide cases.colburn ii,at.we clarify today that this statement indicates that the vulnerability to suicide framework applies when a plaintiff seeks to hold prison officials accountable for failing to prevent a prison suicide.it does not,however,preclude other types of claims,even if those claims also relate to an individual who committed suicide while in prison.
here,to the extent brandon could have brought an eighth amendment claim contesting his conditions of confinement while he was alive,his family should not be precluded from doing so because he has passed away.we agree with the palakovics that their original claim need not have to fit within the vulnerability to suicide framework,and the district court erred in dismissing it solely for that reason.
a claim of inhumane prison conditions may rise to the level of an eighth amendment violation where the prison official deprived the prisoner of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities and acted with deliberate indifference in doing so,thereby exposing the inmate to a substantial risk of serious damage to his future health.parkell danberg,cir.quoting chavarriaga dep t of,cir.
the original complaint alleged that several defendants were either responsible for brandon repeated placement in solitary confinement or indirectly responsible through policies and practices that led to his repeated confinement there for instance,the palakovics alleged that supervisory officials wetzel,cameron,boyles,luther,and harrington all upheld policies and practices at sci cresson of sentencing prisoners to solitary confinement based on behavior that was caused by mental illness and intellectual disability.in addition,wetzel,cameron,boyles and luther had responsibility for,among other things,disciplinary proceedings and punishment and policies pertaining to the use of solitary confinement.finally,boyles and luther were members of the program review committee,which was directly responsible for oversight of the rhu,including review of the appropriateness of placement in the rhu for individual prisoners.
the next question,then,is whether those defendants with responsibility for brandon placement in solitary confinement were alleged to have sufficient knowledge that the conditions there were inhumane for him in light of his mental illness.before we turn to the palakovics particular allegations,we first acknowledge the robust body of legal and scientific authority recognizing the devastating mental health consequences caused by isolation in solitary confinement.in our recent decision,williams secretary of the pennsylvania department of corrections,cir,we observed a growing consensus with roots going back a century that conditions like those to which brandon repeatedly was subjected can cause severe and traumatic psychological damage,including anxiety,panic,paranoia,depression,stress disorder,psychosis,and even a disintegration of the basic sense of self identity id.at.and the damage does not stop at mental harm physical harm can also result.studies have documented high rates of suicide and amongst inmates who have been subjected to solitary confinement.these behaviors are believed to be maladaptive mechanisms for dealing with the psychological suffering that comes from isolation.id.at citations omitted.against this backdrop of the extremely serious and potentially dire consequences of lengthy exposure to the conditions of solitary confinement,we turn to the sufficiency of the palakovics claim that prison officials who were aware of his history of mental illness permitted brandon to be repeatedly exposed to inhumane conditions of confinement and acted with deliberate indifference in doing so.
the original complaint adequately alleged that the prison diagnosed brandon with an array of serious mental health issues and placed him on a mental health roster,making it quite reasonable to infer that prison officials had or should have had knowledge of those diagnoses.the complaint further alleged that wetzel and his subordinates were aware that the conditions of solitary confinement cause severe psychological harm,exacerbate mental health problems,and generated the majority of suicides,suicide attempts,and acts of at sci cresson and throughout the entire pennsylvania doc.while perhaps a somewhat conclusory allegation on its own,this was buttressed by allegations of the officials specific awareness of suicides and instances of that had occurred just before brandon confinement,and was underscored by the department of justice announced investigation,which it conducted for the express purpose of determining whether sci cresson routinely subjected mentally ill prisoners like brandon to unnecessarily harmful conditions of confinement.
considering these factual allegations in light of the increasingly obvious reality that extended stays in solitary confinement can cause serious damage to mental health,we view these allegations as more than sufficient to state a plausible claim that brandon experienced inhumane conditions of confinement to which the prison officials wetzel,cameron,boyles,luther,and harrington were deliberately indifferent we therefore conclude that the district court should have allowed this claim to proceed to discovery 
we next consider the palakovics claim that all defendants violated brandon constitutional rights by providing inadequate mental healthcare treatment in assessing the palakovics serious medical needs claim,the district court first observed that as explained above,the complaint has not alleged that brandon had a particular vulnerability to suicide.first dismissal,wl at.the district court went on to conclude that the complaint does not allege facts showing that defendants were deliberately indifferent to brandon serious medical needs related to his mental health treatment at the prison,because he received some mental health care while at sci cresson brandon was placed on the prison mental health roster,he was prescribed medication,and he was visited by mental health staff,id.at we disagree with both conclusions.neither the failure to plead a particular vulnerability to suicide nor the acknowledgment that brandon received some mental healthcare during his incarceration precludes this claim.
the eighth amendment prohibits prison officials from being deliberately indifferent to an inmate serious medical needs estelle gamble.to act with deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is to recklessly disregard a substantial risk of serious harm.giles kearney,cir.while we have recognized that a particular vulnerability to suicide qualifies as a serious medical need,see colburn ii,at,a vulnerability to suicide is not the sole need on which the palakovics claim was focused.rather,the palakovics sought to hold prison officials and mental healthcare staff accountable for failing to meet brandon serious need for mental healthcare.
as masters of their complaint,the palakovics wished to bring this claim without regard to brandon particular vulnerability or lack thereof to suicide,and instead wished to pursue a more general claim under estelle that the sci cresson officials were deliberately indifferent to brandon serious need for adequate mental healthcare and that this indifference led to injury in the form of deterioration of brandon condition ultimately leading to his suicide.in other words,they were,once again,not attempting to directly claim that the prison officials should be held liable for failing to prevent brandon suicide.
where a prisoner has received some amount of medical treatment,it is difficult to establish deliberate indifference,because prison officials are afforded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of prisoners.see durmer,cir.allegations of mere negligent treatment or even medical malpractice do not trigger the protections of the eighth amendment.estelle,at.where a prisoner has received some medical attention and the dispute is over the adequacy of the treatment,federal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims which sound in state tort law.united states ex rel.walker fayette county,cir.internal quotations and citation omitted.deference is given to prison medical authorities in the diagnosis and treatment of patients,and courts disavow any attempt to the propriety or adequacy of a particular course of treatment which remains a question of sound professional judgment.inmates of allegheny cty.jail pierce,cir.quoting bowring godwin,cir.alterations in original.
nonetheless,there are circumstances in which some care is provided yet it is insufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements.for instance,prison officials may not,with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of the inmate,opt for an easier and less efficacious treatment of the inmate condition.west keve,cir.quoting williams vincent,cir.nor may prison authorities deny reasonable requests for medical treatment when such denial exposes the inmate to undue suffering or the threat of tangible residual injury.monmouth county corr.inst.inmates,at quoting westlake lucas,cir.and,knowledge of the need for medical care may not be accompanied by the intentional refusal to provide that care.id.alterations in original quoting ancata prison health,cir.
brandon palakovic suffered from serious mental healthcare issues he had informed prison mental health staff of prior suicide attempts and he had been diagnosed with a number of serious mental disorders and the prison labeled him stability rating d and placed him on the prison mental health roster.and sci cresson personnel did treat brandon mental illness while he was an inmate.specifically,according to the original complaint,brandon was prescribed antidepressant medication and was visited by psychology staff on three occasions.
the palakovics claim that,despite this minimal treatment,the defendants intentionally or recklessly provided brandon with mental healthcare that was so grossly deficient that it violated the constitution.they alleged,for instance,that brandon requested counseling from a psychiatrist,but his request was ignored and a psychiatrist did not provide treatment.they further alleged that medical staff refused to provide brandon with necessary forms of treatment and instead relied only on medication but then neglected to ever evaluate the efficacy of the medication,even after brandon himself advised staff that the medications were not effective.
more broadly,according to the palakovics,harrington chief psychologist at sci cresson and the individual with responsibility for mental health services throughout the prison expressly prohibited medical personnel from speaking with mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement for more than minutes at a time through solid steel doors.they further alleged that sci cresson had systemic deficiencies in mental healthcare treatment,and failed to adhere to the minimal components of a constitutional prison mental health care system conclusions that the doj reached in its investigation.these systemic deficiencies included punishing the mentally ill rather than treating them,a fragmented mental healthcare program with insufficient staffing and poor diagnostic procedures,and a failure to have any program to identify,treat,or supervise prisoners at risk for suicide.according to the palakovics,sci cresson lack of a systematic program for screening and evaluating prisoners in need of mental health care caused officials to understate,delay,and ignore brandon palakovic need for mental health care during his confinement.
and there is a final,key component to the palakovics claim,which takes it from the realm of mere negligence to a potential claim of constitutional magnitude the defendants permitted brandon with his fragile mental health condition and history of and suicide attempts to be repeatedly subjected to the harsh and unforgiving confines of solitary confinement.allegedly ignoring the prison express written policy,which acknowledges that placement of mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement can increase the potential for suicide due to the inherent stress of those conditions,the defendants nonetheless substituted solitary confinement for treatment.thus,the defendants are alleged to have affirmatively contributed to causing brandon serious mental health conditions to deteriorate.although brandon had a history of and suicide attempts,he continued to be placed in isolation,eventually leading to his death.quoting doj report.
considering these allegations and recognizing the high bar the palakovics must meet in order to ultimately prevail,we conclude that they have presented allegations sufficient to state a plausible claim warranting discovery despite receiving some minimal care,brandon received mental health treatment while at sci cresson that fell below constitutionally adequate standards,and the defendants both the mental healthcare personnel providing treatment and the supervisory officials and medical corporation responsible for the prison mental healthcare treatment policies were deliberately indifferent to brandon serious medical needs.thus,this claim,too,should have survived dismissal.
after the district court first dismissal made clear that their claims would not proceed beyond the pleading stage if those claims did not include allegations meeting the vulnerability to suicide framework,the palakovics amended their complaint to set forth four vulnerability to suicide claims and a failure to train claim.the district court dismissed those claims as well.
the amended complaint alleged that brandon disclosed to prison personnel his history of suicide attempts,including an attempt in the recent past,his periodic thoughts of both and suicide,and even that he had made specific plans about how he would go about killing himself.he had been diagnosed with an array of serious mental illnesses,exhibited signs of depression,shared his suicidal thoughts with prison staff,and expressed a wish to die.unsurprisingly,after the prison considered these indications,it labeled him a suicide behavior risk.despite these allegations,the district court concluded that the amended complaint was insufficient to establish a strong likelihood that palakovic would inflict.second dismissal,wl at.we can not agree.
when a mentally ill,depressed person has attempted to kill himself multiple times,has engaged in,declares he has been thinking about killing and harming himself,and has made an actual plan of how he would carry out his own suicide,it can not be said as a matter of law that the risk of suicide is nothing more than a mere possibility.woloszyn,at quoting colburn ii,at.brandon suicidal propensities were so readily apparent that his fellow inmates nicknamed him suicide.see colburn ii,at there is a strong likelihood where a lay person would recognize the necessity for preventive action.if we were to conclude that brandon circumstances were insufficient to allege a particular vulnerability to suicide,it is difficult to imagine how any plaintiff could ever succeed in doing so.
our statements in woloszyn and colburn ii requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate a strong likelihood of were never intended to demand a heightened showing at the pleading stage by demonstrating as the district court seemed to require here that the plaintiff suicide was temporally imminent or somehow clinically inevitable.a particular individual vulnerability to suicide must be assessed based on the totality of the facts presented.in our view,the sum of the facts alleged in the amended complaint are more than sufficient to support plausible inferences that there was a strong likelihood that harm would occur,and that brandon therefore suffered from a particular vulnerability to suicide.
the district court also determined that the amended complaint did not allege facts showing that defendants knew or should have known about brandon particular vulnerability to suicide because the palakovics only generally allege that defendants were aware of or were familiar with brandon medical history,vulnerability to suicide,and his nickname of suicide.second dismissal,wl at.we do not read the amended complaint so narrowly.
the palakovics plausibly alleged that defendants harrington,rathore,eidsvoog,boyles,and luther all knew of brandon particular vulnerability to suicide,or if they did not actually know,at least should have known.we have observed that prison officials know of a particular vulnerability to suicide where they have had actual knowledge of a history of suicide attempts or a diagnosis identifying suicidal propensities.see colburn ii,at.brandon had attempted suicide on prior occasions and told prison officials so.the prison identified brandon as a suicide behavior risk and rated him stability rating d,diagnosed him with multiple,serious mental illnesses known to heighten the risk of,and placed him on the mental health roster.the palakovics allege that all of this information was set forth in brandon records,which the corrections officers and medical staff must have or,at the very least,should have reviewed when considering both his treatment and whether or not to repeatedly place him in solitary confinement.these facts,taken together,are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that prison officials and medical personnel knew or should have known of brandon particular vulnerability to suicide.
finally,the district court concluded that the amended complaint failed to adequately plead deliberate indifference on the part of any defendant.in so doing,the district court erroneously applied a subjective test,examining what the officials were actually aware of as opposed to what they should have been aware of.second dismissal,wl at.yet our case law is clear it is not necessary for the custodian to have a subjective appreciation of the detainee particular vulnerability.woloszyn,at quoting colburn ii,at.rather,we have held that reckless or deliberate indifference to that risk only demands something more culpable on the part of the officials than a negligent failure to recognize the high risk of suicide.id.citation omitted.
after applying the incorrect standard,the district court then unnecessarily required the palakovics to demonstrate one of three limited factual circumstances specifically,where a defendant took affirmative action directly leading to the suicide a defendant actually knew of the suicidal tendencies of a particular prisoner and ignored the responsibility to take reasonable precautions or a defendant failed to take necessary and available precautions to protect the prisoner from wounds.second dismissal,wl at citing freedman city of allentown,cir.the district court observed,plaintiffs have failed to allege facts showing any of these scenarios.id.
while these factual scenarios provide helpful guidance in determining whether a case meets the vulnerability to suicide standard,each case will present unique circumstances and should be considered on its own facts.a failure to track the precise contours of our prior caselaw should not,by itself,compel a conclusion that a plaintiff has failed to state a vulnerability to suicide claim.here,in our assessment,the palakovics adequately alleged that the defendants knew of both brandon particular vulnerability to suicide and his mental health care needs,but in disregard of that knowledge repeatedly placed him or permitted his placement in solitary confinement,where they knew that the risk of suicide and mental harm was even greater.this claim is amply supported by specific factual allegations.
first,as addressed in the preceding section,brandon vulnerability was known or should have been known by prison officials.second,according to the palakovics,it was common knowledge that the prison was being investigated by the doj for provid ing inadequate mental health care to prisoners who have mental illness,fail ing to adequately protect such prisoners from harm,and subject ing them to excessively prolonged periods of isolation,in violation of the eighth amendment of the constitution.and,it can hardly be disputed that it is widely known and understood that solitary confinement is characterized by extreme deprivation of social interaction and environmental stimulation.finally,and perhaps most importantly,prison officials were aware of a history of and suicide in sci cresson solitary confinement unit in the recent past in alone,of the documented suicide attempts at sci cresson occurred in the solitary confinement units,and there were dozens of incidents involving prisoners on the mental health roster engaging in in the isolation units,while just two such incidents occurred in the general population.
these allegations support an inference that,despite knowing of brandon vulnerability and the increased risk of suicide that solitary confinement brings,the defendants disregarded that risk and permitted brandon to be repeatedly isolated in solitary confinement anyway.that is sufficient to satisfy the plausibility standard and proceed to discovery on the vulnerability to suicide claims as to defendants harrington,rathore,eidsvoog,boyles,and luther.
the palakovics also asserted a vulnerability to suicide claim against mhm,the corporation providing medical services at sci cresson.to state a claim against a private corporation providing medical services under contract with a state prison system,a plaintiff must allege a policy or custom that resulted in the alleged constitutional violations at issue.natale camden cty.corr.facility,cir.therefore,the question is whether the palakovics sufficiently alleged that mhm had a policy or custom that resulted in a violation of brandon eighth amendment rights.
according to the amended complaint,mhm was responsible for psychiatric staff,not providing necessary forms of mental health treatment such as suicide risk assessments and counseling,failing to ensure adequate frequency of mental health appointments and that such be conducted in a clinically appropriate setting,and failing to provide proper medical oversight of medication regimes.further,mhm was aware that sci cresson was warehousing people who were seriously mentally ill and those who were vulnerable to suicide in solitary confinement,that this practice was psychologically harmful and medically contraindicated,and they did nothing to intervene on behalf of their incarcerated patients.id.the palakovics buttressed these allegations with findings from the doj investigation and subsequent report.the doj report,as restated and alleged in the amended complaint,specifically found that the mental health care provided by sci cresson during the time of brandon incarceration suffered serious problems including a dearth of mental health treatment,insufficient staff ing,and poor screening and diagnostic procedures.quoting doj report.
the palakovics alleged that mhm policies of understaffing and failing to provide proper treatment resulted in brandon isolation,untreated mental illness,and eventual suicide.at the motion to dismiss stage,these allegations are sufficient to proceed to discovery.absent discovery,the palakovics could not possibly have any greater insight into mhm exact policies or their impact on brandon.
next,the palakovics raised a vulnerability to suicide claim against supervisory defendants wetzel,cameron,luther,and boyles based upon policies and practices at sci cresson,and a related claim for a failure to train sci cresson staff on how to manage prisoners with serious mental illness and those that were vulnerable to suicide in a manner that would not cause mental health injuries.
as previously discussed,a plaintiff may state an eighth amendment claim against a supervisor based on policies or practices where the plaintiff alleges that the supervisors knew or were aware of and disregarded an excessive risk to the plaintiff health or safety,at.in somewhat cursory fashion,the district court held that the palakovics failed to allege facts sufficient to establish supervisory liability second dismissal,wl at.we conclude,in disagreement with the district court,that the risk here was alleged with sufficient specificity and factual support to be so obvious that the palakovics did plead a plausible claim for supervisory liability.
the palakovics claimed that the supervisory defendants established a policy whereby mentally ill and suicidal prisoners like brandon were repeatedly placed in solitary confinement rather than provided with adequate mental health treatment.in the palakovics view,the risk of suicide created by repeated
