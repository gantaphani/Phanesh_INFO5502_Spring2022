charles munafo appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,edward korman,chief judge,denying his motion to alter or amend judgment and denying a new trial.munafo contends that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to amend its civil judgment and provide a new trial on the issue of damages,or grant a new trial on all issues.he argues that the jury misinterpreted questions on the special verdict form and rendered an inconsistent verdict.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and,and we have jurisdiction over munafo timely filed appeal pursuant to.we affirm.
in,the staten island rapid transit operation authority authority terminated munafo employment in its maintenance of way department track department following a series of disciplinary actions for alleged insubordinate conduct.at the time,defendants peter argenziano,david filimon,john mccabe,and alphonse sorrentino were managerial employees at the authority.sorrentino,munafo immediate supervisor in the track department,initiated the disciplinary proceedings against munafo and served as principle complainant.argenziano,filimon,and mccabe presided over various phases of the proceedings as hearing officers.
after exhausting the authority contractual grievance procedures,munafo filed a civil action in federal court against sorrentino,argenziano,filimon,mccabe,and other individual and corporate defendants primarily pursuant to.his complaint alleged that the defendants denied him due process and violated his first amendment free speech rights by terminating his employment in retaliation for his safety complaints and union activities.the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.on appeal,we concluded that we lacked jurisdiction to consider the first amendment claims,and we declined to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the corporate defendants appeal.see munafo metro.transp,cir munafo i.nonetheless,we reversed the district court denial of the individual defendants motions for summary judgment on the due process claims.see id.
after remand and at the conclusion of a trial,the district judge instructed the jury that some of munafo speech might be constitutionally protected and outlined the jury role in ascertaining the defendants motives for terminating munafo.he explained that the jury must decide whether munafo protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants decision to take action against him,but that it must also consider whether the defendants would have terminated munafo even if he had not engaged in protected speech.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.along the way,the district judge stressed that the jury responsibility was limited to answering the four factual questions on the special verdict form with respect to each defendant the court would then apply the law to the jury verdict and render judgment.no party objected to these oral instructions or the questions on the special verdict form.
after deliberating approximately one day,the jury announced its verdict.the completed special verdict form reads as follows 
special verdict form on the question of liability 
do you find that plaintiff engaged in the constitutionally protected speech that the court described to you 
if you answered no to question,do not proceed to questions,or.
if you answered yes to question,do you find that plaintiff constitutionally protected speech was at least a substantial or motivating factor in his dismissal with respect to the defendant indicated 
if you answered yes to question as to any individual defendant,do you find that that defendant would have taken the same action even if plaintiff had not engaged in any of the constitutionally protected speech 
do you find that plaintiff unreasonably chose not to participate in the disciplinary process provided for by the collective bargaining agreement and that his participation could have led the standing board of arbitration or any other hearing officer in the process to decide not to terminate munafo 
upon receiving the jury special verdict,the district judge announced judgment in favor of all four remaining defendants.he then polled the jurors individually,and each confirmed that the answers provided in open court accurately reflected their views of the case.the jury was subsequently excused from the courtroom.
moments later,some jurors informed the district judge law clerk that they had been surprised and disappointed to learn that their special verdict resulted in a judgment for the defendants.the district judge invited the jury back into the courtroom and inquired once again whether the jury answers on the special verdict form were correct.the following colloquy ensued 
the court my law clerk tells me that you were somewhat surprised when i said that the net effect of your answers to the question was a verdict for the defendants.my question to you is whether the answers that you gave me are your answers to those questions 
the foreperson we thought it would be a different outcome.
the court the third question said if you answered yes to question as to any defendant,do you find that any defendant would have taken the same action,even if plaintiff had not engaged in any of the constitutionally protected speech.and you answered yes with respect to sorrentino,argenziano and mccabe now,are those answers your responses to the question 
the foreperson those are the answers that 
the court okay 
the court then proceeded to explain why,as a matter of law,the jury factual findings for questions and exonerated all four defendants.
after the jury withdrew from the courtroom for the second time,munafo contended that the jury must have misread question and therefore mismarked the answer boxes in the special verdict form.reluctantly,the trial judge consented to poll the jury a third time.the interview proceeded as follows 
the court i just want to ask you was yes your answer to question 
juror number 
the court or rather.was yes the answer 
juror number that was the answer that we indicated but 
juror number but we did understand it.
the court you did understand it 
juror number no,because it would have been no the way you explained it to us.we told us the law after we picked it.now,knowing the law,no,we would have went the other way.we feel very strongly about it,your honor.
the court well,y ou may feel very strongly that the plaintiff should prevail 
juror number yes.
the court but if your answer was correct to the question,he ca and you ca change your answer just because you would like him to win so,the issue is not whether you misunderstood 
juror number even if we again misunderstood,we are for the plaintiff on this.that why we would say no my point.we are for the plaintiff to begin with i mean,we were told the law after.
the court you ca decide first that you want to rule for the plaintiff and then answer the questions to make that result happen.it works just in reverse.
juror number but,your honor,we only answered that because we misinterpreted it.and now i do feel our verdict has come forth in this court we were totally confused at the time you polled us,your honor.we were in a state of shock here.and we went back and we could believe what we had just heard 
the court that because you may have wanted to reach a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.but your answer to the question,there was no ambiguity in this question 
juror number in all honestly sic,you know what we agreed to,that was for the plaintiff.so,we made a mistake the wrong way,but in our hearts,we were for the plaintiff.i know we agreed to the question not realizing 
the court yes,not realizing that it that my point.you answered the question 
juror number not realizing what it meant to the stuff i did understand it.this went by the evidence that was here that what we agreed to 
juror number we made a mistake yes,i guarantee.but we made a mistake because we do know the law and we not expert at the law.we laymen but if we had answered oppositely,there would have been another verdict here 
the court yes.
juror number then maybe things should be ex
