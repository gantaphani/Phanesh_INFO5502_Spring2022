at issue in this appeal is whether pennsylvania inmates have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the expectation of release to a community correctional center.we hold they do not.
appellant darryl powell is a former pennsylvania state inmate whose suit under was dismissed by the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the gravamen of powell complaint was that the pennsylvania department of corrections doc violated his fourteenth amendment right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law when it revoked its decision to release him to a community correctional center.the doc concedes that the revocation was based on an improper calculation of powell sentence.
most of the prolix details underlying powell interactions with the pennsylvania criminal justice system are not germane to the question presented here,so we recite only the essential facts.
in july,powell was sentenced in three separate criminal actions before two judges of the philadelphia county court of common pleas.thereafter,powell challenged the doc calculation of his overall prison term in the pennsylvania intermediate appellate courts,contending that his sentences should run concurrently,not consecutively.powell term was then recalculated,and based on that recalculation,he was granted prerelease status and scheduled for transfer to a community correctional center an extension of the state correctional system designed to reintegrate inmates into the community on february.appellee ralph weiss,a doc employee who was sued in his individual capacity processed the paperwork for powell transfer,during which time he reviewed powell sentence calculation in accordance with standard doc procedure.as part of his review,weiss sought clarification,and one of the judges who presided over powell criminal cases advised weiss by letter dated february,just four days prior to powell scheduled transfer that his sentences were to run consecutively.in accordance with this response,weiss recalculated powell overall prison term,which resulted in powell being denied prerelease without notice or a hearing.although powell eventually was granted prerelease status in july and transferred to a community correctional center,he alleged he was deprived of a protected liberty interest during the approximately seventeen months that he remained incarcerated before his transfer.
in,powell filed a petition for writ of mandamus in which he asked the commonwealth court to compel the doc to reduce his prison term by running his three sentences concurrently.while that petition was pending,powell was paroled from the doc custody on august.over a year later,in january,the commonwealth court issued a writ of mandamus after holding that powell trial judge had no authority to modify his sentence with her february,letter to the doc.see commonwealth of ex rel.powell.dep t of.pursuant to the commonwealth court order,the doc recalculated powell sentence,which resulted in a maximum sentence date of may.this recalculation gave rise to powell claim that he was deprived of another liberty interest when he was supervised as a parolee by the board of probation and parole until december,some seven months beyond the appropriate date.
the district court dismissed powell complaint against weiss for two reasons.first,it held that weiss miscalculation of powell sentence did not violate due process because powell had no liberty interest in his prerelease status and his anticipated transfer to a community correctional facility.second,although the court held that powell unwarranted parole supervision did deprive him of a cognizable liberty interest,it determined sua sponte that this claim was precluded by the favorable termination rule of heck humphrey,d.
powell timely appealed.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction over its final order under.
we review the district court dismissal order de novo.james city of wilkes barre,cir.in doing so,we accept all factual allegations as true,construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the complaint,the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.phillips cnty.of allegheny,cir citation omitted.
on appeal,powell maintains that he had a protected liberty interest in his prerelease status and anticipated transfer to a community correctional center.thus,he contends that the district court erred when it held that weiss miscalculation and the subsequent revocation of his prerelease status did not violate his fourteenth amendment right to due process of law.
we sympathize with powell because he was understandably disappointed when his anticipated transfer to a community correctional center was rescinded through no fault of his own.though powell pleaded no facts to this effect,the parties presume that residents of community correctional centers enjoy greater privileges and relaxed restrictions compared to those who remain incarcerated in state correctional facilities.nevertheless,the supreme court has reject ed the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the state is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the due process clause.jago van curen,d quoting meachum fano,d internal quotation marks omitted.instead,our inquiry concerns not merely the weight of the individual interest,but whether the nature of the interest is one within the contemplation of the liberty or property language of the fourteenth amendment.id.quoting morrissey brewer,d.protected liberty interests arise either from the due process clause or from statutory entitlement.fraise terhune,cir quoting shoats horn,cir.we have characterized the former as an independent due process liberty interest and the latter as a liberty interest.renchenski williams,cir.we shall consider each liberty interest in turn.
with respect to an inmate independent due process liberty interest,the supreme court has held 
as long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the constitution,the due process clause does not in itself subject an inmate treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.
montanye haymes,d asquith dep t of,cir.thus,due process is implicated when severe changes in conditions of confinement amount to a grievous loss that should not be imposed without the opportunity for notice and an adequate hearing.renchenski,at finding that due process must be afforded before sex offender conditions may be imposed on an inmate who was not convicted of a sexual offense see also vitek jones,d holding that a prisoner convicted of robbery may not be involuntarily transferred to a mental hospital without process.unlike renchenski and vitek,here weiss administrative error resulted in no change to powell conditions of confinement although powell had been scheduled for transfer,he had not actually been released to the community correctional center.accordingly,he remained in confinement in accordance with his sentence.
on appeal,powell emphasizes that his case involves the revocation,not the mere denial,of his prerelease status,and that a protected liberty interest attached once that status was granted.powell argument is not without force,as the supreme court has held that a fourteenth amendment interest may arise once an inmate is granted a substantial,albeit conditional,freedom.see morrissey,at noting that the liberty of a parolee,although indeterminate,includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty entitled to protection by the fourteenth amendment.but the supreme court has also clarified that an inmate mere anticipation of freedom,when a privilege has been granted but not yet implemented,does not give rise to a constitutionally recognized liberty interest.jago,at.
indeed,the supreme court decision in jago,which concerned a prison revocation of its promise of parole,governs our analysis in powell case.there,the inmate had been informed he would be released on parole,and pursuant to the parole board order,completed prison prerelease classes and was measured for civili
