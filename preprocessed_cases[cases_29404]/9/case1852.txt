on august,as the temperature in baltimore reached,gavin class,a towson university student,collapsed with exertional heatstroke while practicing as a member of the towson university football team.he was transported to the shock trauma unit at the university of maryland medical center in baltimore,where he remained in a coma for nine days and almost died.he suffered failure,requiring a liver transplant and numerous additional surgeries.
following a protracted recovery involving a high level of perseverance,class returned to classes at towson university in january and thereafter pursued his plan to return to ncaa division i football.applying its return to play policy,however,towson university refused to clear class to play because the team physician,a sports medicine doctor,concluded that allowing class to participate in the football program presented an unacceptable risk of serious reinjury or death.the return to play policy gave towson university team physician final authority over the issue.
class commenced this action against towson university,alleging that its decision to exclude him from the football program amounted to a violation of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada and section of the rehabilitation act.he alleged that his inability to regulate his body temperature and his susceptibility to heatstroke constituted a disability,as defined by those acts,and that he was qualified to play intercollegiate football if towson university agreed to his proposed accommodations.following a bench trial,the district court agreed with class,concluding that class proposed accommodations were reasonable and that towson university had violated the ada and the rehabilitation act.the court entered judgment against towson university,issuing a permanent injunction prohibiting it from violating those acts.
on appeal,towson university contends that the district court erred in concluding that class was disabled as the term is defined by the acts and that class was otherwise qualified for the football program with the accommodations he proposed.it also challenges several evidentiary rulings made by the district court during trial.
for the reasons given herein,we reverse the district court judgment,vacating its injunction.while we recognize that the question of whether class had a disability,as defined by the acts,is a close one,we nonetheless conclude that class was not otherwise qualified to participate fully in towson university football program because the university reasonably applied its return to play policy.giving deference to towson university judgment,as we are required to do,we uphold its determination.in view of these conclusions,we do not reach towson university challenge to the district court evidentiary rulings.
after class played ncaa division iii football at the university of rochester for two years,he transferred to towson university to play division i football.and,in early august,towson university football coach informed class that he had won a starting position as an offensive guard.two days later,however,on august,class collapsed during drills from an exertional heatstroke and was taken to the shock trauma unit at the university of maryland medical center.class heatstroke resulted in failure,including liver failure,necessitating a liver transplant.according to william hutson,class treating physician,without the transplant,there is no question that class would have died.class was in a coma for nine days and endured more than a dozen other surgical procedures.he was hospitalized for nearly two months,receiving intensive medical care that included chemotherapy to treat complications.
class still suffers from the effects of his medical trauma.as a result of the liver transplant,he has a weakened abdominal wall,which places his internal organs at risk of injury.he must take immunosuppressive medications,which increase his risk of infection.and he is at a heightened risk of subsequent heatstroke.class physicians have also cautioned that any future surgeries would be more complicated.
after leaving the hospital,class began a lengthy and grueling recovery process.initially unable to stand,he progressed over a period from using a walker to beginning to run.in january,he resumed classes as a student at towson university and began training in pursuit of his hope of returning to playing football.while conditioning on his own,class expressed his wish to rejoin the team for the football season.as with any seeking to return to play from injury,towson university athletic staff directed class request to play to the team physician,kari kindschi.
kindschi was the medical director of the arnold palmer sportshealth center for sports injuries at medstar union memorial hospital in baltimore.under a preexisting contract,kindschi served as the medical director of athletics at towson university and the head team physician for the university division i teams,including its football team.four other medstar physicians were also engaged to provide services to towson university,and those physicians oversaw the three athletic trainers assigned to the football team.in the fall of,kindschi and the physicians on the medstar medical review team,all of whom were board certified in sports medicine,unanimously concluded that class could not safely participate fully in towson university football program.they reached this conclusion after kindschi conducted a physical examination of class reviewed his medical records and his medical history reviewed the results of a heat tolerance test conducted on august,consulted class physicians and reviewed medical literature.kindschi did,however,clear class to participate in no contact conditioning in a cool environment.
the august heat tolerance test was conducted by the korey stringer institute,a center at the university of connecticut that researches issues related to heatstroke and heat illness.the institute was founded in the wake of the death of korey stringer,an all pro offensive lineman in the national football league who died after suffering a heatstroke.the institute conducted a low intensity heat tolerance test on class and found that,in an environment of with humidity,class was to sustain low intensity exercise in a hot environment for minutes.while the test required that class maintain a rectal temperature of or lower for two hours,he exceeded that temperature just over halfway into the test.
after class continued to train,towson university again engaged the korey stringer institute to conduct another low intensity heat tolerance test on class on february,using the same conditions and standards as were used in the first test.this time,class completed the test,having had a rectal temperature of no higher than.the institute concluded 
at this point we suggest that you only exercise in cool environments ranging from low to high intensity including football practices,and only low to moderate intensity in warmer environments.we strongly suggest having a second test done prior to any intense conditioning that is done in a warm to hot environment.this would be done in order to determine your body response to high exercise intensity coupled with heat exposure,most likely before returning to practice in august.
the report included restrictions and conditions for class continued progress.
thereafter,kindschi again refused to clear class for participation in the football program because he had not shown that he had sufficient heat tolerance to handle competitive football practices,including scrimmages,and play outdoors in seasonal heat.she made her judgment after again reviewing class medical records,including both the institute august and february tests,as well as a letter from hutson,the lead treating physician on his team,concluding that class was at acceptable risk to play collegiate football with appropriate padding and protection.she also consulted with other medical professionals at medstar union memorial hospital and with representatives of towson university athletic department.kindschi noted that the test conditions for the february heat tolerance test did not adequately mimic the conditions that class would face playing competitive football and that class had not passed any test wearing the specialized padding recommended to protect his liver and the standard football gear,including the pads and helmet required for playing football.
consistent with ncaa requirements and national best practices,towson university applied a written return to play policy,which provided that the university team physician has the final and autonomous authority in deciding if and when an injured may return to practice or competition.the policy provided in relevant part 
a towson university team physician or designee,in consultation with a towson university certified athletic trainer,has the final authority in deciding if and when an injured may return to practice or competition.a private physician does not have any jurisdiction as to the participation status of the.any seen by a physician other than the towson university team physician must return to the sports medicine clinic for and final clearance prior to active participation status.
emphasis added.
after class obtained counsel,who made a formal demand for class to be fully reinstated in the football program,towson university formally responded with a letter dated may,stating that,based on its return to play policy,it was denying class request.the letter stated 
t he university,with the advice of the medstar medical professionals in its athletic department,has determined that while class has made admirable strides in his recovery,he is unable to return to playing football safely and that no reasonable accommodation can be made to adequately protect him from potentially devastating health effects.
the sports medicine professionals believe that the risk of serious injury or death as a result of another heat stroke is too great to clear class to play.as i am sure you are aware,class prior heat stroke led to a cascade of devastating complications,including failure,which resulted not only in the need for a liver transplant,but also in a very complicated hospital course,several additional surgeries due to wound infections,and lymphoproliferative disease that required chemotherapy.
most importantly,class remains at risk for another heat stroke.his prior severe heat stroke is a significant risk factor for future heat illness.while some of his current medical risks can be minimized with measures such as abdominal padding and medications,class risk of heat stroke is not capable of adequate prevention with any reasonable restriction or accommodation.routine temperature monitoring alone would not adequately provide for his safety,and the sports medicine professionals can not fashion a reasonable or practical precaution that would adequately protect class from another serious heat related illness.the individuals involved in this decision agree that it would be irresponsible to permit class to be exposed to another potentially catastrophic event.
a few weeks later,class commenced this action against towson university,alleging that its decision to exclude him from the football program violated the ada and the rehabilitation act and seeking an injunction to allow him to fully participate in the program.in his complaint,class alleged that he was disabled in that his inability to regulate his body temperature and susceptibility to heat stroke substantially limit major life activities,including regulating body temperature,walking,standing and running,when he experiences a heat stroke,but that he could fully return to football with reasonable accommodations.he alleged that he undertook his recovery process to become the first person to come back from exertional heatstroke and a liver transplant to play football.he proposed various accommodations,based on the korey stringer institute suggestions,which,he contended,were reasonable accommodations which could be performed by towson with minimal cost or disruption to the football program.he claimed that towson university refusal to allow him to participate in football with these accommodations discriminated against him by reason of his disability.
following the commencement of this action and class continued training,the korey stringer institute conducted a third heat tolerance test of class on june.this was a moderate intensity test that required class,in an environment of with humidity,to maintain a rectal temperature of or lower for a period of one hour.the institute reported that class was able to maintain the specified temperature for minutes,but,unlike the prior test reports,the june report did not specify what rectal temperature was reached at any point during the test.rather,it stated 
while there was not a plateau in your rectal body temperature,your rate of rise was low enough to allow you to complete minutes of exercise with an expected body temperature for individuals exercising in the heat.the only limiting factor to completing minutes of exercise was muscular fatigue,which is expected for your fitness,sport and physical make up.
the report concluded,given your previous tests it is very encouraging to see that you have been able to make predictable and significant improvements in you ability to handle exercise in the heat.you have made sizeable gains,and it is important to maintain the gains you have made and continue to spend time maintaining and improving your fitness.the report stated that class could fully participate with regularly scheduled football practices,subject to five conditions which it strongly recommended.as detailed further in the report,the five conditions were that class 
c ontinue to perform conditioning workouts outside 
c ontinue to follow the mandated ncaa heat acclimatization guidelines 
m onitor his body temperature when performing exercise or conditioning sessions 
m onitor his fluid needs and match his fluid losses and 
conduct a ll exercise progression at the discretion and direct observation of a medical professional.
at the bench trial in this case,the institute chief operating officer,douglas casa,a certified athletic trainer who holds a in exercise physiology,testified that the temperature monitoring condition condition in the june test report could be accomplished by using a cortemp system,which would require class to ingest a small electronic device that would track his internal body temperature and communicate the readings through a radio waves to a nearby handheld monitor.as casa explained,the system would require that the monitor be positioned near class for to seconds every to minutes,which would provide data with sufficient frequency to allow class to cease physical activity before his internal temperature reached the dangerous level at which a heatstroke could occur.
kindschi testified,however,that the institute june test did not alter her professional judgment as it did not clear class to return to football but only to a progression of activities that would require monitoring and a.she expressed concern about data omitted from the institute june report that appeared in the prior two reports.finally,she continued to note that the june test was not conducted under conditions that mimicked actual football practice and games and in an environment reflecting baltimore heat and humidity.
following the bench trial,the district court found that class had a disability within the meaning of the ada and the rehabilitation act because both his status as a transplant recipient and victim of heat stroke seriously affected major life activities.a lternatively,the court held,class clearly qualifie d as an individual with a record of a protected disability under b.the court determined that towson university had discriminated against class on the basis of this disability by refusing to provide the requested accommodations,particularly the abdominal padding and internal temperature monitoring,which the court found to be reasonable.by judgment dated july,the court permanently enjoined towson university from violating class rights under the americans with disabilities act and section of the rehabilitation act by prohibiting him from participating in the university football program resulting from medical concerns related to his status as a transplant recipient and heat stroke victim.
from the judgment entered,towson university filed this appeal.by order dated july,we granted towson university motion to stay the district court judgment,and on august,we granted class motion to order an expedited appellate schedule.
towson university contends first that the district court erred in finding that class,as a victim of heat stroke,is disabled within the meaning of the ada recognizing that disability,as defined by the act,means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,a,towson university argues that class did not present any evidence that his impaired ability to thermoregulate affects a major life activity or that thermoregulation itself is a major bodily function.it reasons that class increased risk of reoccurrence of heatstroke as a result of his original heatstroke does not establish that he has a disability because that increased risk is just that a risk it does not substantially limit either a major life activity or the operation of a major bodily function.
while towson university acknowledges that an impairment that is episodic or in remission would qualify as a disability if it substantially limits a major life activity when active,d,the university contends that class limitations on thermoregulation are not episodic or in remission.it asserts that class makes no claim that he still suffers any such impairments or that such impairments are likely to return the only activity as to which class claims any current,actual or potential impairment is the one at heart of this suit playing intercollegiate football.and that,it suggests,is clearly not a major life activity.see,knapp northwestern,cir playing intercollegiate basketball obviously is not in and of itself a major life activity,as it is not a basic function of life on the same level as walking,breathing,and speaking.
class contends that he has never asserted that playing football is a major life activity.rather,he contends that the question is whether his impairment,when active,substantially limits a major life activity,such as walking,caring for himself,or lifting objects.he reasons 
the evidence at trial indicated that class may be at an increased risk of a reoccurrence of heat stroke as a result of his original injury or in other words,that class disabilities are currently in remission.if class had a recurrence of heat stroke the very thing the accommodations are designed to prevent he would be unable to engage in caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,seeing,hearing,eating,sleeping,walking,standing,lifting,bending,speaking,breathing,learning,reading,concentrating,thinking,communicating,and working.a.that is all the law now requires.

the statutory requirements for showing disability are not disputed.an individual has a disability under the ada when he a has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual b has a record of such an impairment or c is regarded as having such an impairment.class rests his claims on subsections a and b.
a major life activity is in turn defined to include basic tasks that are part of everyday living,such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,seeing,hearing,eating,sleeping,walking,standing,and lifting,a providing a nonexhaustive list and the operation of a major bodily function,id.b.in response to the supreme court strict construction of this provision,which had indicated that a temporary impairment could not be a disability,see toyota motor,williams,d,congress enacted the ada amendments act of,stat.that act provides that the term disability must be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under the ada,to the maximum extent permitted by the ada.a.overturning toyota,the ada amendments act also provides that a n impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.id.d emphasis added.
relying on the ada amendments act,class argues that playing football could incite his impaired ability to thermoregulate,activating a condition that is otherwise dormant.of course,when active,the condition would clearly limit the major life activities of walking,lifting,and caring for oneself,as occurred during class exertional heatstroke.
the unanswered question in class argument is whether the statutory term when active must imply an activation of the impairment prompted by normal life conditions.in this case,class limitation on thermoregulation can become active only under the extreme exertion of a prolonged and demanding football practice or game in high heat and humidity.in such conditions,anyone could suffer heatstroke.if when active were to include the possibility of activation under any condition,however extreme,it would encompass a broad range of limitations or impairments that would drastically expand the scope of disability under the ada.for example,with such a definition of disability,the inability of one mountain climber to oxygenate as well as another climber at very high altitudes,such as during an ascent of everest,could be considered a disability.
while a closer analysis might find it difficult to extend the definition of disability to cover a condition that becomes active only under extreme conditions,far beyond the scope of normal daily living,we need not engage in that novel analysis in this case in light of our following conclusion that class is not otherwise qualified to participate in towson university football program with accommodations.for the same reason,we need not address whether class has a record of such an impairment.b.
as noted,class must also carry the burden of showing that he is otherwise qualified to participate in towson university football program by establishing that he could satisfy the essential eligibility requirements of the program and if not,whether any reasonable accommodation by towson university would enable him to meet these requirements.halpern wake forest.health sciences,at,cir quoting tyndall educ,cir.in the context of postsecondary education,a disabled person is qualified if he shows that he meets the academic and technical standards requisite to admission or participation in the school education program or activity.l see also knapp,at.the term technical standards refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria that are essential to participation in the program in question.southeastern cmty.coll.davis,d quoting an explanatory note to the original regulations.and a nonacademic eligibility criterion is essential if it bear s more than a marginal relationship to the program at issue.halpern,at quoting tyndall,at.
in determining whether an educational institution eligibility requirement is essential and whether it has been met,we accord a measure of deference to the school professional judgment.see halpern,at citing supreme court cases i n the context of challenges and several cases in which our sister circuits have overwhelmingly extended some level of deference to schools professional judgments regarding students qualifications when addressing disability discrimination claims see also davis of,cir explaining in dicta that in the context of academic eligibility requirements and disability challenges,this court generally accord s great deference to a school determination of the qualifications of a hopeful student.of course,in according deference,we still must take special care to ensure that eligibility requirements do not disguise truly discriminatory requirements.halpern,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
towson university contends that satisfying its return to play policy,which requires clearance by the team physician,is an essential eligibility requirement for participation in its football program as well as other athletic programs,reflecting the need that participation in athletics be conducted in a healthy and safe manner.applying such a requirement does not seem to be controversial in this case or in many others.see,knapp,at a lthough blanket exclusions are generally unacceptable,legitimate physical requirements are proper to ensure the health and safety of citing southeastern cmty,at halpern,at holding that professionalism was an essential requirement of a medical school program in part because inappropriate and disruptive behavior by physicians increases adverse patient outcomes doe of.med,cir determining,based on sch.bd.of nassau cnty.arline,d,that an medical resident was not otherwise qualified because he posed a significant risk of transmitting the infectious disease to others.analogously,the supreme court has held that employers may consider the risk a potential employee disability poses to himself in determining whether he is qualified for a job.see chevron echazabal,d.
unlike with many other educational activities,physical risk is an inherent element of athletic programs.the ncaa,as amicus,explains that decisions about the impact of health and safety risks on players are made daily concerning a host of medical conditions,such as concussion,cervical spine trauma,cardiac arrest,knee injuries,and more.granting the team physician final clearance authority,a policy that is consistent with ncaa guidelines and national best practices,is a fair and reasonable manner for towson university to coordinate these essential determinations for the unique and dynamic medical profiles of its several hundred.while this policy does not completely safeguard against possible discrimination,it helps to ensure that the physician ethical and professional imperative to care for the best interests of trumps other university concerns or motivations,including those that could be discriminatory.arline,at explaining that an otherwise qualified inquiry must be guided by facts,based on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge,about the nature of the risk posed by an individual participation in the program.
accordingly,we conclude that towson university requirement that a obtain the team physician clearance before returning from injury is legitimately an essential eligibility requirement.class does not appear to dispute this.nor does he contend that he is able,without accommodation,to participate healthily and safely in the football program.rather,he contends that the team physician decision to reject his proposed accommodations to allow him to play football healthily and safely was unreasonable because,as he argues 
the team physician has been practicing medicine for five years and admittedly has no expertise and virtually no experience in dealing with heat stroke.she never explained why it would be unsafe for class to return to the football field.she merely stated that she was concerned about his ability to thermoregulate,that she was concerned that he had a propensity for heat stroke,that any future heat stroke could be catastrophic,and that she consulted unidentified colleagues at medstar without claiming any heat stroke expertise on their part.she acknowledged that she was not aware of any scientific literature or research that supported her opinion.
in other words,the team physician medical opinion was based on her feelings,not on any medical or scientific evidence.
the dispositive question,therefore,is whether the team physician opinion was reasonable,whether it was individualized,reasonably made,and based upon competent medical evidence.knapp,at.and in resolving this question,we give the team physician decision and derivatively,towson university decision a measure of deference.see halpern,at davis,at knapp,at doe,at.nonetheless,when considering whether the decision is reasonable,we must be satisfied that it was consistent with the university statutory obligations to provide reasonable accommodations and not a pretext for illegal discrimination.see halpern,at knapp,at.stated otherwise,in evaluating reasonableness,we must determine whether the team physician decision and,derivatively,towson university decision was a application of its policy to protect the health and safety of,was in compliance with the university statutory obligations to provide reasonable accommodations,and was not a disguise for discrimination under the ada or the rehabilitation act.because the record here indicates that kindschi and towson university applied the return to play policy in and that the decision not to fully reinstate class was not simply a pretext for unlawful discrimination,we focus on whether kindschi and towson university reasonably considered class proposed accommodations.
class proposes six accommodations,which,he argues,would satisfy towson university need for his healthy and safe participation in the football program and thus render him qualified under towson university return to play policy.specifically,he proposes the use of padding to protect his abdominal wall and the implementation of the five conditions listed in the korey stringer institute june test report,two of which are challenged by towson university as unreasonable the condition that class internal temperature be closely monitored and the condition that all exercise be done at the discretion and under the direct observation of a medical professional.in particular,towson university contends that these proposed accommodations would impose undue financial and administrative burdens would not effectively reduce class risk of heatstroke and would require fundamental changes in the nature of the football program.the relevant cases indeed note that an accommodation is unreasonable if it imposes undue financial and administrative burdens,halpern,at quoting arline,at or if there is a high likelihood that the accommodation would not effectively allow the disabled individual to meet the eligibility requirements,halpern,at holding that the indefinite duration and uncertain likelihood of success of plaintiff proposed accommodation renders it unreasonable or if it requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program,arline,at alteration in original quoting southeastern cmty,at explaining that an accommodation whereby a nursing student would take only academic classes and no clinical courses would fundamentally alter the nurse training program.
towson university contention that the requested accommodations would impose an undue financial and administrative burden is not well developed in the record,although the university did present evidence that its football trainers are not qualified to implement the cortemp temperature monitoring system,suggesting that class proposed accommodation would require the expense of training them and even hiring additional personnel.moreover,as a matter of possible administrative burden,we have difficulty understanding how the temperature monitoring system class proposed could function in the context of a football game,particularly for a starting offensive lineman,such as class.during football games,athletic trainers,such as the trainer who would be designated to monitor class every to minutes under his proposed accommodations,are not allowed to participate in football huddles unless a timeout has been called.moreover,portions of football games are often played without huddles,and offensive drives routinely take more than to minutes on a clock.indeed,they often take more than to minutes on a game clock.and,if a reading indicated an internal body temperature,class would have to be removed from the game for an indefinite period of time sufficient to let him cool down.the coach would be denied his starting offensive guard and class would be denied his wish to play.nonetheless,we can not conclude on this sparse record that the district court erred in rejecting towson university challenge on the ground that the accommodation would impose undue financial and administrative burdens.
but towson university contention that the requested accommodations are not reasonable because they would not effectively satisfy towson university safety concerns and would require fundamental changes in the nature of its football program has merit.we address each reason in order.
on the issue of whether the requested accommodations would effectively eliminate the risk of a second catastrophic heatstroke,kindschi concluded that class full participation in the football program,even with the proposed accommodations,would unacceptably expose him to the risk of another heatstroke that could be fatal.it is not our role to agree or disagree with kindschi opinion or to weigh whether her evaluation is more persuasive than another doctor.rather,we are to determine whether her professional judgment was supported by the record.we conclude that it was.
first,class himself claims that he suffers from an inability to regulate his body temperature and susceptibility to heat stroke.similarly,the district court found that the evidence at trial indicated that class may be at an increased risk of a reoccurrence of heat stroke as a result of his original injury.emphasis added.
second,the korey stringer institute test reports indicate that the heatstroke risk really has not been demonstrably abated.the first report shows that class failed to thermoregulate adequately during a low intensity heat tolerance test.the second and third reports show that he passed,although he did so with several substantial caveats and conditions related to his inability to thermoregulate sufficiently.his second test was another low intensity test,and class performance prompted the institute to recommend that class limit any high intensity exercise including football to cool environments.it strongly suggest ed that class undergo a third test before engaging in intense conditioning that is done in a warm to hot environment.in his third and final test,which was of moderate intensity,class was able to perform for only minutes of the scheduled minute test.the institute reported that class had made sizeable gains,but that it was important that,while engaging in any intense exercise,he be directly supervised by a medical professional and have his internal temperature closely monitored.
third,all of the korey stringer institute tests were conducted while class was wearing shorts and a light and not while wearing standard football gear,including a uniform,football pads,and a helmet,and the specialized protective padding required to protect his liver.casa,the director of the institute,conceded that test conditions did not replicate football conditions.and he also conceded that the relative humidity under which the tests were conducted did not replicate baltimore average humidity in august the tests were conducted in humidity while baltimore average august humidity was shown to be around.
fourth,class august heatstroke left him with a compromised physical condition,including a thinner abdominal wall,an ongoing requirement to take medications,and an increased susceptibility to a future fatal heatstroke.relying on class medical records,kindschi described the medical reasons for class compromised condition 
his initial heatstroke was nearly fatal.he had failure and dysfunction which led to fulminant necrosis of his liver,requiring transplant.he had a very complicated postoperative course that included multiple surgeries for wound dehiscences and infections.he had kidney failure that required intervention.he had a hemothorax.he had persistently elevated liver enzymes after discharge.and he had lymphoproliferative disease which required chemotherapy.
she concluded by stating that class prior heatstroke was a risk factor for future heat illness,a conclusion that was not disputed and that the district court found.
on this record,it is clear that kindschi judgment that class could not play football without the risk of serious injury or death was well supported.that conclusion leaves only the question of whether kindschi opinion that the temperature monitoring accommodation would not sufficiently reduce this risk was reasonable.
kindschi considered the proposed accommodation to monitor class internal body temperature throughout his football activity and concluded that it would not adequately meet the needs of health and safety.she explained that she had concerns about the reliability of where the electronic heat sensor was in the gi system,noting that digestion is a fairly individualized and even process.she explained that such unreliability would be compounded by the difficulty of figur ing out practices with one cortemp sensor.she stated that she would not feel comfortable having towson university trainers monitor class internal temperature without a physician present,stating that such a role was beyond their scope.and she concluded that the monitoring program,even if well implemented,would not eliminate the meaningful risk of catastrophic reinjury.kindschi stated that,in making her decision,she had considered the serious risk of injury or death in the context of the potential problems in administering the monitoring system,conceding that the decision was very difficult and was made only after considerable thought.
kindschi concerns were supported by casa testimony,which explained in detail how the monitoring system would be carried out.after explaining that class internal body temperature would be monitored by an electronic sensor that class ingested,emitting a electronic signal from his intestinal tract,he described how a monitor would have to be placed near class to receive the signal and obtain the readings.the person holding the monitor would have to hold it near class for to seconds every to minutes,requiring either that the person holding the monitor go onto the football field into the huddle or that class go to the sidelines.as casa explained 
so just during normal,when he flipping out of certain drills,you know,if he rotating around,a manager can be sitting there where the person holding the water bottles and he could check him as people rotate through.if there specific,you know,designated rest breaks,then obviously someone can just come behind him.
casa also testified to caveats that reiterated kindschi concerns.as he testified 
now,there are a few caveats.you have to ingest the electronic sensor a certain number of hours beforehand so that it out of the stomach and into the intestines to allow for more accurate measures.you obviously have to have a new pill when the other pill has been passed.you have to have the receiver and a small amount of training to make sure you can utilize the device.
you probably have a manager or someone assigned to checking the temperature every time there a break or every time it convenient,every five or ten minutes,and then the specific instructions from the athletic trainer that every time a measure is taken,that is communicated to the athletic trainer.i mean my particular recommendations would be if they reached i would give them a break,use particular strategies and use hydration.and then when it went back down under,i would let em return to activity.
finally,and perhaps most importantly,the internal temperature monitoring could not ensure that class would not suffer from another heatstroke while playing or practicing.the monitoring would only facilitate the discretionary decision of whether it was necessary to remove him from the game or practice.this would not guarantee that his removal would,in fact,be sufficiently early.in any event,removing him from the activity would deny class the very participation that he seeks by the accommodation.he could not play as the coach might need if playing were to raise his internal temperature to a dangerous level,which itself would be an individualized threshold,would not be known with any certainty,and would be predicted only as a discretionary medical judgment that could prove to be wrong.
on this record,class claim that kindschi decision had no medical support is simply untenable.while he may disagree with her judgment,even his expert testimony purporting to support his return,at least to football practice,was filled with serious caveats and precautions.and no one disputed that the monitoring effort would be conducted against the continuous and heightened risk of heatstroke and the reality that numerous athletes had died or suffered serious injury from it including class himself.indeed,casa conceded that over a recent year period,athletes had died from heatstroke in the united states.
as noted,the standard for assessing kindschi judgment not to clear class for return to football under towson university return to play policy is not whether we share that judgment or whether she had a better judgment than some other doctor.rather,the standard is whether her judgment was reasonable,whether it was individualized to class,was reasonably made,and was based on competent medical evidence.when applying that standard,we conclude that kindschi decision was supported by legitimate health and safety concerns,manifested by the medical records,which were not eliminated by the proposed monitoring system.therefore,we conclude that her decision was not unreasonable.
courts are particularly to evaluate the medical ineffectiveness of proposed accommodations in safeguarding against significant health risks.davis,at quoting bd.of curators of the of horowitz,d explaining that courts generally accord deference to a school judgment regarding admissions qualifications.in this case,the district court did not show deference to towson university but engaged in its own evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed accommodations.in doing so,it applied the wrong standard and analysis.see halpern,noting that courts are at a comparative disadvantage in determining technical eligibility standards knapp,at explaining that it will be the rare case regarding participation in athletics where a court may substitute its judgment for that of the school team physicians doe,at explaining that the court was reluctant to substitute its judgment for that of the university,despite potentially conflicting recommendations from the centers for disease control and prevention.at bottom,we agree with the seventh circuit articulation in knapp regarding the courts role in such issues.as the knapp court stated 
on the same facts,another team physician at another university,reviewing the same medical history,physical evaluation,and medical recommendations,might reasonably decide that class met the physical qualifications for playing on an intercollegiate football team.simply put,all universities need not evaluate risk the same way.what we say in this case is that if substantial evidence supports the that decision must be respected.
while it is sufficient in evaluating the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation to rely on only one factor,towson university also contends that the temperature monitoring and medical supervision proposed by class would fundamentally alter the nature of its football program.we agree.
class proposed accommodations would require towson university team physician to allow class to play football and supervise his participation when,in her medical judgment,she has concluded that he should not be playing football under the circumstances.the relevant accommodation,as stated by the korey stringer institute report,requires that a ll exercise progression should be done at the discretion and direct observation of a medical professional.emphasis added.yet it would not be possible to implement such an accommodation without upending the critical role of the team physician and her subordinates and impinging on the ongoing professional medical discretion she is retained to exercise.because the team physician role is an essential aspect of the football program for many of the same reasons the university clearance requirement is an essential eligibility requirement,class proposed modification would constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.see halpern,at citing pga tour,martin,d examining a rule purpose and importance to the program to determine if it is an essential aspect,such that a change to the rule would fundamentally alter the program.
for these reasons,we find that the team physician judgment and,derivatively,towson university judgment to reject class proposed accommodations were not unreasonable in the context of the risks.
gavin class is a courageous man of substantial character,which is much to be admired.he understandably has been seeking to validate his determination and perseverance to return to intercollegiate football and to become the first person to come back from exertional heatstroke and a liver transplant to play football.while we hold that towson university acted reasonably in response to the health risks posed by class full participation in its football program,we nonetheless believe that class has achieved a substantial victory with his accomplishments.he can be proud to tell his story.
towson university towson decided that gavin class,a student who had suffered a serious heatstroke,could no longer safely participate in its division i football program.class challenged this decision under the americans with disabilities act ada and the rehabilitation act.the key question we must answer is what level of deference the district court should have applied in evaluating whether towson discriminated against class on account of his alleged disability.
the majority opinion and i agree that the district court applied the wrong standard in evaluating towson decision.the team physician medical determination that class faced too great a risk of serious injury or death to fully participate in towson football program was entitled to some deference.we all agree that the district court should have reviewed kindschi opinion to determine if it was individualized,reasonably made,and based upon competent medical evidence.in my view,however,the touchstone of this inquiry should be the objective reasonableness of the university decision not the subjective good faith of the team physician,as the majority opinion suggests.
further,i can not support applying the appropriate standard for the first time here on appeal.instead,the proper course of action is to remand the case,so that the district court may make factual findings in accordance with the correct standard of deference.therefore,i respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
at the heart of this case is the appropriate level of deference that we should accord to towson decision that class could no longer safely participate in its football program.i thus address that issue first.
class claims arise under two similar provisions of law the ada and the rehabilitation act.under title ii of the ada,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity.similarly,section of the rehabilitation act imposes the same prohibition on any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a 
under the ada,a disabled person is otherwise qualified to participate in a program if he is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies,or practices,meets the essential eligibility requirements for participation in that program.see l,stating a nearly identical standard applicable to rehabilitation act claims.
in my view,the essential eligibility requirement at issue here is the ability to play football without an unacceptable risk to the player health and safety.see doe of.med,cir a n individual is not otherwise qualified if he poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others.i therefore disagree with the majority opinion conclusion that towson university requirement that a obtain the team physician clearance before returning from injury is legitimately an essential eligibility requirement.ante,at.it is inconsistent with the ada to elevate the unilateral approval of the entity accused of discrimination to the status of an essential eligibility requirement,as the majority opinion does here kindschi determined whether class met the pertinent essential eligibility requirement class ability to play football without an unacceptable risk to his health and safety her determination itself was not the essential eligibility requirement 
with the appropriate essential eligibility requirement in mind,i turn to the standard that the district court should have applied in evaluating kindschi opinion.my review of the relevant ada and rehabilitation act case law convinces me that kindschi opinion should have been reviewed for objective reasonableness,in contrast to the majority opinion more subjective approach.
