this interlocutory appeal arises from a wrongful termination action brought by several former employees of the city of long beach city against the city,the city manager,and the republican members of the city council council members,both in their individual capacities and in their official capacities as council members.hereinafter,plaintiffs claim that the hereinafter,defendants terminated their employment because of their affiliation with the democratic party and their exercise of free speech,in violation of their first amendment rights,their due process rights,and.plaintiffs also assert that defendants conspired to terminate them on the basis of their political affiliations and beliefs,and failed to prevent the terminations from occurring,in violation of and 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds,including legislative and qualified immunity.on march,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joanna seybert,judge granted the motion in part and denied it in part.in particular,the district court held that while the council members were absolutely immune for voting for the budgetary resolutions that abolished plaintiffs positions,they were not so protected for meeting with to discuss the terminations because those meetings were allegedly conducted in secret.the district court also denied the council members motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.
we hold that legislative immunity applies not only to the council members vote on the budgetary resolutions that terminated the budget lines for plaintiffs positions,but also to any discussions and agreements the council members may have had regarding the new budget prior to the vote,regardless of whether those discussions and agreements took place in secret.thus,to the extent that the,and claims against the council members relate to the legislative termination of the budget lines for plaintiffs positions,the district court denial of legislative immunity is reversed.
while the grant of legislative immunity covers all aspects of the legislative process,it would not protect the council members from a charge,if asserted here,that they administratively fired,or conspired to administratively fire,any plaintiff prior to the date on which his or her position was effectively abolished pursuant to the legislative resolutions.we remand the case for the district court to determine,based on the operative complaint or upon further amendment,whether any of the plaintiffs have alleged or could allege such a claim.finally,we dismiss for lack of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction the council members appeal of the denial of qualified immunity for the firing of mary cammarato based on the contention that she was a policymaker,as well as the city appeal of the denial of its motion to dismiss.
background 
factual allegations 
as this case comes to us after the denial of a motion to dismiss,we must accept the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.see hill city of new york,cir.according to the amended complaint,plaintiffs were all longtime employees for the city until they were terminated in.maria almonte was terminated from her position as bus dispatcher effective june.mary cammarato was suspended from her post as tax assessor on july,and then ostensibly the following day.barbara davis served as an administrative aide until her employment with the city was terminated on june.peter snow was terminated from his position as the superintendent of municipal buildings effective july.at the time of their terminations,plaintiffs were all active and members of the democratic party,with close affiliations with longstanding leaders of the long beach democratic party.cammarato and snow were especially active in campaigning for democratic candidates leading up to the elections.
mona goodman,james hennessey,and thomas sofield,were elected to the city council in they belonged to the republican party and,at the time of plaintiffs terminations,constituted the majority of the city council.glen spiritis,also a member of the republican party,was appointed as city manager.
sometime in,goodman,hennessey,sofield,and spiritis participated in a series of private meetings at the home of charles theofan,the corporation counsel for the city.also in attendance was james moriarity,the executive leader of the long beach republican party.the two democratic members of the city council were not invited to the meetings,or notified of their purpose or occurrence.according to the amended complaint,one purpose of these secret,unofficial meetings was to discuss firing plaintiffs on account of their political affiliations with the democratic party and their allegiance to the leaders of the long beach democratic party.plaintiffs claim that during the course of those meetings,the participants reached a decision or agreement to fire them on that basis.
on may,the city council convened,and passed by majority vote,resolution,which adopted and confirmed the budget and personnel schedule for the fiscal year the new budget terminated the funding for the positions of bus dispatcher,tax assessor,and administrative aide,effective july.on august,the council passed a supplemental budgetary resolution,resolution,which amended the personnel roster to delete the position of superintendent of municipal buildings,effective immediately.
b.the district court march,decision 
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,raising a number of different arguments.of relevance to this appeal,the council members asserted that absolute legislative immunity barred all claims against them because their enactment of the budgetary resolutions,which plaintiffs positions,constituted legitimate legislative activity.in the alternative,the council members argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity against mary cammarato claims,because as the city tax assessor,she was a policymaker within the meaning of elrod burns,d.the city also invoked the policymaker exception in support of dismissal of cammarato municipal liability claims.in addition,the city contended that none of the plaintiffs had adequately alleged a constitutional violation caused by a municipal policy,custom,or practice.
the district court granted the council members motion in part and denied it in part.it held that legislative immunity insulated the council members from liability for voting for and passing the budgetary resolutions.it found that legislative immunity did not extend,however,to the council members purported participation in secret meetings with.relying on berlickij town of castleton,d,the district court reasoned that the secrecy of the meetings took them outside the sphere of legitimate legislative activity and,as a result,outside the protective scope of legislative immunity.
the district court also denied the council members motion to dismiss mary cammarato claims on qualified immunity grounds.while it noted that the argument sounded plausible,the district court concluded that further factual development was necessary before it could determine whether cammarato was or was not a policymaker within the meaning of elrod burns.the district court denied the city motion to dismiss the,and claims asserted against it.
the council members now seek interlocutory review of the district court denial of legislative and qualified immunity.the city requests that we exercise pendent jurisdiction over the district court denial of its motion to dismiss.
discussion 
interlocutory appellate jurisdiction 
generally,this court has jurisdiction over appeals only from final decisions of the district courts.the denial of a motion to dismiss is ordinarily considered,and therefore not immediately appealable.hill,at.under the collateral doctrine,however,a n order denying a motion to dismiss a complaint against a n official when the dismissal motion is based on the official assertion of absolute or qualified immunity is immediately reviewable,to the extent that the denial turns on issues of law.id.at see also locurto safir,cir holding that an interlocutory appeal is permitted from the denial of immunity at the motion to dismiss phase,even when it is without prejudice,because such a denial is conclusive with regard to a defendant right to avoid discovery,so long as the validity of the denial of the immunity defense can be decided as a matter of law in light of the record on appeal.on the other hand,if a factual determination is a necessary predicate to the resolution of whether immunity is a bar,review is postponed.parkinson cozzolino,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs contend that the council members raised the defenses of legislative and qualified immunity only against the claims,and that consequently,this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the availability of immunity with respect to the claims.plaintiffs argument is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the defense of immunity.immunity,either absolute or qualified,is a personal defense that is available only when officials are sued in their individual capacities t he immunities officials enjoy when sued personally do not extend to instances where they are sued in their official capacities.morris lindau,cir see goldberg town of rocky hill,cir explaining that an claim is in substance a claim against the municipality,which can not assert immunity,either absolute or qualified,as a defense to liability under.the council members asserted both legislative and qualified immunity in their motion to dismiss,and the district court addressed these issues at length in its decision accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review whether the council members are immune from liability in their individual capacities,to the extent that the inquiry turns on questions of law.
because no final order has been entered in this case,we lack appellate jurisdiction to decide issues that are not independently entitled to interlocutory review.see rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir.we have discretion to exert pendent jurisdiction over such an issue,but this discretion may be exercised only a where the issue is inextricably intertwined with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal,or b where review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of a jurisdictionally sufficient one.id.at quoting swint chambers county comm n,d.
legislative immunity 
under the supreme court functional test of absolute legislative immunity,whether immunity attaches turns not on the official identity,or even on the official motive or intent,but on the nature of the act in question.see harhay town of ellington bd.of,cir citing bogan,d,and forrester white,d.more specifically,legislative immunity shields an official from liability if the act in question was undertaken in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.id.quoting bogan,at.local legislators,like their counterparts on the state and regional levels,are entitled to absolute immunity for their legislative activities.bogan,at.harhay,at.
the council members argue that the district court erroneously relied on the berlickij case in analyzing their defense of legislative immunity.we agree.in berlickij,the plaintiff complained that the members of the town selectboard and planning commission had conducted their executive sessions in secret and had thereby denied her and others the opportunity to speak and to participate in town meetings,and denied her access to a public forum.berlickij,d at.in other words,in berlickij it was the very secrecy of the meetings that the plaintiff claimed had violated her rights.here,by contrast,there is no tenable contention that plaintiffs had a legal right to attend the meetings at theofan home,and plaintiffs claims are not premised on a theory of wrongful exclusion.rather,plaintiffs assert that the council members violated their rights by terminating,and conspiring to terminate,their employment on the basis of their political beliefs and affiliations with the opposing party.thus,whether legislative immunity requires dismissal of the claims against the council members depends on whether these particular alleged firing of,and conspiracy to fire,undertaken in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.harhay,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court granted legislative immunity for the council members vote for the budgetary resolutions that terminated the budget lines for plaintiffs positions,but denied it with respect to their alleged participation in the secret meetings.we hold that legislative immunity is not limited to the casting of a vote on a resolution or bill it covers all aspects of the legislative process,including the discussions held and alliances struck regarding a legislative matter in anticipation of a formal vote.as the supreme court has explained,the purpose of absolute legislative immunity is to protect legislators from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty,not for their private indulgence but for the public good.tenney brandhove.meeting with persons outside the as executive officers,partisans,political interest groups,or discuss issues that bear on potential legislation,and participating in party caucuses to form a united position on matters of legislative policy,assist legislators in the discharge of their legislative duty.these activities are also a routine and legitimate part of the legislative process.see bruce riddle,cir observing that m eeting with interest groups,professional or amateur,regardless of their motivation,is a part and parcel of the modern legislative procedures through which legislators receive information possibly bearing on the legislation they are to consider.the fact that such meetings are politically motivated,or conducted behind closed doors,does not take away from the legislative character of the process.see tenney,at.holding that t he claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege.
applying this principle to the instant case,we conclude that legislative immunity cloaks not only the vote on the budgetary resolutions,but also any discussions the council members may have held,and any agreements they may have made,regarding the new budget in the months preceding the actual vote.that the discussions and agreements occurred in secret does not strip these activities of their legislative function.therefore,to the extent that plaintiffs,and claims relate to the legislative termination of the budget lines for their positions,the denial of legislative immunity was incorrect as a matter of law and must therefore be reversed.
this conclusion does not automatically dispose of the entirety of plaintiffs claims against the council members,however.as we held in jessen town of eastchester,cir per curiam,absolute legislative immunity does not protect legislators against a claim of an administrative firing,even if the employee position was later abolished pursuant to a legislative act.see id.at even assuming,without deciding,that the elimination of jessen position was a legislative act,his earlier termination from a position which then,at least briefly,remained open was an administrative act that legislative immunity does not protect.a personnel decision is administrative in nature if it is directed at a particular employee or employees,and is not part of a broader legislative policy.bogan,at.the ordinance reflected a discretionary,policymaking decision implicating the budgetary priorities of the city and the services the city provides to its constituents.moreover,it involved the termination of a position,which,unlike the hiring or firing of a particular employee,may have prospective implications that reach well beyond the particular occupant of the office thus,petitioners activities were undoubtedly legislative.emphasis added.administrative personnel decisions,even if undertaken by public officials who otherwise are entitled to immunity,do not give rise to legislative immunity because such decisionmaking is no different in substance from that which is enjoyed by other actors.harhay,at.thus in harhay,we concluded that the town board members were not absolutely immune for their actions with respect to the plaintiff employment,including their vote to table the matter of another employee
