robert joyal,the in this age discrimination case,had worked in hasbro,games division for years when he was fired on december.he was then years old,and was replaced by a subordinate who was years old.after exhausting administrative remedies,joyal brought suit in state court against hasbro,which removed the matter to federal court on diversity grounds.
joyal complaint charged that hasbro had illegally discriminated against joyal by firing him on the basis of age,in violation of.laws ch.in two further counts,joyal claimed that hasbro had breached its employment contract with him by failing to use progressive discipline and had improperly deprived him of an bonus to which he was entitled under the company management incentive plan.
following discovery,hasbro moved for summary judgment on all three of joyal claims.the magistrate judge,acting on the matter with the consent of the parties,c,granted summary judgment to hasbro on all counts on october.joyal now appeals.we consider de novo whether the district court properly granted summary judgment,see banco popular de puerto rico,cir,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of joyal.sparks fidelity title ins,cir.
the main subject of joyal appeal is his statutory age discrimination claim.the massachusetts statute,like the federal age discrimination in employment act of,generally prevents employment action taken against older employees because of their age.massachusetts case law uses a device akin to federal law to force the employer to supply reasons for his action once an easily made prima facie case is established.compare abramian president fellows of harvard,with mcdonnell douglas green,d.
here,joyal provided the prima facie case,primarily by showing that he was in the group and was replaced by a substantially younger man.see blare husky injection molding.boston.hasbro in turn provided three specific reasons for the firing,coupled with facts colorably supporting the reasons joyal misuse or attempted misuse of company property for personal benefit retaliation against an employee who had refused to cooperate with that misuse and an abusive management style.
under massachusetts law,as under federal law,the employer provision of a reason or reasons rebuts the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case,and the issue of discriminatory intent then turns upon the evidence.abramian,at.under federal law,that evidence may include inferences drawn against the employer if his alleged reason or reasons for the adverse action are shown to be pretextual.udo tomes,cir.
massachusetts law is similar,but in one relevant respect perhaps even friendlier to plaintiffs.under lipchitz raytheon,a plaintiff may be and regardless of avoid a directed verdict and reach a jury if he or she proves that at least one of the reasons given by the defendant was pretextual.this subtlety was not at issue in fite digital equip,cir,where we said that federal and massachusetts law were aligned,but were dealing mainly with jury instructions and not a directed verdict.
if lipchitz does authorize the jury to decide for the plaintiff merely because the employer lied in one respect and regardless of circumstances,this may seem an oddly mechanical rule one can imagine easily a case where an unimpeached and powerful nondiscriminatory reason is proved but the jury finds pretextual a further reason also given by the employer as a.but,like the magistrate judge,we will assume arguendo that under massachusetts law any deliberately false reason would get joyal to a jury.
in this case,there is no direct evidence,such as slighting remarks or express admissions,see,blare,at,fontaine ebtec,that hasbro was hostile to older workers or that joyal dismissal was motivated by age.however,joyal argues that the circumstances of the all,the alleged falsity of one or more of the reasons permit a reasonable jury to infer that one or more of the reasons was pretext and therefore,under lipchitz,that age discrimination was an actual motive for joyal dismissal.
this is the most familiar of issues on summary judgment whether,resolving reasonable doubts in his favor,the evidence so far could rationally support a jury verdict for the plaintiff.see anderson liberty lobby,d.contrary to joyal intimation on appeal,there is no indication that the magistrate judge misunderstood the legal framework adversely to joyal.but,by the same token,our obligation is independently to assess the evidence and reach our own conclusion.
the basis offered for hasbro actions is easily summarized based on the summary judgment record.hasbro is a major toymaker headquartered in rhode island with operations in various other locations.over a period,joyal worked his way up to a senior vice president position at the company plant in east longmeadow,massachusetts.david wilson was the division president based at the facility and,at the time of the firing,joyal reported to in turn reported to alfred verrecchia,hasbro president and chief executive officer in pawtucket,rhode island.
in august,joyal through another employee asked a subordinate,scott aye,for the keys to a hasbro truck so that joyal could transport personal materials to his home.this might appear to be a trivial matter,but hasbro had a history of criminal and civil litigation in the involving corruption and misuse of company assets.see generally united states serafino,cir.its company handbook prohibited such misuse,and an explicit policy statement specifically regarding the use of company vehicles for private purposes had been circulated to joyal division in march.
aye refused to give joyal the truck keys,noting that to do so would be a violation of company policy.joyal became angry and expressed his anger to aye immediate supervisor,who gained the impression that joyal was planning to retaliate.in september,joyal demoted aye to a lower management position and withdrew certain job responsibilities from him,and during the following year aye received a bonus and wage increase.joyal then proposed that aye be supervised by another employee david dunican,whom aye particularly disliked,even though aye had previously been assured by the company that he would not be thus assigned.
in the summer of,aye told the division director of human resources that he was seeking legal advice and complained to wilson of the apparent retaliation.in august,wilson met with joyal and aye wilson promised aye that he would not have to report to dunican and aye withdrew a proposed letter of complaint to corporate headquarters.wilson also spoke privately to joyal and told him to fix his relationship with aye.additionally,wilson told joyal to stop his practice of bringing trash from home to the plant to be disposed of by hasbro employees.
in this period and in the fall,wilson also became concerned about joyal management style in dealing with other subordinates,particularly allegations of harsh language and abuse.an employee opinion survey around this time showed that joyal department ranked significantly lower than others in categories such as leadership,teamwork,and fairness of employee treatment wilson conversations with aye and another employee previously under joyal supervision reinforced these concerns 
in the late fall,aye was informed by his supervisor that joyal was still considering making him report to dunican.aye complained to wilson,who then contacted the rhode island headquarters.after discussions with other executives and an investigation by a company lawyer,verrecchia accepted wilson recommendation that joyal be terminated,and the termination occurred on december.
on this appeal,joyal picks at details,but the evidence for this history is solid.joyal says,for example,that he asked to use the truck but did not succeed,as if this matters.he says that he promoted aye,but this is a no more than an unpersuasive gloss on joyal acknowledged change of aye employment responsibilities.joyal claims that the subordinate who replaced him denied mistreatment at his hands,which is true,but the subordinate confirmed that other employees had complained to him of mistreatment by joyal.
this is a sample,but the other objections are mostly of the same or
