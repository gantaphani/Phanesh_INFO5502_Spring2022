this case returns to us following remands in and to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,robert sweet,judge,for further findings,clarification,and supplementation of the record in connection with its issuance of injunctions prohibiting defendant new york city housing authority nycha or the authority from implementing proposed changes in its method of complying with a consent decree the consent decree or decree settling actions alleging that,in accepting tenants for public housing in new york city,the authority had discriminated against latinos and african americans on the basis of race.the district court found that nycha proposed introduction of a preference into the tenant acceptance procedures would cause a significant perpetuation of past segregation at nycha housing projects,and in it permanently enjoined nycha from implementing that preference at those projects.nycha appeals,contending principally that the district court erred a in its view of what constitutes segregation,and b in finding that segregation would be significantly perpetuated.for the reasons that follow,we affirm with respect to of the housing projects,and we reverse with respect to the remaining six.
background 
the factual background of this litigation has been chronicled in several opinions,familiarity with which is assumed.the prior proceedings are summarized below.
a.the consent decree davis i 
nycha,an independent public corporation created by new york state law,operates public housing projects in new york city.in the early,parallel actions were brought by the united states and by plaintiffs pauline davis et on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,alleging that nycha had engaged in discrimination in violation of,inter alia,and and the fair housing act of,as amended,et.fha,by assigning applicants for public housing to particular housing projects on the basis of race.nycha ultimately acknowledged that it had engaged in,inter alia,racial steering nycha memorandum of law in support of the fairness and adequacy of the davis settlement and the entry of the consent decree and in response to comments submitted by interested persons,dated october,nycha memorandum supporting consent decree or nycha memorandum,at,and it stated that t he housing authority concluded that the complaint had merit id.at.
the parties agreed to settle both actions in by entering into the consent decree.see davis new york city housing authority,wl,davis i.in urging the district court to enter the decree,nycha admitted that 
t he housing authority engaged in a number of policies and practices that had the effect of discriminating against black and hispanic applicants.because the housing authority was convinced that these policies were wrong,and indeed in most instances were stopped well before the lawsuits were brought,the housing authority believed that the responsible course was to settle these suits to remedy these past practices in as fair a manner as possible.
nycha memorandum at.describing a few of these policies id,the nycha memorandum stated,inter alia,that the authority in adopted an integration program whose racial steering component continued at a few predominantly white projects until january,resulting in a higher proportion of whites than would have resulted from a race neutral admissions policy id,and that until,some nycha employees would expedite applications and send them to projects to which they would not otherwise have been sent,o ften favor ing white applicants who sought an apartment at a predominantly white project id.at.
following a fairness hearing,judge pierre leval,to whom the case was then assigned,approved the consent decree,making findings of fact and conclusions of law that included the following 
plaintiffs evidence supports their allegations that during specified periods of time the housing authority selected and assigned applicants for public housing,and tenants requesting transfers,to certain housing projects using methods that resulted in unlawful discrimination against blacks and hispanics.these methods included the intermittent use of codes denoting housing projects to which only white families could be assigned the use of zip code and other geographic restrictions on admission to projects the use of racial goals or targets when new projects were rented up and on an ongoing basis thereafter and the assignment of families to projects where vacancies were not expected to arise.
davis i,wl,at.the consent decree 
permanently enjoined nycha from engaging in any act or practice which denies equal access to its housing on the basis of race,color,or national origin,including adopting and implementing any tenant application,selection,assignment,and transfer plan,or any such policy or process,which gives preference to applicants or tenants on the basis of race,color,or national origin.
consent decree a.other provisions permanently enjoined nycha from,inter alia,basing denials of transfers on racial considerations,see id.b,making statements indicating a preference or limitation based on race,see id.c,and falsely representing,because of an applicant race,that certain projects were not anticipating vacancies when in fact such vacancies were anticipated,see id.d.although parts of the decree were to be dissolved years after its date of entry,the provision for such dissolution expressly excluded the permanent injunctive provisions.id.
as part of the injunctive relief granted,the consent decree also required nycha to implement a new tenant selection and assignment plan tsap that substantially revised the authority prior procedures for granting applications for public housing.after explicitly incorporating the tsap by reference,the decree stated that t he tsap will be implemented by the housing authority to prevent any unlawful discrimination on the basis of race,color,or national origin,in compliance with the housing authority obligations therewith under title vi,the fair housing act and the implementing regulations and requirements of the united states department of housing and urban development hud.consent decree.hud approved the tsap for a period as meeting the requirements of,inter alia,hud regulations governing on the basis of race,color,or national origin.consent decree page,whereas.
in the tsap,nycha recognizes federal preferences for certain categories of applicants,as required by certain federal laws,and employs certain of its own preferences local preferences.in the first stage of the tsap,applicants are chosen from the overall applicant pool for interviews as to their eligibility for public housing.in the second stage,those interviewed who are found eligible are assigned to waiting lists for vacancies and are divided into three tiers.tier iii families have the highest incomes tier i families have the lowest.in the final stage of the tsap,nycha attempts to allocate of the vacancies to tier iii and to divide the remaining evenly between tiers i and ii.under the original tsap local preferences,priority is given to families on the basis of housing need.
the decree also provided that 
n o applicant will be barred or disqualified from any project tenanted under the tsap because of any minimum income requirements that result in discrimination on the basis of race,color,or national origin in violation of title vi or the fair housing act provided,however,that consistent with hud general occupancy standards,the housing authority may seek to achieve a tenant body in each project composed of families with a broad range of incomes,generally representative of the range of incomes and abilities of lower income families in its geographic operating area to the extent permitted under c a iv,and part if any new minimum income requirements are added to existing conventional housing projects administered by nycha,plaintiffs shall have the right to challenge such a change during the period after full implementation of the tsap or thereafter 
consent decree.
nycha was required to have the tsap fully implemented within one year after entry of the decree.see id.a.if,during the period after full implementation of the tsap,nycha proposed to modify any provision of the tsap,it was to give at least days notice to plaintiffs,who were given the right to move the court to enjoin the proposed modification as inconsistent with the terms of th e consent decree.id.b.the decree also provided that for three years following that period,plaintiffs were allowed to ask the district court to modify or otherwise enjoin any aspect of any tsap implemented by the housing authority on the ground that it violates the fair housing act,title vi hud implementing regulations.id.c.
nycha proposed preference davis 
in,nycha sought to modify the local preferences recognized under the tsap.to the extent material here,it proposed to introduce a preference wfp,altering the factors determining whether an applicant for public housing is even granted an interview.under the wfp,federal preference holders who are working or disabled would receive a priority over those who are not as to local preferences,tier iii families and tier ii families would receive priority,in that order thereafter,tier i applicants who are working or are disabled would be given priority,but other tier i applicants would have no priority.see davis new york city housing authority,wl,at july,davis ii.the proposed wfp would eliminate applicant housing need as a local priority concern and instead give preference to families who can pay the most.nycha goals in proposing this change are to increase the number of working families in public housing and increase income integration in public housing,in order to promote financial and social stability in such housing.see id.at.
plaintiffs opposed nycha proposed changes and moved before judge sweet,to whom the case had been reassigned,for an injunction.while conceding that nycha interest in financial stability was legitimate,plaintiffs contended,supported by affidavits from their expert leonard cupingood,that the wfp would favor the admission of white families and thereby have the effect of perpetuating racial segregation.plaintiffs suggested that the wfp be modified so that,while continuing to give the lowest preference to tier i,families,nycha would give all tier i applicants equal preference.under plaintiffs proposed alternative,tier i families would continue to rank below tier ii and tier iii families and thus,because tier ii and iii families by definition have higher incomes than tier i families,the number of rentals to families would still increase but desegregation of the housing projects would be less adversely affected.nycha conceded that plaintiffs suggested alternative might increase income integration but rejected it,stating that it would frustrate the goal of increasing the proportion of rentals to working families.see davis ii,wl,at.
the district court noted the legitimacy of nycha concerns and goals and stated that there was no dispute that an increase in the proportion of tenants with higher incomes was needed in order to safeguard the projects stability 
historically,public housing applicants in the lowest income categories accounted for approximately of all nycha rentals.since,however,an increase in homeless families applying for housing has resulted in a significant increase in the number of rentals to the lowest income applicants.by,these lowest income applicants accounted for of new admissions.nycha states,and plaintiffs do not dispute,that unless a higher proportion of applicants with higher incomes receive rentals,the stability of the projects will be jeopardized.
id.at.the court also noted that nycha had submitted its proposed wfp,along with another proposed modification called project choice,to hud for approval.although hud approved project choice as not likely to affect the racial identifiability of developments in new york city,davis ii,wl,at quoting hud letter to nycha dated october,hud response to the proposed wfp,in contrast,was as follows 
hud does not approve local preferences,and thus nycha may create these local preferences,so long as notice and comment requirements are met.however,nycha should be mindful of the injunctive relief provided for by the davis consent decree and its responsibilities under civil rights statutes.
davis ii,wl,at quoting hud letter to nycha dated july,emphasis ours.
the district court proceeded to consider the likely effects of the wfp on nycha performance of its obligations under the decree.noting that in,under the tsap scheme of priorities,only some of all applicants for public housing even reached the stage of being granted interviews,see davis ii,wl,at,the court found that implementation of the wfp would significantly change 
the racial composition of the top of applicants,who are those likely to be called for interviews.under the current tsap,only of the top of applicants are white.if the new working family preference were implemented,there would be a statistically significant increase in the percentage of white families in the top of the list of applicants.these conclusions are not disputed by nycha.
id.at.the court noted further that cupingood had concluded that if the wfp were implemented at the projects that as of june remained more than white,the process of desegregation would be significantly slowed at three of the projects,completely stopped at four projects,and indeed reversed at four projects.see id.
the court noted,however,that the wfp desegregative effects could easily be lessened 
it also appears that nycha could eliminate the objectionable perpetuation of discrimination by making revisions to their plan that are even less drastic than those proposed by plaintiffs.the working family preference could be instituted in essentially the proposed form,provided white applicants selected under the preference are not placed in projects in which whites are relative to the applicant pool.the extent to which such a modification would be administratively feasible or desirable is,of course,a question for nycha.
id.at emphases added.
accepting the projections made by cupingood,the district court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their wfp challenge with respect to the housing projects whose tenant populations remained predominantly white.the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of the wfp at all nycha projects,but it invited nycha to offer suggestions for modifications that would limit the injunction to the disproportionately white projects.see id.at.
thereafter,the parties agree d that the wfp considered in davis ii w ould not perpetuate past discrimination at any of the nycha projects other than the projects where greater than of the apartments are rented to whites the disproportionate projects,davis new york city housing authority,wl,at,as amended,davis iii,and agree d that the wfp should go forward for the projects,id.at.accordingly,in davis iii,the court narrowed its prior order and enjoined use of the wfp at only those housing projects where white families then occupied more than of the apartments.
nycha appealed.this court was unable to resolve the merits of the appeal,however,as we concluded that the district court had not provided an adequate explanation for finding that plaintiffs would likely succeed in showing that the wfp would perpetuate segregation at the projects to which the injunction applied.see davis new york city housing authority,cir davis iv.we stated that although the opinions in davis ii and davis iii were 
not entirely devoid of detail,judge sweet failed to adequately explain the subsidiary facts and methodology underlying the ultimate finding.for instance,judge sweet refers to existing trends demonstrat ing that many of the additional white families admitted under the proposed modification will be concentrated in predominantly white developments,but does not discuss or attempt to explain these trends or the data reflecting them.he also fails to address the time period during which the purported impact of the proposed tsap was assessed how future trends might affect application of the tsap to developments that are not currently,but subsequently become,predominantly white.further,while he focuses on the racial imbalance the proposed tsap will cause at specific developments within the nycha system,he does not identify them by name or state the number,fraction or percentage of additional white families who will be admitted to each of the developments as a result of the proposed tsap.
davis iv,at footnotes omitted.we also noted that cupingood d id not cite to any precise numerical data underlying his opinion.id.at.
accordingly,while leaving the preliminary injunction undisturbed,we remanded for the district court to address these matters,stating that t he proper standard to be applied on remand is whether the proposed use of the working family preference will significantly perpetuate segregation at the relevant nycha developments.id.at emphasis in original.
c.the wfp as significantly perpetuating segregation davis v 
following the remand in davis iv,the district court conducted a hearing,received additional evidence and arguments,and addressed,both broadly and in considerable detail,whether there is a basis on which to conclude that there is segregation to be dealt with under the consent decree,and whether the wfp would significantly perpetuate segregation.in an opinion dated august,the court rendered a final decision,answering both questions in the affirmative and concluding that plaintiffs were entitled to a permanent injunction prohibiting nycha from implementing the wfp at housing projects.see davis new york city housing authority,d davis v.
first,as to the existence of segregation,the court ruled that,for purposes of this litigation,it is appropriate to deem a project segregated if white families occupy more than of its apartments.it pointed out that 
throughout this litigation projects have been deemed disproportionate or predominantly white if more than percent of the parties residing there are white.see,davis ii,wl at.
davis v,d at footnote omitted.the court noted that this benchmark was reflected in the tsap,which was incorporated by reference into the consent decree.see,id.at t he tsap identifies housing projects that are percent white as infected by past segregation.the tsap contains a borrowing provision that can be used by a housing project that has more vacancies than willing applicants.such a project is allowed to borrow applications from another project,id.at but if the borrowing project tenant body is more than white,the nycha decisionmaker shall not select a project whose tenant body is also more than white,id.at quoting tsap at.the court pointed out that the benchmark was 
not,as nycha urges,an arbitrary number,but a negotiated figure that implies that the parties and the court believed that a project was disproportionately white if more than percent of its families are white an examination of exhibit a to the consent decree,a list of projects where it was alleged that discriminatory practices occurred in statistically significant amounts,reveals that during the time in question most of these projects were at least percent white.
davis v,d at.further,the court noted that the injunctive relief ordered was necessarily premised on a finding that a white tenant population above the level constituted segregation 
the tsap must be read as in harmony with existing law under existing law,borrowing of applications could not have been prohibited at projects more than percent white without regard for claimant relief unless those projects were still tainted by past segregation r emedies containing relief must be substantially related to the objective of eliminating the alleged instance of discrimination,and must not unnecessarily trammel the interests of affected third parties.kirkland new york state of correctional,cir.thus,had there been no finding that housing projects that are greater than percent white were affected by past segregation,the borrowing provision would be unlawful.
davis v,d at.accordingly,having previously held that u nder the tsap,a project is considered disproportionately white if more than percent of its families are white,the court concluded that percent will continue to be employed as a measure to identify segregation in this case.davis v,d at quoting davis ii,wl at.
second,as to the impacts of the wfp on the desegregation of the disproportionately white projects,the district court,largely crediting the analysis of cupingood,made extensive findings.the court noted that,in predicting the effects of the wfp on the racial mix of those likely to move into public housing projects,cupingood relied on data for the period because is the first year that is free of distortion caused by nycha own discrimination,and is the last year that is free of distortion caused by the initial implementation of the consent decree remedies,to wit,the davis.davis v,d at.cupingood relied on nycha records of and by race for each project,and he proceeded on the assumption that families of each race will make decisions about which projects to choose in the same manner,and with the same probabilities,as families of that race have done in the past.the court concluded that w hile projections about the future,are by definition,subject to some uncertainty,cupingood has taken reasonable steps,such as the use of historical averages,to minimize the impact of possible uncertainties.id.at.
the court credited cupingood view that the wfp would have significant impacts on the disproportionately white projects,either by increasing the percentage of a project white population or by detrimentally affecting the degree or timing of the project desegregation.the davis v opinion included tables showing,for each disproportionately white project,inter alia,race distribution of rentals under original tsap and wfp table effect of wfp at disproportionate projects after five years assuming historical t urnover by race table relative percentage reduction in number of white families d ue to wfp after five y ears assuming historical turnover by race table change in percentage white occupancy at disproportionate projects after five years assuming historical turnover by race table effect of wfp at disproportionate projects after five years assuming historical turnover by race table,and same after ten years table.see davis v,d at.
in discussing the anticipated percentages of apartments that would be occupied by white families at each disproportionate project after five years,with and without the wfp,the court noted that,
a ssuming historical turnover by race,after five years under the wfp,the percentage of white families at middletown plaza would rise from to instead of falling to.at the remaining disproportionate projects,white occupancy percentages would either stabilize or fall more slowly under the wfp than under the original tsap.for example,at cassidy lafayette,after five years the percentage of white families in occupancy would inch down from to instead of falling to.
id.at.these figures were reflected in table 
davis v,d at see also id.at,table at independence,of apartments were initially occupied by white families,a percentage of at straus,under the original tsap five years after the davis,white families would occupy of apartments,a percentage of id.at,table as of june,before davis,holmes towers and straus were above the level,at and,respectively.the court noted that table showed that 
s imilar trends exist after ten years,except that at disproportionate projects where desegregation would not essentially stop,the magnitude of the impact of the wfp would generally become larger.for example,at middletown plaza,where segregation would increase under the wfp,the white population would climb to instead of falling to.at berry houses,where desegregation would be significantly slowed,the white population would fall to instead of.in the aggregate,after ten years under the wfp again assuming historical turnover by race,the disproportionate projects would be occupied by more white families than would have resided in those projects in the absence of the wfp.
davis v,d at.
nycha,proffering the views of its own expert david peterson,argued that cupingood analysis was flawed because it was based on the assumption that,in the absence of the consent decree injunction,the percentage of white families admitted to nycha public housing in would have risen from to.the authority contended that the percentage admitted would have risen only to.however,the district court found that there were substantial flaws in peterson methodology 
i n addition to a number of other errors,peterson did not account for the fact that several thousand families who moved into nycha housing during were selected for interviews certified to project waiting lists before the wfp went into operation.because families selected under the old tsap are still working their way through the pipeline,the white admission rate in was significantly lower than would have occurred if all families had been selected for interviews and certified pursuant to the wfp.moreover,peterson conclusion is based on an of.significantly,even accepting peterson methodology,and adjusting only for the undercount of families to the projects,one obtains a corrected figure of percent white among families who were placed in and were allegedly untainted by the pipeline effect cupingood sixth aff.
davis v,d at.accordingly,the court rejected peterson analysis and credited that of cupingood.
the court also rejected nycha contention that so long as the white occupancy rates would decline under the wfp,regardless of the rate of decline,then the wfp can not be said to perpetuate segregation.id.at.the court noted that to perpetuate means to extend in time,id.other internal quotation marks omitted,and that that is precisely the effect that the wfp will have.although at the outset of housing discrimination litigation the adverse impact of an applicant selection process is determined by whether minority applicants are chosen at a rate lower than their proportional representation in the overall applicant pool,once remedies for segregation have been ordered and the defendant proposes to change its method of compliance t he query is not whether the change would have an adverse impact on minority applicants,but whether it will significantly perpetuate segregation.davis v,d at emphasis omitted.
where a plan intended to eradicate past segregation is in effect,and where,as here,a proposed change to the plan is alleged to perpetuate past segregation,the supreme court has compared the results under the proposed plan with those under the original,plan.
accordingly,in evaluating whether the wfp significantly perpetuates segregation,the relevant comparison will be the desegregation that would be achieved under the original tsap with the projected effect of the wfp.
the relevant inquiry here is not whether desegregation will occur eventually,but whether the wfp will significantly delay desegregation at the disproportionate projects.see monroe board of commissioners,d if it can not be shown that such a plan will further rather than delay conversion to a unitary,nonracial,nondiscriminatory school system,it must be held unacceptable.wright council of the city of emporia,d if the proposal would impede the dismantling of the dual system,then the district court may enjoin it from being carried out.
davis v,d at emphasis in original.
the district court concluded that the wfp would significantly impede desegregation at nycha disproportionately white projects,see davis v,d at of the projects covered by the preliminary injunction pursuant to davis iii,glenwood was omitted because prior to june it had fallen below the threshold.the court reached this conclusion because the wfp will more than double white admission rates,and because existing trends demonstrate that many of these additional white families will be concentrated in predominantly white developments.davis v,d at internal quotation marks omitted.it found these effects to have both s tatistical significance,which measures whether a particular phenomenon is the cause of a specific set of effects,and l egal significance,which measures whether,assuming the phenomenon was the cause of those effects,those effects have any legal import.id.at.as to statistical significance,the court stated as follows 
a standard tool for assessing statistical significance is the deviation test.the test is used to determine whether a deviation from the expected norm is small enough to be attributable to chance,or so large that random chance could not reasonably account for the outcome.the greater the number of standard deviations,the less likely it is that chance is the cause of any difference between the expected and observed results.ottaviani state at new paltz,cir,cert.denied,d.courts have frequently adopted a standard of two to three standard deviations as constituting statistical significance.see hazelwood school district united states,d if the difference between the expected value and observed number is greater than two or three standard deviations,then the hypothesis that employees were hired without regard to race would be suspect.castaneda partida,d.
davis v,d at footnote omitted.the court noted that,in terms of the total number of apartments affected by the wfp in the disproportionately white projects,the magnitude of the effects would be well in excess of two standard deviations 
for the five,and assuming historical turnover trends for each race,the wfp would result in a total of approximately white at the disproportionate projects,as compared to only without the wfp.the difference between these excess white standard deviation units and is highly significant.
id.at footnote omitted.and over a period of ten years,assuming historical turnover rates for each race,the wfp would increase white from to approximately increase of white.the difference represents standard deviation units.id.at.the court found that the magnitude would also be statistically significant when assessed in terms of individual projects 
a fter five years,of the disproportionate projects would have statistically significant white differential caused by the wfp.at the ten year mark,again using historical turnover rates for each race,of the disproportionate projects would have statistically significant reductions in desegregation.at holmes towers,for example,the wfp would result in approximately white as opposed to without the wfp,a disparity representing standard deviation units.at pomonok,there would be approximately white with the wfp and without the wfp in place,a difference constituting standard deviation units.
finally,as to the legal significance of the wfp retardation of desegregation,the court noted that 
w hile many of the cases cited by the parties involve larger discrepancies than in the instant case,small differences can result in significant perpetuation of segregation.at the pomonok project,for example,where the wfp would increase the white occupancy rate by percentage points after five years,and percentage points after ten years,see cupingood third aff.cupingood tables and,every percentage point increase in the white population means relinquishing apartments to white families that would have gone to african american and hispanic families.at pomonok alone,the wfp would deprive families of apartments after five years see id.cupingood table and apartments after ten years see id.cupingood table.
these figures are significant in sheer magnitude perhaps more importantly,they are significant to the families affected.to be sure,the wfp has numerous benefits,but with respect to the disproportionate projects,these are outweighed by its adverse effects.the wfp markedly inhibits the rate at which desegregation will occur,adversely affects the ratios at the disproportionate projects,and contravenes the purposes of the consent decree.in short,the wfp significantly perpetuates segregation.
davis v,d at footnotes omitted.
accordingly,having determined that the effects of the wfp in slowing the pace of desegregation at the disproportionately white projects would be significant,the court enjoined nycha from implementing the wfp at the relevant developments,making its preliminary injunction permanent.
comparisons of the tsap with and without the wfp davis 
nycha again appealed.this court again remanded without resolving the merits,asking for additional information.see davis new york city housing authority,wl cir,davis vi.given that the wfp had been implemented in at some projects,all but the projects covered by the injunction,we stated that we would benefit from knowing whether and to what extent actual tenant correspond with projected,and whether and to what extent the actual numbers would alter the experts conclusions at each of the covered projects,how many months it is expected to take to achieve a white family occupancy rate below with and without the wfp and whether figures presented in the davis v tables based on cupingood estimate of a white admissions rate under the wfp should be revised to reflect a rate of,as it appeared cupingood might have suggested in one affidavit,or a rate of as nycha suggested.
in june,the district court responded to the questions posed by davis vi.as to our first question,the court found that the expert witnesses for both sides opined that the use of actual rates for would not necessarily increase the accuracy of the white admissions rate projections.see davis new york city housing authority,d,davis vii.as to our last question,the court found that the reference in cupingood prior affidavit to a rate of was the result of a copying error and that the intended reference was to a rate of.id.at.however,the court found that cupingood rationale for using the rate of for white rather than a rate of was more persuasive than that proffered by peterson for the lower rate.id.at.the court also found that use of the rate would not show any significant decrease in the wfp effects of delaying desegregation in the projects.id.thus,adoption of the rate,and revision of the calculations,would not change this court prior conclusion that implementation of the wfp at the disproportionate projects would result in a significant perpetuation of discrimination.id.
as to our second question,requesting a comparison of the estimated times for desegregation under the tsap with and without the wfp,the court set forth the following table 
following these findings,the appeal by nycha was reinstated.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,nycha contends principally that neither the consent decree nor the tsap defined housing projects with more than white tenant populations as segregated,and that the district court therefore erred in using that standard in finding the projects in question to be segregated that the district court erred in its findings as to the wfp desegregation delays because the court a accepted the view of cupingood rather than that of peterson,b failed to do a analysis,and c analyzed the wrong comparables and that the court erred in concluding that the differences in white tenancy percentages with and without the wfp are legally significant.for the reasons that follow,we reject most of nycha contentions,finding merit only in its challenge to the ruling as to the legal significance of the wfp effects at six projects.
standard of review 
the standard of review is well established.in reviewing the district court judgment and its issuance of a permanent injunction,we may overturn the court findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous.see.a.
although the meaning of the phrase clearly erroneous is not immediately apparent,certain general principles governing the exercise of the appellate court power to overturn findings of a district court may be derived from supreme court cases.the foremost of these principles is that a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.this standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently.the reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under rule a if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.in applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury,appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues de novo.zenith radio hazeltine research,d.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.united states yellow cab.see also inwood laboratories,ives laboratories,d.
anderson bessemer city,d see also id.at.the question is not whether a contrary finding by the court of appeals would be clearly erroneous,but only whether the finding made by the district court was clearly erroneous.these standards apply whether the district court findings are based on oral testimony or solely on documentary evidence.see,id.at.a.
determinations as to the existence and cause of racial discrimination are findings of fact,and hence are subject to the standard of review.see,anderson bessemer city,d swint,d united states yonkers board of education,cir,cert.denied,d.we apply no different standard for the district court findings as to the likely future discriminatory effects of actual or proposed conduct.even as to past events,a trial judge 
can not always be confident that he knows what happened.often,he can only determine whether the plaintiff has succeeded in presenting an account of the facts that is more likely to be true than not.
anderson bessemer city,at.our task as an appellate tribunal is more limited still we must determine whether the trial judge conclusions are clearly erroneous.id.at.we similarly review only for clear error the district court findings as to whether particular conduct will more likely than not perpetuate discrimination.
the district court conclusions as to questions of law,or as to mixed questions of fact and law,are reviewed de novo.see,johnsbury academy,cir united states city of yonkers,cir,cert.denied,d.a determination of the legal significance of the effects that the court has found likely to occur is a conclusion of law.the interpretation of a consent decree is also an issue of law that is freely reviewable by the court of appeals.see,united states,cir united states international brotherhood of teamsters,cir berger heckler,cir see also id.at consent decrees are a hybrid in the sense that they are construed largely as contracts,but are enforced as orders.
the propriety of relief in the form of a permanent injunction is reviewable for abuse of discretion.see,knox salinas,cir per curiam general media communications,cohen,cir,cert.denied,d schulz williams,cir.and though a court can not randomly expand or contract the terms agreed upon in a consent decree,judicial discretion in flexing its supervisory and enforcement muscles is broad.eeoc local,international association of bridge,structural ornamental ironworkers,cir see also berger heckler,at court interest in protecting the integrity of a judicially approved consent decree justifies any reasonable action taken by the court to secure compliance internal quotes omitted.
b.the level as the measure of segregation 
for several reasons,we reject nycha contention that the district court erred in using the white family population level as the standard for whether a nycha public housing project should be deemed segregated.
first,the district court drew the figure directly from the consent decree and the litigation surrounding it.as set out in part above,the tsap borrowing provision allows an undersubscribed public housing project to borrow applications from another project but it explicitly forbids an undersubscribed project whose tenant population is more than white from borrowing applications from another project whose tenant population is also more than white.thus,the consent decree,which expressly incorporated the tsap by reference,treated as the significant level.
second,the decree identified projects as affected developments,see consent decree b exhibit a,and required nycha to give priority placement at those projects to some families who had been adversely affected by discrimination since,davis i,wl,at.when davis i was entered,of those projects,or more than,had white family populations in excess of with three of the remaining seven having white tenant populations of.see nycha tenant statistics by race as of.and those projects constituted of the nycha projects whose white tenant populations exceeded.id.thus,it was reasonable for the district court to use the figure as a reflection of which projects the parties had agreed were infected by past segregation.
third,although nycha contends that none of its projects should be considered segregated under the consent decree once nycha has provided the relief that the decree ordered for individual applicants,that contention is belied by the decree itself.the decree a allowed plaintiffs,within the first five years of the tsap operation,to seek an injunction against any proposal to modify the tsap on the ground that the modification would be inconsistent with the decree or with the fha,and b allowed plaintiffs,within the three years following that period,to request modification of the decree on the ground that nycha implementation of the tsap was violating the fha.accordingly,the existence of segregation in new york city public housing may properly be measured by fha standards,not solely by whether nycha has provided the individualized relief ordered for specific victims of prior discriminatory practices.
fourth,when davis v was decided,nycha data showed that,overall,white families in nycha housing projects constituted just of the tenant population.research and policy development special tabulation of tenant characteristics as of,nycha tenant characteristics tabulation,at.thus,in using the level as the pertinent measure of segregation,the court generally considered a project to be segregated only if its white population was at least percentage points higher than the average white tenant population,or more than four times the average.
the court treatment of such wide discrepancies as indicative of segregation was entirely consistent with existing law.in united states yonkers board of education,for example,we upheld findings that housing in the city of yonkers was segregated in where minorities constituted of the residents of one quadrant of the city,but only of the city total population.see at,see also id.at in five of the real estate tracts within that quadrant,minorities constituted more than of the residents.we concluded that there was no error in the district court findings that the city decision to concentrate housing,occupied principally by minorities,in that quadrant had a discriminatory effect.see id.at.brown board of education,cir comparing minority enrollment in particular schools against figures and finding vestiges of segregation where the difference in minority representation between the actual population and the student population exceeded percentage points,vacated,d,reinstated in full,cir,and cert.denied,d penick columbus board of education,cir same,aff,d.
nycha attempts to distinguish such authorities by pointing out that the present litigation was resolved without a trial on the merits and that the consent decree recited that nycha did not concede liability.this approach is unpersuasive.to establish a violation of the fha,a plaintiff need not show discriminatory intent but need only prove that the challenged practice has a discriminatory effect.see huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir,aff,d per curiam united states yonkers board of education,at.the fha prohibits such practices and authorizes courts to order affirmative action to erase the effects of past segregation and desegregate housing patterns.otero new york city housing authority,cir.here,nycha own records plainly show segregative housing patterns.in,nycha operated more than public housing projects.some of the white families of lived in the projects that were defined in the consent decree as affected developments.see nycha tenant statistics by race as of.in addition,there are four projects haber,independence,and williams that were not defined as affected developments but are covered by the present injunction,whose respective white tenant populations at the end of ranged from to see nycha tenant statistics by race as of,and in ranged from to,see davis v,d at,table id.at,table.as of december,those four projects housed an additional white families.see nycha tenant statistics by race as of.thus,when davis i was decided,nycha had placed more than of the white population in of its projects.
in approving the consent decree,the district court found that plaintiffs evidence supported their allegations that nycha had selected,assigned,and transferred applicants for public housing to particular projects using methods that resulted in unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.davis i,wl,at.nycha did not appeal those findings.nor could it legitimately have done so.in urging the district court to approve the consent decree,nycha stated that it had engaged in a number of practices,some dating back to,and some lasting until,that had the effect of discriminating against black and hispanic applicants.memorandum supporting consent decree at.nycha stated that those policies included racial steering and favoring white applicants for predominantly white housing projects id.at,that these policies were wrong id.at,and that t he housing authority concluded that the complaint had merit id.at.see part above.having made those statements to the court in order to secure judicial approval of the decree,nycha can not now disavow them.
in sum,only of the families in nycha housing projects are white the tsap,incorporated into the consent decree,treated white family occupancy as a threshold signifying segregation when the decree was entered,more than of the white population lived in fewer than of the nycha projects and nearly all of the projects whose tenant populations were more than white were targeted by the decree for placement of individual applicants who had been the victims of past discrimination.we see no clear error in the district court finding that in negotiating and approving the consent decree,the parties and the court,respectively,had regarded projects more than of whose apartments were rented to white families as segregated,nor any error in the court use of the level as a reasonable standard.
c.the district court findings of fact as to the wfp effects 
nor do we see clear error in the district court findings as to the likely percentages of white tenant populations in the covered projects with and without the wfp.nycha attacks those findings principally by arguing that the court should have adopted the views presented by peterson rather than those of cupingood that the court failed to conduct a analysis and that it erred in comparing the projected effects under the wfp to the projected effects under the original tsap rather than to the racial composition of the projects.we disagree.
as discussed in part.above,decisions as to which witness to credit and which of two permissible inferences to draw lie strictly within the province of the district court as factfinder.as discussed in parts and above,the district court found that cupingood had extrapolated data from a reasonable that was free of distortion either by nycha discriminatory practices or by the implementation of decretal remedies for those that his assumptions,us ing historical averages,to minimize the impact of possible uncertainties,davis v,d at,were reasonable.further,in response to the remand in davis vi,both sides experts agreed that use of actual turnover data for the available period would not change their views as to the likely effects of the wfp in the future.although predictive analysis is generally more speculative than statistical analysis of existing the district court recognized,see,davis v,d at projections about the future,are by definition,subject to some uncertainty the need for predictions in this case,in order to determine the wfp likely effects,was inescapable.
the district court found that peterson analysis was flawed in several respects.it is immaterial to appellate review whether the views proffered by peterson were nonetheless permissible.the views proffered by cupingood were permissible,and we thus see no basis on which to conclude that the court acceptance of his analysis,rather than that of peterson,is clearly erroneous.
nycha also contends that cupingood analysis is flawed because it would automatically produce statistical significance over time.we disagree because the present inquiry falls outside the realm in which ordinary statistical analysis,and the need for inquiry into significance from a purely statistical standpoint,are needed.ordinarily,such an inquiry is used when observable data are compared against expected data,or when two sets of observations are compared,and the question is whether the differences between the two data sets are attributable to a factor other than chance.in the present case,there is no question as to what causes the differences between the projections of the pace of desegregation with and without the wfp the differences are caused simply by the contrasting hypotheses.
nor is there any merit in nycha contention that the district court failed to analyze the likely effects of the wfp on a basis.most of the district court analyses were conducted at both the project level and the aggregate level.see,davis v,d at statistical significance can also be analyzed at the project level.although the court did not discuss every project in detail,its inclusion of the numerous tables in davis v and davis vii,showing the levels of concentration at each project for various time periods,provides adequate assurance that each project was considered individually.thus,while we disagree with some of the court conclusions as to the legal significance of the wfp differential at certain of the projects,see part.below,we see no indication that the court failed to give each project individual attention.
finally,the court did not err in comparing the anticipated desegregation effects under the wfp against the anticipated effects under the original tsap rather than against the racial composition of the projects without the tsap.the remedies implemented under the tsap were designed to alleviate past racial discrimination.it was both consistent with supreme court cases,as the district court discussed in davis v,d at,and eminently reasonable for the court to compare the effects of nycha proposed changes against the anticipated status of the projects under the original tsap.
d.the legal significance of the wfp effects 
the matter of whether the differences in the pace of desegregation under the original tsap and the tsap as it would be modified by the wfp are legally significant is a question of law that we review de novo.the caselaw give us little guidance as to what constitutes legal significance.the district court focused primarily on the issue of desegregation and the differences between the existing and the proposed procedures in achieving desegregation.in so doing,the court adopted the reasonable premise that past segregation may be perpetuated by actions that slow the pace of desegregation,even though they do not reverse it,see,arthur nyquist,cir affirming suspension of hiring and layoff rules that delayed desegregation of public school faculty,cert.denied,d sarabia toledo police patrolman ass n,cir affirming suspension of civil service rule that restrained growth in african american representation on the police force.were the court not to consider the effects of proposed conduct on the pace of desegregation,desegregation could be delayed to such an extent that it effectively would never be achieved.and were there no worthy countervailing considerations,the court correct findings that proposed modifications would substantially delay desegregation would likely end our inquiry.
in the present case,however,nycha has proposed the wfp in pursuit of a valid countervailing interest that is,to some extent,in tension with the goal of expeditious desegregation and that is worthy of consideration.as discussed in part above,nycha goal in proposing a preference for working families is to increase the number of such families,increase income integration in public housing,and thereby promote financial and social stability in such housing.there can be no doubt that this is a legitimate objective.in providing federal funding for housing,congress has prohibited recipient public housing agencies from concentrat ing very families or other families with relatively low incomes in public housing dwelling units in certain public housing projects or certain buildings within projects,a a supp.v,and has required such agencies to adopt plans for deconcentration 
a public housing agency shall submit with its annual public housing agency plan an admissions policy designed to provide for deconcentration of poverty and by bringing higher income tenants into lower income projects and lower income tenants into higher income projects.this clause may not be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any project or projects,
a b i supp.v.see also c a iv which,at the time the wfp was proposed,provided that public housing authorities to the maximum extent feasible,will include families with a broad range of incomes and will avoid concentrations of and deprived families with serious social problems,repealed,balanced budget downpayment act,i,d,stat.as amended in,provides that a public housing agency may establish and utilize criteria for the selection of residents for dwelling units in public housing projects,subject to the requirements of this section,a supp.v.
consistent with these statutory provisions,hud regulations explicitly permit a preference for working families.see a b.in issuing a,hud commented that t he department is convinced that housing agencies must have the flexibility to give preference to working families to assure diversity in the residency of projects and to include families who can serve as role models for other families.july.
notwithstanding that conviction,hud did not endorse nycha proposed wfp.nor,however,despite having responsibility under of title vi of the civil rights act of to review plans for federally funded public housing to ensure compliance with federal civil rights law,see,did hud criticize the wfp.rather,when nycha sought hud approval for the wfp and project choice,hud response with respect to the its reaction to project choice,which hud found not likely to affect the racial identifiability of developments in new york city for the remaining period of the davis tsap,davis ii,wl,at quoting hud letter to nycha dated october,was to remind nycha that it must give notice of the proposed wfp and that it must be mindful of the injunctive relief provided for by the davis consent decree and its responsibilities under civil rights statutes.davis ii,wl,at quoting hud letter to nycha dated july.
we too are mindful of nycha responsibilities under the decree and the civil rights laws,and we conclude that the assessment of whether the effects of the wfp are legally significant involves a balancing of the interest in eradicating the past effects of segregation against the interest in achieving financial stability in public housing.the latter is reflected in the public housing statutes discussed above.the district court acknowledged that interest,see davis ii,wl,at,as well as the existence of cause for concern on the part of nycha,see id.at noting that the percentage of applications from families who are homeless or in the lowest income category had risen from approximately to.and plaintiffs did not dispute,that unless a higher proportion of applicants with higher incomes receive rentals,the stability of the nycha projects will be jeopardized.id.
at the same time,we think it plain that congress did not mean to cause public housing agencies to implement plans for financial deconcentration in a way that would violate the civil rights laws.and we take into account the fact that,in the present case,the concentration of most of the white families in a small percentage of the projects was the consequence of nycha policies and practices acknowledged by nycha in urging judicial approval of the consent racial steering,withholding of information that could h
