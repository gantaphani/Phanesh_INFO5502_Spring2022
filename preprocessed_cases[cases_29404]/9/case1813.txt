opinion of the court 
mentholated tobacco products apparently pose greater health risks than ones.plaintiffs,a group of,brought a civil rights action,contending that,with this knowledge,defendant tobacco companies have targeted the marketing of mentholated tobacco products at.
plaintiffs,who designate themselves the black smokers,are the jesse brown,the uptown coalition for tobacco control and healing,aaron eleazer,pansy smith,ellen irving,and the national association of african americans for positive imagery.they brought this civil rights action on behalf of a class of all living black americans who have,since,purchased or consumed mentholated tobacco products.they named as defendants the tobacco companies philip morris,reynolds tobacco company,rjr nabisco holdings corporation,brown williamson tobacco corporation,industries,the american tobacco company,lorillard tobacco company,liggett myers tobacco company,liggett group and united states tobacco company the organizations supported by the the tobacco institute,the council for tobacco,and smokeless tobacco council,and the public relations firm hill knowlton.black smokers contend that each of the defendants has unlawfully engaged in targeted marketing and sales of mentholated tobacco products to on the basis of their race in violation of the civil rights statutes codified at,and.black smokers also assert a cause of action against defendants under bivens six unknown federal narcotics agents,d,and the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,arguing that defendants should be considered federal actors by virtue of the federal regulatory scheme to which the tobacco industry is subject.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.we will affirm that decision.we agree with the district court that black smokers allegations of racially targeted marketing of mentholated tobacco products can not,in the absence of any disparity between the products sold to and the products sold to others,constitute a deprivation of contract or property rights actionable under or.we also concur with the district court that there is no allegation that defendants are state actors to support the claim and that defendants can not be regarded as federal actors as is required to maintain the claims under bivens and the fifth amendment.although we agree with the district court that black smokers failed to state a claim under,we need not reach the further question whether and claims can,as a matter of law,support a claim under.as the district court noted,even assuming arguendo that black smokers could properly premise a cause of action on a violation of and,they have failed to state a claim under and.
in their second amended complaint,black smokers allege that the defendants have unlawfully targeted with billboard,magazine,and other types of advertising in order to promote the sale to and consumption by of various mentholated tobacco products.it is not disputed that the tobacco industry has designed certain menthol cigarettes specifically to appeal to consumers,including reynolds uptown,a high tar,high nicotine menthol cigarette black smokers contend,and defendants do not dispute,that medical research has demonstrated that mentholated tobacco products pose greater health risks than ones,including an increased incidence of cancers of the lung and pharynx.it is not disputed that,although account for only of the population,they account for a significantly greater share of menthol cigarette smokers.black smokers cite reports fixing the percentage of menthol smokers at,variously,and.apparently relying upon the figure,defendants claim that a significant majority of menthol cigarette smokers are not and that black smokers admit that fact.in addition to the allegation of racially targeted marketing,black smokers also charge defendants with intentional racial discrimination and a conspiracy of deception and misrepresentation against the african american public.
black smokers also accuse defendants of a massive conspiracy to mislead the black american public regarding the safety of menthol tobacco products.black smokers identify three courses of conduct underlying the purported conspiracy acting in concert to represent falsely that their menthol tobacco products are safe for african americans to use engaging in a concerted campaign to saturate the african american community with dangerous,defective and hazardous tobacco products,which tobacco industry knew caused harm,in violation of the civil and constitutional rights of african americans and misrepresenting,suppressing,distorting,and confusing the truth about the health dangers of mentholated tobacco products.notwithstanding these allegations,black smokers apparently concede in their opening appellate brief that demonstrated their preference for menthol cigarettes before defendants initiated targeted advertising.in their reply brief and at oral argument,however,black smokers denied making such a concession and asserted that defendants created the preference for menthol cigarettes.black smokers did not allege in their opening appellate brief that defendants interfere with the right of african americans to purchase cigarettes or that menthol cigarettes are not marketed and sold to persons other than.however,in their reply brief and at oral argument,black smokers made the surprising statement that they do not concede that black americans are free to purchase cigarettes.
black smokers do not contend that the menthol cigarettes marketed and sold to are themselves different from those sold to whites or other persons.additionally,black smokers do not aver that receive information about menthol cigarettes that differs in any respect from the information provided to others.however,in their reply brief and at oral argument,black smokers made another surprising while defendants suggest to in advertising that menthol cigarettes are healthier than cigarettes,are of high quality,enhance the smoker image,and are glamorous,prestigious and socially acceptable,none of these sales messages or terms are targeted to white consumers.black smokers agree,however,that defendants have employed targeted marketing,advertising using models and athletes to sell cigarettes such as camel,lucky strike,kent and eve.in addition,no party to the instant litigation alleges that defendants provide any consumers with warnings concerning the additional health risks posed by menthol cigarettes in comparison to tobacco products.
black smokers filed this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on october.a month later,black smokers filed a first amended class action complaint correcting the caption.by leave of the court,black smokers filed a second amended complaint on december,in order to add claims purportedly arising under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and.on january,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.the district court granted the motion to dismiss on september.jesse brown et philip morris,et,no.civ,wl.black smokers filed a timely notice of appeal on october.

iii.discussion 
regulating tobacco products 
a brief summary of the federal regulation of the tobacco industry is a necessary prerequisite to a discussion of black smokers civil rights claims.manufacturers of cigarettes are subject to the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act of and its successor,the public health cigarette smoking act of,et together,the labeling act.the labeling act provides a comprehensive program of federal requirements addressing the labeling and advertising of cigarettes and preempts certain state law damages actions relating to smoking and health which challenge the adequacy of warnings on cigarette packages or the propriety of a manufacturer advertising or promotion of cigarettes.see cipollone liggett group,d.in cipollone,the supreme court was called upon to determine the contours of the federal preemption of state law actions under the labeling act.the court held that i the act does not preempt state law damages actions in general ii the act does preempt claims based on a failure to warn and on the neutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent that such claims rely on omissions or inclusions in a manufacturer advertising or promotions and iii the act does not preempt claims based on express warranty,intentional fraud and misrepresentation,or conspiracy.see cipollone liggett,at.
civil rights claims sections and 
section,which prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts and property transactions,provides 
all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts,to sue,be parties,give evidence,and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,and shall be subject to like punishment,pains,penalties,taxes,licenses and exactions of every kind,and to no other.

like,is a reconstruction statute enacted to effectuate the aims of the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.because of the historic interrelationship between the two statutes,courts have consistently construed them together.see saunders general services,citing tillman recreation association,d runyon mccrary,d.
although not identical,the requisite elements of claims under and are quite similar.in neither case need a plaintiff allege state action on the part of the defendant.see stirgus benoit.in order to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege facts in support of the following elements that plaintiff is a member of a racial minority intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant and discrimination concerning one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute,which includes the right to make and enforce contracts yelverton lehman,no.civ,wl,at.june,aff,cir.in order to bring an action under,a plaintiff must allege with specificity facts sufficient to show or raise a plausible inference of the defendant racial animus intentional discrimination and that the defendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of race.garg albany indus.dev.agency,aff,table,wl cir.see also shaare tefila congregation cobb,d.
accepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint,we conclude that black smokers have not alleged a claim cognizable under either or.black smokers do not make the sort of claim that is most readily actionable under the statute that they have been deprived by defendants of the right to contract for,purchase,own or use either menthol or cigarettes.black smokers do not aver that defendants have engaged in a discriminatory refusal to deal with with respect to either menthol or cigarettes.nor do black smokers claim that defendants have dealt with customers on differing terms on the basis of race black smokers concede that defendants sell menthol cigarettes to at the same price and on the same terms as such products are offered to whites.significantly,black smokers do not allege that the mentholated tobacco products sold to differ from those sold to whites.furthermore,at no place in their submissions do black smokers argue any disparities with respect to the marketing or sales of tobacco products on the basis of race.consequently,it is difficult to understand black smokers allegations to constitute a deprivation of contract or property rights actionable under or.indeed,black smokers complaint appears instead to present quite the opposite situation.defendants are alleged to encourage the consumption by of certain of their products mentholated cigarettes,snuff,and chewing tobacco.
the question at the heart of black smokers and claims,then,is whether such encouragement is unlawful under the civil rights statutes.at the outset,we note that neither party has alerted us to the existence of any authority standing for the proposition that an encouragement to deal is actionable under such statutes.some authority does exist in support of the notion that targeting consumers for sales of defective products on the basis of race is actionable under and.for example,in roper edwards,cir,a case cited by black smokers,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit suggests that a cause of action under exists where a burial vault manufacturer made targeted sales of defective burial vaults to black consumers.although the case was brought by white plaintiffs who were inadvertently sold a defective vault,and although the court of appeals ultimately rejected plaintiffs claims on other grounds,black smokers correctly argue that the eleventh circuit did not reject the cause of action.nevertheless,roper is readily distinguishable from the case at bar because unlike roper,which involved deceptive sales to of products that differed from those sold to whites,this case concerns identical products defendants sell the same menthol cigarettes to everyone.
one might argue that if racially directed marketing of menthol cigarettes resulted in a situation in which virtually all mentholated tobacco products were consumed by and substantially all tobacco products by others,that case might come within the sweep of roper.however,black smokers have not alleged such a situation.
in order to salvage their claims,black smokers resort to several alternative theories of recovery.first,they suggest that defendants advertisements for menthol cigarettes constitute express warranties containing misrepresentations and false statements.this argument seems to constitute a claim of breach of express warranty,intentional fraud or misrepresentation.although it is true that the labeling act does not preempt such an action,cipollone liggett,at,black smokers fail to make sufficiently detailed allegations with respect to any of these potential causes of action.black smokers imply in their submissions,and asserted at oral argument,that defendants fail to disclose the increased health risks of menthol cigarettes and that the community suffers damages as a result of its higher consumption of mentholated tobacco products.although that claim may be factually true,it is not actionable.the supreme court has held that the act preempts claims based on a failure to warn and on the neutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent that such claims rely on omissions or inclusions in advertising or promotions.cipollone liggett,d.
second,black smokers attempt to raise a claim of segregated market exploitation by arguing that defendants practices fall within the ambit of segregated housing cases such as clark universal builders,cir.this claim also fails on both factual and legal grounds.in the segregated housing cases,unlike the instant case,the defendants sold houses to black purchasers on substantially different and more onerous terms than to others,effectively creating two separate,markets.see,clark universal builders,at.black smokers,however,point to no such disparities in the sale of mentholated tobacco products,apart from the generalized allegation that are more likely than others to buy mentholated tobacco products as a result of targeted advertising.
moreover,even if black smokers segregated market exploitation claims were cognizable on the facts alleged,we must reject them on procedural grounds.it does not appear that black smokers advanced such claims in the district court arguments asserted for the first time on appeal are deemed to be waived and consequently are not susceptible of review in this court absent exceptional circumstances,the public interest requires that the issues be heard or manifest injustice would result from the failure to consider such issues.see,united states anthony dell acquilla enter.subsidiaries,cir citations omitted united parcel serv.international brotherhood of teamsters,cir.no such exceptional circumstances are apparent here.
third,black smokers assert that defendants targeted marketing practices violate the full and equal benefit clause of,which provides that a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens a.again,we must reject black smokers full and equal benefit claims because they do not appear to have been raised in the district court and no exceptional circumstances suggest review of such claims notwithstanding black smokers failure to argue them previously.united states anthony dell aquilla enter.subsidiaries,at citations omitted.moreover,even if we were to consider them,such full and equal benefit claims would fail in light of a substantial line of authority holding that only state actors can be sued under the full and equal benefit clause of.mahone waddle,cir sheppard dickstein,shapiro,morin oshinsky,d,dictum lewis penney,citations omitted sterling kazmierczak.as we explain in sections iii c and d,infra,the defendants in the instant case can not be regarded as federal or state actors.
notwithstanding black smokers arguments to the contrary,their complaints essentially constitute discriminatory advertising claims.black smokers virtually admit as much when they characterize their claims as allegations of discriminatory targeting in sales of allegedly defective products.although black smokers argue that their claims resemble racial profiling and prepayment cases,all such fact patterns are distinguishable from the instant case because they involve either a naked,restriction on dealing or a variation of the terms of the contract at issue.consequently,black smokers claims remain fundamentally allegations of discriminatory advertising and are not therefore cognizable under or.
even in the context of housing a paradigmatic example of the rights congress sought to protect under the civil rights authority exists in support of the proposition that discriminatory advertising is not actionable under and.see jones alfred mayer,d noting that s does not prohibit advertising or other representations that indicate discriminatory preferences spann colonial village,holding that and do not prohibit real estate advertisements indicating discriminatory preferences saunders general services.declining to apply or to racially discriminatory advertising for rental housing ragin steiner,clateman and,same in context of cooperative apartment complex.

d.the bivens and fifth amendment claims 
the controlling question with respect to black smokers claims under bivens,supra,and the federal constitution is whether defendant tobacco companies should be regarded as federal actors.in bivens,the supreme court found that a damages claim arose under the federal constitution where a federal agent acting under color of federal authority violated the fourth amendment.id.a bivens action,which is the federal equivalent of the cause of action against state actors,will lie where the defendant has violated the plaintiff rights under color of federal law.alexander pennsylvania dep t of banking,no.civ,wl,at.april.black smokers also make direct constitutional claims under the fourteenth and fifth amendments.as the district court noted in its opinion,the fourteenth amendment only applies to actions of the states and not to the federal government therefore,the district court properly granted defendants motion to dismiss the fourteenth amendment claims.for black smokers bivens and fifth amendment claims to succeed,black smokers must establish that defendants are federal actors.because defendants conduct can not properly be regarded as federal,these claims must fail.
in order to determine whether the conduct of a private party should be attributed to the federal government,courts apply the state action analysis set forth by the supreme court in lugar edmondson oil,d.the supreme court succinctly summarized the test of lugar in its decision in edmonson leesville concrete,d.there,the court stated that lugar requires courts to ask first whether the claimed constitutional deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in federal authority and second,whether the private party charged with the deprivation could be described in all fairness as a federal actor.leesville concrete,at.applying lugar citations omitted.citing american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d,black smokers argue that their claims satisfy the first prong of lugar insofar as defendants had acted with knowledge of and pursuant to the statute in question the labeling act.this argument is unavailing because it fails to allege a deprivation of a right protected by the constitution.
moreover,the averment that defendants should be subject to the mandates of the constitution because their activities have been allegedly approved by the federal government through defendants compliance with the labeling act is unconvincing.the mere fact that a tobacco company has complied with the requirements of a federal law can not suffice to transform it into a federal actor any more than the compliance of a myriad of private enterprises with federal law and administrative regulations could of itself work such a transformation additionally,because the alleged wrongdoing the targeted advertising of mentholated tobacco products to is not required by the labeling act,it is difficult to view such targeted advertising as federal action by defendants which can serve as the basis for a bivens action.
the second requirement of the lugar the private party could in all fairness be regarded as a federal be met under one of three interrelated theories of government action i the public function test,ii the close nexus test and iii the symbiotic relationship test.in addition,black smokers discern in case law a fourth,more synthetic totality of the circumstances test,the existence of which is doubtful,as we explain infra.in order to determine which test should be applied to a given set of facts,courts must investigate carefully the circumstances of each case.see burton wilmington parking authority,d community med.center emergency med.services.cir citations omitted.regardless of what test is ultimately applied,the object of the inquiry is to determine whether a private entity has exercised powers traditionally reserved exclusively to the government,jackson metropolitan edison,d,or whether the defendant exercised power possessed by virtue of federal law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed in the authority of federal law.groman township of manalapan,cir citations omitted.
the gravamen of the public function test is whether the government is effectively using the private entity in question to avoid a constitutional obligation or to engage in activities reserved to the government.see goussis kimball.we can not agree with black smokers assertion that defendants actions satisfy the public function test.the public function test is the most rigorous of the inquiries.in blum yaretsky,at,the supreme court stressed that the traditionally public function must be the exclusive prerogative of the government,id.citation omitted.courts generally emphasize this exclusivity requirement and thus seldom find that high standard to have been satisfied.mark borough of hatboro,cir.even in cases involving arguably functions,such as providing utility services,see jackson metropolitan edison,supra,or furnishing remedial education to high school students,see kohn,d,the supreme court has declined to characterize such activities as government functions for purposes of the public function analysis.
in the case at bar,the action complained of is the lawful sale and marketing of a legal,albeit federally regulated,consumer product a private rather than public,and a fortiori not exclusively public,function.even if the activities at issue extended,as black smokers suggest,beyond the mere marketing and sale of mentholated tobacco products to the testing and labeling of such products,black smokers argument would fail because it would not meet the exclusivity requirement under the public function test.given that many products,including mentholated tobacco,are tested,marketed and labeled by their manufacturers,often in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements,such activities can not be characterized as the exclusive prerogative of the government.as the district court noted,it is simply inaccurate to suggest that the testing,labeling and marketing of cigarettes is the exclusive province of the federal government.finally,black smokers averment that defendants compliance with various federal labeling requirements transforms defendants into government actors is without support in applicable case law.such propositions have been flatly rejected by the supreme court on several occasions see american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d blum yaretsky,at.jackson metropolitan edison,d holding that the fact that a business is subject to government regulation does not by itself convert the business action into that of the government.
black smokers allegations that defendants actions satisfy the close nexus test under the government action analysis are also unavailing.as with the public function analysis,black smokers apparently discern the purported nexus between the private action complained of and the federal government in the operation of the labeling act.they assert that the labeling act encourages tobacco manufacturers to conceal the dangers of mentholated cigarettes,mandates inadequate warnings on such products and preempts most tort actions against defendants.however,because the labeling act does not compel,influence or encourage the actions upon which this suit is targeted marketing of menthol cigarettes to rather only requires the disclosure of certain risks on tobacco product packaging,defendants conduct in compliance with the labeling act does not create the close nexus necessary for a finding of state action.see kohn,d american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,at.goussis kimball.at.additionally,black smokers close nexus argument is defective to the extent that it does not allege the violation of a federal right,a prerequisite under that analysis.see goussis kimball.at.
black smokers attempt to classify this case under the symbiotic relationship category of state action cases is similarly tenuous.in the seminal,albeit somewhat idiosyncratic,case of burton wilmington parking,supra,the supreme court held that a coffee shop,which leased property located in a government owned parking garage,was integrated with the parking facility as an organic part of the government operation and was party to a mutually beneficial relationship with the government.out of these facts arose the symbiotic relationship test,which asks whether the government has insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the defendant.burton wilmington parking,at.
black smokers allegations concerning defendants relationship with the federal government prove both too little and too much and in any case,they scarcely suffice to make out a symbiotic relationship within the meaning of burton.black smokers aver that i the government benefits from its relationship with defendants by virtue of collecting enormous tax revenues from the tobacco industry and ii the interests of the government and defendants are explicitly intertwined under the terms of the labeling act,id.while these averments are undoubtedly true,they are inadequate to demonstrate government action.virtually all enterprises are subject to tax collection and,to varying degrees,to regimes of administrative regulation were these attributes sufficient to satisfy the test of burton,substantially all businesses in the country would effectively become federal actors.see hadges yonkers racing,cir.moreover,although burton retains much of its precedential value,it should be noted that the supreme court has recently cast some degree of doubt upon that decision.in american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,supra,which reversed our finding that certain private insurance companies were to be regarded as state actors under burton,the supreme court noted that burton was one of our early cases dealing with state action under the fourteenth amendment,and later cases have refined the vague joint participation test embodied in that case,at.citations omitted 
finally,black smokers contend that an expansive,totality of the circumstances approach to the question of government action exists wholly apart from the three inquiries discussed supra and that such an approach is grounded in third circuit cases such as sullivan barnett,cir,rev,d,and mark borough of hatboro,cir.although our cases place the factual context in which the case arises,sullivan barnett,at,at the heart of the government action analysis,such emphasis constitutes no more than proper adherence to the methodology set forth in the government action cases discussed supra and consequently can not be said to represent a novel development in or distinct branch of government action doctrine.
purporting to use this asserted totality of the circumstances test as the basis of their remaining government action analysis,black smokers compare the instant case to edmonson leesville concrete,d.leaving aside the question whether the federal courts have ever explicitly recognized black smokers totality of the circumstances approach,the facts of the instant case are readily distinguishable from those of edmonson.in edmonson,the supreme court held that lawyers use of peremptory challenges was pursuant to a course of government action and consequently that any racially discriminatory use of such challenges violates jurors equal protection rights.edmonson leesville concrete,at.the sine qua non of the court decision in edmonson was the presence of government involvement so pervasive in the context of the challenged actions as to render such actions virtually inseparable from the participation of the government.the edmonson court therefore emphasized that peremptory challenges simply could not exist without the government significant participation.id.at.the court went on to characterize the jury as a quintessential government body,having no attributes of a private actor,id.at,and to note that peremptory challenges are performed in the context of an inarguably traditional government function trial by jury.id.by contrast,in the instant case,the federal government does not in any manner design,mandate or approve the alleged racially targeted advertising of which black smokers complain,notwithstanding the fact that such advertising is subject to certain requirements and restrictions set forth in the labeling act.black smokers insistence at oral argument that the preemption of certain categories of tort actions by the labeling act in some way constitutes the exercise of a traditional government function or significant governmental participation within the meaning of edmonson is also without support in applicable precedent indeed,such preemption provisions are commonplace in federal product safety and information disclosure legislation.see,federal hazardous substances act,et,note b a moss parks,cir construing preemption provision of federal hazardous substances act.moreover,the marketing and advertising practices of defendants,including their research and safety testing activities,are functions typical of various private enterprises and,even in light of the federal regulation to which such activities are subject under the labeling act and other legislation,are difficult to regard as traditional government function s within the meaning of edmonson.
section claim 
black smokers claims are deficient in several respects and consequently may be disposed of relatively quickly.section provides,in pertinent part 
if two or more persons in any state or territory conspire,or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another,for the purpose of depriving,either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws,or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws and in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section,if one or more persons engaged therein do,or cause to be done,any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy,whereby another is injured in his person or property,or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the united states,the party so injured or deprived may have an action for recovery of the damages,occasioned by such injury or deprivation,against any one or more of the conspirators.
in general,the conspiracy provision of provides a cause of action under rather limited circumstances against both private and state actors.in order successfully to bring an action under for private conspiracy,a plaintiff must show,inter alia,a that a racial or other invidious discriminatory animus lay behind the coconspirators actions,b that the coconspirators intended to deprive the victim of a right guaranteed by the constitution against private impairment,and c that that right was consciously targeted and not just incidentally affected.spencer casavilla,cir citation omitted see also tilton richardson,cir holding that the same elements are required for claims against private actors.in order to prevent the use of as a general federal tort law,courts have been careful to limit causes of action thereunder to conspiracies that deprive persons of constitutionally protected rights,privileges and immunities that are protected against private,as well as official encroachment.libertad welch,cir.
it is well established that does not itself create any substantive rights rather,it serves only as a vehicle for vindicating federal rights and privileges which have been defined elsewhere.see great am.fed.sav.loan ass novotny,d.moreover,in the context of actions brought against private conspirators,the supreme court has thus far recognized only two rights protected under the right to be free from involuntary servitude and the right to interstate travel.see bray alexandria women health clinic,d caswell v.the morning call,no.civ,wl,at,welch board of dirs.of wildwood golf club.
the instant case is distinguishable from the cases cited above because black smokers assert the deprivation of a different type of rights those of property and contract.additionally,the district court correctly observed that because such entail freedom from discrimination by a private statutorily enacted,rather than of purely constitutional provenance,they can not be vindicated under.
black smokers attempt to salvage their claims by arguing that defendants alleged violations of and may support a claim under.in light of the overwhelming preponderance of authority on the question,this argument,too,must fail.contrary to black smokers claims,bray does not support the proposition that or claims can form the basis of a claim or the notion that the contract and property rights protected by and fall within the category of involuntary servitude violations that may support a claim.isolated authority from the district court for the district of columbia does exist in support of the theory that a claim may be based on a claim.see johnson greater southeast community hospital,citing alder columbia historical society.thompson int l of machinists.the great weight of precedential authority,however,supports the traditional limitation of to questions of interstate travel and involuntary servitude and does not suggest that or claims in general may form the basis of a action.see,sanders,table,wl,at cir,libertad welch,cir tilton richardson,cir.we need not,however,resolve the question whether violations of and can support a claim because black smokers have failed to state a claim under either or the district court therefore correctly dismissed black smokers claims under.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the decision of the district court in all respects.the district court correctly held that black smokers claims of racially targeted advertising and marketing of mentholated tobacco products were inadequate to state a cause of action under and.because black smokers do not demonstrate that defendants should be regarded as state actors,the district court properly dismissed their claims under as well.finally,we will affirm the district court conclusion that black smokers fail to allege adequately that defendants are federal actors for purposes of claims asserted either pursuant to bivens or directly under the federal constitution and that they fail to state a cause of action under.
what has been said in the majority opinion may properly be viewed as having put forth the best possible case for affirmance of the district court dismissal of the black smokers second amended complaint complaint.but that presentation,i believe,has despite itself highlighted the basic flaws in such a threshold.rule b dismissal.accordingly i dissent from the portion of the majority opinion that rejects black smokers claims under sections,and at the threshold of the case 
both the panel majority and i necessarily proceed from the seminal statement in hishon king spalding,d of the quite undemanding burden that rule b imposes on a plaintiff complaint 
a court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.conley gibson,d.
and the majority opinion also correctly recognizes,though i fear it does not fairly apply,the proposition that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the allegations in the complaint,as well as the allegations themselves,must be accepted as true moore tartler,cir.
because we deal with a complaint whose allegations must thus be credited,there is no need to dwell at length on the appalling record disclosed by black smokers pleading.page complaint does not comport with the rule a requirement of a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,but they can scarcely be faulted for what would normally be viewed as overkill in light of the undue judicial skepticism with which their effort has been met.it is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the substantially higher carcinogenic effects of the tobacco companies mentholated products,the use of which an extensively quoted surgeon general report and other medical research discloses as having led to
