background 
in bringing the underlying action pursuant to section a of title vii,a,the government alleged a pattern and practice of racial and gender discrimination by the board in its hiring and recruitment practices with respect to the positions of custodian and custodian engineer.these positions appear to have a hierarchical relationship,with custodian engineer being the superior job before one becomes a permanent custodian or custodian engineer with seniority rankings,one must serve what is essentially a probationary period as a provisional custodian or provisional custodian engineer.
the complaint alleged,inter alia,that the board engaged in discrimination by i failing to recruit females and minorities on the same basis as white males ii failing to hire and promote minorities on the same basis as whites and iii using civil service determine the order of hiring and promotion and,therefore,had a negative,disparate impact on black and hispanic applicants.
after discovery and negotiations,the government and the board executed the agreement.in pertinent part,the agreement required the board to confer permanent civil service status on provisional african american,hispanic,asian,and female custodians and custodian engineers,and to provide retroactive seniority to them and an additional eleven employees in all of similar backgrounds collectively offerees.
the agreement would benefit the offerees in the following ways.the salary of a custodian or custodian engineer is discounted at various levels during the first five years of an individual employment.retroactive seniority would entitle an offeree to a higher salary,a smaller discount.moreover,the larger the building in which a custodian or custodian engineer works,the higher the salary.as a result of a collective bargaining agreement,transfers to larger buildings are based generally on a formula that uses both seniority and performance ratings.in practice,of actual transfers are based on the transferee seniority.finally,permanent civil service status benefits an offeree by allowing to bypass provisional status in which the employee has no protected rights.
as claimed by appellants,the pertinent principal effects of the agreement on other employees appear to be.first,other custodians or custodian engineers will have less seniority relative to offerees moved above them and may therefore fail to obtain a desired transfer to a larger building.second,permanent custodian engineers have seniority rights whereas provisional custodian engineers are probationary employees according permanent status as a custodian engineer to an offeree may result in the offeree displacing a provisional custodian engineer,who may return to a permanent custodian position.
the parties moved the district court to hold a fairness hearing at which objections to the agreement would be heard.see n preventing challenge to employment practices implementing consent judgment provided notice and opportunity to object are given.various employees,including appellants,filed objections to the proposed agreement on numerous grounds.appellants,who were permanent custodians provisional custodian engineers,also moved to intervene as of right,pursuant to.a on the ground that the agreement was unconstitutional.they claimed that the agreement was impermissibly based on race,ethnicity,and gender and would result in some or all of them losing their status as provisional custodian engineers their relative seniority rights as custodians custodian engineers.the district judge referred the matter to magistrate levy to conduct a fairness hearing,and the government and the board then consented to have the case referred to magistrate levy for all purposes,pursuant to c.
magistrate levy received expert declarations and held a fairness hearing,at which employees of the board who filed timely objections to the agreement had an opportunity to raise their concerns,while the government and the board presented arguments in favor of entry of the agreement.
the district court found that the government had made a prima facie showing on each of its discrimination claims that the remedies proposed in the agreement were fair,reasonable,and legal and that none of the objections had sufficient merit to overcome the presumption of validity that the district court accorded to the agreement.d at.
the district court also denied appellants motion to intervene.it reasoned that they had presumptively obtained their seniority rights as a result of discrimination.it further concluded that appellants had no legally protectable interest in their employment status or seniority rankings.specifically,the district court held that a civil servant has no vested property right in a particular position or appointment,and a person on an eligibility list does not possess any mandated right to appointment or any other legally protectible interest.d at quoting kirkland new york state dep t of corr,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court further held that e ven if the proposed intervenors could assert some cognizable interest in their seniority rights,that interest would be remote and speculative.id.at.it based this conclusion on the perceived unlikelihood that any of the offerees would compete with any of the appellants for a transfer to a particular building and obtain the transfer as a result of the retroactive seniority.for such a result to occur,the court reasoned,several events would need to converge i one of the offerees and one of the appellants would have to request the same transfer ii each would have to have the same job title,custodian or custodian engineer iii the performance ratings of the offeree and the appellant would have to be quite close and iv the offeree and the appellant would have to hold the first and second spots,respectively,on the transfer list for the particular building.the district court held,therefore,that appellants interest in their seniority rankings was not direct,substantial,and legally protectable,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,denied appellants motion to intervene,and approved the agreement.
this appeal followed.
