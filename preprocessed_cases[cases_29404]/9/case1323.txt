this case is before us a second time,following a remand to the united states district court for the district of connecticut dominic squatrito,judge for supplementation of the record.see generally united states jacobson,cir holding that remands for supplementation of the record are permissible.the question presented is whether the plaintiffs claims brought pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,of the rehabilitation act of,rehabilitation act,and the connecticut and united states constitutions are under the applicable connecticut statute of limitations.
background 
plaintiffs initially brought this action on march,seeking,inter alia,reimbursement for the years of tuition expenses that resulted from and unilateral decision to remove their daughter from the southington public school system and to place her in cheshire public high school on a tuition basis.we assume familiarity with the facts and procedural history set forth in the published opinion of the district court.see southington bd.of,d.
on october,the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss pursuant to.b and b because it concluded that plaintiffs claims were by the limitations period set forth in connecticut general statutes a.the court determined that plaintiffs cause of action accrued when was unilaterally withdrawn from the southington school district on january.see,d at.plaintiffs did not file a request for a due process hearing pursuant to the idea,f,until april,than four years after the unilateral withdrawal of from southington and the subsequent enrollment of at cheshire public high school.accordingly,the district court concluded,their claims fell outside the limitations period.after determining that the doctrine of equitable tolling was inapplicable,the court granted defendant motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiffs claims were.see id.at.plaintiffs timely appealed.
on august,we filed an unpublished order remanding the cause to the district court so that the parties could supplement the record.see southington bd.of,wl cir.recognizing that requires the board of education to provide notice of certain procedural safeguards before the limitations period begins to notice of the limitations period sought supplementation of the record with admissible evidence related to the following three questions 
when,how,and under what circumstances did the d family first receive actual notice that a period of any period of running against them if the d family did not first receive such actual notice from the board of education,when,how,and under what circumstances did they first receive it and did the d family sleep on their rights so that the doctrine of laches may have some bearing on this case 
ii.we stated that,on remand,the district court should consider whether it is appropriate or permissible for the district court to convert the rule motion to a fed civ.motion for summary judgment.id.at.we indicated that i f the rule motion is converted into a rule motion,jurisdiction will be restored to this panel,without the need to file a new notice of appeal.id.
on may,while the case was pending on remand,defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.on august,magistrate judge thomas smith,to whom the case had been referred,filed a report recommending that defendant summary judgment motion be granted.see southington bd.of,civ,slip op.at.magistrate judge smith correctly recognized that,because the idea does not contain its own statute of limitations,courts must apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see generally wilson garcia,d.he determined that the most closely analogous statute of limitation under connecticut law is a,which sets forth a limitations period for challenges to the appropriateness of an educational placement.nevertheless,he concluded that,because was unilaterally withdrawn from the southington school district prior to the enactment of a,that statute limitations period was not applicable.instead,he recommended applying the limitations period set forth in,which governs all causes of action founded upon a tort.
magistrate judge smith next determined that the date of accrual of a cause of action brought pursuant to the idea is governed by federal law,and that such an action accrues when the parents know or have reason to know of the injury or event that is the basis for their claim.iii,civ,at quoting james upper arlington city sch.he concluded that i n this case,the parents were aware of the alleged injury to their child when they unilaterally placed her out of what they judged to be an inferior school district.id.at.because was withdrawn from the southington schools on january,than four years before and requested a due process hearing on this judge smith concluded that,even under the longer,limitations period provided by,the plaintiffs claims are.
the district court adopted magistrate judge smith recommendation,and judgment was entered in favor of the defendants on september.pursuant to this court summary order of august,jurisdiction was automatically reinstated in this court.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts in the light most favorable to the party and identifying any genuine issues of material fact that remain for adjudication.see,anderson liberty lobby,d schonholz long island jewish med,cir.
accrual of the cause of action 
even where a federal court borrows a state statute of limitations,f ederal law governs the question of when a federal claim accrues.leon murphy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under federal law,a cause of action generally accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also singleton city of new york,cir applying this rule of accrual to claims brought pursuant to.
we join our sister circuits in holding that this general rule is also applicable to claims brought pursuant to the idea.see,james upper arlington city sch,cir holding that initial claim accrued when the parents knew of the injury to their child,the inadequate education alexopulos riles,cir holding that a cause of action generally accrues when a plaintiff learns of the injury which is the basis of his action and applying this standard to claims brought pursuant to the idea predecessor statute,the education of all handicapped children act,et.
applying this rule,it is clear that plaintiffs knew or had reason to know of their injury when they withdrew from the southington school system on january,because they believed that the system was not providing her with an appropriate and adequate education.at the time they placed in cheshire public high school on a tuition basis,and were aware that they would have a substantial monetary loss as a result of their decision.we therefore hold that plaintiffs claims accrued on or before january,
statute of limitations governing the idea claims 
when congress has not established a time limitation for a federal cause of action,the settled practice has been to adopt a local time limitation as federal law if it is not inconsistent with federal law or policy to do so.wilson garcia,d.where a federal statute is silent with respect to the applicable limitations period,courts apply the most appropriate or analogous state statute of limitations.goodman lukens steel,d see also wilson,at.board of regents tomanio,d adler educ.dep t of,cir borrowing limitations period from an analogous new york statute for purposes of determining the timeliness of an action brought pursuant to the idea predecessor,the education of all handicapped children act,et.
in its october,ruling granting defendant motion to dismiss,the district court adopted the connecticut statute of limitations set forth in a this provision establishes a limitations period for challenges to an educational placement.it states that the limitations period generally begins at the time the school board declines to make the educational change desired by the parents or at the time it proposes an educational change that the parents deem unsuitab
