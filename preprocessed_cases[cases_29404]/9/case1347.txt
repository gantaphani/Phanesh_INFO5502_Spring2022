plaintiff diana mickle appeals from so much of a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alan nevas,judge,as dismissed her claims brought under against defendants sean morin and ronald smith,members of the norwalk,connecticut police department,for the alleged use of excessive force in arresting her.at the close of mickle presentation of her case to the jury,mickle withdrew her claims against other defendants,and the district court granted judgment as a matter of law jmol in favor of morin and smith on the grounds that mickle trial testimony was not as credible as that of smith and morin and that,in the circumstances,the amount of force used by the officers was the minimum amount needed and was not objectively unreasonable.on appeal,mickle contends that the court could not properly make credibility evaluations or weigh the evidence in entering judgment against her as a matter of law.in addition,appellant john williams,one of mickle attorneys,appeals from an order of the district court sanctioning him in the amount of for failing to comply with a pretrial order.williams contends that the sanction was unwarranted and was imposed on him without notice and an opportunity to be heard.for the reasons that follow,we vacate both the judgment and the sanctions order and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
the present litigation arises out of incidents that occurred on june and june,at the home of mickle,then a grandmother.at approximately on june,mickle was arrested by officer morin and smith,and perhaps a third officer.she was released later that day without being charged.she brought this action under,alleging,inter alia,false arrest,use of excessive force during the arrest,and various violations of state law.all but the claim of excessive force were withdrawn before trial.
at trial,mickle testified and called smith and morin as witnesses.the following accounts of what occurred in the early morning hours of june are drawn from the trial testimony.
a.the arrest of mickle 
it is undisputed that on the evening of june,mickle daughter amy barrow had been arrested after a disturbance between barrow and barrow son and that mickle thereafter attempted to call the norwalk police station,hoping to extricate her daughter or to arrange bail.according to mickle,when she tried the police station main telephone number,she reached only an answering machine that had a garbled message she therefore called,explained the problem,and asked the operator to transfer her to the desk sergeant the operator responded that she could not do so.
mickle then called again the exact number of times she called is disputed but is not material to this appeal.morin was sent to mickle home after midnight and knocked when there was no response,he left.smith too went to mickle home,knocked,received no response,and departed.thereafter,smith and morin together went to mickle home they knocked,rang the doorbell,still received no response,and departed.at about,both smith and morin were again dispatched to mickle home according to morin,the officers were sent because of mickle repeated calls to for nonemergency purposes according to smith,they were sent because they had been informed that mickle was intoxicated and they were concerned for the safety of mickle grandson.
mickle version of the arrest 
mickle testified that she was not intoxicated when the officers arrived at on june.she and members of her family had gone out to dinner on the evening of june to celebrate her grandson birthday,and they had consumed some champagne and had had wine with dinner but she had not had an alcoholic beverage since 
mickle indicated that she had heard smith and morin on their first visit to her house in the early morning hours of june,but she had not responded because they had not identified themselves as police officers.prior to their final visit,she had received a call from the operator who alerted her that the officers were coming.mickle testified that,on that final visit,unbeknownst to her,one officer entered through the back door of her house,which she kept locked and when there was a knock at the front door and she opened the door a crack,
t here was an officer standing behind the door to the vestibule,hiding behind it.he pulled the door,he grabbed my arm and wrenched it up behind my back and pushed me out into the arms of these two on the stoop and they put a hand cuff on and dragged me out to the car and threw me in.
trial transcript february,tr.when they arrived at the police station,mickle was told to get out of the car but could not because her hands were cuffed behind her and she could not maneuver.the officers pushed and pulled her out of the car and dragged her into the station.mickle testified that at no point did she use any vulgarity in speaking to the officers.nor had she attempted to punch or kick anyone.
as a result of the wrenching of her arm,the rotator cuff in mickle shoulder was dislocated,causing her tremendous pain and shock and requiring numerous visits to her doctor and her physical therapist.mickle also suffered a pinched nerve in her shoulder and developed high blood pressure as a result of the incident.she also testified that the handcuffing had been inappropriately high on her forearms and caused a large hematoma however,she had suffered little residual pain from the bruising and was complaining principally that the wrenching of her arm sufficiently to damage her rotator cuff constituted force that was excessive.mickle doctor bills as a result of the incident totaled some.as of the time of trial in,an mri was being scheduled for the shoulder.
the granting of jmol 
the final visit by smith and morin to mickle home,and her ensuing arrest,were described by the district court in a posttrial opinion as follows 
after smith and morin left following their first visit,on which they knocked and rang but received no response,the norwalk police continued to receive calls on their emergency number.because of these additional calls,smith and morin again returned to mickle home at approximately to investigate.morin knocked on the front door and eventually it was opened slightly by mickle.mickle informed morin that she did have to let him in and that he was a worthless piece of shit.while morin was talking to mickle,smith walked around the perimeter of the residence and found the rear door of the house unlocked.smith,concerned about the well being of the child who had been left in the custody of his intoxicated grandmother,entered the premises and announced his entry.he entered through the kitchen,where he spotted numerous empty wine bottles and glasses.smith continued through the hallway and saw mickle at the front door.mickle had just slammed the door on morin and began to turn around as smith approached her.smith walked towards mickle and stated,why do you open the door for the officer.mickle then turned around,and with the closed fist of her right hand,attempted to strike smith in the head.smith blocked mickle punch and stepped backwards to get out of the way.mickle forward momentum caused her to fall to the floor.while mickle was on the floor,smith opened the front door for morin and together they handcuffed her.both smith and morin detected an odor of alcohol on her.mickle was handcuffed and arrested for breach of peace,criminal mischief,interfering with an officer,and assaulting an officer.morin and smith asked mickle to walk to the police car,but she refused and began digging her heels into the ground.eventually mickle went limp and smith and morin carried her approximately twenty five to thirty feet to morin patrol car.
once in the car,mickle verbally berated morin during the drive to the norwalk police station.morin again noticed an odor of alcohol emanating from mickle while they were driving to the station.upon arriving at the police station,mickle refused to peacefully exit the police car.smith,who had returned to the station in his own patrol car,had to assist morin in physically removing her from the car.mickle,again refused to walk and was carried into the police station by morin and smith.
ruling on motion for judgment as a matter of law,dated february,jmol ruling at.
in ruling that the above evidence entitled smith and morin to judgment as a matter of law,the district court stated as follows 
in this case,the evidence shows that,as a matter of law,no reasonable jury could determine that mickle was subjected to excessive force.mickle presented no evidence to support her claim that the officers used excessive force.to the contrary,the evidence presented in her revealed that morin and smith acted objectively reasonabl y in light of the circumstances that confronted them.both smith and morin applied the minimum amount of force necessary to subdue mickle under the circumstances.mickle was intoxicated at the time of the arrest,she was abusive and belligerent towards morin and smith,she attempted to strike smith,she resisted arrest,and continuously refused to comply with their request that she walk,and thus they had to carry her.the only evidence presented by mickle was her testimony that she had been handcuffed and that this caused bruising.
the court also found that smith and morin were entitled to qualified immunity,stating that 
the evidence presented at trial revealed that morin and smith exercised the minimum amount of force necessary to subdue mickle who was intoxicated,assaulted smith,and refused to comply with the officers requests.their actions did not violate clearly established constitutional rights and it was objectively reasonable for them to believe that their actions did not violate those rights.
the court concluded 
it is for the foregoing reasons,as well as the reasons articulated on the record at trial,that the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law as to morin and smith was granted.
id.on the record at trial,the district court had stated its reasons for granting smith and morin judgment as a matter of law as follows 
in the court view,the testimony of the plaintiff is not credible and is inconsistent with the testimony of the officers.the court finds the officers testimony to be far more credible than that of the plaintiff and,therefore,the court directs a verdict in favor of the defendants.
sanctions against williams 
as discussed in greater detail in part.below,on february and,the district court entered two sanctions orders dated february,one against williams as attorney of record for mickle,and the other against jeffry spahr as lead attorney for smith and morin,in connection with their respective failures to comply with a pretrial order filed on january,january pretrial order.that order required the parties,at various intervals prior to trial,to file,inter alia,proposed voir dire questions,a stipulation of the uncontroverted facts,an agreed statement of the contested issues of fact and law,lists of their respective witnesses and exhibits,specifications as to interrogatory answers and deposition passages to be offered at trial,proposed jury instructions,and a special verdict form if one was to be requested.the court found that neither attorney had complied with any part of the january pretrial order.it fined williams and spahr.each attorney moved to vacate the sanctions order against him.spahr motion remains pending in the district court williams motion to vacate was denied.
these appeals followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mickle contends that in granting judgment against her as a matter of law,the district court erred by making evaluations of credibility and by failing to draw permissible inferences in her favor.williams contends that the sanctions against him were unwarranted and were imposed without affording him due process.for the reasons that follow,we vacate both the judgment against mickle and the sanctions order against williams and remand for further proceedings.
a.the granting of jmol against mickle 
the district court may properly grant judgment as a matter of law in a case tried to a jury if a party has been fully heard on a dispositive issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.in reviewing the record to determine whether a motion for jmol should be granted,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.reeves sanderson plumbing products,d quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.jmol is thus proper only if the evidence is such that,without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence,there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable men could have reached.fiacco city of rensselaer,cir quoting simblest maynard,cir,cert.denied,d.and in making this determination,the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.reeves sanderson plumbing products,at.
the fourth amendment,which protects against unreasonable seizures,governs a claim that excessive force was used in connection with an arrest.see graham connor,d.in this context,the reasonableness question is whether the officers actions were objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.id.at.as to the substance of such a claim,n ot every push or shove is excessive.id.at.quoting johnson glick,cir,cert.denied,d.however,we have held that where there was testimony that a suspected thief,upon answering the police officer knock at his door,was shoved to the floor,was immediately cuffed with his hands behind his back,and was kept in that position for five or six hours with the handcuffs unduly tight,despite his complaints,before being taken to the police station,the evidence was sufficient to defeat a motion for judgment as a matter of law.see calamia city of new york,cir.similarly,sworn assertions that the defendant pushed the plaintiff against the inside of the door of her car,yanked her out,threw her up against the fender,and twisted her arm behind her back,causing bruises lasting a couple of weeks were sufficient to preclude summary judgment dismissing a claim for excessive force.robison via,cir see,bellows dainack,cir similar evidence held sufficient to foreclose judgment as a matter of law after trial see also reeves sanderson plumbing products,at.the standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the standard for judgment as a matter of law,such that the inquiry under each is the same.quoting anderson liberty lobby,at.wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed standard for assessing sufficiency of evidence to create issue of fact for jury is the same whether it arises in the procedural context of a motion for judgment as a matter of law prior to the submission of the case to the jury or in the context of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law after the jury has returned a verdict.
in the present case,neither the district court oral announcement that it was granting jmol at the close of mickle case nor its written decision a week later complied with the above principles.the written decision did not take the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to mickle.rather,on all conflicting points,that decision appears to have ignored mickle testimony entirely.for example,the court stated that mickle was intoxicated at the time of the arrest jmol ruling at.mickle testified,however,that she was not intoxicated and had last consumed five hours earlier,tr.the court stated that mickle was abusive and belligerent towards morin and smith,jmol ruling at,and informed morin that he was a worthless piece of shit,jmol ruling at.mickle testified,however,that she had not used any profanity toward the officers tr.and when asked whether she had made that specific quoted statement,mickle stated that she had not tr.the court stated that w hile morin was talking to mickle,smith walked around the perimeter of the residence and found the rear door of the house unlocked.jmol ruling at.mickle testified,however,that the officer who had entered her house grabbed her the moment she opened her door a crack she also testified that her back door was locked,that it was her practice to keep it locked,and that she had been particularly careful to ensure that it was locked that night because of the upsetting events involving her daughter.tr.the court stated that smith entered the premises and announced his entry.jmol ruling at.mickle testified,however,that at no point did smith announce his presence in her home.tr.the court stated that mickle,with the closed fist of her right hand,attempted to strike smith in the head.jmol ruling at.mickle testified,however,that she did not hit or swing at any officer.tr.
thus,in virtually every particular relating to the encounter between mickle and the officers,the district court made no mention whatever of the testimony of mickle and adopted a version of the circumstances that was proffered by smith morin.as the jury was not required to believe the disputed accounts given by either of the defendants,the court was required to disregard their testimony in ruling on their motion for judgment as a matter of law.the court could not instead embrace defendants versions of the circumstances as the basis for granting them judgment as a matter of law.
further,the district court erred in stating that t he only evidence of force or injury presented by mickle was her testimony that she had been handcuffed and that this caused bruising,jmol ruling at.mickle testified,in addition,that she had suffered a painfully dislocated rotator cuff that that injury had required visits to her doctor for which she incurred in doctor bills,and required trips to a physical therapist and that even as late as the time of trial,more than years after the event,she needed an mri for her shoulder,tr.whether or not mickle rotator medically precise,her description was admitted without objection,and a rational juror,crediting mickle version of the events,could have inferred that the force used to inflict that injury on a person whose only offense had been repeated nonemergency calls to was excessive.
nor could the court properly grant jmol for smith and morin on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity,for it was well established that the use of excessive force in the course of an arrest is constitutionally prohibited,see generally graham connor,at,and proper application of the test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case,including the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight,id.at.see id.at.the fourth amendment inquiry is one of objective reasonableness under the circumstances.where the circumstances are in dispute,and contrasting accounts present factual issues as to the degree of force actually employed and its reasonableness,a defendant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on a defense of qualified immunity.kerman city of new york,cir see also id.at s ummary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is not appropriate when there are facts in dispute that are material to a determination of reasonableness quoting thomas roach,cir robison via,at.
the district court here recognized that the objective reasonableness of a given amount of force depends on the circumstances.see,jmol ruling at morin and smith acted objectively reasonabl y in light of the circumstances that confronted them.both smith and morin applied the minimum amount of force necessary to subdue mickle under the circumstances.emphases added.but it failed to give recognition to the fact that the circumstances were sharply in dispute.for example,in stating that morin and smith exercised the minimum amount of force necessary to subdue mickle who was intoxicated,assaulted smith,and refused to comply with the officers requests,jmol ruling at,the court plainly made factual findings as to the circumstances confronting the officers.in contrast to those findings,mickle account of the facts was that she was not intoxicated and had done nothing more than make calls and open her door a crack when the officers knocked on her door at.she had not engaged,and did not engage,in any violent conduct.she did not curse at the officers she did not attempt to strike any of them.she had merely sought to speak by telephone to a live police than an answering an attempt to have her daughter released from custody.instead,a policeman surreptitiously entered her locked home and grabbed her from behind without warning or provocation,and she was literally dragged off to jail in handcuffs,her arm wrenched out of its socket.a jury as factfinder,of course,would not be required to credit mickle version of the events,but it could permissibly do so and her version,which the court was required to credit in ruling on defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law,was sufficient to support findings that the force used against mickle was excessive and that no reasonable police officer could objectively have believed otherwise.
in adopting the defendants versions of the events,the district court expressly stated that it found those versions to be far more credible than that of the plaintiff,and that i n the court view,the testimony of the plaintiff wa s not credible.tr.the granting of jmol on such a basis is,as discussed above,impermissible.
accordingly,we reverse the granting of jmol and remand for a new trial.
b.the imposition of sanctions against williams 
the trial began and ended on february.on february and,the district court entered orders dated february imposing sanctions against williams and spahr,respectively,for failing to file the stipulations,statements,lists,and requests called for by the court january pretrial order.the sanctions order with respect to williams stated as follows 
on february,trial before a jury commenced in this court.neither counsel of record,john williams,nor his associates who filed appearances on the eve of trial complied with any of the requirements of the court order doc.filed january.see attached the order expressly states that f or purpose of complying with this order,the jury selection date of february,is the trial date.see court order.contrary to the requirements of the order,williams did not submit a written stipulation of uncontroverted facts and an agreed statement of the contested issues of fact and law a list of witnesses a list of exhibits a joint statement of the case jury instructions a list of any interrogatories,answers thereto,or depositions specifying the appropriate portions thereof that plaintiff intends to offer at trial a special verdict form if one is to be requested or voir dire questions.
williams failure to comply with the court order is an occurrence by williams and the members of his firm in cases assigned to the docket of the undersigned.in fact,in almost every case which has gone to trial in this court,the members of his firm have uniformly ignored the court order.the court will no longer excuse this pattern of practice.in light of williams and his firm present and past failures to respect the court authority and to obey the court order,the court now invokes its inherent power to impose sanctions for such conduct.the court is vested with inherent power to police the conduct of attorneys who violate court orders and engage in other conduct that interferes with the court power to manage its courtroom and may do so without a finding of bad faith.see united states seltzer,cir.
accordingly,the court hereby imposes sanctions in the amount of five hundred dollars against john williams for failure to comply with the court order.the fine shall be paid to the clerk of the court in bridgeport,connecticut,by march.
order imposing sanctions on williams,dated february,williams sanctions order,at.the court order imposing sanctions on spahr was similar,but the amount was,and it made no reference to any past contumacy.
williams moved to vacate the order of sanctions against him,complaining in part that the sanctions had been im
