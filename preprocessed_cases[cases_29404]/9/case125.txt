the government of puerto rico changed hands as a result of the november general elections,and quickly passed laws to reorganize different agencies.many of the officials displaced as a result brought suit,claiming political discrimination and due process violations.see torres rivera garcia padilla,wl,at,listing cases.
this is an interlocutory appeal from one of those cases.it concerns the change effected by law,which explicitly made the position of the chair of the puerto rico industrial commission pric freely removable,and governor alejandro garcía padilla subsequent decision to remove the,basilio torres rivera,and to appoint a replacement.torres rivera responded almost immediately by bringing suit against garcía padilla and the new pric chair,grace sylvette lozada crespo,alleging violations of his constitutional rights under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments,as well as violations of puerto rico constitutional and statutory law.the district court granted a preliminary injunction based on torres rivera due process claim that,inter alia,vacated the appointment of his replacement,lozada crespo,and reinstated torres rivera.
federal injunctive relief concerning the selection of political appointments in commonwealth government is as extraordinary as it is rare.since the district court issued its preliminary injunction,the supreme court of puerto rico has made clear the importance of these cases to the commonwealth own constitutional balance of powers,see díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla,tspr,wl certified translation provided by the parties,and the parties agree that the relief available under commonwealth law is adequate here.accordingly,we again face the question of whether torres rivera remains entitled to federal injunctive relief for his due process claim given the conceded adequacy of commonwealth remedies.montañez allman garcía padilla,cir,acevedo feliciano ruiz hernández,cir.in light of the extraordinariness of the relief sought,the immense importance of this case to the commonwealth own constitutional balance of powers,and torres rivera failure to allege that commonwealth procedure is inadequate,we remand with instructions to vacate the preliminary injunction within thirty days of the date of this opinion,and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we summarize only the facts necessary to resolve the appeal.
established in,the pric is the puerto rico agency charged with reviewing decisions made by the administrator of the state insurance fund on claims for workers compensation.the governor appoints the commissioners of the pric with the advice and consent of the senate of puerto rico.the governor also appoints the chair,with the advice and consent of the senate,who serve s simultaneously as a commissioner and the administrative head of the agency.laws ann.tit.
in may,luis fortuño appointed torres rivera as commissioner and chair of the pric,and the puerto rico senate confirmed his appointment a month later at the time of his appointment,the term of office was six years,pursuant to law of,as amended through law the parties dispute whether this term attached to a joint position of chair and commissioner,jointly to both positions,or only to the position of commissioner.
when garcía padilla became governor following the november general elections,a series of laws were enacted to usher the governor political supporters into office.torres rivera,wl,at.one of these,law,made the pric chair a freely removable position,arguably eliminating the term that the position may have had.by letter dated january,garcía padilla notified torres rivera of this change.garcía padilla letter also informed torres rivera that he could continue on as commissioner,but that a new chair had been appointed.less than a week later,torres rivera filed suit in federal district court against garcía padilla and the new chair,lozada crespo,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages under,the puerto rico constitution,and commonwealth law.
the district court found that torres rivera was likely to succeed on his due process claim,reasoning that he had been deprived of his property interest in continuing as pric chair for the term to which he had been appointed.the district court issued a preliminary injunction on this basis that vacated lozada crespo appointment as chair and commissioner ordered that torres rivera be maintain ed as chair and commissioner and enjoined torres rivera removal from his position as chair and commissioner without due process.this appeal followed.
the parties vigorously dispute several points of commonwealth law that they argue are relevant to the question of whether torres rivera had a property interest in the position of chair,and,if so,whether that interest survived law they also dispute both the applicability and the authority of the puerto rico supreme court decision in the related case of díaz carrasquillo garcía padilla,tspr,wl.
we need not and will not adjudicate these disputes.reinstatement is an equitable remedy,and,even if available,is not inevitable.rosario torres hernandez colon,cir en banc noting that reinstatement must be tailor ed on a case by case basis.the parties agreed at oral argument that the relief available in commonwealth court is adequate,and so we must consider whether the rather extraordinary federal injunctive relief reinstating a commonwealth political appointment and removing the appointee replacement remains appropriate.see montañez allman,el dia,hernandez colon,cir e quitable remedies should be granted only as a matter of judicial discretion citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
when we last resolved this issue in montañez allman,we observed that in determining entitlement to federal relief for due process violations,a relevant consideration is the adequacy of existing state remedies.montañez allman,quoting acevedo feliciano,at.we explained that this is particularly true where,as here,the relief sought implicates comity concerns,but is not necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury.id.quoting.state grange benton,holmes,internal quotation marks omitted see also rosario torres,at urging caution i n shaping equitable remedies,where comity concerns can loom large comm of pullman,holding that federal courts must exercis e a wise discretion in administering equitable relief to avoid needless friction with state policies citations and internal quotation marks omitted.relying on such comity considerations and the discretion inherent in equitable relief,we found that federal equitable relief was no longer appropriate given the importance of the case to the commonwealth constitutional balance of powers and the adequacy of relief that had become available under the puerto rico supreme court decision in díaz carrasquillo.see montañez allman,finding applicable justice holmes important rule that injunctive relief ought not issue against officers of a state unless in a case reasonably free from doubt and when necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury alteration in original quoting.state grange,at.
the parties believe that this presents a different case from both montañez allman and díaz carrasquillo.superficially,they are correct montañez allman and díaz carrasquillo present abolishment cases,concerning limits on the legislature ability to effect a removal by destroying an executive office only to reestablish it under a new name,and the survival of a property interest in the destroyed office as a property interest in the new office.by contrast,this case,torres rivera,appears to present a removal case,concerning limits on the legislature ability to destroy a property interest in an office assuming there was such an interest by lifting whatever removal limitations created the property interest in the first place.santana gobernadora,wl certified translation provided by the parties stating the principle that where there is no mandatory time period,there is no proprietary interest 
but despite these superficial differences,these cases are similar in one significant respect they implicate questions concerning the limitations on the legislative assembly
