the case before us concerns plaintiff julia johnson appeal from the district court grant of qualified immunity to defendant police officer patterson.the district court dismissed johnson claim against him by reason of his having seized her for psychiatric evaluation based on her supposed dangerousness to her son djm.
in response to reports from djm school that djm mother was behaving in an irrational manner,nassau county child protective services cps opened an investigation,led by cps caseworker jodi weitzman.as a result of her investigation,weitzman eventually summoned police to meet her at johnson home,where according to notes from the record,she and officer patterson agreed that mo ther should be sent for a psych eval as her behavior was irrational.
we are now called on to decide whether officer patterson is entitled to qualified immunity,thereby barring johnson claim that he violated her fourth amendment rights by arresting her.unfortunately,the record evidence of what happened that evening consists only of the terse notes of the cps caseworkers.and those notes lack indicia of,or specific observations substantiating,johnson dangerousness nor do they show that patterson reasonably relied on communications from weitzman or others in making the seizure.moreover,and notably,there is no statement by patterson in the record.
on the current record,we can not affirm the district court grant of qualified immunity to officer patterson on johnson claim.without evidence regarding the grounds for patterson decision,we are unable to determine whether his actions were contrary to clearly established law.accordingly,and without considering the many unresolved legal questions in this area,we vacate the district court grant of qualified immunity and remand to the district court for further expansion of the record as to the basis on which the arrest was made,and for reevaluation of patterson entitlement to qualified immunity on the basis of an expanded record.
background 
the case before us arises from the involvement of officer patterson in the august,seizure and involuntary hospitalization of plaintiff appellant julia johnson.patterson arrested johnson in the course of an attempted interview of johnson son pursuant to a cps neglect investigation.caseworker notes from that cps investigation constitute the factual corpus underlying both patterson motion for summary judgment and our description of the investigation and subsequent events leading to johnson seizure.these notes are essentially contemporaneous records of the course of the cps investigation,with entries recorded the day they occurred,or within a few weeks.weitzman,a cps caseworker who was actively involved in the investigation of johnson and who was present during johnson arrest,made the majority of the entries.
the investigation 
on june,an employee at djm school called the new york state child abuse hotline to allege that johnson was acting oddly and to express concern that there would be no one to check on the child.caseworker notes,dist.dkt,at johnson myers,cv js wdw,wl,at june.according to the caseworker notes,the caller stated that the mother i had refused to sign emergency contact cards with a home phone number for djm,ii had refused to sign permission slips for school trips,iii had written letters to the fbi with the school cc ed,iv had attended an award assembly where she only took notes,v had made unusual inquiries about other children at the school,and vi had grown furious with the school when djm father picked him up,demanding to see the father signature.caseworker notes,dist.dkt,at 
on the same day as the school employee call,weitzman tried to contact johnson by going to her home,and she was able to meet with djm father,eddie myers,at the home.according to the caseworker notes,myers responded to the allegations against johnson by stating that djm was safe with johnson.he elaborated that while johnson had her moments,they were never toward djm.myers stated that johnson does not get physical when she gets angry.rather,according to myers,johnson was like supermom,and myers believed that everything she does was in djm best interest.weitzman also observed the home to be very clean and appropriate and to contain an ample food supply.id.at.
two days later,cps returned to johnson home and the notes reflect what appears to be cps first contact with johnson.while johnson initially refused to grant cps request to speak with djm,she relented somewhat,allowing the caseworker at least to see the child,who indicated that he did not want to be interviewed.id.at.moreover,in contrast to myers earlier characterization of johnson just two days before,myers now stated that this behavior,seemingly referring to johnson obstinate actions towards cps caseworkers,was typical of johnson and very upsetting to djm and to him.id.at.
from june to august,cps caseworkers,including but not limited to weitzman,made multiple further attempts to speak to johnson,who was either not there,not answering the door,or not willing to talk 
the seizure 
on august,johnson was arrested and eventually taken to nassau university medical center numc against her will.weitzman notes comprise the only evidence in the record about that day.
because the notes,written in shorthand,play such a primary role and are terse,we reproduce the relevant section describing the arrest in its entirety,with all emphasis our own 
c ase w orker weitzman contacted police when she arrived at johnson home.myers met with c ase w orker outside of the home.po patterson and po barret t arrived at the home.myers let police and caseworker into the home.johnson was annoyed and stated she and djm were on their way out to an appointment and did not have time to talk.c ase w orker told johnson she the caseworker needed to talk with djm for a few moments.johnson refused.johnson stated that she does always hear the doorbell and denies having strange behavior.po also tried to get johnson to allow c ase w orker to talk to djm.johnson insisted that she had an appointment and got annoyed.johnson stated that the police would have to arrest her if they wanted to have djm interviewed.c ase w orker and police tried to calm johnson down.johnson was very uncooperative.johnson started to act irrational and was telling djm not to talk with c ase w orker.po and c ase w orker agreed that johnson should be sent for a psych eval as her behavior was irrational.police called the nc paramedics.paramedic goldstein ambulance arrived at the home.johnson was evaluated and transported to numc for psych ological eval uation.johnson was uncooperative to paramedic.
c ase w orker manage d to speak with djm briefly.djm stated that johnson makes him meals,or french toast and sandwiches or hot dogs for lunch.djm stated johnson does not hit him.djm was fearful to talk to c ase w orker so c ase w orker ended the interview.
id.at emphasis added.
the caseworker notes thus indicate that johnson,despite denying that her behavior was strange,was perceived to be annoyed,very uncooperative,and irrational,and that the child was fearful of talking to the caseworker.at that point,po and c ase w orker agreed that johnson should be sent for a psych ological eval uation as her behavior was irrational.officer patterson then arrested her.
procedural history 
johnson began this action in.the district court construed her pro se complaint as stating allegations against a large number of individuals,including patterson,based on a violation of her fourth amendment and fourteenth amendment rights.as particularly relevant to the instant appeal,johnson complaint alleged that she was falsely arrested and unlawfully held by po patterson,handcuffed and informed by po patterson that he was placing johnson under arrest,never informed by po patterson why he was arresting johnson,and transported while still in handcuffs to nassau university medical center.complaint at.
with respect to johnson false arrest claim against patterson,the district court concluded 
according to the county defendants,plaintiff was extremely agitated,would not allow weitzman to speak with djm,and displayed increasingly irrational behavior.for example,plaintiff would not allow weitzman to speak with djm unless officers p a tterson and barrett arrested her.based on their assessment of plaintiff behavior,weitzman and the police officers believed that plaintiff was a danger to herself and djm and the police officers therefore decided to send plaintiff to the numc psychiatric unit for a psychiatric evaluation.
johnson,wl,at emphasis added citations omitted 
although johnson filed a statement of material fact responses in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,johnson statement did not,in the district court view,specifically address the material facts or contain citations to the evidence.because,as the district court put it,plaintiff failed to file a proper counterstatement,and had also failed to abide by other procedural rules despite adequate notice,the district court found as true the facts contained in defendants statements to the extent that they are supported by admissible evidence.johnson,wl,at.unsurprisingly,however,johnson counterstatement specifically denied that her conduct demonstrated the risk of harm to herself or others that is necessary to justify the seizure and involuntary hospitalization.
on this basis,the district court found that patterson was entitled to qualified immunity and granted him summary judgment.prior to doing so,the court did,however,determine that the defendant did not provide evidence that either patterson or weitzman witnessed johnson threaten her own life or that johnson manifested homicidal or other violent behavior placing djm at risk of serious physical harm.id.at.
the district court use of homicidal or other violent behavior refers to the language of mental hyg.law,which governs emergency admissions of one who appears to be mentally ill and is conducting himself or herself in a manner which is likely to result in serious harm to the person or others.id.the new york statute further defines likely to result in serious harm such that the legal standard for detention of the parent,by reason of risk of harm to the child,depends on substantial risk of physical harm as manifested by homicidal or other violent behavior by which the child is placed in reasonable fear of serious physical harm.mental hyg.law emphasis added see also kerman city of new york,cir we interpreted new york law as imposing the same objective reasonableness standard that is imposed by the fourth amendment.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this respect,it is significant that the standard for involuntary detention of the parent is different from the standard for removal of the child from the parent.thus,a police officer may take a child into emergency,protective custody,even in the absence of a court order,if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the child is in such circumstance or condition that his or her continuing in said place of residence or in the care and custody of the parent presents an imminent danger to the child life or health.fam.act.and,the risk of harm to the child need not result from violence.but to seize a mentally ill parent,danger of physical violence is needed.
the court nonetheless granted qualified immunity to patterson,concluding that,based on officer patterson observations and the fact that he was accompanying weitzman to plaintiff home as part of a continuing cps investigation of allegations of child neglect,it was objectively reasonable to believe that plaintiff posed a danger to herself and djm.id.at the court also granted motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment on all of johnson claims against the other defendants.
a panel of our court considered johnson appeal and her motions for in forma pauperis ifp status and appointment of counsel that panel dismissed all of her claims except the appeal from the grant of qualified immunity to officer patterson,and,as to that claim,appointed counsel.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact,such that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir.we do so resolving all ambiguities and drawing all factual inferences in plaintiff favor as the party.anthony city of new york,cir.
the fourth amendment guarantees t he right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.this protection adheres whether the seizure is for purposes of law enforcement or due to an individual mental illness.a ssuming that the term mental illness can be given a reasonably precise content and that the mentally ill can be identified with reasonable accuracy,there is still no constitutional basis for confining such persons involuntarily if they are dangerous to no one and can live safely in freedom.rodriguez city of new york,cir quoting donaldson,d alterations omitted.to handcuff and detain,even briefly,a person for reasons,an officer must have probable cause to believe that the person presented a risk of harm to her self or others.kerman city of new york,cir see also green city of,cir likewise requiring a showing of dangerousness for seizure and transportation to a hospital for treatment.
governmental actors,including police officers,enjoy qualified immunity from suit for constitutional violations under.a state actor charged under with violating a plaintiff constitutional rights is entitled to have the action dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity if at the time of the challenged conduct there was no clearly established law that such conduct constituted a constitutional violation.lynch ackley,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.and qualified immunity attaches if it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.lennon miller,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in the context of a false arrest claim,qualified immunity protects an officer if he had arguable probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.garcia does,cir.arguable probable cause exists if either a it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed,or b officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.escalera lunn,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,an officer lacks arguable probable cause and is not entitled to qualified immunity only where no officer of reasonable competence could have made the same choice in similar circumstances.lennon,at.the doctrine of qualified immunity serves to protect police from liability and suit when they are required to make judgments in tense circumstances and when their actions could reasonably be seen as lawful.id.at.
kerman city of new york makes clear that,to determine whether a seizure is justified by arguable probable cause,a court must review the specific observations and information available to the officers at the time of a seizure.in that case,this court reversed a grant of qualified immunity at the stage for a plaintiff detention and subsequent hospitalization.officers had responded to an anonymous call stating that a mentally ill man was off his medication,acting crazy,and possibly had a gun.kerman,at.after an detention of kerman and search of his apartment,it was clear that there was no firearm.id.at.the police nonetheless continued to detain kerman and transported him to bellevue hospital.id.at.
in reversing the district court and remanding for further proceedings,we emphasized that while the police may have been entitled to hospitalize kerman if his conduct or the condition of his apartment demonstrated a dangerous mental state,there were genuine disputes as to those material facts.the police claimed that kerman was ranting and raving and that the apartment was,as the district court put it,a veritable augean stable,whereas kerman,in contrast,claimed he was acting in a calm,if irritated,manner and that the apartment was,at worst,untidy.id.at.this court remanded for jury factfinding to resolve precisely what the officers could have observed of kerman home and behavior.
we can not affirm the distri
