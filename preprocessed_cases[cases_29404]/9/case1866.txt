in,after five years of employment as an employee assistance program consultant in carilion behavioral health unit,appellant neil demasters allegedly was fired for acting contrary to his employer best interests,failing to take the side,and leaving his employer in a compromised position,as a result of his support of a fellow employee sexual harassment complaint and his criticism of the way the employer had handled the investigation.demasters brought suit against carilion clinic,carilion medical center,and carilion behavioral health,collectively,carilion,claiming that he was terminated for engaging in protected activity,including opposing an unlawful employment practice,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.the district court dismissed demasters complaint,primarily on the grounds that no individual activity in which demasters engaged by itself constituted protected oppositional conduct and that the manager rule,in any event,prevented an employee whose job responsibilities included reporting discrimination claims from seeking protection under title vii provision.as we now hold that the proper test for analyzing oppositional conduct requires consideration of the employee course of conduct as a whole and that the manager rule has no place in title vii jurisprudence,we will reverse and remand for demasters to proceed with his suit.
demasters began working in july as an employee assistance program eap consultant for carilion,a large healthcare organization that owns and operates several hospitals in october,demasters was consulted by john doe,a carilion employee who had been referred to the eap for help.at this meeting,doe revealed that his department manager had been harassing him for the last several months and described how his manager had masturbated in front of him twice on hospital grounds,asked doe for oral sex,and asked doe to display his genitals.doe also offered that he had physical evidence of the harassment.
after hearing doe out,demasters opined that doe was a victim of sexual harassment in violation of carilion sexual harassment policy and formulated a plan with doe to report the harassment and facilitate the investigation of doe complaint.to assist doe with this reporting and investigation,demasters suggested that doe sign a release form that authorized demasters to communicate with carilion human resources hr department directly on doe behalf.that same day,demasters put this plan in motion by contacting the hr department,relaying the substance of doe complaint,and thereby initiating the investigation of doe alleged sexual harassment.once carilion began to investigate the matter and took a statement from doe,it fired the harasser and told doe that this individual would never be allowed back on hospital property.
a few days later,however,demasters received a distressed call from doe,who had learned that the harasser had been permitted by doe department director to come back to the hospital to collect his belongings.demasters then scheduled another meeting with doe for the following day.at that meeting,doe explained that he felt uncomfortable with the department director and was facing increasing hostility from aligned with the harasser.to ascertain how best he could assist doe with this increasingly hostile workplace,demasters convened a meeting of his eap colleagues,who agreed that demasters should contact carilion hr department to offer suggestions as to how it might better handle the situation,including by intervening to stop the hostile behavior by the harasser friends.demasters followed through on this plan by calling and leaving a message for an hr representative who called him back the next day.
in that conversation,after confirming that the hr representative was aware that doe was being subjected to harassing behavior from his,demasters offered to coach carilion hr department about better ways to respond to doe concerns.the hr representative declined and stated that he would speak with the department director.however,several days later,doe reported to demasters that his behavior was getting worse,that he was dissatisfied with management reaction to his complaint,and that he feared his harasser would come looking for him with a gun.in response,demasters offered his opinion that carilion management and hr department had been mishandling doe complaints.demasters also reached out to carilion hr manager again to say that he felt that carilion was not handling the case properly.
demasters does not allege any subsequent contact with doe or activity on doe behalf and apparently was unaware of the legal remedies pursued by doe over the next two years.in,however,one of carilion managers called demasters and informed him that doe had filed a title vii complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and was pursuing a civil suit for sexual harassment against carilion.in that conversation,the manager pressed demasters on his involvement with doe harassment complaint.demasters acknowledged that doe had been to the eap but did not reveal any details of demasters own involvement with doe internal complaints.the manager told demasters that he might expect to hear more from carilion on the matter.
that he did.within a few weeks of doe and carilion reaching a settlement,demasters was called to a meeting with several of carilion managers,including the vice president of hr,the eap department director,and corporate counsel.when demasters asked at the outset if he could have counsel present,he was told that if he persisted he would be considered insubordinate and would be terminated.the carilion managers then proceeded to ask demasters about doe sexual harassment complaint and specifically whether demasters told doe that what happened to him was sexual harassment.when demasters acknowledged sharing his view that doe was a victim of sexual harassment,the managers asked demasters why he had not taken the side and if he understood the magnitude of the liability the company could face if one of its supervisors had engaged in harassment.the managers also told demasters that he had not protected carilion interests and that he had left carilion in a compromised position.the eap department director likewise accused demasters of fail ing to protect carilion and plac ing the entire operation at risk.id.
two days after this meeting,carilion fired demasters.carilion letter to demasters,explaining the reasons for his termination,stated that demasters had fail ed to perform or act in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of carilion clinic.id.separately,the eap department director sent demasters a letter stating that he was being fired because he made statements that could reasonably have led doe to conclude that he should file suit against carilion failed to perform or act in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of carilion clinic made multiple statements that were contrary to his employer best interests and that required disciplinary action and failed to protect carilion eap client company,in this case also the employing organization,carilion.id.this letter concluded that the eap contractor was very fortunate to be able to maintain this company as the entire operation was at risk for the actions of one consultant.id.by way of further explanation,demasters direct supervisor in the eap told him that carilion was angry at having to settle doe discrimination lawsuit and was looking to throw somebody under the bus.id.
after filing a charge of discrimination with the eeoc and receiving a notice of right to sue,demasters timely filed a complaint in the district court for the western district of virginia.in that complaint,demasters claimed that carilion terminated his employment in violation of title vii provision,under various legal theories,including that he was fired in violation of title vii opposition clause,which forbids retaliation against an employee who oppose s any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.a 
the district court granted carilion motion to dismiss,concluding that demasters failed to raise plausible allegations that he engaged in protected activity under the opposition clause because the conversations that took place between demasters and doe about the alleged discrimination did not constitute purposive communications from demasters to doe employer,carilion demasters communications to carilion merely reflected transmissions of doe complaints and not demasters own opposition to unlawful activity and demasters criticisms of the way carilion handled the investigation did not oppose activity that itself was unlawful under title vii.in addition,the district court held that,under the manager rule,even if the activity were otherwise protected,demasters could not avail himself of that protection because he was acting within the scope of his job duties as an eap consultant in counseling doe and communicating with carilion.the district court therefore dismissed demasters complaint for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.this timely appeal followed.

while it is undisputed that the second element is satisfied,the district court in effect held that demasters did not plead either the first or third elements because he did not engage in protected activity under title vii opposition clause and thus was not terminated on that basis.we conclude that the district court erred,first,by examining demasters communications as if they were each discrete incidents rather than as a continuous course of oppositional conduct and,second,by applying the manager rule to demasters title vii retaliation claim.we address these issues in turn.
the district court examined each of demasters communications in a discrete fashion,analyzing separately demasters conversations with doe,demasters communication of doe complaints to carilion,and demasters criticism to carilion of its internal investigation,and concluded that no act by itself constituted protected activity.neither the text nor the purpose of title vii is served by this method of parsing a continuous course of oppositional conduct into individual acts and assessing those acts in isolation.
title vii opposition clause,by its terms,prohibits retaliation against an employee who has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.a.the supreme court has defined oppose in this context by looking to its ordinary meaning to resist or antagonize to contend against to confront resist withstand,to be hostile or adverse to,as in opinion.crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson,internal citations omitted quoting webster new international dictionary ed random house dictionary of the english language ed.this broad definition led the court to conclude that the threshold for oppositional conduct is not onerous.instead,w hen an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in a form of employment discrimination,that communication virtually always constitutes the employee opposition to the activity.crawford,at internal quotation marks omitted citing eeoc compliance manual ii b.
this circuit,as well as the other courts of appeals,also has articulated an expansive view of what constitutes oppositional conduct,recognizing that it encompasses utilizing informal grievance procedures as well as staging informal protests and voicing one opinions in order to bring attention to an employer discriminatory activities.laughlin metro.airports,cir see also collazo bristol myers squibb,cir recognizing that even conduct may constitute protected activity barrett whirlpool,cir protected activity includes complain ing about unlawful practices to a manager,the union,or other employees moore city of philadelphia,cir quoting curay cramer ursuline acad.of wilmington,cir protected activity covers informal protests of discriminatory employment practices,including making complaints to management mcdonnell cisneros,cir protected activity includes endeavoring to obtain an employer compliance with title vii.
and while the oppositional activity must be directed to an unlawful employment practice under title vii,a,this circuit recent en banc opinion in boyer liberto made clear that we should also interpret unlawful employment practice broadly.at.thus,an employee is protected when she opposes not only employment actions actually unlawful under title vii but also employment actions she reasonably believes to be unlawful,and the title vii violation to which the oppositional communication is directed may be complete,or it may be in progress.id.alterations in original quoting eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir.
in sum,nothing in the language of the opposition clause nor in its interpretation by the courts supports a myopic analysis under which an employee opposition must be evaluated as a series of discrete acts.a.on the contrary,as the third circuit has observed in a similar context,t hese determinations depend on the totality of the circumstances,as a play can not be understood on the basis of some of its scenes but only on its entire performance,and similarly,a discrimination analysis must concentrate not on individual incidents,but on the overall scenario.moore,at second alteration in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,in collazo,where the plaintiff had arranged meetings with the hr department for a and then complained to hr about problems with his company ongoing internal investigation of the complaint,the first circuit,reviewing the full range of the plaintiff conduct,held that his persistent efforts to help the victim initiate her sexual harassment complaint and urge human resources to act upon that complaint constituted protected opposition activity.id.at.
this holistic approach is also consistent with the broad remedial purpose of title vii to root out the cancer of discrimination in the workplace.boyer liberto,at quoting jordan alt.res,cir king,dissenting.this is particularly so in the retaliation context,where title vii must be read to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for even victims of,or discrimination,because effective enforcement could only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.id.at alterations in original quoting burlington,at see also thompson,at title vii antiretaliation provision prohibits any employer action that well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.quoting burlington,at.acknowledging and protecting activities that,viewed as a whole,oppose unlawful discrimination will promote the prompt and full reporting on which title vii enforcement depends.
we conclude from this review of the statute and case law that we must examine the course of a plaintiff conduct through a panoramic lens,viewing the individual scenes in their broader context and judging the picture as a whole.although individual acts may be scrutinized to ascertain their nature,purpose,and nexus to the alleged objective,the touchstone is whether the plaintiff course of conduct as a whole communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in a form of employment discrimination,crawford,at and concerns subject matter that is actually unlawful under title vii or that the employee reasonably believes to be unlawful,boyer liberto,at.
applying these criteria to the allegations here,we are satisfied that demasters has alleged that he engaged in protected oppositional activity.first,the complaint describes a course of conduct by demasters that clearly and effectively conveyed to carilion over several weeks his belief that carilion was violating title vii by subjecting doe to unlawful conduct.see crawford,at.as alleged,demasters became doe leading advocate and adviser from the day doe first told demasters about his manager harassing behavior,and demasters persisted in his advocacy on doe behalf as carilion investigated the complaint.demasters generated a plan with doe to report the harassment and to galvanize carilion internal investigation,arranged for doe to sign a release so that he could speak directly with hr on doe behalf,and relayed doe harassment complaint to hr,leading to the termination of the harasser.upon learning that doe was facing increasing hostility from who sympathized with the harasser,demasters consulted with his eap colleagues and formulated another plan to try to draw carilion attention to the hostile workplace and to improve the situation.he then reached out to the hr department,ensured that an hr representative aware of the hostility confronting doe,and offered eap services to coach the hr department on how to respond more effectively.and when doe reported that the hostile environment was only intensifying,demasters shared his opinion that carilion was mishandling the matter not only with doe but also with carilion hr manager.
the district court concluded these allegations did not reflect protected activity because demasters,by not complain ing himself of workplace discrimination or other unlawful employment practices and m erely ferrying doe allegations to carilion human relations department,did not engage in purposive conduct.in imposing this requirement,the district court relied on this circuit unpublished opinion in pitrolo,where the panel held,consistent with justice alito concurrence in crawford,that opposition should be limited to purposive conduct.pitrolo cty.of buncombe,wl,at cir,unpublished quoting crawford,at alito,concurring.while the crawford majority defined oppose to include to be hostile or adverse to,as in opinion,crawford,at,justice alito described this part of the definition as dictum,observed that the term other meanings reflected purposive conduct,and expressed concern that extending the definition to silent opposition for example,by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers would be excessive and impractical,id.at alito,concurring.
we need not decide today on the vitality of a purposive ness requirement however,because,with the term purposive properly construed,demasters conduct would easily qualify in any event.the district court took purposive to mean that the protections of the opposition clause are limited to an employee who directly communicate s to her employer her own experiences with discrimination in the workplace,and that the complaining employee must not only intend to relay a complaints to his employer,but also must voice his own opposition to any unlawful employment practice.it was mistaken.although justice alito sought to distinguish silent opposition and to limit the protection of the opposition clause to conduct that was active and purposive,he was in full agreement with the majority that oppositional conduct need not be instigated or initiated by the employee,and that an employee communication to his employer about a belief that the employer has engaged in discrimination virtually always constitutes the employee opposition to the activity.crawford,at alito,concurring internal quotation marks omitted.
here,no one could mistake demasters alleged activities for silent opposition.on the contrary,he asserts that he actively and deliberately communicated to carilion both doe complaints and demasters own opinion that these complaints were not properly handled,offered to share ideas about how they could be better handled,and,like the plaintiff in collazo,made persistent efforts to help doe initiate his discrimination complaint and urge human resources to act upon that complaint.collazo,at.thus,even assuming a threshold requirement that conduct be purposive to be protected under the opposition clause,demasters allegations easily clear that hurdle.
having concluded that demasters alleged course of conduct,viewed as a whole,communicate d to his employer a belief that the employer has engaged in a form of employment discrimination,crawford,at,we now address the second part of our test the subject matter to which this conduct was directed.here,too,the complaint is sufficient.demasters plausibly alleged that he directed his communications to practices that were actually unlawful or that,at a minimum,he reasonably believe d to be unlawful,boyer liberto,at quoting navy,at,the sexual harassment to which doe originally was subjected,see meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,and the emerging retaliatory hostile work environment to which doe was later subjected as a result of carilion alleged mishandling of the matter,see boyer liberto,at protected conduct includes oppos ing a hostile work environment that,although not fully formed,is in progress noviello city of boston,cir d iscriminate in the clause includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment.
to the extent the district court focused on demasters criticism of carilion investigation or handling of doe complaints,as opposed to the hostile environment resulting from those activities,it again framed the issue too narrowly.the district court relied heavily on brush sears holdings,app x cir,which stated that the plaintiff disagreement with the way in which her employer conducted its internal investigation into a allegations of sexual harassment and rape does not constitute protected activity.id.at.we do not find brush to be persuasive.whatever weight it may carry as an unpublished opinion from another circuit,there was no allegation in that case,as there is here,that the plaintiff reasonably believed the way the employer was handling the matter was itself responsible for an unlawful employment practice,in this case,a retaliatory hostile work environment.at the time of its decision,the district court also did not have the benefit of this circuit decision in boyer liberto,which made clear that an employee is protected from retaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when she reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in progress,with no requirement for additional evidence that a plan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is likely to occur.at.we conclude that demasters actions as a whole constitute protected activity and that he thus has pleaded the first element of a prima facie case for a title vii retaliation claim.
we also have no difficulty concluding that demasters sufficiently pleaded the third and only remaining contested element a causal connection between that protected activity and the termination of demasters employment.two days before firing him,carilion management objected to demasters conduct,confronting him at a meeting about why he had not taken the side,asking if he understood the liability the company could face if its supervisor had engaged in harassment,and asserting that he had not protected carilion interests and had left it in a compromised position.in the very letter that purported to justify his termination,carilion reiterated that demasters had acted contrary to his employer best interests,had made statements that could reasonably have led john doe to conclude that he should file suit against carilion,and had failed to protect carilion eap client company.even at oral argument,carilion seemed to acknowledge that it retaliated against demasters for his opposition activity,with counsel conceding that demasters was fired because he rocked the boat.transcript of oral argument at argued.
