we consider the question of whether the is an employee within the meaning of the civil rights act of,et title vii,and new york human rights law,exec.law,et nyhrl.we hold that,in determining whether a worker is an employee within the meaning of title vii and the nyhrl,courts ordinarily should place particular weight on the extent to which the hiring party controls the manner and means by which the worker completes her assigned tasks,rather than on how she is treated for tax purposes or whether she receives benefits.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
unless otherwise noted,the following facts are not disputed.in july,julianne eisenberg ran into an old acquaintance,peter white,who was accompanied by another man,mike ewing.both men worked at advance relocation storage,advance,a danbury,connecticut was involved in advance hiring process,and ewing was the warehouse manager.the men discussed with eisenberg the possibility of her working on a permanent basis at advance.they did not inquire into any special skills that eisenberg may have had,and they did not ask about her prior work experiences.instead,eisenberg believed,the men were interested in her working at the warehouse because white knew that she was strong,having played football with her,and that she had been doing carpentry work for many years.
soon after her conversation with white and ewing,eisenberg reported for work at advance.there,she and her were responsible for loading and unloading furniture from trucks at the warehouse and at residences.they were paid on an hourly basis,and were required to punch in and out.eisenberg and her were occasionally sent home early if there was little to do,and they were sometimes asked to work on the weekend.
at the warehouse,pete was the boss he gave eisenberg orders,and if he was not going to be at the warehouse on a particular day,he told her on the prior day where to go and what to do.at job sites,an advance,ewing,or someone else would direct the crew as to what objects each crew member,including eisenberg,was to move.
eisenberg claims that during much of the time that she worked at advance,she was sexually harassed.she asserts that on september,she complained about this alleged sexual harassment to joan isaacson,the advance office manager eisenberg also alleges that she told isaacson that she had seen several advance employees using cocaine in the warehouse.
the warehouse was closed by management the next day.eisenberg then met again with isaacson,at which point isaacson allegedly told her that she would receive a job when the warehouse,and would be contacted and told when to return to work.isaacson then assertedly advised eisenberg that she would not receive a job at advance if,based on her allegations of sexual harassment,she sought legal counsel or filed a complaint.undeterred,eisenberg hired an attorney and initiated this action.she claims that she has not been called by issacson or anyone else at advance regarding a position at the firm.
eisenberg complaint alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment at advance,that her termination from the firm was discriminatory,and that defendants retaliated against her for complaining about the violation of her right to be free of sexual in violation of title vii and the nyhrl.following discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted their motion,holding that eisenberg was not an advance employee,and thus could not invoke the protections of title vii or the nyhrl.see eisenberg advance relocation and storage,d.judgment was entered accordingly,and this timely appeal followed.
title vii and the nyhrl cover employees,not independent contractors.see davis,cir title vii scott massachusetts mut.life ins,the nyhrl.for the purposes of these statutes,a decision on whether a worker is an employee or whether he or she is merely an independent the application of the common law of agency.see,at title vii tagare nynex network,the nyhrl collecting new york cases.in turn,whether a hired person is an employee under the common law of agency depends largely on the thirteen factors articulated by the supreme court in community for creative reid,d see,at tagare.at noting that the factors consulted to determine whether a hired party is an employee under the nyhrl largely mirror those weighed in title vii claims collecting cases.these reid factors,which are culled from the federal common law of agency,see reid,at,are as follows 
the hiring party right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished the skill required the source of the instrumentalities and tools the location of the work the duration of the relationship between the parties whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party the extent of the hired party discretion over when and how long to work the method of payment the hired party role in hiring and paying assistants whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party whether the hiring party is in business the provision of employee benefits and the tax treatment of the hired party.

in balancing the reid factors,a court must disregard those factors that,in light of the facts of a particular case,are irrelevant or of indeterminate is,those factors that are essentially in equipoise and thus do not meaningfully cut in favor of either the conclusion that the worker is an employee or the conclusion that he or she is an independent contractor.see aymes bonelli,cir see also langman fabrics graff californiawear,cir not all the reid factors will be significant in every case,and we must weigh in the balance only those factors that are actually indicative of agency in the particular circumstances before us.
the court is then required to assess each of the remaining factors.though no single factor is dispositive,see reid,at,the greatest emphasis should be placed on the first is,on the extent to which the hiring party controls the manner and means by which the worker completes his or her assigned tasks.see frankel,at noting that under the common law agency test outlined in reid,the greatest emphasis is placed on the hiring party right to control the manner and means by which the work is accomplished the first factor is entitled to this added weight because,under the common law of agency,an relationship exists if the purported employer controls or has the right to control both the result to be accomplished and the manner and means by which the purported employee brings about that result.hilton int l nlrb,cir see railroad hanning,wall.collecting cases and authorities that apply this control rule performing right soc y,mitchell and booker,collecting and early century english cases that apply the rule and treatises that describe it cilecek inova health,cir at root,the distinction at common law between an employee and an independent contractor rests on the degree of control exercised by the hiring party.frankel,at observing that the traditional test for determining whether a worker is an employee of independent contractor focuses primarily on the hiring party right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished internal quotation marks and citations omitted local,democratic union org.comm.nlrb,control exercised over the manner and means of performance,is the identifying characteristic of an relationship.in re morton,applying the general concept that the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor turns on the right of control over the worker in respect of the manner in which his work is to be done see also restatement second of agency cmt.d stating that control or right to control the physical conduct of the person giving service is important and in many situations is determinative of whether that person is an employee or independent contractor warren seavy,agency,at observing that the right to control the physical movements of the employee is typically the most important single element tieberg unemployment ins.appeals,cal d,holding that t he right to control the means by which the wor
