opinion of the court 
this appeal presents the issue of whether a state affirmative duty under the due process clause to care for and protect a mental health patient in state custody depends upon the individual custody being involuntary.contrary to the district court resolution of this issue,we conclude that the state does not owe the affirmative duties of care and protection first enunciated in youngberg romeo,d,to those individuals who are free to leave state custody.we will affirm the district court order denying appellants claim to qualified immunity,however,because resolution of that claim should await fuller development of the record.
the plaintiffs are the guardians of twenty adult individuals with mental retardation who formerly resided at western center,a mental retardation institution operated by pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw on april,dpw closed western center and transferred its remaining residents,including the plaintiffs in the present litigation,to privately operated facilities.at the time of the closing,the plaintiffs were unwilling to be transferred to placement in community facilities of any type,medically and developmentally inappropriate for community placement,medically and mentally fragile,especially when removed from their familiar institutional surroundings,in need of continuous care by multidisciplinary staff,and in need of continuity of placement stability,and therapeutic access to family.am.compl.
in the course of the transfer,a physical blockade was set up by state police at western center to separate plaintiffs from their parents,guardians,relatives and other loved ones.id.at.against each plaintiff will,each was prevented from making physical contact with any individual on the other side of the blockade was ordered into and placed within a bus or van at western center,and was then transported to various placements several hours away.id.at.plaintiffs allege that state employees utilized p hysical and psychological force and that the plaintiffs suffered severe physical and psychological damage in the forced,involuntary transfer from western center.id.at.
the plaintiffs,through their guardians,filed suit in the middle district of pennsylvania alleging violations of and other federal and state statutes.in their complaint,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated their constitutional life and liberty interest in appropriate placement and appropriate medical and therapeutic treatment from the state of pennsylvania.id.at.they further allege that the individually named defendants,including feather houston,the secretary of dpw,and nancy thaler,the deputy secretary,were personally responsible for the decision to transfer each plaintiff.id.at.
based on these allegations,plaintiffs sought injunctive relief under the due process clause.in count v,the only claim currently before us,the plaintiffs sought monetary damages from the individual defendants thaler and houston based on the same due process violation.
the defendants moved to dismiss,asserting,inter alia,that defendants houston and thaler were protected by qualified immunity from plaintiffs damage claims.the district court viewed the issue as whether the substantive due process rights to care and protection possessed by involuntarily committed residents in state facilities under youngberg romeo,d,are clearly established as extending to voluntarily committed persons.app.at.the district court concluded that it was clearly established that such due process protections do extend to those who are voluntarily committed and denied the motion.we will affirm the order of the district court,albeit for a different reason.
after houston and thaler filed this interlocutory appeal,the plaintiffs failed to enter an appearance or file a brief.houston and thaler are entitled to pursue their appeal,however,and we are required to proceed without the benefit of an appellee brief.united states everett,cir if an appellee after proper notice fails to file a brief,then we may decide the case on the brief of the appellant only.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice procedure at ed fed.c.
the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs constitutional claims under.we have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of qualified immunity pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.rouse plantier,cir mitchell forsyth,d in reviewing a denial of qualified immunity at the rule b stage of litigation,we accept the plaintiffs allegations as true and draw all inferences in their favor.larsen senate of com.of,cir.
the officials assert qualified immunity with respect to the plaintiffs damage claims brought under.they will be entitled to such immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.wilson layne,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.a court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all,and if so,proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of alleged violation.id.quoting conn gabbert,d.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.on the other hand,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.saucier katz,d.this second inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case.id.
as a threshold matter,we note that we,like the district court,read the damage claims before us as resting solely on the substantive due process rights of care and protection recognized in youngberg romeo,d.youngberg addresses only the extent to which the due process clause imposes upon the state an affirmative duty to care for,treat,and protect persons in its custody.id.at.we hasten to note that the due process clause,of course,also forecloses the state under some circumstances from taking affirmative action that deprives citizens of interests in life or liberty,regardless of their custodial status.as we pointed out in fialkowski greenwich home for children,cir,residents of state institutions whose circumstances do not qualify them for protection under youngberg nevertheless possess other substantive due process rights to be free of certain state interference in their lives because the complaint and,indeed,the briefs before us and in the district court,rely solely on the rights mandated by youngberg,nothing we say about the significance of the voluntary or involuntary nature of confinement in this context is relevant in the context of other substantive due process rights of voluntarily committed persons.
in youngberg,the supreme court held that when the state deprives an individual of liberty through involuntary commitment proceedings,it undertakes an affirmative obligation to confine the individual under conditions of reasonable care and safety that are reasonably nonrestrictive and to provide the individual with such training as may be required by these interests.at.the court noted that s uch conditions of confinement would comport fully with the purpose of the individual commitment.see also id.at.citing jackson indiana,d holding due process requires rational relation between nature and duration of commitment and its purpose.
