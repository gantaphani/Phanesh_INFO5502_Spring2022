as a result,on november,in a meeting with hahn and whoi human resource manager,kathleen la bernz,abraham was asked to resign.on that date,hahn also presented abraham with a letter informing him that he could either resign immediately and accept a severance package or continue working with whoi until he found another post doctoral position.the letter indicated that if abraham chose the latter option he could work until no later than january,at which point he must resign hereinafter referred to as the november,letter.

abraham argues that since his employment was terminated on december,and because his proposed amendment would relate back to the filing of his complaint before the district court on december,his claim falls within the three year statute of limitations period.according to abraham,he did not believe he would be terminated at any time prior to december because he thought that he could solve his problems with hahn.specifically,abraham claims that the termination threats were made to force him to renounce his religious beliefs in creation and to accept a belief in evolution as fact rather than theory 
essentially,abraham argues that the three year statute of limitations period commenced when he finally understood that he was terminated.however,as mentioned above,under ricks the limitation period commences at the time the adverse employment decision is made and communicated to the employee.ricks,at.in the present case,the three year statute of limitations period began to accrue when he was given notice that he would no longer be working with whoi.we find that abraham had such notice before december.first,we note that the november,letter indicated to abraham that he could either resign immediately and receive a severance package or continue working up to january.in his mcad complaint,abraham acknowledged that he received this notice when he stated that he was asked to resign on november.additionally,on november,hahn informed abraham that there would be no reconsideration of his staying at whoi.furthermore,on that date,abraham was given a general release,which indicated that he had to voluntarily resign within days in order to receive a severance package.the release document was read to abraham at a meeting on november,and on that date,abraham was also handed a set of options all of which involved termination from employment no later than january.thus,in the month of november,abraham received at least four unequivocal termination notices.an employee in this situation could not reasonably conclude that whoi would not go through with the termination.
abraham seeks to convince this court otherwise by arguing that it was reasonable for him to think that the notices were bluffs,a mere tactic used to force him to renounce his religious beliefs in creation and to accept a belief in evolution
