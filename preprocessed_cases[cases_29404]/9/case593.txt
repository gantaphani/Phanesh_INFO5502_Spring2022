gloria garcía and juan sifre appeal from a judgment dismissing their employment discrimination lawsuit.questioning our jurisdiction,we asked the parties to brief the timeliness of this appeal.after reviewing the parties submissions,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely.
on march,appellants brought this lawsuit alleging that garcía was constructively terminated from her employment.the complaint alleged that garcía employer,frito lay snacks caribbean,and her supervisors,jose luis prado and enrique niño,discriminated against her in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,see et the equal pay act,see d and the americans with disabilities act the ada,et on september,the district court entered a partial judgment dismissing the suit against the supervisors because the federal statutes do not provide for individual liability.on march,after the conclusion of discovery,the court entered a second partial judgment dismissing all of the federal claims against frito lay except for appellants ada claim.
on july,frito lay filed a memorandum of law alerting the court that,in its view,two recent appellate decisions compelled the dismissal of appellants ada claim.on august,the court instructed frito lay and appellants to brief the effect of these new decisions on the pending ada claim.the court treated this briefing as another motion for summary judgment.see garcía frito lay caribbean,d.on december,the court granted frito lay motion and entered a final judgment dismissing the ada claim and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the puerto rico law claims.id.at.on january,appellants filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,see.e,which the court denied on june.the next day,june,appellants filed a notice of appeal,which we shall assume was sufficiently specific to challenge the december,judgment and the june,order denying the rule e motion.see in re spookyworld,cir.
in every case,we are required to satisfy ourselves of jurisdiction.see,cir.as we shall explain,the jurisdictional question here is whether appellants june,notice of appeal was timely as to the december,judgment.
a private party in a civil case generally must file his or her notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the order or judgment from which he or she appeals.see fed.a.compliance with this rule is mandatory and jurisdictional.browder.dep t of,d internal quotations and citations omitted.however,fed.a a tolls the running of this period until after the disposition of certain timely filed motions,including a motion under.e.id.emphasis supplied.an untimely motion for reconsideration under rule e will not toll the running of the notice of appeal period.see feinstein moses,cir.because appellants filed their notice of appeal approximately six months after the december,judgment,appellate jurisdiction exists only if the notice of appeal period was tolled by the rule e motion.
rule e provides an aggrieved party with ten days after the entry of judgment to file a motion to alter or amend the judgment.this period does not include intermediate weekends and legal holidays.see.a as noted above,the district court entered judgment on december.excluding the weekends and holidays mentioned in rule a that occurred during this period results in the motion being due on january,the day before appellants filed their rule e motion.the motion was therefore untimely.
appellants do not dispute this line of analysis but contend that new year eve also should be counted as a legal holiday under rule a because the clerk office was closed for business by order of the chief judge.we disagree.new year eve is not listed in rule a,see supra at,and there is no record evidence that it was appointed a holiday by the president or congress,or by the governor or legislature of puerto rico.see.
appellants urge us to read rule a to encompass days in which the clerk office is closed for business by order of the chief judge.but the plain language of the rule precludes such a reading.the rule,on its face,refers to a legal holiday as a day appointed by the president,congress,or the relevant state.it does not grant this power to the federal judiciary.
our view of the matter is supported by the case law.the tenth circuit has interpreted the identical legal holiday definition in fed.not to encompass the day after thanksgiving because,even though the kansas state courts were closed pursuant to an order issued by the chief justice of kansas,it was not a legal holiday in kansas.see in re cascade oil,cir per curiam see also kirby,wl,at,aff,wl cir,holding that christmas eve and new year eve were not legal holidays under rule a even though the district court was closed pursuant to administrative order on both days penney,cir holding that day honoring eugenio maría de hostos is legal holiday under rule a because it is declared a holiday under the statutes of puerto rico per curiam.our conclusion is also supported by the fact that jurisdictions wishing to count the days on which the clerk office is closed as legal holidays have enacted local rules to this effect.for example,instead of relying on the legal holiday definition contained in the federal rules,the federal circuit has adopted a local rule stating that l egal holiday also means a day on which the clerk office is closed by order of the court or the chief judge.see fed.cir.a emphasis supplied.
appellants make two additional arguments in an attempt to save their appeal.first,they claim that their rule e motion should be treated as timely because they spoke with an unnamed individual in the clerk office who told them that new year eve was a holiday.second,they contend that we should ignore the late notice of appeal because the district court addressed the rule e motion on its merits.we are not persuaded by either argument.
in making their first argument,appellants invoke the doctrine of unique circumstances.this doctrine permits the court to entertain a appeal in certain cases.see air line pilots ass precision valley aviation,cir.the doctrine was first recognized by the supreme court in thompson ins,d per curiam,but its continuing vitality has been questioned,see davignon clemmey,cir citing cases.in any event,this circuit continues to apply the doctrine,but only in rare situations.see scola beaulieu,cir air line pilots,at united states heller,cir.
to the extent it remains viable,the doctrine applies only where a party has performed an act which,if properly done,would postpone the deadline for filing the appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done.osterneck ernst whitney,d under this standard,appellants contention that we could entertain their appeal because the person who answered the phone in the clerk office advised that december,would be a holiday fails for two reasons.
first,appellants were never told that,because december,was a holiday,the time for filing their rule e motion would be extended.they were told only that the clerk office was closed for new year eve.thus,appellants never received the required specific assurance that their motion would be timely if filed on january.see osterneck,at.rejecting unique circumstances claim where court never affirmatively represented to plaintiffs that their appeal was timely filed heller,at stating that courts apply unique circumstances doctrine only where a court has affirmatively assured a party that its motion will be timely.second,appellants did not receive any assurance from a judicial officer.see heller,at the unique circumstances doctrine requires that the assurance be made by a judge,not an employee in the office of the clerk.thus,the unique circumstances doctrine simply does not apply.id.at.
in presenting their second argument,appellants ask that we follow city of hartford chase,cir b ecause the district court entertained the rule e motion and ruled on its merits,the time for appeal may begin to run anew from the date on which the court disposed of the untimely application.internal quotations marks omitted.we decline to follow chase for several reasons.
first is the supreme court decision in browd
