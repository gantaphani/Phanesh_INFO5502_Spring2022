opinion of the court 
plaintiff timothy burgh,an african american male,applied for a job as a police officer with the borough of montrose pennsylvania police department.he was not hired for the position,which was filled by a white male with no prior police experience.burgh brought suit against the borough under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and under the pennsylvania human relations act phra,et,alleging that the borough did not hire him because of his race.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the borough and against burgh on both counts,finding that the claims had been filed beyond the applicable statutory limitations periods.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand both claims to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts underlying the instant dispute have not been developed in detail,given the early stage at which the matter was resolved in the district court.burgh complaint is the only pleading in the record and no discovery has been taken.
according to the complaint,in april,burgh applied for a position as a police officer with the borough police department.he updated this job application sometime before june.in april,burgh accepted a position as a police officer in the clifford township pennsylvania police department.clifford township is located approximately miles from burgh home in south montrose.
in june,the montrose police department hired a white male,allegedly with no prior police experience,as a police officer,filling the position that burgh had sought.the montrose police department did not interview burgh for this,or any other,position.burgh alleges that he was more qualified than the person hired and that the department failed to hire him because of his race.
on december,burgh filed a charge of racial discrimination against the borough with the pennsylvania human relations commission phrc under the phra.a the phra claim was filed within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice,the borough failure to hire burgh because of his race.the state administrative complaint was therefore timely.see.h.
burgh requested that his complaint be referred to the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc for dual filing as a title vii charge.the federal claim was accepted and docketed by the eeoc on march.this claim was filed within days of the alleged discriminatory employment practice and it too was timely.see e.on may,the eeoc sent burgh a letter advising him of the filing of his title vii claim.the letter stated that the eeoc would investigate and resolve the charge and that the commission must issue a notice of right sue before burgh could file a court action under title vii.
on march,the phrc sent burgh a letter advising him that it had been one year since he filed his complaint with the phrc and notifying him that he now had the right to bring a private civil action under the phra in the court of common pleas.the letter stated that burgh was not required to file such a private action and that the commission was continuing to process his case and would make every effort to resolve it as soon as possible.if,however,burgh did wish to file in state court,the commission would dismiss the administrative complaint and would not decide the case.the letter further advised burgh to ensure that any complaint was properly filed,particularly that it was timely filed,and to consult an attorney about representing him in court.there is no dispute that burgh received this letter.burgh never filed an action in the court of common pleas.the phrc apparently took no further action on the administrative charge.
sometime prior to october,burgh retained counsel.on october,burgh attorney sent a letter to the eeoc,requesting that the agency issue a letter in light of the pennsylvania commission extended delay in resolving this matter.the eeoc on december,sent a letter to burgh attorney,advising burgh of his right to institute a civil action under title vii within days of receipt of that letter.burgh filed his lawsuit,alleging violations of title vii and the phra,in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.his suit was filed on february,days after the letter was issued.
on may,burgh moved for default judgment this motion was withdrawn by stipulation,dated june.on june,the borough filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,pursuant to.b,contending that,because burgh had brought suit beyond the applicable statutes of limitations,his discrimination claims were untimely.
the district court notified both parties during a case management conference that the motion would be treated as one for summary judgment both parties agreed to rest on their memoranda and neither requested the opportunity to file additional evidence.on november,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.
the district court held first that burgh could not rely on the fact that he had not received a letter from the eeoc prior to december as reason for the delay in filing his action because to accept plaintiff argument we would have to decide we could wait forever to file suit even when the commission takes no action and fails to notify the plaintiff.this flies in the face of the basic reason for a statute of limitations.the court then determined that the issuance of a letter was not a necessary prerequisite to the commencement of a civil action.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied on case law holding that the phrc failure to issue a notice of right to sue after one year does not bar a civil action under the state statute.see rogers mount union borough by zook,citing snyder pennsylvania ass of sch.retirees.the court concluded that each agency should have responded to burgh administrative complaints within one year of filing with that phrc by december,the eeoc by march.the court reasoned that after the passage of one year,burgh could have brought a private civil action on the federal and state claims.as a result,the statute of limitations for each claim began to run on the one year anniversary of its filing with the agency.
the district court went on to determine the period after the anniversary within which a complainant could bring suit.because the court found no specific limitations period in title vii,it decided to borrow a state statute of limitations governing an analogous cause of action.the court held that pennsylvania limitations period for personal injury actions,which has been applied to federal civil rights actions brought under,should govern title vii.the court found a rationale for this conclusion in the fact that both statutes provide redress for employment discrimination.working from march,the anniversary of the referral of the complaint to the eeoc,the court held that burgh had until march,to file suit because he did not file until february,his suit was months late and therefore.
the district court did note that the inaction of the phrc and eeoc was partially to blame for the delays.however,the court held that the filing of the action almost five years after the filing of the first administrative complaint was clearly unreasonable and therefor e untimely.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had original federal question jurisdiction over the title vii claim,pursuant to f and,and supplemental jurisdiction over the phra claim,pursuant to a.we have appellate jurisdiction over the final decision of the district court,pursuant to.
the district court granted summary judgment,which is subject to plenary review,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see pacitti macy,cir ideal dairy farms,john labatt,cir.further,the issue of the proper limitations period under title vii is primarily a legal one,involving the interpretation of federal law,and our review is plenary.see lavia pennsylvania dep t of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see fed.civ.p c dehart horn,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
both title vii and the phra make it unlawful to fail or refuse to hire or employ an individual because of that individual race or color.see a.a.the analysis of the claims is identical.see goosby johnson johnson,cir citing jones school dist.of philadelphia,cir.both statutes also establish administrative remedies and procedures that claimants must exhaust prior to bringing a civil action in court.see.c see also robinson dalton,cir holding,in title vii case,that plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing suit in court clay advanced computer applications,holding that the intended forum for initially addressing phra claims is the phrc bailey storlazzi,holding that plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies under phra prior to bringing case to court.the statutes have slightly different requirements in terms of timing and scope of the administrative remedy.because this case turns on the precise requirements of each statute,an overview of the statutory provisions is helpful.
under title vii,a charge of race discrimination in employment must be filed with the eeoc within days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice.the eeoc must serve notice of the charge on the employer within ten days of the filing of the charge.see e see also occidental life ins.eeoc,d.if the complainant also initiates a complaint with a parallel state agency,as occurred in the instant case,the period for filing the charge with the eeoc is extended to days from the date of the alleged unlawful employment practice.see e.
the eeoc is then required to investigate the charge,see occidental life,at,and the complainant must allow a minimum of days for the eeoc investigation to proceed.see f see also occidental life,at.holding that a private right of action does not arise until days after a charge has been filed.the congressional policy underlying this framework was to resolve discrimination claims administratively through cooperation and voluntary compliance in an informal,noncoercive manner.see occidental life,at.anjelino new york times,cir.
if,after days,the eeoc has not resolved the charge,it must notify the complainant,see f,generally through the issuance of a letter,in which the eeoc states that it sees no reason to take action on the complaint.see waiters parsons,cir.after days,the complainant on his own may also request a letter.the eeoc must issue the letter promptly on request.see a.the receipt of the letter indicates that a complainant has exhausted administrative remedies,an essential element for bringing a claim in court under title vii.see anjelino,at citing ostapowicz johnson bronze,cir the preliminary step of the filing of the eeoc charge and the receipt of the right to sue notification are essential parts of the statutory plan.a complainant may not bring a title vii suit without having first received a letter.see anjelino,at robinson,at.nothing in the statute or the regulations,however,requires a complainant to request a letter or to bring a private suit.nevertheless,if the complainant does choose to bring a private action,it must be filed within days of the date on which the complainant has notice of the eeoc decision not to pursue the administrative charge.see f.the of the period is generally considered to be the date on which the complainant receives the letter.see seitzinger reading hosp.and med,cir mosel hills store,cir per curiam.
both the period for filing the administrative complaint and the period for filing the court action are treated as statutes of limitations.see zipes trans world airlines,d likening requirement of timely filing of administrative charge to statute of limitations figueroa buccaneer hotel,cir same with respect to time for bringing court action after receipt of letter.we have strictly construed the period and held that,in the absence of some equitable basis for tolling,a civil suit filed even one day late is and may be dismissed.see figueroa,at.in our review of this case,we must keep in mind,however,that the statute of limitations does not begin to run unless and until there is final agency action,such as the issuance of a letter.see waiters,at.without that final agency action,the complainant has not exhausted his administrative remedies and can not bring suit.see anjelino,at.
b.the phra 
the phra similarly requires that claims be brought first to an administrative agency,the phrc,which has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim for a period of one year in order to investigate and,if possible,conciliate the matter.see clay,at quoting lukus westinghouse.a complainant may not file an action in court for a period of one year.see clay,at.c.if the phrc does not resolve the administrative charge within one year,the commission must notify the complainant that he may bring an action in the court of common pleas.see.c see also snyder,at holding that where a complainant has not had her grievance resolved by the phrc within one year of filing,she could pursue another course,namely,an action in the judicial system.importantly,and unlike under title vii,notice of the right to sue is not required in order to bring the phra action.instead,after one year has elapsed,a complainant may bring a court action regardless of whether or not he has received a letter from the phrc.see snyder,at.no case law suggests,however,that a complainant must bring the civil action then or at any later time.
moreover,the phra does not limit the time,after receipt of the notice,within which a civil action must be brought.the statute does provide that any civil action must be filed within two years after notice from the phrc that it is closing the complaint.see.c the phrc notice is not,however,the equivalent of notice that the phrc is closing the complaint.a review of the notice sent to burgh illustrates this point.the letter states that burgh was not required to file suit in court,that the commission was continuing to process the case and would make every effort to resolve it as soon as possible,and that only if burgh filed a complaint in state court would the phrc dismiss the complaint.
is there a gap in the title vii limitations periods 
the district court granted summary judgment on burgh title vii claim,applying the pennsylvania statute of limitations to title vii as a and running the limitations period from the date on which burgh could have requested a letter from the eeoc.under this application of limitations,the court found burgh claim to be untimely.
it is that,if congress has created a cause of action and not specified the period of time within which a claim must be asserted,a court may infer that congress intended state limitations periods to apply and may borrow such periods and engraft them onto the federal statute.see occidental life,at.see also id.citing,inter alia,runyon mccrary,d state limitations period applies to civil rights act of,and felix.same as to civil rights act of.we have borrowed personal injury limitations periods from the states and imposed them in both claims,see zubi v.at t,cir,and claims.see nelson county of allegheny,cir.where,however,congress explicitly provides a limitations period in the text of the statute,that period is definitive.there is no need to borrow a state period.see holmberg armbrecht.
contrary to the borough arguments,title vii is not a statute without a limitations period.congress did provide a statutory limitations period for employment discrimination claims in fact,congress provided two periods.first,a complainant has days from the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice within which to bring a discrimination charge before the eeoc,see e,or days where there has been with a state agency under state law.see e.second,a complainant has days from receipt of the letter to bring an action in court.see f see also seitzinger,at mosel,at.both periods have been treated as statutes of limitations.see zipes,at.figueroa,at.the latter limit is strictly enforced and a delay of even one day will bar a claim.see figueroa,at.
these two periods together represent the congressional determination of the relevant and proper time limitations under title vii.the imposition of an additional limitations p
