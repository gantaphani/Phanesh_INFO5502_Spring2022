petitioner franck pierre,a native of haiti,appeals from the june,final decision and order of the board of immigration appeals bia which affirmed the january,decision of immigration judge ij john reid denying pierre application for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.
pierre asserts that he has shown a sufficient likelihood that he will be tortured if he is deported to haiti,because all haitians who are deported from the united states and other countries for criminal conduct are imprisoned indefinitely,and because prison conditions prevailing in haiti amount to torture.he challenges the bia decision in in re,en banc,which held that a haitian petitioner faced with this detention is not entitled to cat relief.he also contends that his case is distinguishable from in re because his medical conditions will be inadequately treated in the haitian prisons.
we deny the petition,and defer to the bia interpretation of the definition of torture under the cat regulations.the failure to maintain standards of diet,hygiene,and living space in prison does not constitute torture under the cat unless the deficits are sufficiently extreme and are inflicted by government actors or by others with government acquiescence intentionally rather than as a result of poverty,neglect,or incompetence.we also affirm the agency conclusion that,based on the record evidence,pierre diabetes does not remove his case from the ambit of in re.
background 
pierre was born in haiti in,and was admitted to the united states in.in august of,pierre was convicted of criminal possession of a firearm in september,he was convicted of grand larceny.for the latter crime,he was sentenced to a period of to months incarceration.
in,the ins charged that pierre was subject to removal under a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,see a g defining aggravated felony to include a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,and under a c as an alien convicted of a firearms offense.pierre conceded removability,but applied for withholding of removal and cat relief.before the ij,he presented documentary evidence concerning the conditions in haiti,as well as his own testimony and that of his pierre diabetes.
the record concerning country conditions in this case is substantially similar to the record in in re and its progeny,and can be summarized as follows.
at one time,haitian government policy had been to briefly detain any haitian deported for having committed crimes in another country release was ordinarily secured within a week.in re,at.in,haiti began to hold such deportees with no timetable for their release.according to a state department country report written in,this policy was instituted to prevent the bandits from increasing the level of insecurity and crime in the country.id.quoting bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,dep t of state,haiti country reports on human rights,available at.the country report.
conditions in haitian prisons are awful.p rison facilities are overcrowded and inadequate p risoners are deprived of adequate food,water,medical care,sanitation,and exercise.many prisoners are malnourished.id.at.a lack of basic hygiene and health care results in elevated morbidity and mortality.id.according to the country report,food and medicine are in short supply,and prisoners receive one meal a day unless their diet is supplemented by nearby family.haitian prison authorities,working with the red cross,have attempted to improve conditions in the country prisons.id.at.
the state department reports that deliberate mistreatment of those arrested or detained by police in haiti is pervasive in all parts of the country,commonly involves b eating with fists,sticks,and belts,and sometimes involves burning with cigarettes,choking,hooding,and kalot marassa severe boxing of the ears,which can result in eardrum damage.id.quoting the country report.
at a january,hearing,pierre sister testified that her brother suffered from type two diabetes and from hypertension,though she herself an emergency room physician with a pediatric specialty had never treated him.according to her testimony,without his diabetes medications and a proper diet,pierre blood sugar levels would become unstable and acute dehydration could induce diabetic even death.she also testified that pierre hypertension,if left untreated,could bring on a stroke.
pierre himself testified as to the circumstances surrounding his criminal convictions and his connections with haiti.pierre last visit to haiti was in,when he got married his wife lives there with her family.as of the date of the hearing,he was corresponding with her by mail.he also testified that his aunt and uncle spend part of the year in haiti and maintain a residence there.
in a january,decision,the ij denied pierre withholding of removal and cat relief.as to the cat,the ij incorporated into his findings by reference the conclusion in in re that there is no evidence that haitian authorities are detaining criminal deportees with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering and the ij found a that pierre medications would be available in haiti,b that his relatives in haiti could supply him with medication,and c that he would neither be prevented from taking the medication nor be denied a fairly prompt release when his family took action.
pierre appealed to the bia both the denial of withholding of removal and the denial of cat relief.the bia denied pierre appeal on june,declining to revisit in re and holding that because pierre had failed to show that the substandard prison conditions in haiti amounted to torture,or that his family would be prevented from giving him medication,he was not entitled to relief under the cat on july,pierre filed a habeas petition in the western district of new york pursuant to provisions of the real id act of,stat,c,the habeas petition was transferred to this court as a petition for relief from a ruling of the bia.
discussion 
at issue in this case is a cat regulation which provides that i n order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.a.in re construed the phrase specifically intended to require a showing of specific intent.pierre argues that the specific intent requirement of in re is an impermissible reading of the cat and of the implementing regulations,and therefore is not entitled to deference.the cat according to pierre requires only general is,the intent to commit an act that foreseeably results in severe pain or suffering.
because pierre is a criminal alien,this court review is limited to constitutional claims and questions of law.see a c d.except in cases where the ij factual findings are themselves based on constitutional or legal raising constitutional claims or questions of law the court does not review the factual findings made by the ij.xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir citing gonzales,cir.we review de novo the bia application of legal principles to undisputed facts.see wangchuck dep t of homeland,cir.but the bia interpretations of immigration regulations are reviewed with substantial deference.id.quoting,at.
the question as to the meaning of torture is presented to us now in the procedural and statutory context of immigration.but we bear in mind that as this opinion demonstrates the wording of the immigration regulations we read is carefully drawn to implement the wording of the cat to the express understandings of the senate when it that the cat is not solely or predominantly concerned with immigration and refoulement the cat binds its signatories to prevent torture within their own borders.any definition of torture adopted by the united states has potential bearing on the obligations of the united states,domestically and abroad,in contexts that transcend our immigration laws.these considerations bear upon our deference to the bia construction of the term torture.great deference is owed to the political branches,which guide the nation efforts to achieve and define domestic compliance and to coordinate with other countries in eradicating torture worldwide.see el al isr.airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d respect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the executive branch concerning the meaning of an international treaty.the deference owed to the bia may be qualified to the extent that its reading of the regulation which mirrors the wording of the cat and the senate understanding of it is a reading of terms that have application outside the context of immigration.
the cat,to which the united states is a signatory,includes a provision that n o state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,opened for signature,art.iii,treaty doc,available at.ch html menu b h cat.htm.
torture is defined by the cat and the immigration regulations as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
a see also cat.torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.a cat.
the cat is not by its own force,it confers no judicially enforceable right on individuals.see wang ashcroft,cir.to implement the cat,congress amended the immigration laws with the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra which announced the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture,div.g,tit.xxii,a,stat,codified at note see auguste ridge,cir.farra directed the appropriate agency the department of justice to issue implementing regulations,and specified that the regulations should define torture as the term is defined in the treaty subject to any reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the convention.farra b,f codified at note,quoted in a see auguste,at.the definition of torture under domestic immigration law,and the scope of an individual entitlement to cat relief,is therefore governed by the text of the cat subject to the terms of the senate ratification resolution.
the senate ratification resolution included the following understanding t he united states understands that,in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering cong.rec,see also convention against torture,declarations and reservations,available at last visited july.the farra regulations use the wording of this understanding in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.a.one ramification of this,as the regulations explain,is that an act is not torture if it results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering.id.
the text of the cat itself recognizes that there are other acts of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture.cat.the regulations also draw this distinction torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.a.
the acts of private individuals may constitute torture under the cat only if there is government acquiescence.see cat.the senate resolution indicates 
t he united states understands that the term acquiescence requires that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.
cong.rec,see khouzam ashcroft,cir discussing the government decision to revise its original understandings to make it clear that both actual knowledge and willful blindness fall within the definition of the term acquiescence quoting exec,at.the regulations incorporate the text of this understanding.see a.
the cat forbids deportation if there are substantial grounds to believe that the deportee will suffer torture at home the senate ratification resolution links this standard to the more likely than not standard used by immigration courts for withholding of removal claims 
t he united states understands the phrase,where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,as used in article of the convention,to mean if it is more likely than not that he would be tortured.
cong.rec.accordingly,the regulations place the burden of proof on the applicant for withholding of removal to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal,c,and mandate withholding or deferral of removal where the applicant meets this burden,c see mu xiang lin dep t of justice,cir.
the issue in this case is whether haiti indefinite detention of criminal deportees amounts to torture in light of the prevailing prison conditions.the bia answered this question in the negative in in re,en banc,and the bia here affirmed the ij denial of relief because pierre medical condition does not distinguish his case from in re.
in re held that detaining criminal deportees in the prison conditions prevailing in haiti does not constitute torture because the prison conditions are not created or maintained with a specific intent to cause severe pain and suffering,but are instead the result of budgetary and management problems as well as the country severe economic difficulties,id.at and that indefinite detention does not amount to torture because it is a lawful sanction,id.at.the bia conceded that there are examples of isolated acts constituting torture in haitian prisons,but concluded that the applicant there presented insufficient evidence to show it was more likely than not that he would be singled out for such treatment.id.at.
pierre argues that the specific intent standard of in re is an impermissible narrowing of the cat,and is therefore not entitled to deference.however,the regulations at issue were drawn by the doj pursuant to a mandate in farra to craft regulations that implement the exact wording of the senate expressed understanding of a treaty.on general principles,this circumstance bespeaks more deference,not less deference to the senate ratification understanding,deference to the framing of the regulations,and deference to an agency interpretation of the regulations.i n construing treaty language,r espect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the executive branch.tachiona united states,cir second alteration in original quoting el al isr.airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d see also sumitomo shoji,avagliano,d although not conclusive,the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.as to the cat regulations where the bia interprets a regulation promulgated by the attorney general under the ina,we afford substantial deference to the bia interpretation,unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,or inconsistent with the agency previous interpretation.zhen nan lin dep t of justice,cir citations omitted.
deference to the bia interpretation of the cat is particularly important when as here claims similar to the petitioner have been advanced by many petitioners before this and other courts,and the issue raises complicated public policy and foreign policy questions.jian hui shao bia,cir citing ins,d j udicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.
the bia decision in in re has commanded deference from several federal courts.see,theagene gonzales,cir auguste,at cadet bulger,cir elien ashcroft,cir thelemaque ashcroft,d.no federal circuit court considering the case of a haitian criminal deportee has declined to follow in re,though there are wrinkles in the third circuit 
in the case of a congolese petitioner,the third circuit distinguished in re the basis that the petitioner cat claim was based on far more than evidence of substandard prison conditions.see zubeda ashcroft,cir the zubeda panel also opined that the wording of the cat regulations stopped short of requiring specific intent.but this discussion in zubeda was discounted as dicta in a later third circuit case that decided the very issue before this followed in re.see auguste,at.of course,we are free nevertheless to adopt zubeda analysis as persuasive,but we are unpersuaded for the following reasons.
zubeda concluded that under the statute and regulations torture does not entail a specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering the panel acknowledged that severe pain and suffering must be specifically intended to constitute torture but to justify its conclusion that one can specifically intend without specific intent,the panel focused on the regulations statement that an act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture.zubeda,at quoting a.as a matter of plain language,we read that portion of section a differently to draw a distinction between a severity of pain or suffering that is intended torture and a severity of pain or suffering that is unintentional or unanticipated not torture,rather than a distinction between what is foreseeable and what is not.the proviso in section a that an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering bespeaks specific intent,the zubeda dicta notwithstanding.
zubeda discounted specific intent on another ground that the cat regulations define torture to include threats of physical harm that result in severe mental suffering,regardless of whether the persecutor actually intends to carry out the threat.zubeda,at.but this proves little when a credible threat of physical torture causes extreme mental pain or suffering,the specific intent requirement is altogether satisfied by the specific intent to cause the mental pain or suffering the persecutor intent specific or not to follow through on the threat to inflict physical torture does not matter if the making of the credible threat amounts to the torture in itself.see a defining types of severe mental pain and suffering that can rise to the level of torture with or without any physical torture.
it is also important that the concept of specific intent not be conflated with the concept of state acquiescence.because the cat reaches torture committed by or acquiesced in by government actors,it is not always necessary that the specific intent required by section a be formed by the government itself.a private actor behavior can constitute torture under the cat without a government specific intent to inflict it if a government official is aware of the persecutor conduct and intent and acquiesces in violation of the official duty to intervene.see khouzam ashcroft,cir in terms of state action,torture requires only that government officials know of or remain willfully blind to an act and thereafter breach their legal responsibility to prevent it.emphasis added.but in that scenario,there is specific intent of the private actor.
some courts have contemplated the possibility that in particular cases,a government willful blindness or deliberate indifference to suffering might suffice to show that the suffering is specifically intended.see,lavira att y of the,cir our criminal law jurisprudence bolsters the view that a finding of specific intent could be based on deliberate ignorance or willful blindness.thelemaque,d at a mechanical application of the specific intent requirement might yield results at odds with cat and concepts such as deliberate indifference,reckless disregard or willful blindness might well suffice in certain circumstances.we do not see how these concepts,which may bear on knowledge to the extent they establish conscious avoidance,can without more demonstrate specific intent,which requires that the actor intend the actual consequences of his conduct as distinguished from the act that causes these consequences 
in sum,the phrase specifically intended incorporates a criminal specific intent standard,notwithstanding the difficulties that might arise in applying that standard to evidence of country conditions in order to predict the likelihood of future events in individual cases.the president and senate knew full well that they were construing a treaty designed to stop criminal conduct we can not ignore the word specifically in the ratification understanding and the regulations,and we decline to give it a spin.see duncan walker,d citing principle that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant quoting washington market hoffman.the deference we owe to the bia analysis in in re simply confirms the understanding we derive from plain meaning.the bia reading of a,to which we defer,raises no insurmountable obstacle to cat relief,because there is no requirement that a cat claimant provide direct proof of the persecutors motives.ins,d.the cat regulations,like the asylum regulations,make motive critical,so a cat claimant must provide some evidence of specific intent,direct or circumstantial.id.but torture as commonly understood and practiced is not subtle,elusive,or easy to misconstrue,and the torturer intentions are rarely if ever obscure 
pierre appears to argue that even if the united states ratification understanding reflects a definition of torture that entails a specific intent to inflict severe pain and suffering,it should yield to the broader language of the cat itself as interpreted under principles of international law.
because the cat is not a treaty,wang ashcroft,cir,pierre has no judicially enforceable right directly arising from the cat as interpreted by its signatory nations his claims arise under united states law implementing the treaty.see flores peru copper,cir noting that treaties require implementing action in order to be suitable for judicial application,while treaties immediately create judicially enforceable rights.united states law is not subordinate to customary international law or necessarily subordinate to international law and,in fact,may conflict with both.united states yousef,cir.an act of congress will govern in domestic courts in derogation of previous treaties and customary international law.see oliva dep t of justice,cir noting that clear congressional action trumps customary international law in the immigration context as elsewhere empresa cubana del tabaco culbro,cir l egislative acts trump international law when those acts are passed subsequent to ratification of the treaty and clearly contradict treaty obligations.internal quotation marks omitted wang,at guzman tippy,cir per curiam.
in that light,international law does not assist the analysis.it is plain that in farra,congress commanded the immigration agencies to promulgate regulations that give full effect to all of the senate reservations and understandings,including the understanding that in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe pain and suffering.see auguste,at i n our opinion,farra codified the senate understandings into domestic law.by announcing its understandings,the senate implicitly recognized that the treaty wording would benefit from clarification.those understandings are the indispensable premise for the implementation of the cat as domestic law.the agency is bound by them and we defer to the agency reasonable interpretation of them
