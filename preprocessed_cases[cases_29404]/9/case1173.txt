this appeal is the latest installment in a series of litigations over the nassau county correctional center nccc blanket strip search policy for newly admitted,misdemeanor detainees the policy.plaintiffs,who were strip searched pursuant to the policy,appeal from a series of orders entered in the district court for the eastern district of new york denis hurley,judge denying their repeated motions for class certification on the ground that individual issues predominated over common ones.see.b requiring that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.
during the course of class certification motion practice,plaintiffs requested that the district court certify a rule b class solely on the issue of liability,as permitted by rule c a.in response,defendants conceded their liability to plaintiffs.the district court denied the motion.as an initial matter,the district court expressed serious doubt over whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that plaintiffs claims,as a whole,failed the predominance test.even if it could do so,the district court reasoned that defendants concession removed common liability issues from the predominance analysis.with common liability issues so excised,the court concluded that individual liability issues,such as the application of an affirmative defense,predominated.the court thus denied plaintiffs motions for class certification on the issue of liability.
the precise issues on appeal are whether a court may certify a rule b class as to a particular issue when it already has determined that the claim as a whole fails the predominance test common issues that are conceded remain part of the predominance analysis and the district court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability.as set forth more fully below,we hold that a court may employ rule c a to certify a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test the district court erred when it concluded that defendants concession eliminated liability issues from the predominance analysis and the district court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to rules b and c a.accordingly,we reverse the district court orders dated september,and november,to the extent that they deny certification as to the issue of liability,and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,the district court for the eastern district of new york held that defendants blanket policy of strip searching newly admitted,misdemeanor detainees violated clearly established fourth amendment law.see shain ellison,d,aff,cir.although the policy has never been formally enjoined,shain ellison,cir vacating injunction for lack of standing,defendants assert that following the district court decision,they ceased implementing it.
shortly after the district court decision,plaintiffs brought three separate actions in the eastern district of new york augustin jablonsky,civ,et nassau county sheriff department,et,civ,and iaffaldano county of nassau,civ.together,plaintiffs named as defendants nassau county,sheriff joseph jablonsky,the sheriff department,county executive thomas gulotta,the division of corrections,the port washington police district and its chief of police,william kilfoil,and up to subordinate john and jane doe corrections officers.
each action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to weapons or drugs and thereafter strip searched,without individualized suspicion,pursuant to the policy.plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches violated,the fourth,fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and article,section of the new york state constitution.they sought compensatory and punitive damages,a declaration that the policy was unconstitutional,and an injunction barring enforcement of the policy.they also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action.
in february of,plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified class pursuant to rule b plaintiffs defined the class as follows a ll persons arrested for or charged with offenses who have been admitted to the nassau county correctional center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.in an opinion and order dated march,the district court granted that branch of the motion seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification.see augustin jablonsky,civ,wl.
the district court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation.see.a.however,it denied certification for lack of common issue predominance.the court recognized certain common questions,namely,whether defendants maintained a blanket strip search policy whether that policy was unconstitutional and whether some or all defendants may be held liable.nonetheless,it determined that individualized issues predominated,in particular whether subordinate jane and john doe defendants might escape liability in some cases because,notwithstanding the blanket policy,they had reasonable suspicion to search certain detainees the existence of proximate causation for each alleged injury and compensatory and punitive damages calculations.
the district court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue of liability pursuant to rule c a,which allows for class certification with respect to particular issues.it declined to do so because it did not wish to undertake plaintiffs burden to craft and submit a proposal,and because,as a legal matter,it perceived considerable doubt as to the propriety of using rule c a in this fashion.in particular,the court relied on castano am.tobacco,cir for the proposition that courts may not employ rule c a to single out the issue of liability for class treatment unless the cause of action,as a whole,first satisfies rule b predominance requirement.id.at emphasis added by district court.
plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.they first asserted that they would no longer seek judgment against subordinate jane and john doe defendants.since that modification would render the question of liability identical for nearly all class members,plaintiffs next asserted that the court should certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to rule c a.they again defined the class as all persons arrested for or charged with offenses who have been admitted to the nassau county correctional center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.
in an opinion and order dated may,the court agreed that plaintiffs forbearance of their claims against subordinate defendants removes the possibility of individualized liability determinations.to be sure,the court acknowledged,the absence of individualized questions of liability militates in favor of partial certification solely on that issue.it nevertheless denied the motion.
the district court again noted its concern that partial certification might not be appropriate in the first instance where the cause of action,as a whole,does not satisfy the predominance requirement of rule b.even assuming that rule c a could be used in that fashion,the court denied the motion because plaintiffs proposed class definition would necessitate just to determine class membership.in order to determine class membership,the court believed,each class member would have to show affirmatively that he was strip searched without particularized reasonable criterion that the definition incorporated.this burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that they had ceased the blanket strip search policy after the eastern district decision in shain,and thereafter conducted strip searches only with particularized reasonable suspicion.
in january,plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification as to liability and offered a new definition of the class as follows a ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or noncriminal offenses in nassau county who thereafter were at the nccc pursuant to defendants blanket policy,practice and custom which required that all arrestees be stripsearched upon admission to the facility alterations incorporated.by referring only to the blanket policy,this new definition did not require plaintiffs to show that reasonable suspicion was absent in each case,and it excluded individuals strip searched after the shain decision,when defendants ceased implementing the policy.plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew their claims against individual john and jane doe corrections officers.
in response,defendants conceded the one common issue that in their view might be appropriate for class certification namely,whether the nccc strip search policy during the class period was constitutional.alterations incorporated.specifically,defendants recognized that they are bound by shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
the district court denied the renewed motion.in an opinion and order dated september,the court determined that defendants concession removed all common liability issues from its predominance analysis.accordingly,the only liability issue that remained was an individual one whether,notwithstanding the policy,some plaintiffs were searched based upon reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.with the liability issue thus circumscribed,the court wrote,certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.interestingly,the court recognized that the individualized reasonable suspicion inquiries will be de minimis for two reasons because defendants conceded that such an inquiry will only be sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs,and because pursuant to united states colon,cir,reasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed.
plaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on october.in an opinion and order dated november,the district court adhered to its earlier determinations and also the first for the same reasons informing its predominance analysis,plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of rule b requirements,specifically,that the proposed class action be superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.in one last effort to determine if its decision was in some other way improper,the court examined the policies of efficiency and uniformity animating rule,and concluded that they did not favor certification.the court also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little trouble securing counsel to pursue their claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide the necessary economic incentive.
the parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of to the ten plaintiffs,who agreed to split the funds equally.plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal the district court orders denying class certification,which they timely exercised

ii.the requirements and purpose of rule b 
in order to achieve class certification pursuant to rule b,plaintiffs must satisfy the four requirements of rule a,which are numerosity,typicality,commonality,and adequacy of representation demonstrate that common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and establish that the class action mechanism is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b.
as a general matter,the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.in re visa antitrust,cir quotation marks omitted.the rule encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies of time,effort,and expense,and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated,without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.b comm.to amend.
in light of these purposes,we have set forth that although a defense may arise and may affect different class members differently,this occurrence does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones.in re visa check,at internal quotation marks omitted.so long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class members together,variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically foreclose class certification.id.quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated.
iii.the district court erred in failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to rules b and c a 
as set forth more fully below,we conclude that the district court erred by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability we first conclude that,contrary to the district court reservations,a court may employ rule c a to certify a class on a particular issue even if the action as a whole does not satisfy rule b predominance requirement.second,we hold that the district court committed legal error in concluding that defendants concession eliminated common liability issues from rule b predominance analysis.third,this error caused the district court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that individualized liability issues predominated over common ones,and that the class action mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle under these circumstances.
a.a district court may certify a class as to specific issues regardless of whether the entire claim satisfies rule b 
whether a court may employ rule c a to certify a class as to a specific issue where the entire claim does not satisfy rule b predominance requirement is a matter of first impression in this circuit.see robinson,at identifying question as one of first impression and declining to resolve it.it also is a matter as to which the circuits have split.id.
the fifth circuit has adopted a strict application of rule b predominance requirement.id.under this view,t he proper interpretation of the interaction between subdivisions b and c is that a cause of action,as a whole,must satisfy the predominance requirement of b and that c is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the common issues for a class trial.castano am.tobacco,cir.
the ninth circuit holds a different view.pursuant to that court precedent,e ven if the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the entire action is warranted,rule authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to isolate the common issues under rule c a and proceed with class treatment of these particular issues.valentino,cir gunnells healthplan,cir holding that courts may employ rule c to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs claims,taken together,do not satisfy the predominance requirement.
we agree with the ninth circuit view of the matter.first,the plain language and structure of rule support the ninth circuit view.rule c provides as follows 
when appropriate a an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues,or b a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class,and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.
