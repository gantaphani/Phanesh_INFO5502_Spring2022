while we have affirmed district courts decisions on motions to proceed anonymously,we have never set out a test for courts to apply to determine if a litigant reasonable fear of severe harm outweighs the public interest in open judicial proceedings,at.many of our sister courts of appeals have provided such guidance.see,sealed plaintiff sealed defendant,cir doe porter,cir advanced textile,at zavaras,cir james jacobson,cir frank,at doe stegall,cir.unit a.when a litigant sufficiently alleges that he or she has a reasonable fear of severe harm from litigating without a pseudonym,courts of appeals are in agreement that district courts should balance a plaintiff interest and fear against the public strong interest in an open litigation process.sealed plaintiff,at porter,at advanced textile,at zavaras,at jacobson,at frank,at stegall,at.while the courts of appeals have agreed that district courts should apply a balancing test,each case presents a slightly different list of factors for courts to consider while one could conclude that there is a conflict as a result of the different factors,each court has agreed that their list of factors is not exhaustive.see,id.further,each court agrees that the purpose of the balancing test is to allow a district court to determine whether a litigant has a reasonable fear of severe harm that outweighs the public interest in open litigation.kamehameha schools,at.

the extent to which the identity of the litigant has been kept confidential the bases upon which disclosure is feared or sought to be avoided,and the substantiality of these bases the magnitude of the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the litigant identity whether,because of the purely legal nature of the issues presented or otherwise,there is an atypically weak public interest in knowing the litigant identities the undesirability of an outcome adverse to the pseudonymous party and attributable to his refusal to pursue the case at the price of being publicly identified and whether the party seeking to sue pseudonymously has illegitimate ulterior motives.
id.at.on the other side of the scale,factors disfavoring anonymity included 
the universal level of public interest in access to the identities of litigants whether,because of the subject matter of this litigation,the status of the litigant as a public figure,or otherwise,there is a particularly strong interest in knowing the litigant identities,
