plaintiff appellant gregory hubbs asserts that he was severely beaten by suffolk county deputy sheriffs while he was being detained in a holding cell at the suffolk county supreme court following a court appearance.hubbs sued the alleged perpetrators in the eastern district of new york and the district court joanna seybert,judge granted summary judgment to the defendants on the ground that hubbs had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act plra,a 
on hubbs appeal from that judgment,the issue before us is what must be proffered to establish that an administrative remedy is available pursuant to the plra.because failure to exhaust under the plra is an affirmative defense,and because the evidence adduced by the defendants principally in the form of a conclusory affidavit does not suffice to establish the defense as a matter of law,we vacate the summary judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
hubbs allegations of 
in november,plaintiff appellant gregory hubbs was an inmate at the suffolk county correctional facility sccf in yaphank,n,where he was being held pending conclusion of his criminal trial.hubbs trial was being conducted at the suffolk county supreme court.accordingly,on court days before and after his appearances,hubbs was held in the custody of deputy sheriffs from the suffolk county sheriff department at a facility in that courthouse.
the correction division of the sheriff department is responsible for the sccf jails one in yaphank and one in riverhead and correction officers staff both facilities.the holding cell at the courthouse,on the other hand,is staffed by deputy sheriffs,who are not correction officers and who do not work in the correction division.the warden,a sheriff department employee who serves under the county sheriff,is in charge of the sccf jails.
on november,hubbs jury trial ended in conviction,but while awaiting transfer to the scff he was still in a holding cell at the courthouse.there,he struck up a conversation with anthony oddone,a detainee who was accused of murdering an suffolk county correction officer.after learning that hubbs had been convicted,oddone offered some encouraging words,and hubbs responded i wish you the best.according to hubbs,it was after this brief interaction with oddone that he was dragged to another holding cell by several deputy sheriffs and beaten,supposedly in retaliation for his sympathy towards oddone.subsequently,hubbs was taken to the emergency room.doctors there determined that he had suffered a contact seizure and identified head trauma with a laceration over the right eye,and swelling and bruising around the eye and ear.
natalie desir,a detainee in the cell down the hall from where the alleged assault took place,submitted an affidavit in which she stated that she saw the deputies drag hubbs from the holding cell while telling him that they would show you how to keep your fucking mouth shut and saying of oddone that h e killed one of ours.joint app x at.she further averred that she saw the officers strike hubbs in the face and then saw one of the deputies choke hubbs by placing his forearm under hubbs neck.id.hubbs then began to shake from what desir believed to be a seizure,and she heard one of the officers say enough you are going to kill him.id.
when hubbs regained consciousness,desir yelled out to him that she had witnessed the entire incident,and hubbs gave her his mother telephone number.desir contacted hubbs that evening and reported the assault,and hubbs contacted christopher cassar,the lawyer who had represented hubbs at trial.
on november,cassar sent a fax to county sherriff vincent demarco,informing him of the assault and requesting an investigation.in addition,hubbs avers that she called the yaphank jail sometime on or before november to report the incident.the employee she spoke to,however,told her to raise the issue with internal affairs ia at the sheriff department because s heriffs handle anything on the courtroom side of the facility.joint app x at on november,hubbs called ia to request an investigation.thereafter,she informed her son that she had tried to call the yaphank jail but that they had told her to raise the issue with ia.hubbs called ia two more times before november,the date on which ia sent an officer to interview hubbs,and in both her calls,she was assured that the incident would be investigated.ultimately,ia conducted an investigation and concluded that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the deputies.hubbs subsequently initiated this suit in the district court.
b.the sccf inmate grievance procedure 
the sccf inmate grievance procedure is detailed in an inmate handbook given to all inmates.the grievance process has multiple stages.first,inmates are to try and resolve any issue with the officer assigned to their housing unit.if that is not possible,inmates may complete a grievance form that will be given to the sergeant assigned to the inmate housing unit.if the sergeant fails to resolve the issue,the grievance is forwarded to the grievance coordinator,who may conduct an investigation and will provide a written determination.if the inmate disagrees with the determination,it may be appealed to the warden,who will provide his own written determination within days.finally,the inmate may appeal to the state commission of correction.
the handbook also informs inmates that some issues can not be grieved through the sccf system 
the following decisions will not be subject of a grievance and therefore may not be appealed to the warden or the citizens policy and complaint review council issues that are outside the warden control.

proceedings in the district court 
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the ground that hubbs had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the plra.most relevantly for purposes of this appeal,the court ruled that the sccf grievance procedures detailed in the handbook applied to hubbs complaint and that administrative remedies were thus available and had to be exhausted.to arrive at this conclusion,the district court relied largely on an affidavit submitted in support of the defendant summary judgment motion by craig rosenblatt,the sccf grievance coordinator.rosenblatt affidavit stated in relevant part 
complaints made by inmates involving acts or occurrences that take place while the inmate is in the custody of the suffolk county sheriff department are issues within the control of the warden 
any grievance filed by an inmate within five days of the act or occurrence giving rise to the grievance,concerning an act or occurrence that took place while the inmate was detained in the county court holding facility would be accepted by the grievance coordinator and a determination would be made regarding what action should be taken to resolve and rectify the matter.
joint app x at.
the court further concluded that the inmate handbook did not establish that grievances were unavailable because,under its reading,the handbook only barred appeals of matters outside the warden control,and did not bar initial grievances of such matters.thus,despite the fact that rosenblatt had never been disclosed to hubbs as a projected witness,and was therefore never deposed,the court ruled that hubbs proffered only speculation to counter rosenblatt affidavit,and this was insufficient to establish that the grievance process was unavailable to hubbs.see hubbs cnty.of suffolk,cv,wl,at june.
discussion 
hubbs argues on appeal that summary judgment was improper because administrative remedies for grievances that stem from events in the holding cell of the county court were,as a matter of law,unavailable to him.hubbs also contends that the plra is inapplicable to his suit because his claims were not brought with respect to prison conditions.a.in the alternative,he contends that his failure to exhaust should be excused pursuant to our holding in hemphill new york,cir,which establishes a inquiry in cases where a prisoner seeks to counter the contention that he has failed to exhaust
