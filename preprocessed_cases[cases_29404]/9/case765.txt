in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief,plaintiffs john copeland,pedro perez,native leather,knife rights,and knife rights foundation,invoke to charge the city of new york and the new york county district attorney,cyrus vance,with applying new york law criminalizing the possession of gravity knives,see penal law,in such a way as to render the proscription unconstitutionally vague,thereby depriving plaintiffs of the notice mandated by due process.the united states district court for the southern district of new york katherine forrest,judge,dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,see.b,concluding that no plaintiff had demonstrated standing to pursue that challenge.see knife rights,vance,civ.kbf,wl.plaintiffs now appeal,arguing that they each satisfactorily alleged the imminent threat of harm necessary to demonstrate the injury in fact required for constitutional standing.
for the reasons stated herein,we conclude that plaintiffs copeland,perez,and native leather adequately allege standing,but that the organizational plaintiffs,knife rights and knife rights foundation,do not.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of dismissal as to knife rights and knife rights foundation,but we vacate the judgment against copeland,perez,and native leather and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings as to these three plaintiffs consistent with this opinion.
background 
statutory framework 
under new york law,criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree is a class a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year in prison.see penal law.switchblades and gravity knives are among the weapons specifically proscribed by.new york defines a switchblade knife as any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button,spring or other device in the handle of the knife.id.it defines a gravity knife as any knife which has a blade which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force which,when released,is locked in place by means of a button,spring,lever or other device.id.the new york court of appeals has explained that the latter definition distinguishes gravity knives from certain folding knives that can not readily be opened by gravity or centrifugal force.people dreyden.
plaintiffs assert that,consistent with these definitions and judicial gloss,has been enforced without controversy for decades by reference to the essential attribute of both switchblade and gravity knives,the lack of any mechanical resistance or bias against opening from the closed position that must be overcome in order for these knives to open.am.compl.plaintiffs complain that,more recently,defendants have construed the definition of gravity knife in such a way as to render the statutory prohibition unconstitutionally vague.specifically,defendants have applied the law to any folding knife even ones designed to resist opening from the closed position common folding knives if it would be possible for some person to open the knife by means of a motion.id.plaintiffs argue that a person in possession of a common folding knife,particularly one that the person himself is unable to open with a wrist flick,can not be expected to know that his possession is criminal because some person may be able to flick open the knife.on this appeal,we do not consider the merits of plaintiffs vagueness claim,but only their standing to pursue it.because past enforcement efforts against certain plaintiffs are relevant to their standing,we proceed to summarize those efforts.
defendants enforcement efforts against plaintiffs 
copeland and perez 
plaintiffs john copeland and pedro perez are,respectively,an artist and an art dealer.both had routinely carried folding knives for use in their work until when such knife possession resulted in each man separately being charged with violating.perez was so charged on april,when new york city police officers observed him at a manhattan subway station with a metal clip protruding from his pocket.inquiry revealed the clip to be part of a gerber brand common folding knife that perez had purchased approximately two years earlier at tent trail,an outdoor supply store in manhattan.plaintiffs assert that the charging officers were unable themselves to flick open perez knife,but based on the possibility that someone could do so,they issued perez a desk appearance ticket charging him with unlawful possession of a gravity knife.
some months later,on october,copeland was similarly charged when police,observing a metal clip in his pocket,found him in possession of a benchmade brand common folding knife,purchased the year before at paragon sports in manhattan.plaintiffs assert that on two occasions before october,copeland had shown his benchmade knife to new york city police officers and inquired as to the legality of its possession.on both occasions,the officers were unable to flick open the knife and so returned it to copeland,advising that its possession was legal.by contrast,the officers who stopped copeland in october were able to open the knife by grasping the knife handle and forcefully flicking the knife body downwards and,thus,issued copeland a desk appearance ticket for violating.am.compl.
perez and copeland each retained counsel to defend the charges by disputing that the devices in their possession were proscribed gravity knives.the question was never resolved because,in both cases,the parties agreed to adjournments in contemplation of dismissal,a disposition.see.proc.law hollender trump vill,explaining that adjournment in contemplation of dismissal is neither a conviction nor an acquittal.
in this action,perez and copeland assert their continuing interest in carrying common folding knives in new york city but maintain that they do not do so for fear of again being charged with a violation,given their inability to determine which common folding knives defendants might deem prohibited by that law.
native leather 
plaintiff native leather operates a retail store in manhattan,where it sells,among other things,common folding knives.plaintiffs allege that in june,defendant vance initiated enforcement actions against numerous new york city knife retailers,claiming that an undercover investigation had revealed the retailers sale of proscribed gravity knives.many retailers resolved these actions by agreeing to pay fines,totaling an aggregate of nearly million to surrender various folding knives in their inventories and to refrain from future sales of gravity knives.seven retailers,including native leather,did so by entering into deferred prosecution agreements.
under its agreement,native leather not only paid a monetary fine and forfeited certain folding knives,but also adopted a compliance program approved by the district attorney office and pledged to permanently cease and desist from selling any prohibited gravity knives in the future.pursuant to its compliance program,native leather has a designated employee test each common folding knife in its inventory by making several attempts to open the knife by means of a action.native leather only sells common folding knives that the designated employee can not flick open on even a single attempt.
although most provisions of native leather deferred prosecution agreement have now expired,it asserts that it maintains its compliance program to avoid running afoul of defendants interpretation of the statutory prohibition of gravity knives.am.compl.at the same time,it professes concern that its program can not assure that some other person will not be able to flick open one of its knives despite its own employee inability to do so.id.thus,it complains that,while it wishes to sell a wide assortment of common folding knives,it does not do so because it can not confidently determine which such knives defendants will deem gravity knives in violation of.
knife rights and knife rights foundation 
knife rights is a membership advocacy organization that promotes legislative and legal action,as well as research,publishing,and advocacy,in support of people ability to carry and use knives and tools.id.knife rights also seeks to vindicate the legal rights of individuals and businesses who are unable to act on their own behalf in light of the costs and time commitments involved in litigation.id.knife rights asserts that defendants have charged or threatened to charge certain of its members with violations of.as a result,some unidentified members have refrained from carrying or selling folding knives for fear of being so charged.
knife rights foundation is a nonprofit organization intended to promote education and research regarding knives and edged tools.id.knife rights foundation alleges that it has paid or contributed towards some of the monetary expenses that knife rights has incurred in consequence of defendants threatened enforcement of,which expenditures have come at the expense of other organizational priorities of knife rights foundation.id.
prior proceedings 
on june,plaintiffs copeland,perez,and knife rights initiated this action,seeking a declaration that penal law and are unconstitutionally vague as applied to common folding knives,and an injunction preventing defendants continued enforcement of these statutes as to such knives defendants moved for dismissal pursuant to,inter alia.b and c,whereupon plaintiffs successfully sought leave to amend.this resulted,among other things,in the addition of native leather and knife rights foundation as named plaintiffs.
defendants thereafter renewed their motion for dismissal,arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because no plaintiff alleged the injury in fact necessary to satisfy article iii requirement.the district court agreed and entered judgment for defendants on september.as to plaintiffs copeland and perez,the district court determined that any injury was completely hypothetical and highly speculative,because neither had alleged the make and model of knife that he wants to carry or specifically describe d it.knife rights,vance,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.as to native leather,the district court stated that the store desire to skirt the edges of the law does not create an injury sufficient for article iii standing.id.the district court further concluded that knife rights and knife rights foundation expenditure of resources to avoid an entirely hypothetical possibility that the government policies will injure their members did not confer standing because the threat of harm to the organizations and their members was too speculative.id.at.
plaintiffs sought reconsideration,arguing that the district court had failed to consider their request for leave to amend and providing the court with a proposed second amended complaint indicating that,but for the alleged vagueness in defendants application of,plaintiff copeland would purchase,possess,and use another benchmade model folding knife,and that plaintiff perez would purchase,possess,and use another gerber model folding knife.proposed second am.compl.the district court denied reconsideration,noting,among other things,that amendment would unduly prejudice defendants because discovery had been completed and summary judgment had already been awarded in their favor.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
dismissal for lack of subject matter.the jurisdictional requirement of standing 
to ensure that persons are not denied liberty without due process,the law requires that criminal offenses be defined with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,accord johnson united states.a statute that fails to do so is deemed unconstitutionally vague.plaintiffs here sue for a judicial declaration that penal law and are unconstitutionally vague as applied to common folding knives,and for an order enjoining the future application of these statutes to such knives.
a court jurisdiction to hear such a vagueness challenge is limited to an actual case or controversy.see,art.iii.the doctrine of standing gives meaning to these constitutional limits,susan anthony list driehaus,by requiring a plaintiff to allege such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court remedial powers on his behalf,warth seldin,internal quotation marks omitted.to establish article iii standing,then,a plaintiff must show an injury in fact,a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,and a likel ihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.susan anthony list driehaus.at alteration in original quoting lujan defenders of wildlife.
the district court here concluded that plaintiffs failed to carry their standing burden at the first element.we review plaintiffs challenge to this legal conclusion de novo,borrowing from the familiar rule b standard,which instructs us to construe the pleadings in plaintiffs favor,accepting as true all material factual allegations contained therein.see huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir.
for an alleged injury to support constitutional standing,it must be concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.susan anthony list driehaus.at quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,at other quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has described the imminence requirement differently in different contexts,without specifying whether the descriptions are synonymous or distinct.see,clapper amnesty int l usa,employing certainly impending standard while acknowledging cases referencing substantial risk standard,but declining to address possible distinction accord susan anthony list driehaus.at an allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending,or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.quoting clapper see also hedges obama,cir.
where,as here,certain plaintiffs assert injury from threatened prosecution,the supreme court has instructed that imminence does not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat for example,the constitutionality of a law threatened to be enforced.medimmune,genentech,collecting cases accord susan anthony list driehaus.at see generally steffel thompson,rehnquist,concurring observing that declaratory judgment procedure is an alternative to pursuit of the arguably illegal activity.rather,in the context of challenges to criminal statutes,imminent injury can be established by plausible allegations that a plaintiff inten ds to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.susan anthony list driehaus.at quoting babbitt united farm workers union,the identification of a credible threat sufficient to satisfy the imminence requirement of injury in fact necessarily depends on the particular circumstances at issue.a credible threat of prosecution,however,can not rest on fears that are imaginary or speculative.babbitt united farm workers union,at quoting younger harris.nor is it evident where plaintiffs do not claim that they have ever been threatened with prosecution,that a prosecution is likely,or even that a prosecution is remotely possible.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.that is hardly this case,at least not as to plaintiffs native leather,copeland,and perez.
native leather demonstrates a credible threat of imminent prosecution for intended conduct 
native leather asserts that it has in the past sold,and wishes again to offer for sale,a variety of common folding knives that it does not think violate because they have a mechanical bias in favor of the closed position that must be overcome in order to open them.it does not do so,however,because it can not confidently determine which such knives defendants will deem proscribed gravity knives,and it does not wish to risk prosecution.this professed fear of prosecution is hardly conjectural or hypothetical,given that defendant vance recently identified native leather as a violator and pursued enforcement action against it.in susan anthony list driehaus,the supreme court located a substantial threat of future prosecution in a history of past enforcement.at.the past enforcement there included a determination that probable cause supported a complaint that petitioners had made statements violative of the state law whose constitutionality they wished to challenge.see id.at.the threat is even more substantial here because in susan anthony list,the complaint was withdrawn,see id.at,while here,native leather was officially charged,paid fines,surrendered property in purported violation of law,implemented a compliance program,and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement that expressly threatened future charges if its terms were not satisfied.see generally steffel thompson,at recognizing imminent threat where parties stipulated that arrest warrants would be sought if plaintiff engaged in specified conduct see also virginia am.booksellers ass n,recognizing imminent threat where challenged statute would require plaintiffs to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution.one of these terms required native leather to permanently cease and desist from selling knives prohibited by,the very statute that plaintiffs maintain defendants apply in a way that creates constitutionally impermissible vagueness.while the agreement had expired in all other respects approximately nine months before native leather joined this lawsuit,the totality of these circumstances demonstrates a credible threat of imminent prosecution if vance were to determine that native leather was again offering for sale common folding knives that he deemed proscribed gravity knives.certainly,defendants do not disavow such enforcement.see,susan anthony list driehaus.at citing absence of disavowal as further support of credible threat.thus,native leather is not required either to pursue arguably illegal activity,steffel thompson,at rehnquist,concurring,or to expose itself to criminal liability before bringing suit to challenge the constitutionality of the law threatened to be enforced,medimmune,genentech,at.
city of los angeles lyons,is not to the contrary.there,a plaintiff who had been placed in a chokehold by police effecting his arrest sued for declaratory and injunctive relief from an alleged municipal policy of excessive force in arrest.see id.at.the supreme court concluded that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the alleged policy because he failed to establish an imminent threat that he would again be stopped by police,particularly as he expressed no intent to violate any law in the future or the blanket application of chokeholds by arresting los angeles police officers.see id.at.by contrast,here native leather has expressed its intent but for the fear of prosecution to engage in the very conduct that prompted defendants prior enforcement action.see susan anthony list.driehaus.at identifying imminent harm where plaintiff alleged intent to engage in same speech that was subject of prior enforcement proceeding moreover,while no defendant in lyons threatened plaintiff with future chokeholds,defendants here expressly threatened to prosecute native leather for violations,as determined by vance,if native leather violated any term of its deferred prosecution agreement,including the pledge permanently to cease and desist from selling gravity knives.see steffel thompson,at 
accordingly,to the extent the district court concluded that native leather failed to satisfy the element of standing,we vacate its judgment in favor of defendants and remand for further proceedings.
copeland and perez demonstrate a credible threat of imminent prosecution for intended conduct 
copeland and perez assert that they have in the past carried,and wish again to carry,common folding knives,but do not do so because they can not confidently determine which such knives defendants will deem gravity knives prohibited by,and they do not wish to risk prosecution.their professed fear is also not conjectural or hypothetical.each man has already been charged with a violation for carrying a common folding knife.each was obliged to retain counsel to secure an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.see susan anthony list driehaus.at.to be sure,that disposition,unlike the deferred prosecution agreement applicable to native leather,did not expressly threaten future prosecution if copeland or perez were again to carry the knives prompting charges against them.but certainly nowhere in the record of this litigation have defendants disavowed that they would criminally charge copeland and perez again in the same circumstances.see id.at holder humanitarian law project,at recognizing imminent threat where government had not argued that plaintiffs will not be prosecuted if they do what they say they wish to do see also babbitt united farm workers union,at noting that plaintiffs were not without some reason in fearing prosecution where state had not disavowed any intention of invoking the criminal penalty provision.indeed,the contrary can be inferred from defendant vance defense of the test supporting these plaintiffs past arrests.see appellee vance br.
thus,copeland and perez are not similarly situated to the plaintiff in city of los angeles lyons,because they affirmatively wish to engage in the very conduct that resulted in defendants charging them with violations of and the record indicates that,upon becoming aware of any such conduct by plaintiffs,defendants would again charge them with violations of law 
because these circumstances demonstrate a credible threat of prosecution,neither copeland nor perez is required to pursue arguably illegal activity or to expose himself to criminal liability before bringing suit to challenge the constitutionality of the law threatened to be enforced.see medimmune,genentech,at steffel thompson,at rehnquist,concurring.to the extent the district court concluded that these plaintiffs failed to satisfy the element of standing,we vacate its judgment in favor of defendants and remand for further proceedings.
knife rights and knife rights foundation fail to demonstrate standing 
we reach a different conclusion as to the standing of organizational plaintiffs knife rights and knife rights foundation.
insofar as these plaintiffs sued on behalf of their members,i t is the law of this circuit that an organization does not have standing to assert the rights of its members in a case brought under.nnebe daus,cir collecting cases.plaintiffs argue that nnebe and the precedent on which it relies conflict with warth seldin,at.but as nnebe observed,this court has reaffirmed its rule as to organizational plaintiffs representative standing even after warth seldin thus,individual panels are bound by the implicit determination of prior panels that the rule survives warth until such time as our prior decisions are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.nnebe daus,at alteration in original quoting united states wilkerson,cir 
insofar as the organizational plaintiffs sue on their own behalf,they must independently satisfy the requirements of article iii standing.see havens realty coleman,holding that organization standing to sue on its own behalf requires same inquiry as in case of individual has the plaintiff alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of jurisdiction internal quotation marks omitted accord nnebe daus,at.knife rights and knife rights foundation attempt to carry this burden by citing the expenses they incurred in opposing defendants application of.even assuming that such expenditures perceptibly impaired these organizations activities,they at best demonstrate past injury.havens realty coleman,at concluding that nonprofit organization established standing in its own right to pursue fair housing act challenge to apartment owner racial steering practices,where organization ability to provide counseling and referral services to its clients had been perceptibly impaired by need to devote significant resources to identify and counteract defendants challenged practices internal quotation marks omitted.such injury might
