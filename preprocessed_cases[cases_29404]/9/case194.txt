on november,defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that the undisputed material facts established that no deprivation of kenney constitutional rights had occurred.defendants motion for summary judgment was based on and supported by a report from the attorney general of new hampshire concerning the deaths and the incident.the report summarized and assessed,inter alia,accounts of the incident,video and audio recordings from officer mckay vehicle and from franconia police dispatch,and forensic evidence collected at the scene.it concluded on the basis of this material that officer mckay had reasonably used physical force on kenney.ann,i,that kenney had unlawfully used deadly force on officer mckay,id,ii,and that gregory floyd had acted justifiably.plaintiff did not object to consideration of the report as evidence.
