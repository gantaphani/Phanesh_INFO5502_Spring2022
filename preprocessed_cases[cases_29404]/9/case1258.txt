this case presents a constitutional claim arising from a voting machine malfunction in a local new york election.on november,david jacobowitz stood for election to the office of town supervisor in the town of whitestown,oneida county,new york.his opponent was plaintiff matthew shannon,the incumbent.the names of both candidates appeared in several places on the ballot,jacobowitz on lines and,and shannon on lines,and.when the polls closed and the votes were counted,the board of elections unofficially declared jacobowitz the winner by a margin of votes.the tally was to.
the election inspectors soon noticed a problem with voting machine a in whitestown election district.although both the machine public counter and the election inspectors list reflected that voters used the voting machine,only votes were registered on the machine in the supervisor race.further,the inspection return showed that only one vote was entered on line one of the lines on which shannon name appeared.each of the four election democrats and two a notation on the return of canvass indicating a possible machine break.
together with matthew shannon,plaintiffs are voters who claim that their votes were not counted due to the machine malfunction.rather than pursue the state remedy of quo warranto by requesting that new york attorney general investigate the machine malfunction and challenge the election results in state court,exec.law,plaintiffs filed their complaint in federal court,pursuant to.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief and claimed,among other things,that the board of elections violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by depriving them of their right to vote and to have their votes counted.
although the district court acknowledged that plaintiffs had not alleged that the board of elections intentionally deprived them of their rights,the court nevertheless found that plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits by showing that quo warranto was neither an adequate nor a fair remedy for the unintentional deprivation of plaintiffs voting rights.the court agreed with plaintiffs assertion that quo warranto was purely discretionary and it would occur well after the wrong was done.shannon jacobowitz,d.the court also found that shannon and the voters would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.id.at.accordingly,the district court issued preliminary injunctions enjoining the oneida county board of elections from taking any action to certify jacobowitz the winner and enjoining jacobowitz from assuming the supervisor office.id.the parties agreed that shannon would remain in office pending resolution of the litigation.id.at.see pub.off.law.
subsequently,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.because the facts were mostly uncontested by defendants,the district court saw no need for extended discovery and adopted the facts as presented by plaintiffs in their motion for preliminary injunction.the court found that despite the voting machine malfunction,shannon was the actual winner of the election.id.at.the court reasoned that although typically some among voters occurs,was not a likely explanation for the discrepancy between the number of voters who used machine a and the number of votes cast on that machine for town supervisor.the rate of for voting machine a in district was.id.at.in contrast,the next highest rate of recorded in any district in the supervisor race was,and the rate on the other machine in district was.id.
the district court further noted that approximately one month after the election,a voting machine technician examined and tested the machine and determined that the mechanical wheel which operates the counter on line malfunctioned in such a way as to not advance each time the lever was pulled by a voter on line.id.at.given this information,and the affidavits of seventy registered voters who swore they voted for shannon on line using voting machine a,the district court concluded that voting machine a had malfunctioned.id.the court further concluded that,as a result of the malfunction,shannon had at least votes,and perhaps as many as votes,cast for him but not counted.id.
the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on due process grounds and made its preliminary injunctions permanent shannon jacobowitz,wl.the court relied on language in gold feinberg,cir and determined that even if an election mistake resulting in a loss of votes was inadvertent or negligent,it still established a constitutional deprivation if the available state remedy was not fair or adequate.the court concluded that quo warranto was an inadequate remedy because an investigation by the attorney general was unnecessary when all agreed that the voting machine malfunctioned,that a discretionary action by the attorney general would not necessarily have permitted an aggrieved candidate and the voters to assert their rights,and that there was no danger that the town supervisor position would be vacant since the parties had agreed that shannon would remain in office during the litigation.see shannon,d at.the court also found the remedy unfair 
it is not a fair remedy to know without doubt that votes were cast in favor of a candidate but lack a provision in the law by which those votes can be counted within a reasonable time.it is not a fair remedy to sit idly and watch the opposing candidate be sworn in,knowing full well that the wrong person is taking public office.it is not a fair remedy to forgo your duty,as a duly elected public servant,to fill the position for which you were elected by the citizenry.it is not a fair remedy,as a citizen,to be governed by one whom sic it is clear to see was not elected to the office he holds.it is not a fair remedy to require the board of elections to certify an election result which it knows is incorrect.it is not a fair remedy to the opposing candidate to be sworn into office under uncertain circumstances and to be exposed to personal liability.it is not a fair remedy where the one avenue to correct such an injustice is available only after the fact,and then is purely discretionary and doubtless protracted.
in our view the district court mistakenly defined the constitutional right by the state remedy while bypassing the determinative threshold question whether the state actors conduct was intentional.because supreme court jurisprudence plainly requires intentional conduct by state actors as a prerequisite for a due process violation,and because there was no such conduct here,we reverse

in this case,appellees argue that because a voting machine malfunctioned in a local election and the resulting miscount was outcome determinative,the oneida county board of elections and its officers violated their constitutional due process rights in the absence of a viable state remedy.they rely on language in one of our previous cases,gold,to support their underlying claim that,even in the absence of intentional conduct,the lack of an adequate state remedy is a sufficient alternative basis to establish a due process vi
