in this case,renee mihalik sued her former employer,credit agricole cheuvreux north america,cheuvreux,alleging that her supervisor ran the office like a boys club,subjecting her to sexually suggestive comments and twice propositioning her for sex.she alleges that when she refused his sexual advances,he retaliated by berating her in front of other employees and ultimately firing her.mihalik asserted claims of gender discrimination and retaliation under the new york city human rights law the nychrl,admin.code a.the district court granted summary judgment to cheuvreux,dismissing the complaint.we conclude the district court erred in its application of the nychrl.because mihalik presented sufficient evidence to show there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding both her claims,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for trial.
statement of the case 
a.the facts 
with all conflicts in the evidence resolved and all reasonable inferences drawn in mihalik favor,the facts may be summarized as follows 
cheuvreux hires mihalik 
in july,cheuvreux hired mihalik as a vice president of alternative execution services,working under chief executive officer ian peacock.this position required mihalik to sell cheuvreux electronic equity trading services to institutional clients and cultivate them into regular customers.cheuvreux hired mihalik because she had contacts with several potential clients.cheuvreux realized,however,that mihalik was coming from a standing start and that these relationships were not immediately transferable.therefore,cheuvreux did not set a hard target for the revenue she had to generate.
mihalik treatment 
from the moment mihalik started,peacock paid special attention to her,asking her about her relationship status and whether she preferred older men or was a cougar.immediately,peacock asked mihalik to make sure her travel arrangements for a business trip coincided with his so they could enjoy traveling together and get to know each other.he commented on her appearance often,telling her she looked sexy and that her red shoes meant she was promiscuous.when she wore certain outfits,he told her that she should dress like that every day.you might get more clients in turn.about two months after she started,he asked her if she fanc ied dogging and then,when she did not know what that was,described the sex act to which he was referring.in response,mihalik would always tell peacock that his behavior was inappropriate and unbefitting a ceo.
peacock boorish behavior was typical of the boys club atmosphere in the cheuvreux office.the male employees regularly talked about visiting strip clubs and rated their female colleagues appearances.shortly after one of mihalik female had given birth,peacock joked that he could not see that because her breasts were in the way and then told her,i f this job does work out,scores a new york strip club is hiring.upon introducing mihalik to a new male employee in january,peacock told her to respect the new employee because he was male and more powerful than she was 
the male employees also frequently looked at pornography on their computers and peacock showed mihalik pornography once or twice a month.in one instance in august,mihalik noticed peacock laughing about something on his computer screen and,when she asked him what was so funny,he showed her an image of a man hanging from his genitals.he then emailed this image to other employees.also that month,another cheuvreux employee emailed mihalik a video parody of the television series csi,in which detectives used a black light to search for semen residue on a woman mouth 
in december,peacock propositioned mihalik twice,both times inviting her to spend the night with him at the cheuvreux flat.mihalik rejected the overtures,telling peacock in no uncertain terms that she had no interest in a personal relationship with him and that his conduct was offensive and shameful.after these rejections,peacock stopped sitting next to mihalik at the trading desk where he had sat for the first several months of her employment and began treating her differently.among other things,peacock began to exclude her from meetings,berate her in front of other employees,and criticize the quality of her work.
mihalik complains 
mihalik first complained about this behavior around the end of.by then,however,the head of human resources had resigned,leaving peacock responsible for most employment matters until a replacement was hired in march.thus,beginning in november,mihalik complained about peacock inappropriate sexual comments to david zack,the head compliance officer,instead of reporting her concerns to human resources.zack only response was,y ou ca prove it,he the ceo,and nobody is going to back you.
in april,mihalik presented zack with a draft email she intended to send to peacock.in the draft email,mihalik planned to confront peacock about criticizing her in front of her,calling his behavior very unprofessional and his criticisms inaccurate,and asking him to calmly discuss these matters with her in private.after reviewing the email,zack advised mihalik that she should send it only if she wanted to get fired.
mihalik performance problems 
mihalik performance was deficient in certain respects throughout her tenure.first,her monthly sales commissions were substantially below those of her peers.there were,however,mitigating circumstances.only one of mihalik clients was actively trading through the sales desk during her tenure.while mihalik had successfully signed several institutional clients,those clients had to finish negotiating their contracts with cheuvreux before they could generate revenue and these negotiations took several months.some of mihalik clients did not begin generating revenue for cheuvreux until after her discharge.in contrast,most of her colleagues had established books of clients who regularly conducted business with cheuvreux.
second,mihalik did not follow up on some sales leads in a timely manner.for example,in august,a week after peacock had provided mihalik and a colleague with three sales leads,mihalik emailed the colleague to ask if he knew anything about these accounts ian keeps asking us about.at the end of november,she sent a similar email to another colleague,asking about a sales lead that peacock had originally given her in.and in january,mihalik apologized to an overseas colleague for not following up with a client as she had promised,explaining that she was delayed because her airline had lost her luggage containing her business notes.
finally,mihalik missed approximately days of work during her nine months at cheuvreux due to vacations,sickness,and personal reasons.mihalik provided notice and obtained permission for all of her absences,however,and never exceeded her allotted number of vacation and sick days.
mihalik is discharged 
in april,after she failed to complete an assignment,cheuvreux discharged mihalik.peacock had instructed mihalik to conduct cold calls for seven days while he was away on business and to have twenty conversations with prospective clients each day.when mihalik did not complete the assignment,peacock scheduled a meeting with her.although initially he had intended only to give her a performance warning,peacock ultimately fired mihalik after she asked him,in an allusion to his sexual propositions,what not working out me and you or me at the company 
proceedings below 
after her discharge,mihalik filed a complaint against cheuvreux in the supreme court of the state of new york,new york county,alleging gender discrimination and retaliation in violation of the nychrl,admin.code a.mihalik did not assert claims under federal or state law.cheuvreux removed the case to the southern district of new york on the basis of diversity of citizenship of the parties 
after the close of discovery,cheuvreux moved for summary judgment.in a memorandum and order filed july,the district court granted cheuvreux motion,relying on the traditional federal standards for discrimination and retaliation,and noting that it was incorporat ing the special considerations for nychrl claims.mihalik credit agricole cheuvreux,civ,wl,at,july,citing williams hous,dep t.
the district court analyzed mihalik gender discrimination claim using the federal quid pro quo and hostile work environment theories.see id.at.considering her claim under the quid pro quo analysis,the district court concluded that mihalik failed to show any connection between peacock sexual propositions and any tangible job detriment,including her discharge.see id,at.the district court held that,alternatively,mihalik failed to show that the legitimate reason articulated by cheuvreux for her dismissal her poor job performance was pretextual.see id.at.
next,the district court performed a hostile work environment analysis.see id.at.although the court took note that plaintiffs are not required to satisfy the federal severe and pervasive conduct standard to prevail on a claim brought under the nychrl,id.at,see williams,at,it relied heavily on the first department admonition in williams new york city housing authority that the nychrl is not a general civility code,mihalik,wl,at quoting williams,at.thus,it held that mihalik had merely presented evidence of sporadic insensitive comments,rather than an actionable hostile work environment.id.at,quoting fullwood ass for the help of retarded children,civ,wl,at.
finally,the district court considered mihalik retaliation claims.while recognizing that,under the nychrl,protected activities include oppos ing any practice forbidden under this chapter,id.at alteration in original quoting admin.code,the district court held that mihalik failed to show a causal connection between her discharge and either her complaints of harassment or her rejection of peacock propositions.id.at.the court held that,alternatively,she had not presented evidence that cheuvreux reasons for her termination were pretextual.see id.at.
final judgment dismissing all mihalik claims was entered on july.this appeal followed.
discussion 
applicable.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.mcelwee cnty.of orange,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
the nychrl 
for many years,we construed the nychrl to be coextensive with its federal and state counterparts.see,estate of hamilton city of new york,cir leibowitz cornell,cir cruz coach stores,cir.in,however,the new york city council amended the nychrl by passing the local civil rights restoration act of the restoration act,local.see,loeffler staten island,cir williams hous,dep t acosta,see generally craig gurian,a return to eyes on the prize litigating under the restored new york city human rights law,fordham urb.as amended,the nychrl requires an independent analysis.see restoration act loeffler,at.nonetheless,district courts continued erroneously to apply federal standards to nychrl claims.see,jean united parcel serv.serv,cv,wl,at cir,summary order t he district court erred to the extent it found that federal standards for recovery are applied in determining employment discrimination claims under the city hrl simmons akin gump strauss hauer feld,llp,cv,wl,at cir,summary order t he district court erred to the extent that it analyzed the nychrl claim under the same standard as her claims under federal and state law.
in amending the nychrl,the city council expressed the view that the nychrl had been construed too narrowly and therefore underscore d that the provisions of new york city human rights law are to be construed independently from similar or identical provisions of new york state or federal statutes.restoration act.to bring about this change in the law,the act established two new rules of construction.first,it created a ratchet,by which interpretations of state and federal civil rights statutes can serve only as a floor below which the city human rights law can not fall.loeffler,at quoting restoration act.second,it amended the nychrl to require that its provisions be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof,regardless of whether federal or new york state civil and human rights laws,including those laws with provisions to provisions of this title,have been so construed.restoration act amending admin.code.
pursuant to these revisions,courts must analyze nychrl claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims,see restoration act hernandez kaisman,dep t gurian,supra,at,construing the nychrl provisions broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs,to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible,albunio city of new york.thus,even if the challenged conduct is not actionable under federal and state law,federal courts must consider separately whether it is actionable under the broader new york city standards.see hernandez,at while we find that the incidents do not rise to the level of severe and pervasive for purposes of a claim pursuant to the state hrl,this does not dispose of the question whether plaintiffs city hrl claim is still viable.
gender discrimination 
section a of the nychrl makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice f or an employer or an employee or agent thereof,because of the gender of any person,to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such person or to discriminate against such person in compensation or in terms,conditions or privileges of employment.admin.code a.applying the restoration act new rules of construction,the first department has established a new standard of liability for gender discrimination under the nychrl.
construing the phrase discriminate against in terms,conditions or privileges of employment broadly,the first department reasoned that forcing a targeted employee to suffer unwanted conduct imposes a different term or condition of employment on her,even if the harassing conduct does not rise to the level of being severe and pervasive.williams,at.therefore,the first department declined to use the federal severe and pervasive standard for nychrl claims and instead adopted a rule by which liability is normally determined simply by the existence of differential treatment.id.to establish a gender discrimination claim under the nychrl,the plaintiff need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she has been treated less well than other employees because of her gender.id.at accord nelson hsbc bank usa,dep t adopting the same standard of liability.
under this standard,the conduct severity and pervasiveness are relevant only to the issue of damages.see williams,at.to prevail on liability,the plaintiff need only show differential treatment that she is treated less well because of a discriminatory intent see id.at.indeed,the challenged conduct need not even be tangible like hiring or firing.id.at.
when applying this standard,however,district courts must be mindful that the nychrl is not a general civility code.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the plaintiff still bears the burden of showing that the conduct is caused by a discriminatory motive.it is not enough that a plaintiff has an overbearing or obnoxious boss.she must show that she has been treated less well at least in part because of her gender.id.at,emphasis added 
even if the plaintiff establishes that she was treated less well because of her gender,defendants may assert an affirmative defense whereby they can still avoid liability if they prove that the conduct complained of consists of nothing more than what a reasonable victim of discrimination would consider petty slights and trivial inconveniences.id.at quoting oncale sundowner offshore,d.as with most affirmative defenses,the employer has the burden of proving the conduct triviality under the nychrl.see drexel burnham lambert grp.galadari,cir citing blunt barrett,the party asserting an affirmative defense usually has the burden of proving it.the employer may prevail on summary judgment if it shows that a reasonable jury could conclude only that the conduct amounted to no more than a petty slight.williams,at.thus,courts may still dismiss truly insubstantial cases,where the defense is clear as a matter of law.id.
in evaluating both the plaintiff claim and the defendant affirmative defense,courts must consider the totality of the circumstances.hernandez,at.t he overall context in which the challenged conduct occurs can not be ignored.id.even a single comment that objectifies women made in circumstances where that comment would,for example,signal views about the role of women in the workplace may be actionable.williams,at.
although the first department has observed that a jury is often best suited to make this determination,id.at,we note that summary judgment still can be an appropriate mechanism for resolving nychrl claims.even in this context,summary judgment remains an integral part of the federal rules of civil procedure as a whole,which are designed to secure the just,speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.celotex catrett,d quoting.the restoration act can not,as a procedural matter,limit our interpretation of rule.see commc,wireless data,cir per curiam w here the matter in question is one covered by the federal rules of civil procedure,it is settled that the federal rule applies regardless of contrary state law.omission in original quoting gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.while the new york city council may provide a different substantive standard to be applied to particular claims in federal court,the same federal procedural rules apply.see,id.at under the erie doctrine,federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,even new york courts continue to grant and affirm the granting of summary judgment dismissing nychrl claims.see,melman montefiore med,dep t e ven after the passage of the restoration act,not every plaintiff asserting a discrimination claim will be entitled to reach a jury bennett,at affirming grant of summary judgment williams,at same.accordingly,district courts may still grant summary judgment with respect to nychrl claims if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding plaintiff claim and the employer affirmative defense.see.a celotex,at.
retaliation 
section of the nychrl prohibits employers from retaliat ing or discriminat ing in any manner against any person because such person has opposed any practice forbidden under this chapter.admin.code.the restoration act amended this section to further provide 
the retaliation or discrimination complained of under this subdivision need not result in an ultimate action with respect to employment,or in a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment,provided,however,that the retaliatory or discriminatory act or acts complained of must be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity.
restoration act amending admin.code.thus,to prevail on a retaliation claim under the nychrl,the plaintiff must show that she took an action opposing her employer discrimination,see albunio,at,and that,as a result,the employer engaged in conduct that was reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in such action,see williams,at.
in accordance with the restoration act rules of construction,new york courts have broadly interpreted the nychrl retaliation provisions.see,albunio,at.the new york court of appeals has held that oppos ing any practice can include situations where a person,before the retaliatory conduct occurred,merely made clear her disapproval of the defendant discrimination by communicating to him,in substance,that she thought his treatment of the victim was wrong.id.at.
similarly,the first department has held that no challenged conduct may be deemed nonretaliatory unless a jury could not reasonably conclude from the evidence that such conduct was reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in protected activity.williams,at.this assessment should be made with a keen sense of workplace realities,of the fact that the chilling effect of particular conduct is,and of the fact that a jury is generally best suited to evaluate the impact of retaliatory conduct.id.
analysis of nychrl claims 
to summarize,federal courts reviewing nychrl claims are to be guided by the following considerations 
nychrl claims must be analyzed separately and independently from federal and state discrimination claims,see restoration act hernandez,at 
the totality of the circumstances must be considered because the overall context in which the challenged conduct occurs can not be ignored,hernandez,at 
the federal severe or pervasive standard of liability no longer applies to nychrl claims,and the severity or pervasiveness of conduct is relevant only to the scope of damages,see williams,at 
the nychrl is not a general civility code,see williams,at,and a defendant is not liable if the plaintiff fails to prove the conduct is caused at least in part by discriminatory or retaliatory motives,see id.at,or if the defendant proves the conduct was nothing more than petty slights or trivial inconveniences,id.at 
while courts may still dismiss truly insubstantial cases,even a single comment may be actionable in the proper context,id.at and 
summary judgment is still appropriate in nychrl cases,but only if the record establishes as a matter of law that a reasonable jury could not find the employer liable under any theory,see melman,at furfero john,dep t.
application 
we consider in turn mihalik claims of gender discrimination and retaliation.
gender discrimination 
applying the standards set out above,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing mihalik gender discrimination claim because there is a genuine dispute as to whether she was treated less well than her male colleagues because of her gender.mihalik presented evidence that men in the cheuvreux office objectified women by openly viewing and sharing pornography,discussing their jaunts to strip clubs,rating the female employees appearances,and making lascivious comments about women outfits and bodies.see hernandez,at c omments and emails objectifying women bodies and exposing them to sexual ridicule,even if considered isolated,clearly signaled that defendant considered it appropriate to foster an office environment that degraded women.there was even evidence that peacock explicitly told mihalik that male employees should be respected because they were male and thus more powerful than women.see williams,at a single comment that objectifies women made in circumstances where that comment would,for example,signal views about the role of women in the workplace may be actionable.
mihalik was subjected to this environment,and also had to suffer peacock unwanted sexual attention,including two sexual propositions.if a jury were to credit mihalik testimony,it could reasonably find that she was treated less well than her male colleagues because of her gender,and that the conduct complained of was neither petty nor trivial.id.at,see also hernandez,at the mere fact that men and women are both exposed to the same offensive circumstances on the job site does not mean that,as a matter of law,their work conditions are equally harsh.quoting petrosino bell,cir.
the district court reached a different conclusion by relying on reasons that find no support in the nychrl,as interpreted by new york courts.first,the district court analyzed mihalik gender discrimination claim under two federal standards of liability the quid pro quo analysis looking for a connection between the discriminatory conduct and a materially adverse employment action and a hostile work environment analysis looking for conduct severe or pervasive enough to alter the terms of mihalik employment.mihalik,wl,at.williams made clear,however,that the nychrl does not require either materially adverse employment actions or severe and pervasive conduct.see williams,at.instead,a focus on unequal treatment based on gender regardless of whether the conduct is tangible like hiring or firing or not is in fact the approach that is most faithful to the uniquely broad and remedial purposes of the local statute.id.at.thus,peac
