mujahid farid filed a section claim against of whom are state prison officials at either woodbourne correctional facility wcf or clinton correctional six claims for relief first,due process and state law violations based on the filing and conduct of a disciplinary hearing second,first amendment violations based on disciplinary actions resulting from his possession and distribution of a booklet called the politics of parole third,constitutional and state law violations based on the seizure of documents related to the politics of parole fourth,constitutional violations arising out of his transfer to another facility while he was undergoing medical treatment fifth,constitutional and state law violations arising out of the alleged deprivation of medical treatment and sixth,constitutional violations arising from a prison transfer that disrupted a scheduled trial.all but the first and sixth claims are before us here.
the present appeal involves three separate opinions by the district court.first,the united states district court for the southern district of new york castel,dismissed without prejudice farid third and sixth claims due to his failure to exhaust available administrative remedies,as required by the prison litigation reform act of the plra,a.farid ellen,civ,wl,farid i.then,after denying farid motion to supplement his complaint with new defendants and allegations,the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the first,fourth and fifth claims,holding that farid had failed to come forward with evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find in his favor on those claims.farid ellen,civ,wl,farid ii.finally,in a published decision,the district court addressed farid second claim his first amendment allegations,and held that the prison contraband and rules were unconstitutionally vague as applied to farid.the court entered a permanent injunction ordering defendant goord a to reinstate farid lost credits and b to strike the violation from his disciplinary record.but,on the grounds of qualified immunity,the court also granted defendants summary judgment with respect to the award of any monetary relief on this claim.farid ellen,d farid iii.
the parties have appealed and these decisions.we affirm them in all respects save one because we find that defendants conduct violated clearly established rights,the existence of which a reasonable prison official should have known,we vacate the finding of qualified immunity and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
farid is serving an indeterminate sentence with a maximum of life imprisonment.see farid travis,dep t.from december to june,he was incarcerated at wcf,a state prison in woodbourne,new york.during this time,he was a member of an inmate organization known as the long termers committee ltc.the new york department of corrections docs recognized and approved the existence of the ltc,whose stated purpose,inter alia,was to advocate for positive and constructive change in the criminal justice system,particularly as it relates to the unique concerns of long term prisoners.members of the ltc,including farid,agreed to be governed by the committee,one of which provides that all correspondence,callouts and fiscal expenditures must be reviewed and approved by the staff advisor to the ltc.section of the lists the consequences of violation,including censure or reprimand for one violation suspension from ltc for multiple violations and expulsion from ltc for repeated and serious violations.none of the listed consequences entail,or even suggest,discipline under prison rules.
of course,prison officials regulate group and organizational activities within the prison,but they do so pursuant to docs rules,not under those of internal prisoner groups.thus,for example,inmates are not permitted to engage in unauthorized organizational activities or meetings,or to possess or distribute unauthorized materials.see,docs institutional rule of conduct,b v an unauthorized organization is any gang or any organization which has not been approved by the deputy commissioner for program services.
docs rules also prohibit contraband and smuggling.the contraband provision,rule,b xiii reads as follows 
in addition to those items of contraband specifically identified by this rule series,an inmate shall not possess any item unless it has been specifically authorized by the superintendent or designee,the rules of the department or the local rules of the facility.
and,the rule,rule,b i,provides that a n inmate shall not smuggle or attempt to smuggle or solicit others to smuggle any item in or out of the facility or from one area to another.transfer of items which are contraband under rule constitutes smuggling under rule.it is these two rules under which farid was eventually disciplined.
on april,officers conducted random searches of cells at wcf.no contraband was found in farid cell during this search.however,in another inmate cell,officials discovered a copy of a booklet called the politics of parole an analysis by the woodbourne long termers committee,which among other things criticized parole policies and practices.the page booklet also contained profiles of nine prisoners,including farid.the district court noted that the booklet has the appearance of a professionally formatted document.the booklet argued,inter alia,that the parole board is prone to corruption and political influence,that t he weight of the injustice of the criminal justice system falls disproportionately on communities of color,and that i t will require the unified effort of every element of the community,including prisoners,to bring about the needed change.the booklet is dated april for the proceedings the wcf address of the ltc on its cover page,thus arguably giving the impression that it was prepared by the ltc.
on or about april,while farid was at his work assignment,corrections officers searched his cell and confiscated various written materials.among the papers seized were envelopes of papers and approximately pages of parole related articles.also confiscated were seven copies of the politics of parole.other materials taken included m ultiple letters to civilians explaining the book and its distribution,envelopes to civilians that coincide with letters and a list of addresses that correspond to envelopes and letters.
at a later deposition,farid acknowledged that he was the principal author of the politics of parole and that he created it working with the ltc.he accepted the characterization of the work as having been prepared by the ltc.farid also acknowledged that the work was not authorized by docs.
on april,farid received an inmate misbehavior report imr alleging that he had committed several disciplinary violations by possessing and distributing,without authorization,copies of the booklet,letters and envelopes.specifically,farid was charged with violating the contraband provision,rule,through his possession of the politics of parole and associated items smuggling or attempting to smuggle in violation of rule possessing unauthorized organizational materials in violation of rule giving unauthorized legal assistance in violation of rule soliciting foods or services in violation of rule and violating rule,which provides that a n inmate shall comply with and follow the guidelines and instructions given by staff regarding facility correspondence procedures.see farid iii,d at.
deputy superintendent of administration thomas miller,a defendant in this action,presided at an april,tier iii disciplinary hearing regarding the charges set forth in the april,imr.see porter coughlin,cir the most serious violations are the subject of tier iii hearings and may result in special housing unit confinement for the remainder of the inmate prison time,as well as forfeiture of good time credits.farid was provided with an opportunity to select an individual to assist him in the hearing,and chose corrections counselor charles davis,a.at the hearing,farid raised a variety of defenses,including allegations that defendant and superintendent of the facility john keane had targeted him because with other members of the invited state legislators to visit the prison the previous august as part of a conference on parole and prison issues.farid also argued that the imr should be dismissed for lack of clear notice of any particular conduct he supposed ly violated.
lieutenant lawrence jones,also a defendant in this action,testified that another officer had found the politics of parole in an inmate cell during an april search.jones had checked with the staff advisor to the ltc and the deputy superintendent and determined that the pamphlet had not been properly authorized,and so he instituted an investigation to determine who was making the pamphlet.jones and keane testified that they would have had no objection to farid possession of the pamphlet if he had written and possessed it himself,but that it was contraband because it purported to be an official ltc publication,which it was not,as it had not been approved.moreover,jones said that farid had violated the contraband ban by possessing other inmates parole materials,since an inmate should not possess another inmate papers showing their crime and other facts about their criminal history.
at the conclusion of the hearing on april,miller found farid guilty of the possession of contraband,soliciting goods or services and smuggling.miller found farid not guilty of all other offenses.miller imposed sanctions against farid of confinement for ninety days in the special housing unit shu a loss of ninety days of various,commissary,special events and a loss of three months of good time credits.farid disciplinary history indicates that he served the shu portion of the punishment between april,and july.
in june of,farid appealed the disciplinary findings to defendant glenn goord,the docs commissioner.acting on behalf of defendant goord,defendant donald selsky,the docs director of shus,dismissed the charge of soliciting goods or services but allowed the other disciplinary findings and the punishments to stand.hence,the disciplinary charges that were sustained and form the basis for the discipline imposed were violations of the rules governing contraband and smuggling.these are the rules whose constitutionality we must consider in the present appeal.
proceedings below 
farid filed his claim in september.as noted above,the district court resolved the issues that are on appeal here in three separate opinions and an order.
in farid i,wl,issued on december,the court dismissed without prejudice farid third and sixth claims on the basis that he had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the plra 
in farid ii,wl,issued on january,after the close of discovery,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on the first,fourth and fifth claims,finding that farid had failed to show evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find in his favor.the court,however,denied,without prejudice,summary judgment as to farid first amendment claim,and invited the parties to pursue the issue through more fully developed briefing.the court remarked that t he briefs submitted by the parties have left many questions unanswered as to the first amendment claim,and then urged the plaintiff to explain precisely what speech or conduct he argues was constitutionally protected and precisely what adverse action he suffered.id.at.
instead of doing that,farid tried to take an interlocutory appeal to our court.on november,we dismissed that appeal,and defendants again moved for summary judgment on the first amendment claim.in an order filed on july,the district court made its suggestion more explicit,this time specifically asking the parties to submit further argument on whether the rules were vague as applied.they complied.
finally,in a published opinion issued on august,farid iii,d,the district court held that the contraband and smuggling prison regulations under which farid had been disciplined were unconstitutionally vague,but that defendants were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity.first,the court concluded that 
on this record rules and,as they were applied to farid,did not contain explicit standards and gave prison officers unfettered discretion in interpreting what conduct is prohibited.that unfettered discretion impermissibly permitted the viewpoint expressed by the inmate to enter into an evaluation of whether the conduct was violative of the rules.
id.at.despite finding a first amendment violation,the court held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity 
all defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the defense of qualified immunity because the right was not clearly established.alternatively,and assuming,arguendo,that the right was clearly established,summary judgment in favor of defendants would be proper because reasonable prison officials could have disagreed as to whether the right would be violated by their actions.
id.at.the district court therefore declined to grant money damages to farid,but did order defendants to remove the punishment from his disciplinary record,and to restore to him the three months of good time credits he had lost.id.at.
farid appealed the district court grants of summary judgment and qualified immunity,and we appointed counsel.defendants the district court finding of a first amendment violation.we consider each of these issues in turn 
ii.farid vagueness challenge 
the first question we consider is whether,in the special constitutional context of prison regulations,the rules under which farid was disciplined were unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.we agree with the district court that they were.
it is well established that while inmates do not shed all constitutional rights at the prison gates,l awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights.chatin coombe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in light of this background principle,we have approved a test for determining whether a prison rule is unconstitutionally vague as applied a court must first determine whether the statute gives the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and then consider whether the law provides explicit standards for those who apply it.id.
in chatin,which the parties agree is the most relevant precedent,we considered whether a docs disciplinary rule barring r eligious services,speeches or addresses by inmates other than those approved by the superintendent was unconstitutionally vague as applied to silent,individual prayer.id.at quoting rule.we found that it was,rejecting docs argument that the rule vagueness was cured by an internal docs directive and memorandum from prison staff,which together clarified that silent prayer was covered by the rule.id.at.we held that prisoners are not required to integrate multiple directives in order to divine the rules governing their conduct.id.at.
here,farid was charged with violating the prison bans on contraband rule and smuggling rule as noted above,the contraband provision states 
in addition to those items of contraband specifically identified by this rule series,an inmate shall not possess any item unless it has been specifically authorized by the superintendent or designee,the rules of the department or the local rules of the facility.
this rule,by its express terms,is addressed to possess ion of an item.it is not directed to organizational activity,distribution of materials within the prison facility or the manner in which the mails are used.farid iii,d at.
the rule provides that 
an inmate shall not smuggle or attempt to smuggle or solicit others to smuggle any item in or out of the facility or from one area to another.
in farid case,the application of the smuggling prohibition was based entirely on his alleged violation of the contraband fact that the booklet was found to be contraband meant that distributing it was smuggling.
we agree with the district court that these rules were unconstitutionally vague as applied to farid,both because they failed to give him adequate notice and because they failed adequately to constrain the discretion of the prison officials who had the power to impose them.
because the smuggling charge under rule was based entirely on the status of the materials as contraband,we begin with rule,the contraband rule.if the contraband charge is constitutionally infirm,it follows that the smuggling charge also must fail.the basic shortcoming with the contraband rule,as applied here,is precisely the one identified by the district court there is nothing in the rule indicating that materials which violate a prison organization internal are contraband in violation of the prison rules.the internal of the ltc require each member to receive and become familiar with their contents.they expressly provide that a ll correspondence must be reviewed and approved by the staff advisor.all communications with the staff advisor are to be made through the chairman of the ltc.section of the states that a member determined to have violated a provision of the constitution,or facility or departmental policies and procedures may,after being afforded an opportunity to be heard and to present his views,be sanctioned in accordance with this section.sanctions include censure,suspension or expulsion from the group.seems to be the the pamphlet here violated these,farid was subject to these specific sanctions.but he was instead disciplined under prison regulations.there is nothing at all in the that gives notice that discipline under prison regulations,which permit far more severe as the three months in the shu which farid had to expulsion from a prisoner organization,can be a consequence of doing nothing more than infringing the ltc.farid knowledge of the ltc,therefore,did not suffice to give him notice,actual or constructive,that his breach of the could be deemed to violate prison regulations.accordingly,unless he had other reasons to know that what he did was against prison rules,these regulations were improperly applied to him.
of course,a breach of a group can also,independently,violate prison rules.and defendants argue that this is the case here.they point out that the contraband rule is broad,and contend that this breadth saves it from farid challenge.as we have seen,the rule identifies as contraband that which is not specifically authorized by the superintendent or designee,the rules of the department or the local rules of the facility.defendants assert that far from demonstrating vagueness,the breadth of this prohibition sufficed to let farid know that anything lacking the prior approval of the superintendent was contraband under prison regulations.
but this explanation is neither convincing nor consistent with defendants other statements,such as defendant miller testimony that farid would not have been in violation of the prison rules if he had simply produced and possessed the pamphlet himself without including the ltc imprimatur on it.farid iii,d at defendant miller,who presided at the hearing,asserted that had defendant complied with the of ltc,the politics of parole would not have been contraband.as applied that is,on the facts before was solely the alleged violation of the ltc,the failure to have the document approved according to that organization rules which led to the pamphlet classification as contraband.and that is not sufficient to give farid adequate notice of a potential punishment under the prison regulations.the law does not require farid to engage in some kind of interpretive construction,combining the ltc with the prison rules in order to determine whether materials that violate the former might at the will of prison officials be read to constitute contraband under the latter.that is precisely the kind of interpretive burden that we rejected in chatin,and we do so again here.
defendants repeatedly emphasize that farid had actual notice of the ltc rules,particularly since he and other ltc members had been and ltc correspondence must be authorized.in the spring of,about a year before farid was disciplined,members of the ltc violated prison rules by organizing a conference at wcf without following proper procedures.defendant keane,wcf superintendent,sent a letter to members of the ltc informing them that they must follow the proper procedures for inviting community guests to participate in correctional facility functions.keane attached to this letter the ltc and the docs directive regarding inmate organizations and,that farid was aware of the regulations is evident,defendants say,because of the furtive nature of his activity in producing the was written on a computer that he was not authorized to use for private purposes.defs br.
all of this,they argue,differentiates the present case from chatin,because the prisoner in that case was neither warned that his conduct was proscribed nor subjectively believed it to be.see chatin,at.and unlike chatin,where discipline was based solely on docs rules which were not distributed to inmates,at,farid violated the ltc,which were available to,and signed by,all members of the ltc.so long as farid actually knew that his conduct was prohibited,defendants assert his vagueness claim must fail.see duamutef,cir.
this argument did not convince the district court,and it does not convince us.see farid iii,d at the respondents fare no better by trying to link possession and distribution of the booklet to an earlier warning by the superintendent to the ltc that members of the outside community may not be invited to the prison without advance notice and permission.the warning surely served to remind farid and the other members of the ltc that they had signed and were bound by them.but that does not cure the problem the district court identified,which is that,in farid case,his behavior was punished not as a violation of the of the ltc but as a breach of prison rules 
moreover,even if we agreed with defendants that farid had adequate notice that failure to have the pamphlet approved in accordance with ltc might subject him to prison discipline,that conclusion would only satisfy half of the vagueness inquiry we outlined in chatin.in addition to being unconstitutional for failure to provide notice,a statute or regulation may be unconstitutionally vague when it fails to provide sufficiently explicit standards for those who apply it when it impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen,judges and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.chatin,at quoting grayned city of rockford.in other words,in order to survive a vagueness challenge,a rule must both provide adequate notice to those who are governed by it and adequately cabin the discretion of those who apply it.
the prison rules against contraband and smuggling,as applied to plaintiff here,gave almost complete enforcement discretion to prison officials.although the district court did not give extensive consideration to this issue,it concluded that the application of the contraband and rules contained no explicit standards and placed unfettered discretion in the hands of the prison staff insofar as the rules were applied to written materials.farid iii,d at.indeed,the contraband rule allowed prison officials to determine in their unbounded discretion what was and was not specifically authorized in the facility.
farid was disciplined under prison rules prohibiting smuggling and the possession of contraband.but the only thing that made his pamphlet in turn meant that he engaged in smuggling by giving it to other the fact that the pamphlet was not approved in accordance with the internal of his prisoner organization,the ltc.we agree with the district court that the application of prison rules in these circumstances was unconstitutionally vague both because it failed to give farid notice that his actions were prohibited and because it failed adequately to cabin the discretion of prison officials.
iii.defendants claim of qualified immunity 
our finding that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague,however,does not by itself mean that defendants are liable.the district court,having found a violation of farid first amendment rights,held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.their conduct,the court concluded,did not violate any clearly established rights about which a reasonable person would have known.having carefully considered the record,we can not agree.
qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages as a result of their performance of discretionary functions,and serves to protect government officials from the burdens of costly,but insubstantial,lawsuits.lennon miller,cir citing harlow fitzgerald.such immunity shields government officials from civil liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow,at.a defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity 
if he adduce s sufficient facts such that no reasonable jury,looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all inferences most favorable to,the plaintiffs,could conclude that it was objectively unreasonable for the defendant to believe that he was acting in a fashion that did not clearly violate an established federally protected right.
robison via,cir quoting halperin kissinger,scalia,sitting by designation.
we first consider whether defendants actions violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right.for a right to be clearly established,it must have been recognized in a particularized rather than a general sense.moore andreno,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we must therefore define the disputed right at the appropriate level of specificity.wilson layne.
in the present case,defendants have suggested two potential justifications for farid punishment under the prison regulations either as a direct result of his violation of the ltc or as a consequence of the contraband rule,which farid allegedly breached indirectly by violating the ltc.we have explained why we think that neither of these justifications is constitutionally adequate.for qualified immunity purposes,however,we must more precisely define the rights at issue,and only then determine whether they were clearly established.
in keeping with defendants two possible characterizations of their conduct,we find that there are two characterizations of the relevant right either as a right not to be punished under rule a,the prison contraband regulation for violating rule b,the ltc or as a right not to be punished under prison regulations that are too vague to constrain official conduct or to give prisoners notice of what conduct is prohibited,unless read in conjunction with the ltc then only arguably.we find that both of these rights are clearly established,albeit for different reasons,and that a jury might well find that a reasonable officer should have known that they were so established.moreover,fact questions exist as to defendants justification for their conduct and therefore as to which of the rights described above has arguably been infringed.summary judgment on the question of qualified immunity was therefore inappropriate,and must be vacated.
first,defendants seem to suggest that farid violation of ltc was by itself sufficient to justify discipline under prison regulations.see farid iii,d at defendant miller,who presided at the hearing,asserted that had farid complied with the of the ltc,the politics of parole would not have been contraband.we have already explained why this is not constitutionally sufficient.see supra at.for qualified immunity purposes,however,there is a separate question,which is whether the right violated by this conduct was clearly established.we have no trouble concluding that the right not to be punished under one set of rules for violations of another is clearly established.the very essence of constitutional prohibitions on vagueness is that rules must give notice of the conduct that they not another set of rules prohibit,and must constrain the discretion of officials who apply them.this is impossible where prohibitions and punishments are set out in one set of rules,but officials remain free to impose punishments established in an entirely different set of rules not referenced by the first.
there is another way to read defendants argument,any vagueness in the application of the prison contraband regulation is cured by the fact that farid had notice of the ltc.this seems to be the main thrust of defendants argument on appeal,and it is different from the first argument because it begins with the prison regulations,not the ltc,and essentially argues that prisoners must read them in conjunction.in this way,it is not so much a direct defense of the prison contraband regulation as it is an argument that the regulation can be read alongside the internal of a prisoners organization to achieve a constitutional result.we have explained above why we do not think that the existence of the ltc cures the vagueness of the prison contraband and smuggling regulations as they were applied in this instance.see supra at.but for qualified immunity purposes,we must also consider defendants second characterization of the rights they might have violated.under this second purported justification,the relevant question is whether prisoners right not to be punished under docs rules,without sufficient notice that their conduct is prohibited by those rules,is clearly where that conduct is prohibited by other rules 
we conclude that it is.although we are aware of no cases involving the vagueness of the precise regulations challenged here,our conclusion is strongly supported by caselaw in this circuit.qualified immunity can be denied where a rule is clearly foreshadow ed by past precedent,tellier fields,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and similar cases,applying similar regulations,have come to similar conclusions.most notably for present purposes,in chatin we found that a prison regulation banning unauthorized religious services was unconstitutionally vague as applied to a prisoner silent,individual prayer,where the prisoner had no actual or imputed knowledge that he would be subjected to discipline for such prayer.the district court distinguished same case on which it had relied in finding the rules unconstitutionally the grounds that different prison rules are at issue and the nature of the conduct included the implied representation in the written materials that an officially approved organization of inmates had been given institutional permission to transmit the materials.farid iii,d at.
but for a right to be clearly established for purposes of a qualified immunity defense,the precise conduct at issue need not previously have been ruled unlawful.zahrey coffey,cir.and chatin comes mighty close to holding the conduct here at issue to be unlawful.as noted above,in that case we rejected docs argument that a rule potential vagueness could be cured where it was read in conjunction with an internal docs directive and memorandum specifying the rule reach.see chatin,at.we held that prisoners are not required to synthesize prison regulations with other potentially relevant restrictions on their conduct.here,too,we reject defendants argument that farid should have read the contraband and smuggling rules alongside the ltc internal and interpreted them in conjunction as saying that conduct barred under the latter is punishable under the former.and,as a result of chatin,we also reject the argument that it was not clearly established that prisoners could not be expected to synthesize disparate regulations.
multiple questions of material fact exist regarding these two potential theories of qualified immunity.first and most prominently,questions of material fact exist as to which of the two theories is properly the focus of defendants claim.that is,it is unclear whether defendants actually intended to punish farid under the prison contraband rule,or whether they were instead punishing him simply for violating the ltc.the thrust of their argument on appeal tends to suggest the former,but as the district court noted,many of their statements below suggest the latter.see,farid iii,d at.this is a distinction with an important difference,because it is on summary evaluate defendants claims of qualified immunity without knowing the basis for those claims.these questions of material fact would constitute sufficient reasons in and of themselves to vacate and remand the grant of summary
