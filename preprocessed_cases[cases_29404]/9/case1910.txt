in this sex discrimination and equal pay action filed pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,and section b of the equal pay act of,d,appellants appeal the district court grant of family dollar stores,family dollar motion to dismiss strike class claims under federal rules of civil procedure c,f,and d d,and the district court denial of appellants first motion to amend their complaint.we find that the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint was based on an erroneous interpretation of wal mart stores,dukes,d,and the denial was thus an abuse of discretion.without resolving the class certification issue,we reverse and remand for the district court to consider whether,based on our interpretation of wal mart,the proposed amended complaint satisfies the class certification requirements of federal rule of civil procedure.
family dollar operates a chain of over stores in more than forty states.its operations are divided into regions,each run by a vice president,and then into districts,each run by a district manager.a district,which can vary in size from a single city to an area within multiple states,includes to retail stores,each run by a salaried store manager.grace family dollar stores,cir.family dollar has approximately district managers.
appellants are named plaintiffs and a putative class consisting of females who are,or have been,store managers of family dollar stores.appellants primarily allege they are paid less than male store managers who perform the same job,requiring the same skill,responsibility and effort,under similar working conditions.in relevant part,count i of their complaint asserts a disparate impact claim predicated on the following assertions

count ii alleges a of disparate treatment in violation of title vii,and asserts that family dollar,who engages in centralized control over compensation of store managers,willfully violated title vii by paying the plaintiffs and other similarly situated females wages unequal to similarly situated males.count iv asserts a violation of the equal pay act.appellants seek injunctive and equitable relief,back pay,attorneys fees and costs,and punitive damages.
in,appellants filed their complaint in the district court for the northern district of alabama.upon a grant of family dollar motion to dismiss or transfer,the case was transferred to the district court for the western district of north carolina.in opposing the motion to dismiss but consenting to transfer,appellants cited dukes wal mart,cir on reh g en banc sub nom.cir,pointing out that t he ninth circuit has now affirmed certification of such a nationwide class having virtually identical claims of sex discrimination in pay to those brought in this case.as is relevant here,the ninth circuit dukes decision was subsequently reversed by the supreme court in wal mart,d.
following the transfer,family dollar filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings,arguing that appellants would be unable to satisfy the class action requirements in rule b.the filing of this motion had the effect of staying discovery.the district court denied family dollar motion without prejudice,holding that the class allegations in the complaint satisfied the pleading standards as established in bell atlantic twombly,d,and ashcroft iqbal,d.the court further found that a fully developed evidentiary record was necessary to make findings as to class certification.
in july,family dollar moved for summary judgment,but the court stayed the motion pending the completion of discovery.in august,family dollar moved for a protective order with respect to class certification discovery,which the court denied.from january to july,the parties unsuccessfully tried to resolve their dispute through mediation.
following of the case to a different judge,in september,family dollar filed a motion to dismiss strike the class allegations pursuant to rules c,f,and rule d d.family dollar argued that wal mart,which was issued by the supreme court in june,foreclosed appellants class allegations and the monetary relief sought in the complaint.
appellants opposed the motion to dismiss and moved the court for leave to file their first amended complaint arguing that the proposed amended complaint elaborate s on the original complaint allegation of centralized control of compensation for store managers at the corporate level.in the proposed amended complaint,appellants allege and challenge at least four policies.first,appellants assert the existence of a mandatory salary range for store managers set annually by the corporate headquarters,which locks in prior disparities between male and female store managers compensation.only corporate vice presidents can grant exceptions above the salary range,and they grant these exceptions disproportionally in favor of men.second,appellants allege the existence of an annual pay raise percentage set by corporate headquarters that corresponds to performance ratings.regional managers and divisional vice presidents grant exceptions above the pay raise percentage,and significantly greater exceptions are granted to men.third,appellants claim a headwinds compensation criteria for store managers that takes into account prior experience,prior pay,quartile rankings and other specific criteria which have a disparate impact.finally,appellants allege the existence of a of compensation structured to pay less to persons promoted to store managers than to persons hired from outside the company to the same position,where women are disproportionately promoted to store manager positions,while men are disproportionately hired into such jobs.
the district court granted family dollar motion to dismiss,but denied appellants motion for leave to amend.in granting family dollar request and dismissing the class allegations,the district court first relied on appellants admission that their claims were virtually identical to those asserted by the wal mart plaintiffs.further,the court reasoned that as a matter of law under wal mart,appellants can not satisfy the rule a commonality requirement because they allege they were discriminated against on the basis of their gender as a result of subjective decisions made at the local store levels.the court dismissed the equal pay act class claims on the same basis.additionally,the district court held that appellants claims fail to satisfy the predominance requirement in rule b.
in denying appellants motion for leave to amend,the court first held that amendment was futile because the only source of alleged discrimination in the proposed complaint is the discretionary pay of managers,which are foreclosed under wal mart.second,the court found that amendment would be prejudicial to family dollar because the original complaint was filed over three years prior,and the new complaint alleges a new theory only in an attempt to avoid wal mart.
appellants timely petitioned this court under federal rule of civil procedure f for interlocutory appeal of the class certification decision.
we granted appellants petition under rule f,which authorizes courts of appeals to review decisions denying or granting certification appellants did not petition us directly for interlocutory review of the decision denying leave to amend the complaint.appellate jurisdiction pursuant to rule f interlocutory provision lies only where the subject matter of the appeal is the grant or denial of class certification.fed.civ.pro.f see brown nucor,cir a ppellants can not appeal a discovery order under rule f.thus,family dollar contends we lack jurisdiction to review the district court denial of appellants motion for leave to amend their complaint.
we find that under our pendent appellate jurisdiction jurisprudence,we have jurisdiction and exercise our discretion to review the denial of the motion for leave to amend.see rux republic of sudan,cir stating that pendent appellate jurisdiction,a judicially created exception to the final judgment rule,is discretionary.pendent appellate jurisdiction is available only in two scenarios when an issue is inextricably intertwined with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal or when review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of an immediately appealable issue.id.quoting swint chambers cnty.comm n,d.
we may review the decision under the inextricably intertwined methodology.two separate rulings are inextricably intertwined if the same specific question will underlie both the appealable and the order,such that resolution of the question will necessarily resolve the appeals from both orders at once.ealy pinkerton gov t,wl,at cir,per curiam,unpublished quoting myers hertz,cir alterations omitted.here,the crux of the denial of class certification based on the allegations of the original complaint,and the denial of leave to amend the complaint turns on the district court interpretation of wal mart.because the interpretation of wal mart underlies both the appealable certification decision and the decision,and resolution of the interpretation of wal mart will necessarily resolve both appeals,we find that our exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction is proper.
we may also review the decision under the necessary to ensure meaningful review methodology.an issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review if resolution of the appealable issue necessarily resolves the nonappealable issue or where review of the nonappealable issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the appealable one.berrey asarco,cir.here,as detailed below,the proposed amended complaint includes specific policies that allegedly cause a disparate impact polices not specified in the original complaint that would ensure meaningful review of the class certification decision.thus,we exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the denial of leave to amend the complaint.
appellants raise three primary arguments on appeal.first,appellants contend that the district court erred in holding that pursuant to wal mart,the proposed class claims in the original complaint fail to satisfy rule a commonality requirement.second,appellants urge that the district court failed to conduct a rigorous analysis of the certification issue and failed to consider the evidence.finally,appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant leave to amend the complaint.because we find that the proposed amended complaint contains substantial allegations of centralized control,which are necessary to satisfy the commonality requirement for class certification as set forth in wal mart,we focus our review in this appeal on the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint.
we review a district court decision to deny leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion,and it is our policy to liberally allow amendment in keeping with the spirit of federal rule of civil procedure a.galustian peter,cir.a district court abuses its discretion by resting its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact,or by misapprehending the law with respect to underlying issues in litigation.quince orchard valley citizens ass n,hodel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court denied appellants request for leave to amend their complaint for two primary reasons.first,the district court determined that the proposed amendment was foreclosed by wal mart,reasoning that like the original complaint,the proposed complaint pointed to subjective,individualized decisions and failed to satisfy the commonality requirement of rule a second,the district court found that amendment would be prejudicial to family dollar because the proposed complaint was filed three years after the filing of the original complaint and alleges a new legal theory in order to avoid wal mart.we address each rationale in turn.
the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint on grounds that it was foreclosed by wal mart is erroneous and based on a misapprehension of the applicable law.a review of wal mart and its principles reveal the district court error.
in wal mart,the supreme court considered whether the commonality requirement under rule for class actions was satisfied in a sex discrimination suit alleging violations of title vii.the plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of million current and former female employees of wal mart stores,wal mart,asserting that wal mart local managers exercised discretion over employees pay and promotions in a manner that disproportionally favored male employees and had an unlawful disparate impact on the female employees.further,the plaintiffs alleged that wal mart failure to curtail its managers discretion essentially amounted to unlawful disparate treatment.
in holding that the allegations were insufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement for class actions,the court found that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that the class members suffered the same injury,their claims did not depend upon a common contention capable of classwide resolution.wal mart.at.the court reasoned that in the title vii context,one individual claim turns on the reason for the particular employment decision.id.at quoting cooper fed.reserve bank of richmond,d.and,in the class action context,w ithout some glue holding the reasons for all those decisions together,it will be impossible to say that examination of all class members claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was i disfavored.id.
the court explained that such glue might exist if the employer uses a biased testing procedure that produces a common result or there is s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination.id.at quoting.of sw.falcon,d.the latter form was more applicable in wal mart,yet the court found that a general policy of discrimination was entirely absent.id.specifically,the court pointed to wal mart express policy forbidding sex discrimination expert testimony of a strong corporate culture that made it vulnerable to gender bias but which lacked a nexus to employment decisions and a corporate policy of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters,which to the court was just the opposite of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action because it was a policy against having uniform employment practices.id.at.
the court acknowledged that it previously recognized that giving discretion to employees may form the basis of title vii liability under a disparate impact theory,but to do so,the plaintiffs must first identify the specific employment practice that is challenged.id.at citing watson fort worth bank trust,d.however,in the case before it,the court noted o ther than the bare existence of delegated discretion,respondents have identified no specific employment practice much less one that ties all their million claims together.id.thus,the court concluded that the commonality requirement was not satisfied.
two principles readily derived from wal mart are applicable to this case.first,wal mart did not set out a per se rule against class certification where subjective or discretion is alleged.rather,where subjective discretion is involved,wal mart directs courts to examine whether all managers exercise discretion in a common way with some common direction.id.at.thus,to satisfy commonality,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the exercise of discretion is tied to a specific employment practice,and that the subjective practice at issue affected the class in a uniform manner.elizabeth tippett,robbing a barren vault the implications of dukes wal mart for cases challenging subjective employment practices,hofstra lab.emp.
as a corollary,even where subjective or discretion is alleged in the employment discrimination context,wal mart indicates that if another policy is also alleged,courts must also consider it.see wal mart.at considering evidence of a strong corporate culture that makes wal mart susceptible to gender bias,but finding it unsatisfactory because the adduced expert testimony failed to demonstrate that the corporate culture or stereotyped thinking affected employment decisions.thus,even in cases where the complaint alleges discretion,if there is also an allegation of a policy of discrimination,the putative class may still satisfy the commonality requirement for certification.
second,wal mart is limited to the exercise of discretion by employees,as opposed to,personnel.this qualitative distinction is critical because typically,in exercising discretion,employees do not set policies for the entire company whereas,when personnel exercise discretion,resulting decisions affect a much larger group,and depending on their rank in the corporate hierarchy,all the employees in the company.consequently,discretionary authority exercised by corporate,which is applicable to a broad segment of the corporation employees,is more likely to satisfy the commonality requirement than the discretion exercised by managers in wal mart.
courts rulings on class certification since wal mart bear out the principles announced herein.see mcreynolds merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir cert.denied,d allowing title vii class certification where the plaintiffs pointed to two policies see also,tabor hilti,cir denying class certification where challenged policy was highly discretional,and the only other alleged policy was not maintained in a uniform manner bolden walsh constr,cir denying class certification in a title vii case where the only policy alleged was a policy of giving discretion to managers and there was a lack of evidence that discretion was exercised in a common way at some common direction.
a comparison of mcreynolds and bolden,both decisions from the seventh circuit,highlight the parameters of wal mart.in mcreynolds,the plaintiff contested two national,policies a teaming policy and an account distribution policy.at.the teaming policy allowed brokers to form and distribute commissions with teams brokers could decide for themselves whether to form teams and,once the team was formed,brokers decide which other brokers to admit.id.the plaintiffs argued that this national policy had a disparate impact because some successful teams refused to admit blacks.under the account distribution policy,the customers accounts of a broker that had left the company were transferred within a branch office brokers in that office competed for the accounts,and the broker who ultimately won the accounts was determined by criteria that included the competing brokers past records of revenue generated,and number of investments and clients retained.id.at.
the seventh circuit noted that complex directors and managers have a measure of discretion with regard to teaming and account distribution because they can veto teams or supplement criteria for distributions.id.at.the court explained 
t o the extent that these regional and local managers exercise discretion regarding the compensation of the brokers whom they supervise,the case is indeed like wal mart.but the exercise of discretion is influenced by the two policies at issue authorization to brokers,rather than to managers to form and staff teams and basing account distribution on the past success of the brokers who are competing for transfers.
p ermitting brokers to form their own teams and prescribing criteria for account distributions that favor the already successful those who may owe their success to having been invited to join a successful or promising team are practices of merrill lynch,rather than practices that local managers can choose or not at their whim.therefore challenging those policies in a class action is not forbidden by the wal mart decision.
id.at.the court noted that in the absence of the teaming or account distribution policies,if instead the case involved delegation to local management the decision to allow teaming and the criteria for account distribution,mcreynolds would be more like wal mart.id.at.satisfied with the distinction between mcreynolds and wal mart,the court reversed the district court denial of class certification.
in bolden,the seventh circuit reversed the district court grant of class certification.there,twelve black construction workers alleged that the supervisors practiced or tolerated racial discrimination in assigning overtime work and in working conditions for example,derogatory graffiti in portable toilets and hangman nooses in toilets or break sheds.at.the plaintiffs attempted to certify a class covering the employer project sites in chicago.id.the seventh circuit noted that t he sites had different superintendents,with different policies and many of the allegedly discriminatory practices depended on the foremen,who made most overtime offers,and chastised or failed to chastise workers who used racially inflammatory language.id.at.additionally,the court pointed out the plaintiffs concessions that d ifferent sites had materially different working conditions most superintendents the plaintiffs had worked with did not discriminate and their objections concerned only a handful of superintendents and foremen.id.the court likened the case to wal mart and held that when multiple local managers exercise independent discretion,conditions at different stores or sites do not present a common question.id.it then distinguished the case before it from mcreynolds 
in mcreynolds,we held that a national class could be certified to contest the polic ies,which were adopted by top management and applied to all of merrill lynch offices throughout the nation.this single national policy was the missing ingredient in wal mart here,walsh had no relevant or chicago policy other than a its rule against discrimination,and b its grant of discretion to superintendents assigning work and coping with offensive or bigoted conduct.the first of these policies presents no problem and the second the policy of operational discretion is the precise policy that wal mart says can not be addressed in a class action.
id.at.thus,the court reversed the grant of class certification.
as evident from our application of the two principles in our discussion below,we believe the allegations in the proposed amended complaint bear a closer resemblance to mcreynolds.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the class allegations in the original complaint were insufficient to satisfy the commonality standard set forth in wal mart,because the complaint fails to allege that the subjectivity and stereotyping regarding compensation paid to female store managers were exercised in a common way with some common direction,and conclusorily alleges that family dollar engaged in centralized control of compensation for store managers at the corporate level of its operations.aside from this bare allegation,the original complaint does not identify the responsible for pay and promotion.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal of the original complaint.we view the proposed amended complaint differently.
applying the above principles,we find that the district court erred in denying leave to amend the complaint because it failed to consider whether in light of the discretion alleged,the discretion was exercised in a common way under some common direction,or despite the discretion alleged,another policy of discrimination is also alleged and the discretionary authority at issue was exercised by managers,as distinct from the type managers in wal mart.
in dismissing the proposed amended complaint,the district court held that wal mart precludes appellants class allegations of sex discrimination in pay because it believed that appellants claims rest only on a theory that family dollar use of subjective created disparities between male and female employees.additionally,the district court concluded that the employment policies in the proposed amended complaint were limited to subjective,individualized a theory which it stated was simply foreclosed by wal mart.the district court reasoning is based on a misapprehension of both the applicable law and policies alleged by appellants.
the proposed amended complaint clearly specifies the following practices a salary range policy a pay raise percentage policy a headwinds policy and dual pay system for hirees and promotees.to expound,the salary range policy sets mandatory minimum and maximum pay for store managers.according to appellants,as a result of this salary range policy,there are significant disparities in the number of women in the upper pay levels of that range,and exceptions above the range granted by the corporate vice presidents are often granted more in favor of men.further,under the pay raise percentage policy,an increase to a store manager compensation is determined by the manager prior performance ratings.the regional manager and divisional vice president grant exceptions above that pay raise percentage,and do so significantly greater in favor of men.additionally,the headwinds policy is a method for evaluating and determining compensation based on prior experience,prior pay,quartile rankings and other specific criteria that have a disparate impact on women salaries because they incorporate and perpetuate such past discrimination.essentially,this is a testing or evaluation method that appellants allege is biased.finally,the dual pay system for hirees and promotees caps the compensation paid to individuals who are promoted below what lateral hires can make.statistics proffered by appellants show more women promoted,and more men hired laterally,influencing the disparity in pay.
we do not now rule on the sufficiency of the allegations of the proposed amended complaint concerning the policies or on whether certification of the putative class will ultimately be warranted.however,in considering whether amendment of the complaint would be futile,we observe that the proposed amended complaint allegations of uniform corporate policies and of corporate are substantively different from those that the supreme court held sufficient in wal mart.for instance,the dual pay policy referenced in the proposed amended complaint is a policy that is in place in all family dollar stores.the amended complaint alleges that women suffer disparate impact as a direct result of this pay preference for lateral hires.in contrast,if decisions regarding the pay of hirees and promotees were left to the discretion of managers,then the alleged discrimination would be akin to the discrimination alleged in wal mart.see mcreynolds,at.
moreover,the discretionary decisions set forth in the proposed amended complaint are made by corporate with authority over a broad segment of family dollar employees,not on an individual store level as in wal mart.contrary to the dissent unsupported characterization of the in the present case as middle management,the amended complaint explains that exceptions to centrally determined salary ranges can only be made by the corporate vice president at corporate headquarters.similarly,exceptions to raise percentages were made by regional managers and senior vice presidents,again at corporate headquarters.these allegations of authority exercised by officials at corporate headquarters are thus different in kind from the allegations in wal mart,in which local supervisors were vested with almost absolute discretion over pay and promotion decisions.wal mart.at.
given these substantial distinctions,wal mart does not preclude as a matter of law a class certification based on the amplified allegations of the proposed amended complaint.in light of our policy favoring liberal amendment of complaints,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that amendment would be futile and in denying leave to amend the complaint.the district court therefore should revisit the certification question when the record underlying the allegations in the amended complaint has been more fully developed.
the district court next denied leave to amend on grounds that amendment would be prejudicial to family dollar.in support of its prejudice conclusion,the district court stated that the original complaint was filed over three years prior,and appellants did not seek to amend until briefing on family dollar motion for summary judgment was almost complete.further,the court stated that the proposed complaint alleges a new theory in an attempt to avoid wal mart.for the reasons stated below,we find that the district court determinations as to prejudice are clearly erroneous.
first,as to the delayed filing of the proposed complaint,review of the record indicates that the cited delay,for the most part,is attributable to family dollar.on numerous occasions,family dollar moved to dismiss the complaint and this had the effect of staying discovery,thereby prolonging the litigation.appellants ought not to be penalized for this delay.further,the typical briefing schedule for motions to dismiss or summary judgment involves the initial filing of a dismissal motion by the defendant,then the plaintiff files an opposition to the motion and if necessary,a motion to amend the complaint,and then the defendant files a reply brief.that appellants filed the motion for leave to amend simultaneously with their opposition to family dollar motion for summary judgment does not appear out of turn and can not be grounds for finding prejudice to family dollar.
with respect to the alleged new theory,review of the two complaints indicates that appellants do not allege an entirely new theory in the amended complaint,but rather elaborate on one of two allegations that were previously pled in a conclusory fashion.in their original complaint,appellants alleged both subjectivity and gender stereotyping,as well as centralized control of compensation for store managers at the corporate level of family dollar operations.they originally failed to support either theory with substantial factual allegations,including the nature of the claimed centralized control,though the district court initially held that the original complaint survived rule b.following wal mart,it became clear that appellants needed to allege more control over pay determinations by to meet the commonality requirement.the appellants filed a proposed amended complaint accordingly and included numerous additional facts supporting their previous assertion of centralized corporate control.
family dollar makes much of the fact that appellants previously stated their claims were virtually identical to those dismissed in wal mart,seemingly alleging an estoppel argument.even assuming that appellants seek to pursue a completely new legal theory from the one asserted previously,such an approach is not cause for judicial estoppel.see lowery stovall,cir for judicial estoppel to apply,the party sought to be estopped must be seeking to adopt a position that is inconsistent with a stance taken in prior litigation.and the position sought to be estopped must be one of fact rather than law or legal theory.emphasis added citation omitted.appellants present factual position in the proposed amended complaint is consistent with the original complaint.as appellants contend,the proposed amended complaint merely elaborates on the allegation in the original complaint that family dollar engages in centralized control of compensation for store managers at the corporate level.the legal theory remains the same,thus,judicial estoppel is not cognizable in this action.
further,we have held that the filing of a supplemental pleading is an appropriate mechanism for curing numerous possible defects in a complaint.franks ross,cir also noting that u nder rule d,a party may supplement its complaint even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense.hence,as family dollar believed that the original complaint was defective in light of wal mart,appellants should have been granted leave to amend to cure the defect,more especially because this was the first time they sought to amend their complaint.
besides,although prejudice can result where a new legal theory is alleged if it would entail additional discovery and evidentiary burdens on the part of the opposing party,this basis for a finding of prejudice essentially applies where the amendment is offered shortly before or during trial.johnson oroweat foods,cir.because the parties were still in discovery,and many steps removed from trial,the purported undue prejudice to family dollar is overstated.we emphasize that our holding does not condone an automatic period for plaintiffs to seek leave to amend a complaint.rather,we conclude that family dollar would not be unduly prejudiced by the amendment under all the particular circumstances presented in this case.
the district court abused its discretion in denying appellants request for leave to amend their complaint by primarily basing the denial on its erroneous interpretation of wal mart.we reverse the district court decision in part and remand for the court to consider,consistent with this opinion,whether the proposed amended complaint satisfies the class certification requirements of rule.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded 
i join judge gregory fine majority opinion in full.i write briefly to emphasize that despite the dissent dystopian view,the majority has rendered a straightforward and limited decision that the plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their original complaint after a dramatic shift in the law regarding class action certification.
meaningful access to the courts requires that plaintiffs have a fair opportunity to plead their case in accordance with the prevailing legal standard.the plaintiffs here should not be penalized for failing to amend their complaint in anticipation of wal mart,but should be permitted this first attempt to amend following that decision.additionally,the plaintiffs obtained new information about the corporate structure of family dollar during mediation occurring after the original complaint was filed,which facts they reasonably chose to include in the proposed amended complaint.despite the dissent apparent assumption that the class will be certified by the district court,if the allegations included in the amended complaint ultimately are not substantiated,the class simply will not be certified,and the plaintiffs case will fail.
the dissent nevertheless sweeps broadly and bleakly,convinced that the class action mechanism is being used to punish the business community for nothing more than being companies.dissent at.however,the majority opinion simply allows a putative class to its class allegations,in accordance with federal rules of civil procedure and.under the majority holding,the ability of litigants to seek access to our courts will be restricted solely by the strength of their case.
i can not join the majority decision,because it fails to respect the two other levels of the federal judiciary,namely the supreme court and the district courts.first as to the supreme court.the decision is wal mart stores,dukes,d,and the majority opinion has drained it of meaning.the defendant here,as in wal mart,relies on what plaintiffs admit are multitudinous,discretionary decisions by middle and lower management,which would seem to render class action treatment under wal mart impermissible and ineffectual.notwithstanding this,the majority has unloaded on the district court the prospect of a massive,nationwide class action whose administrability would in all likelihood prove impossible.
in the majority view,wal mart applies only where decisions are left to the complete discretion of managers,op.at,and are implemented on an individual store level.id.the fact that a company delegates extensive discretion to vice presidents and district managers,appellee br.at citing grace family dollar stores,in re family dollar flsa litig,cir,does not,in the majority view,bring this case within the ambit of wal mart and still permits nationwide class action treatment.the majority assumes that nearly middle managers somehow all exercise their discretion in lockstep.that can not be.the fact that some middle managers would promote from within,and others recruit from without,as they are given the discretion to do,does not,in the majority view,preclude nationwide class action treatment.the fact that many managers would elevate women from either inside or outside the company,as they are perfectly free to do,would hardly seem discriminatory,but it would be contrary to the commonality wal mart requires for a nationwide class action to proceed.
the majority responds to this point by citing the fact that exceptions to corporate salary ranges may be granted by a corporate vice president.op.at.but this fact only confirms the assertion that placements within the ranges are determined by middle managers.the fact that exceptions to corporate limits on raises are made by regional managers and senior vice presidents is similarly unavailing to the majority position regional managers,by definition,do not make decisions on a national level.in the majority view,middle managers at family dollar are purely robotic with respect to those they supervise,but no american company operates in such a way.
the majority plainly believes wal mart does not apply to middle managers exercising delegated discretion under guidelines such as these because if it believed wal mart applied,the district court denial of nationwide class certification would be promptly affirmed.the majority insistence that wal mart does not apply to middle management but only to store managers suggests not so subtly that it wants this class to be certified.but the commonality wal mart insists is necessary for class action certification is plainly absent here,though the majority purports to find it in some centralized policy.the fact that a company sets pay ranges or values prior experience or performance as factors in compensation is not sinister.vast numbers of companies do just that.a policy with an obvious business justification may occasionally produce some statistical disparity nationwide.but wal mart makes clear that the fact that a policy may have some statistical disparity nationwide does nothing to dispel the fact that in many districts,the policy will not have a statistical imbalance,but indeed may work to the decided advantage of the putative class.at.
the policies cited by plaintiffs are not headwinds,op.at internal quotation marks omitted,but rather common management techniques that make common sense.if centralized delegations of discretion such as these are enough for a nationwide class action to get rolling,then few companies will be exempt.the law is punishing companies for nothing more than being companies,which is apparently the new status offense.
in reaching its decision,the majority faults the district court for denying plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.but if this is an abuse of discretion,and these findings are clearly erroneous,then class action litigation will almost never end.not content with finding the district court abused its discretion,op.at,the majority holds its factual findings clearly erroneous as well.id.at.the district judge should be commended,not condemned.the amended complaint severely prejudiced the defendants by forcing them to defend a wholly different suit three years after the original complaint was filed.the amended complaint contradicted assertions in the original complaint to such an extent as to do violence to the values of forthrightness and fair dealing that the district court had every right to expect from the litigants before it.it was also every bit as irreconcilable with the supreme court decision in wal mart as the original,making denial of leave fully justifiable on futility grounds.
in sum,the district court has been brought up short and found to have abused its discretion for doing nothing more than faithfully following a supreme court decision and for attempting to ensure a small measure of candor and consistency in the filings of that court.it is our obligation to respect the supreme court preeminent place in a hierarchical judicial system,as well as the trial court discretion and experience in matters explicitly entrusted by both logic and precedent to its competence.this decision does neither.
federal rule of civil procedure a,which governs pretrial requests for leave to amend,advises that t he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.the supreme court has accordingly required some justifying reason in support of the rejection of a party request to amend.foman davis,d.
nevertheless,the supreme court has repeatedly recognized that the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the district court.see also krupski costa crociere,d.denying leave to amend is appropriate when at least one of three circumstances exists the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party or the amendment would have been futile.laber harvey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons that follow,it is abundantly clear that the district court was justified in denying plaintiffs motion for leave on all three grounds prejudice,bad faith,and futility.
as to the first ground,w hether an amendment is prejudicial will often be determined by the nature of the amendment and its timing.laber harvey,cir.with respect to the amendment nature,a common example of a prejudicial amendment is one that raises a new legal theory that would require the gathering and analysis of facts not already considered by the defendant.id.quoting johnson oroweat foods,cir alterations omitted.by contrast,a n amendment is not prejudicial if it merely adds an additional theory of recovery to the facts already pled.id.
the majority acts as a cheerleader for the amended complaint,glossing over its gross incompatibility with the original and casually dismissing the threat of prejudice as overstated.op.at.a comparative analysis of the two complaints makes recognition of the differences between them unavoidable.the majority statement that appellants do not allege a new theory,id.at,finds support neither in the record nor in the law.the text of the two complaints speaks nay,screams this conclusion for itself.
at its core,the original complaint attacks family dollar for maintaining a supposedly subjective and decentralized structure for determining store manager compensation,which plaintiffs alleged produced illegal discrepancies between male and female pay.a crucial paragraph,in particular,levels the following accusation with great force 
defendant pay decisions system includes subjectivity and gender stereotyping that causes disparate impact to compensation paid to female store managers.plaintiffs are aware,at this time,of no other criteria which causes such disparate impact other than gender bias,subjectivity and stereotyping.plaintiffs are unaware,at this time,of any other specific criteria that are capable of separation and analyses.

the import of that paragraph is crystal clear according to plaintiffs themselves,any actionable discrimination derived solely from subjectivity and gender stereotyping nothing less,nothing more where subjectivity and gender stereotyping translate directly into discriminatory employment outcomes for a nationwide group of employees as alleged here,the contested decisions must necessarily have occurred outside the corporation core.any centralized employment policy even if rooted in the prejudicial predilections of a particular officer or group of officers could result in generally unfavorable consequences for plaintiffs only if implemented through objective standards,such that the who determine individual store managers salaries have little personal power to deviate from the commands dictated by corporate headquarters.but plaintiffs complaint was that managers had too much discretion to deviate,not too little.
nor does the original complaint specify any other aspect of family dollar compensation policies as a source of plaintiffs injury.in light of prior litigation involving family dollar,it should come as no surprise that the original complaint is rooted exclusively in allegations of permissive subjectivity and gender stereotyping.in a previous suit brought by plaintiffs counsel against family dollar,for instance,plaintiffs some of whom are also parties to the instant action,appellee br.at alleged that d espite disparities in pay,family dollar continues to allow its district managers to subjectively decide what a store manager should earn.opponent responsive submission in resp.to ex.b of the order at,collins family dollar stores,cv veh,ecf.
plaintiffs seek to avoid the thrust of their original complaint by clinging to a single sentence repeated with immaterial variations several times in their original complaint that d efendant engages in centralized control of compensation for store managers at the corporate level of its operations.compl.this uninformative bit of boilerplate seeks to subject corporations to nationwide class actions by virtue of their mere existence.plaintiffs reasoning in this respect would penalize a company for little more than operating on a national scale under the same corporate name.even if taken as true,the fact that some centralized directive comes from some corporate headquarters is entirely unremarkable.surely corporations of national scope can not flourish in the modern economy without some centralized control of compensation for their many thousands of employees.at the very least,corporate headquarters must allocate resources and articulate certain general policies to guide regional or other managers in setting individual salaries and wages.
the alternative would operate to inhibit the most basic tools of management and result in budgetary chaos.the question,therefore,is how much centralized control of compensation the original complaint actually alleges with respect to the challenged employment decisions.the answer is,clearly,not much.if this bare,conclusory statement in the complaint is given weight,then nationwide class action suits are off and running,notwithstanding wal mart and the pleading standards laid down in ashcroft iqbal,d,and bell atlantic twombly,d.
the amended complaint,in stark contrast to the original,pivots degrees to assert that family dollar compensation scheme actually operates in an objective and centralized manner.the amended complaint is not,as the majority contends,a mere elaborat ion on the original.op.at.it is what the district court says it is a bald attempt to assert a completely new theory.it backtracks on the earlier assertion that the flaw in family dollar compensation scheme was too much decentralized,subjective,by alleging that the system requires pay to be set by uniform,criteria.am.compl.the complaint now decides to challenge the purported lack of subjectivity inherent in the company supposedly centralized compensation scheme the very subjectivity that plaintiffs had earlier insisted was the hallmark of family dollar corporate structure.
as for plaintiffs allegations concerning the implementation of family dollar compensation criteria,the following passage is typical 
store managers compensation is not set by managers who have unfettered discretion to use their own judgment without regard to any criteria or standards.all store managers salaries are subject to the same pay system and policy established by corporate headquarters all store manager salaries are subject to store payroll budgets established at corporate headquarters and all store managers have the same job description which sets forth a common set of duties and responsibilities regardless of location.there is no policy against having uniform employment practices at family dollar.
id.we are now explicitly told,moreover,in a complete from the original complaint,that family dollar is not operated in a decentralized,subjective manner.nor is the process for store managers based on decentralized,subjective decisionmaking.id.the demons in the original complaint were those runaway managers.the demon in the amended complaint is a controlling corporate headquarters.id.
given all of the foregoing,it should be plain that the amended complaint is not some mere modification of the original,as the majority contends.instead,it is manifestly,substantively different from the original.the two are utterly irreconcilable.they describe two different companies.by transforming their claims from a frontal assault on an excessively subjective and decentralized compensation system into an intricate attack on a purportedly objective and centralized scheme,plaintiffs have done far more than raise a new legal theory.laber,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the majority breezily dismisses these concerns,asserting in conclusory terms that t he legal theory remains the same.op.at.my colleagues would be wise to pay some modest heed to the opinion of the district judge,who was better situated to evaluate the actual implications of the transfigured complaint.the new complaint,by virtue of its novel allegations,would require significant gathering and analysis of facts not already considered by the defendant.laber,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.as the district judge emphasized plaintiffs wish to pursue extensive discovery to support and clarify their new theories,which will require the parties to and conduct new expert discovery based on plaintiffs changed version of the facts.
thus,the district court was correct to conclude that granting leave to amend would be prejudicial to family dollar.id.at.the proof required to defend against this new claim would be of an entirely different character than the proof which the defendant was led to believe would be necessary.belated claims which change the character of litigation are not favored.deasy hill,cir.the district court acted well within its discretion by denying plaintiffs motion for leave to amend.
the timing of a proposed pleading amendment also bears on whether the change would prejudice the opposing party.laber,at.in particular,whereas an amendment offered before any discovery has occurred is unlikely to be prejudicial,the further a case has progressed,the more likely it is that the amendment will prejudice the defendant.see also united states ex rel.nathan takeda pharm,cir affirming denial of motion for leave to amend in light,inter alia,of a gap between filing of complaint and dismissal mayfield ass for stock car auto racing,cir affirming denial of motion for leave to amend where a significant amount of discovery had already been conducted.
here,plaintiffs attempt to amend their complaint came three years after the case was initially filed and only when family dollar appeared poised to succeed on its motion to dismiss strike the original complaint class allegations.moreover,the district judge observed that plaintiffs had been given adequate time to conduct discovery,that they had in fact conducted significant discovery,and that plaintiffs own counsel had even admitted that discovery is mostly completed.hence,the district court concluded that any additional discovery would be prejudicial to defendant.id.at.the court proceeded to hold that 
a llowing plaintiffs to amend the complaint would prejudice defendant.since the filing of the complaint three years ago,the parties have pursued discovery and have attempted to mediate claims under the original complaint.here,plaintiffs chose not to file their proposed amended complaint until the briefing on defendant motion to dismiss was nearly complete plaintiffs wish to pursue extensive discovery to support and clarify their new theories,which will require the parties to and conduct new expert discovery based on plaintiffs changed version of the facts.
plaintiffs attempt to blame the delay in filing for leave to amend on the various motions and objections that were exchanged between the parties during the course of discovery.such tit for tat,however,is not peculiar to this litigation every complex class action of this variety will have just this sort of pretrial motion exchange.the majority adoption of plaintiffs reasoning in this respect,op.at,thus comes close to establishing a per se grace period for motions for leave to amend.such a protracted interval is excessive and susceptible to manipulative conduct.the new rule established by today opinion endorses filing delays that patently prejudice opposing parties.
moreover,the delay in this particular case is especially unjustifiable.plaintiffs counsel have extensive experience with defendant corporate structure by their own admission,they have sued family dollar over labor and employment matters approximately times since.see pls.reply to def.resp.to pls.opp to terry price serving as local counsel and req.for emergency hr g at,scott family dollar stores,cv moc dsc,ecf.as the district court noted,plaintiffs were plenty familiar through their multiple prior lawsuits with defendant corporate organization.although plaintiffs assert in a conclusory footnote that defendant compensation policies have changed since the time of these many prior suits,appellants br.at,they provide no substantiation for this claim nor do they identify any specific ways in which the policies have been altered.
the majority inexplicably focuses on the fact that plaintiffs motion for leave to amend was made prior to trial.op.at.the crux of this dispute,however,is class certification.that issue is routinely decided pretrial.see.c a at an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative,the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.any potential source of prejudice,therefore,lies not in inconveniences at trial but rather in the superfluous or additional discovery costs imposed on defendant as a result of plaintiffs fluctuating class action theories.if the majority misplaced emphasis on trial represents a new standard for identifying prejudice in class certification proceedings,prejudice will almost never be found.
i see no reason whatsoever to usurp the district court essential case management functions or to question the accuracy of its characterizations.it was entirely proper for the district court to conclude that permitting plaintiffs to amend their complaint so substantially and at such a late stage of the game would impermissibly prejudice family dollar.it was altogether sound for the trial court to hold that family dollar should not be forced to defend a new suit three years after the original complaint was filed.see newport news holdings virtual city vision,cir affirming on prejudice grounds denial of motion for leave where amendment was filed at the eleventh hour,would probably have necessitated additional discovery,and would have substantially change d the nature and scope of litigation internal quotation marks omitted equal rights ctr.niles bolton,cir same.
as to why plaintiffs wanted to undertake such an extensive overhaul of their complaint in the first place,the majority opinion points to the supreme court decision in wal mart,d.the majority,however,misapprehends the import of wal mart with respect to the final two grounds on which a district court may deny a motion for leave to amend a pleading the lack of good faith,to which i now turn,and futility,discussed in part iv.see laber harvey,cir.
a district court refusal to permit a pleading amendment on bad faith grounds is justified where the plaintiff first theory of recovery is based on his own reading of cases and it turns out that he misinterpreted how that theory would apply to the facts of his case.id.at emphasis omitted.that situation is precisely what occurred here.plaintiffs misinterpreted how certain class action precedents would apply to their case and then sought to construct an entirely new set of facts to overcome their error.their willingness to adopt contradictory factual positions in order to match their evolving legal theories evidences a degree of bad faith sufficient to warrant denial of leave to amend.to the view that prior representations to a court actually count for something,the majority answers not much.
plaintiffs were wholly content to ride the coattails of the proposed class in wal mart while that class was enjoying success in the lower federal courts.in consenting to a transfer of venue in,plaintiffs explicitly stated that,with respect to a round of the wal mart litigation,t he ninth circuit affirmed certification of a nationwide class having virtually identical claims of sex discrimination in pay to those brought in this case.citing dukes wal mart,cir emphasis added.later in the litigation,plaintiffs argued that t he evidence is expected to show that this case is more like the ninth circuit decision in wal mart than the cases cited by defendant.
then plaintiffs adopted a dramatically different stance after the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit certification decision in.see,d.in their briefing before this court,for instance,plaintiffs contend that family dollar salary system is the opposite of that in wal mart,appellants br.at that t he current case has never alleged any decisionmaking similar to that in wal mart,id.at,emphasis omitted that t he wal mart decision was limited to localized decisionmaking within each store that was not subject to any centralized policies or control similar to those alleged here,id.at and that wal mart simply does not apply to the complaint here,id.at emphasis omitted.
statements made at oral argument help to illustrate the gross incompatibility between the factual allegations made by plaintiffs original and amended complaints.the court inquired do we have a big difference between your complaint and your amended complaint in terms of the substantive allegations plaintiffs counsel responded no,i do not believe so.he later elaborated 
we say that this case involves centralized criteria and that we can show that that centralized criteria is what causing the disparity,not anything localized that our complaint from day.if you read our original complaint,it says that we are attacking a centralized system.it says nothing but that.
emphasis added.despite these protestations to the contrary,the original complaint actually says precisely the opposite.it states explicitly that plaintiffs are aware,at this time,of no other criteria which causes such disparate impact other than gender bias,subjectivity and stereotyping.compl.emphasis added.
to be sure,counsel must enjoy latitude in amending complaints to address intervening developments in the law and to incorporate factual material uncovered since the original filing.some evolution of a plaintiff approach to a case is to be expected,for good advocacy is adaptive in some measure.it is a matter of degree,however,and the district court was right to spot in plaintiffs new attack a bridge too far.
for the instant plaintiffs do not merely present a new legal argument predicated on their original factual allegations,or some modification based upon new revelations.instead,they seek to invent an entirely new set of facts tailored to their revised theory of recovery.the corporate defendant described in the amended complaint bears no more than a nominal relationship to that described in the original.the proposed amendment is not merely clerical or corrective.it establishes an entirely new factual basis for the plaintiffs claims.little liquid air,cir,reinstated in relevant part,cir en banc see also cornell,oshrc,cir denying leave to amend where plaintiff changed the factual basis for the charge as well as his legal theory internal quotation marks omitted.
this is more than some commonplace doctrinal point.complaints must bear some relationship to the external reality which they purport to describe.when a corporation is reinvented from one employing decentralized,subjective to one with rigid,entirely centralized policies,law relationship to reality is stretched too thin.see bradley chiron,disregarding sham facts in an amended complaint that contradicted the factual allegations pled in the original and represented a transparent attempt to conform the facts to the requirements of the cause of action.law is not a mere set of expressions to be manipulated toward a given end.it is a system designed to ascertain truth as far as possible in order to produce justice,to the extent possible.to do this,law must maintain some concrete relationship with facts as they exist.plaintiffs contradictory pleadings,which treat reality as a plastic entity to be molded to their purposes,run directly counter to this principle.see reddy litton,cir although leave to amend should be liberally granted,the amended complaint may only allege other facts consistent with the challenged pleading.internal quotation marks omitted.
were plaintiffs permitted to substitute contradictory factual narratives every time an intervening opinion cast doubt upon their claims,they could hold defendants hostage by indefinitely postponing final judgment.the majority finds the original complaint deficient because it alleged only a subjective structure.maj op.at.but when plaintiffs sought to run from their prior representations and assert a highly controlled apparatus,the majority says no problem.i regret that the majority encourages litigants to approach courts in such a manner.
finally,the district court rejection of plaintiffs motion for leave to amend was warranted on a third ground futility.see laber harvey,cir.futility is apparent if the proposed amended complaint fails to state a claim under the applicable rules and accompanying standards that is,if it fails to satisfy the requirements of the federal rules.katyle penn gaming,cir internal quotation marks omitted.wal mart itself expounded the requirements of the federal rules specifically,federal rule of civil procedure commands concerning the certification of class actions.it is plain that the amended complaint fails to state a claim by virtue of that decision.
as in wal mart,t he crux of this case is commonality the rule requiring a plaintiff to show that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.at quoting.a.wal mart central teaching is that the claims of each class member must depend upon a common contention.id.at.that common contention,in turn,must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.id.thus,w hat matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions even in droves but,rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles to employment discrimination claims,the wal mart court made clear that w ithout some glue holding the alleged reasons for each of the challenged decisions together,it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why was i disfavored.id.at.as relevant here,plaintiffs must show s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination in order to demonstrate the existence of the requisite glue.id.at quoting.of sw.falcon,d alteration in original.for two reasons,plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this standard.first,the claims in the amended complaint fail on their face.second,even if the claims were not facially deficient,the proffered evidence would still be incapable of supporting such claims on a classwide basis.
in light of the stunning similarities between this case and wal mart,the allegations in the amended complaint just as in the original complaint are legally insufficient from the outset.in both cases,defendants are large corporations operating nationwide chains of stores.from wal mart 
petitioner wal mart is the nation largest private employer.it operates four types of retail stores throughout the country those stores are divided into seven nationwide divisions,which in turn comprise regions of to stores apiece.each store has between and separate departments and to staff positions.in all,wal mart operates approximately stores and employs more than one million people.
at.and from the briefing here family dollar operates a chain of over stores in more than states and has divided its operations into regions,each run by a vice president,and then into districts,each run by a district manager.appellee br.at quoting grace family dollar stores,in re family dollar flsa litig,cir.there are approximately four hundred districts,each of which includes between ten and thirty stores.id.
in both cases,the proposed class encompassed many thousands of,female employees and former employees.in both cases,plaintiffs challenged various pay and promotion decision procedures as improperly.compare wal mart.at the named plaintiffs in this lawsuit,representing the million members of the certified class,are three current or former wal mart employees who allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,with am.compl.the plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all female store managers pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act and b of the equal pay act of to redress the defendant widespread and pervasive gender discrimination in employment opportunities.
and most significantly,in both cases,all of the contested employment actions derived from the same type of structure.in wal mart,the supreme court stated that managers were allowed to exercise discretion within limits imposed and enforced by corporate oversight,with such oversight including preestablished ranges and certain objective criteria for pay and promotions.at.the district court in wal mart provided even greater detail,explaining that the company maintains centralized corporate policies that provide some constraint on the degree of managerial discretion over personnel decisions.dukes wal mart stores.for instance,there is a basic compensation structure that applies similarly to all salaried management positions across all types of wal mart stores,in that the computation begins with a base salary within a range set by the corporation,with adjustments allowed for profit incentives merit increases.id.at.
as discussed in part ii,the factual and legal allegations contained in the amended complaint in this case were so novel as to warrant a finding of prejudice.the fact that certain allegations are new,however,does not indicate that they are viable.here,despite plaintiffs efforts to allege extensive centralized control,the amended complaint reveals the existence of a corporate structure parallel to that described in wal mart.as the district court here explained,although plaintiffs now purport to deny that class members pay is set through a discretionary,subjective process,the discretionary pay of managers,within uniformly established parameters,remain s the only source of discrimination alleged.j.that pattern of dispersed managerial discretion within centralized parameters is precisely that of wal mart.
while plaintiffs fail to so much as identify the source of many of the supposed nefarious corporate parameters,see,am.compl,even if we were to accept these dubious assertions at face value,plaintiffs proffered amendment would still be futile.in an effort to identify a specific employment practice responsible for the alleged pay discrepancies,wal mart.at internal quotation marks omitted,plaintiffs and the majority point to four corporate policies.with respect to each claim,plaintiffs own brief gives away the ballgame.first,plaintiffs challenge the salary ranges for store managers.appellants br.at am.compl.a salary range,however,intrinsically imparts discretion to those charged with administering it.as the district judge noted,a large number of,located around the country,exercise individual discretion in placing store managers within the established pay ranges.discretion cabined by broad corporate policies including salary ranges is precisely the structure that wal mart found not to be susceptible to class action treatment.at denying class certification despite defendant use of salary ranges.if the existence of such discretion defeated class action commonality in wal mart,it must do so here.
second,plaintiffs decry the alleged cap on pay raises and contend that exceptions to this cap,which may only be granted by regional managers and divisional vice presidents,are granted disproportionately to males.appellants br.at am.compl.regional managers and divisional vice presidents,however,as their respective titles indicate,are middle managers.see.by definition,they are incapable of dictating policies.as the district judge noted,plaintiffs allegations in this respect again converge with the facts in wal mart both cases involve dispersed exercising discretion,granting exceptions free of direct corporate control and oversight.id.at.
third,plaintiffs argue that defendant criteria for determining compensation criteria which include prior experience and performance evaluations disparately impact women.appellants br.at am.compl.the use of such criteria is hardly remarkable the only thing that would be remarkable is if family dollar failed to find prior experience and prior performance relevant.the business justification for this practice is obvious.
plaintiffs do not allege,moreover,that these criteria constitute a rigid formula instead,the criteria appear to be simple guideposts listing multiple factors designed to channel the discretionary decisions of those middle managers charged with setting store manager salaries.it is the business equivalent of a judicial test,with the weight and relevance of the factor or circumstance to be determined individually.indeed,it would be senseless to set rigid salaries for every store manager at corporate headquarters,both because it would strip the system of incentives and because the performance of each manager simply is not identical.as noted above,this type of broad corporate constraint on what is fundamentally a discretionary determination does not satisfy the commonality requirement.wal mart.at denying certification despite defendant use of objective criteria in making promotion decisions.
fourth,plaintiffs complain that corporate policies require that store managers promoted from within be paid less than those who are hired laterally.appellants br.at am.compl.this policy allegedly produces a disparate impact insofar as female store managers are disproportionately promoted.appellants br.at am.compl.plaintiffs do not allege,however,that either method of selection is centrally mandated,nor do they allege that any central policy is even responsible for the supposed tendency of females to be promoted from within rather than hired laterally.
given that the alleged policy does not dictate the internal or external route of store manager selection,any disparate impact that arises will necessarily be the result of decentralized choices by middle managers.whether women are disproportionately hired from within will vary from region to region.in short,i n a company of family dollar size and geographical scope,it is quite unbelievable that all managers would exercise their discretion in a common way without some common direction.wal mart.at.consequently,the existence of any disparate impact resulting from this particular policy will be resistant to coherent analysis at the national level.
the business justification for allotting a slight premium to lateral hires is hardly obscure.it may well take such an allowance to persuade an employee to switch companies.furthermore,the supreme court has noted that the mere fact that a business practice produces some statistical disparity is,standing alone,insufficient to conclude that a class action will be viable.id.at.under the lateral hire policy at issue here,for example,some middle managers will hire women from outside,or promote men from within.in other cases,the hiring party may herself be female.the alleged policy could very well work to the benefit of women in certain districts.in short,the results will vary by district and by region nationwide patterns are inadequate to justify an inference of discrimination at the subnational level.the variable results produced by this particular practice which is neutral on its face and supported by an obvious business justification are precisely what wal mart envisioned as inimical to class action commonality.
the fact that each of plaintiffs key claims ultimately reduces to an allegation of cabined discretion should be unsurprising.there is nothing inherently discriminatory about delegated discretion.companies must rely on delegated discretion.it would be virtually impossible,as a matter of sheer practicality,for a company as extensiv
