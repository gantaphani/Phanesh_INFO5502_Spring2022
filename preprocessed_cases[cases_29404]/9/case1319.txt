the plaintiff kevin holcomb brought suit under alleging that his procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution were violated when the defendants revoked his extended furlough from prison without following the vermont department of corrections written procedures.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that qualified immunity protects the defendants from holcomb claim.we affirm the judgment of the district court,but on other grounds.
background 
the facts underlying the judgment on appeal are not in dispute.at all relevant times,kevin holcomb was in the custody of the vermont department of corrections doc serving a lawful term of imprisonment.on march,holcomb was released on furlough pursuant to under the supervision of correctional services specialist mark lykens.on april,holcomb notified lykens that he,holcomb,would start a temporary work assignment at the moretown,vermont,landfill on april.because holcomb could not arrange for a ride home from work on that day,he contacted his employer early that morning to arrange to begin the job a day later.instead of beginning his temporary work assignment that day,holcomb spent the morning looking for permanent work.in that pursuit,he visited the doc probation and parole office at to obtain information about job openings,scheduled and attended a job interview at,and visited several employers to apply for work.as a result of his efforts,he was offered and accepted permanent employment scheduled to begin three weeks later.but holcomb failed to inform lykens of any of this.
during the course of the day,holcomb fianc√©e,dawn boothe,transported him from place to place by automobile she had been approved by doc to provide transportation for him during his furlough.while driving holcomb around,boothe suffered an asthma attack requiring her to return to her apartment to retrieve her inhaler.although holcomb did not have permission to be in boothe apartment,he nonetheless went with her to help her locate the inhaler and to use the lavatory.boothe landlord saw holcomb enter the apartment and notified lykens.
lykens thereupon contacted holcomb and ordered him to lykens office.holcomb went there as told,and was promptly placed in and removed for incarceration pending his hearing.at that hearing presided over by hearing officer sean smith,holcomb admitted to being out of place on the.smith revoked holcomb furlough.when holcomb objected that such revocation was contrary to the procedures set forth in the doc graduated sanctions manual july the manual,smith said that he was not required to follow those procedures.
the following month,holcomb,incarcerated,wrote a letter to joanne pereria,superintendent of the department of corrections,asking that she reconsider his furlough revocation,and later,a letter to doc commissioner john gorzyk,asking that he overturn the furlough revocation.pereria denied the request directed to her gorzyk ignored the letter directed to him.holcomb also filed several grievances with doc,all of which were denied.on september,holcomb appeal of the denials was denied by commissioner gorzyk.
holcomb then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in vermont superior court,orleans county.the writ was granted.the court howard vanbenthuysen,superior judge concluded,and it is undisputed before us,that the manual applied in holcomb case hearing officer smith had wrongly failed to follow it and had punished holcomb excessively in violation of its provisions.holcomb gorczyk,slip op.at.according to the manual,violating furlough by being out of place,as holcomb had been,is a level iii violation,which is the least serious of violations categorized in the manual.level iii violations may not be punished by.manual at.but because holcomb furlough had been revoked on at least two previous occasions,he may have been subject to sanction for a level ii violation under the manual,id.at,the maximum penalty for which is thirty days incarceration.in any event,as a result of the court decision,holcomb was returned to extended furlough on october,after days of following his april,revocation hearing.
on july,holcomb filed suit under for violation of his civil rights in the united states district court for the district of vermont against lykens,smith,pereria,and gorcyzk.holcomb seeks damages for his attorney fees,and costs.he contends that the defendants violation of the doc regulations contained in the manual deprived him of liberty without due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.the district court jerome niedermeier,magistrate judge concluded that qualified immunity protects the defendants from suit because a liberty interest in remaining on extended furlough under doc procedures,if it exists,was not clearly established at the time of holcomb revocation hearing.holcomb lykens,slip op.at.june.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see steel partners ii,bell,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citations,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted see also.c.these standards apply where,as here,the facts are not in dispute.steel partners ii,at.
ii.qualified immunity 
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the ground that qualified immunity protects them from suit.we ultimately agree with the court disposition of the summary judgment motion,but on different grounds.
in general,public officials are entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights,or it was objectively reasonable for them to believe their acts did not violate those rights.weyant okst,cir.consideration of the defense of qualified immunity involves a process.ordinarily,we first address the threshold question of whether the amended complaint alleges the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.if it does,we then decide whether the right was clearly established at the time of the officers alleged misdeeds.patel searles,cir citing wilson layne,d,cert.denied,d see also saucier katz,d a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right t he next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.in order to defeat the defendants qualified immunity defense,then,holcomb must allege a deprivation of an actual constitutional right clearly established at the time of the events in issue.
holcomb asserts that he was deprived of his fourteenth amendment procedural due process rights when vermont state corrections officers revoked his extended furlough without following the procedures set forth in the manual.the fourteenth amendment prohibits any state from depriving a person of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.meachum fano,d.
morrissey and the protected liberty interest in parole 
although the supreme court has not considered whether there exists a liberty interest in extended furlough from prison of the sort enjoyed by holcomb in the days preceding april,the fourteenth amendment due process clause creates a liberty interest in parole,such that parole revocation must be accompanied by sufficient process,morrissey brewer,d.in morrissey,the court identified several aspects of parole that made the interest of the parolee in his continued liberty,id.at,similar to other citizens interest in their continued liberty and therefore worthy of due process protection 
the liberty of a parolee enables him to do a wide range of things open to persons who have never been convicted of any crime subject to the conditions of his parole,he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life.though the state properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens,his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison.he may have been on parole for a number of years and may be living a relatively normal life at the time he is faced with revocation.the parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions.in many cases,the parolee faces lengthy incarceration if his parole is revoked.
id.at.footnotes omitted.after morrissey,courts considering whether the due process clause creates a protected liberty interest in various forms of conditional release have resolved the issue by comparing the specific conditional release in the case before them with the liberty interest in parole as characterized by morrissey.
in young harper,d,the court,using that approach,held that a program of conditional release was a kind of parole as the court understood parole in morrissey,and that participants in that program were therefore entitled to the procedural protections set forth in morrissey.young,at.under the oklahoma preparole conditional supervision program at issue in young,which had been implemented to reduce prison overcrowding,inmates became eligible for preparole after serving fifteen percent of their sentence and became eligible for parole after serving of their sentence.id.at.in reaching its conclusion that this preparole sufficiently resembled parole to require federal due process protection,the court relied on the passage in morrissey quoted above 
h e can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life.though the state properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens,his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison the parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions.
young,at.quoting morrissey,at.alterations and ellipsis in original.the court concluded that the interest of the oklahoma preparolee in his or her liberty was substantially similar to that of the parolee.young,at.
at this point in the inquiry,then,the question for us with respect to holcomb claim is whether vermont extended furlough is similar enough to parole as characterized by morrissey and young with respect to the extent and conditions of the liberty conferred to him as a furloughee to be treated as though it were parole for fourteenth amendment purposes 
vermont extended furlough 
a permits the doc to grant furlough to a prisoner for a variety of reasons the statute states that furlough is not equivalent to parole 
c the extension of the limits of the place of confinement authorized by this section shall in no way be interpreted as a probation or parole of the inmate,but shall constitute solely a permitted extension of the limits of the place of confinement for inmates committed to the custody of the commissioner.
c.that vermont furlough statute expressly denies equivalence between furlough and parole is of little assistance in our inquiry,however.if the conditions of extended furlough are sufficiently similar to the conditions of parole described in morrissey,then a furloughee has a liberty interest in furlough that commands due process protection.
under the authority of c,the commissioner of the doc may promulgate rules and regulations to discharge his or her responsibilities.doc directive,entitled furlough revocation,sets forth the basic contours of the procedures for revoking furloughs.the directive distinguishes between furlough for fewer than fifteen days and furlough for fifteen or more days.doc directive,at.the second type of furlough,as noted above,is called extended furlough,and may be renewed every fifteen days.doc directive,at,set forth in pertinent part in footnote,above.
under the directive,furlough may be terminated at any time at the discretion of the person who authorized the furlough no formal procedures are required.doc directive,at.extended furlough,by contrast,may only be terminated for any behavior that may be detrimental to the offender,the community,the facility or the department of corrections,and such termination must be preceded by an administrative due process hearing.doc directive,at.
it is clear that these furlough protections apply to termination of extended furlough during the course of a period of extended furlough,doc may not terminate the furlough without a hearing.but it is not clear whether they apply to the refusal to renew extended furlough neither the vermont statute nor doc regulations tell us whether doc may,at the end of a given fifteen day period,decline to renew furlough without giving the furloughee a hearing,or whether such refusal must also be preceded by a hearing and justified by a finding of improper behavior.
we think that this question must be resolved in order for us to determine whether vermont extended furlough is sufficiently similar to morrissey characterization of parole to constitute a liberty interest requiring due process protection.in morrissey,the court focused on the parolee reliance on at least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions.at.if extended furlough must be renewed every fifteen days absent a finding of improper behavior,there is a good argument to be made that the furloughee has a reasonable expectation that he or she will maintain his or her status so long as he or she behaves properly.if,on the other hand,doc may decline to renew extended furlough entirely at its discretion,the argument that the furloughee has such an expectation is severely,perhaps fatally,weakened.
whether qualified immunity is available to the defendants 
the district court decided that whatever holcomb rights with respect to the defendants revocation of his extended furlough,they were not clearly established at the time of the revocation and the defendants were therefore entitled to qualified immunity.we are,of course,not bound by the district court approach and are not entirely persuaded that it was justified in the present case.see saucier,at.wilson,at.conn gabbert,d county of sacramento lewis,d.but i t is that we may affirm on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,including grounds not relied upon by the district court.olsen pratt whitney aircraft,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we decline to decide the qualified immunity issue upon which the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.we affirm,instead,on other grounds.
ii.deprivation of liberty without due process 
the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in mathews,the supreme court set forth a list of factors to be considered in determining whether sufficient process was deployed the private interest affected by the official action,the risk of erroneous deprivation of the interest and the probable value of additional procedural safeguards,and the fiscal and administrative burden that additional process would impose on the government.id.at.assuming that holcomb correctly reads vermont law and that extended furlough is equivalent to parole for due process purposes,we conclude that he was entitled to no more process when his extended furlough was revoked than was the plaintiff parolee in morrissey when his parole was revoked.
in morrissey,the supreme court read the fourteenth amendment to require the following as the minimal procedure for revocation of parole 
a written notice of the claimed violations of parole b disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him c opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence d the right to confront and adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation e a neutral and detached hearing body such as a traditional parole bo
