the johnsbury school district the district,which has no public high school,pays tuition for local students to attend either the johnsbury academy the academy,a private high school located in the town,or certain high schools outside the district.this case arose after the academy refused to assign a disabled town resident to the academy mainstream,ninth grade academic classes because he did not meet the academy requirement that students in such classes perform at or above the fifth grade level.the academy appeals from a permanent injunction entered by the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions,under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,and a of the rehabilitation act of,a,invalidating the academy fifth grade minimum requirement for mainstream assignment.
the student,initially contested the fifth grade requirement in a challenge lodged with a state administrative hearing officer,who ruled in favor under idea and the rehabilitation act.the academy properly pursued an appeal from that ruling to the district of vermont naming as defendants,the district,and the vermont department of education the vde.see i a.following trial,the district court affirmed the administrative ruling and permanently enjoined the academy from using the fifth grade standard.see johnsbury academy,d.
the academy now appeals to this court,arguing that the district court misapplied idea and the rehabilitation act.we vacate the injunction and direct the district court to enter judgment in favor of the academy.
background 
high school education in the district 
under vermont law,a school district that does not maintain a public high school has two options for educating its high residents 
i the district may designate an approved independent school as the public high school of the district if the school consents.stat.ann.tit,a,b,in which case the district will pay tuition only to that school unless the district decides,in its sole discretion,that another high school will best serve the interests of the pupil.id.b d.the academy has not been so designated,and does not seek the designation.
ii the district may as it has done in this case pay tuition to an approved public or independent high school,to be selected by the parents or guardians of the pupil,within or without the state.id.a,see,d at.
the overwhelming majority of the district students choose to go to the academy,which is the only approved high school in johnsbury.see,d at.but as conceded by,the district,and the vde,the academy is not required to accept students from johnsbury.
b.the academy special education program 
the academy provides special education services through a resource room program and an individualized services program.see,d at.the resource room program allows for students to be placed in regular academic classes,whereas students in the individualized services program are taught in a segregated classroom along with other individuals with disabilities and may be mainstreamed for activities.id.to qualify for the resource room program,a student must be able to perform at the fifth grade level see id.
application to the academy 
now,has several disabilities,including cerebral palsy,a learning impairment,and a visual deficit.in spring,he completed the eighth grade in the town public middle school.the middle school educated in compliance with idea,which requires participating states to provide all children with disabilities a free appropriate public education,or fape.a a.the particular services required to meet the child educational needs must be set forth at least annually in a written individualized education plan iep.see voluntown bd.of,cir citing d a i.as provided in his eighth grade iep,was mainstreamed with students in at least some academic classes.see,d at.
toward the end of the eighth grade school year,applied for admission to the academy.the school agreed to educate him in the individualized services program,but not in mainstream academic classes,because did not satisfy the fifth grade ability requirement.see id.foster parent refused to send him to the academy under that condition,noting that the child iep for ninth grade called for a mainstream placement in two academic courses,english and social studies.see id.at.
as an alternative,the district offered placement at lake region high school in orleans,vermont.parent refused this offer too,citing a long daily commute and the inability of lake region to provide certain vocational training specified in the iep.parent ultimately decided to have her child repeat the eighth grade.
through his parent challenged the academy position in an idea administrative due process action against the academy and the district.see f.on november,the administrative hearing officer ruled in favor of,holding that idea and the rehabilitation act required the academy to accept the child into its mainstream academic classes.the hearing officer also ordered the district to influence the academy to change the fifth grade policy.
d.the district court decision 
the academy appealed the administrative decision by filing a complaint against,the district,and the vde in the united states district court for the district of vermont,under e west accord i a west.counterclaimed against the academy and against the district,asserting violations of idea and the rehabilitation act 
following trial,the district court issued an interim order directing the academy to admit and to educate him in the two mainstream academic classes identified by his iep.see,d at.nearly two years later,in september,the court issued a published opinion holding that the fifth grade requirement violates idea and a of the rehabilitation act.see,d at.
the district court idea ruling was largely based on that act requirement that disabled students be placed in the least restrictive environment,that students with disabilities be educated with students whenever possible.id.at,citing briggs board of,cir a.according to the district court,the fifth grade standard inadequately accounted for the benefits that disabled students can reap when placed in mainstream academic classes.see id.at educational benefit should not be mistakenly equated with academic benefit alone.the court also found that the drawing of a single line to determine a student program,based on an arbitrary grade level standard,conflicts with idea mandate to design an individualized education program.id.at,emphasis added citing a.
turning to the rehabilitation act,the court observed least with respect to disabled students who are qualified under the requirements of the rehabilitation act resemble those of idea.the court recognized that somewhat different standards apply to public and private recipients of federal funds,but concluded nevertheless that the fifth grade requirement runs afoul of section in general.id.at.
to remedy these statutory violations,the district court permanently enjoined the academy from using the fifth grade requirement to screen students from mainstream academic classes.id.at.the court also awarded one year of compensatory education to make up for the year in which he repeated the eighth grade.see johnsbury academy,cv,at.however,the court found that injunctive relief against the district was neither warranted nor necessary because the district fully supported claim against the academy.id.at.
discussion 
we may overturn an order granting a permanent injunction if the district court relied upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact or incorrectly applied the law.rodriguez city of new york,cir internal quotations omitted.thus,we review de novo questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.see pawlet sch,cir reviewing de novo the application of statutory and regulatory definitions in an idea case.
at oral argument,we questioned sua sponte whether this case may be moot because was then as he is now between his and birthdays.our decision in burr ambach,cir,as well as some decisions in other circuits,could be read to hold that an idea claimant ages out on his birthday.see id.at,addressing whether an award of compensatory education to remedy idea violations can continue beyond a child birthday board of educ.illinois state bd.of,cir the act entitles disabled individuals to special education assistance only until they reach the age of parents of student puyallup sch,cir idea benefits expire upon reaching age.but see pihl massachusetts dep t of,cir he ceased to be eligible for educational services under the idea in,when he turned.if so,this case would be moot notwithstanding the year of compensatory education awarded by the district court.
after reviewing supplementary briefs from the parties,we conclude that idea originally entitled to a fape until his birthday.the additional year of idea coverage awarded by the district court thus preserves the case from mootness.
under a a,idea applies to persons between the ages of and,inclusive.the word inclusive,which must be given meaning,is unnecessary to assure the inclusion of someone aged four,or someone aged,or even someone in his year which culminates in his birthday their inclusion is obvious without the emphasis.if the word inclusive is to mean something,as it must,it means that the relevant period begins on a child third birthday and ends on the last day of his year which culminates in his birthday.
this reading is confirmed by other idea provisions that use the preposition through to bracket ages.subparagraph a b,which conforms the age coverage of idea to the ages in which each state affords a public education,references children through 
idea does not apply with respect to children aged through and through in a state to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with state law or practice,or the order of any court,respecting the provision of public education to children in those age ranges.
a b i emphasis added see also a b ii states need not supply idea services to certain incarcerated children aged through.when this subparagraph is read together with a,which concerns the maximum federal aid that a state may receive in one year,it is clear that aged through in subparagraph a b i is a period that must extend for so long as the child is,and can not be a period that ends on the child birthday.thus a computes maximum funding as 
a the number of children with disabilities in the state who are receiving special education and related services 
i aged through if the state is eligible for preschool grants under and 
ii aged through multiplied by 
b percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the.
a emphasis added.unless congress intended to exclude five from the funding formula,children aged through must mean children for so long as they are five.we conclude that aged through in and aged through in should be read in the same inclusive way.
our reading is further confirmed by idea regulations.thus,unless otherwise dictated by state law or practice,idea applies to children with disabilities aged,and within the state.a,b emphasis added see also a the obligation to make fape available to all children with disabilities does not apply with respect to c hildren aged,or in a state to the extent that its application to those children would be inconsistent with state law emphasis added.in sum,we think that idea eligibility subject to extension in a proper case may continue until the day the claimant turns.
our decision in burr ambach does not hold otherwise,because in that case the significance of the claimant birthday turns on new york law and the discussion of the point naturally concerns new york law not idea.the new york statute at issue,cited in the burr ambach district court opinion,provides that only person s over five and under years of age are eligible to receive a public education.educ.law mckinney supp emphasis added id.mckinney,westlaw same see burr ambach,civ,wl,at.burr also cites a new york provision that each school district ascertain the number of children with handicappping conditions in such district under the age of years.educ.law a mckinney supp emphasis added id.mckinney,westlaw same see burr,wl,at.
as noted above,idea applies to children aged through only if that is consistent with state law on the provision of public education.a b i.obviously,the new york statutes at issue in burr were not consistent with an application of idea beyond the birthday so idea afforded the plaintiff no basis for contesting the point that ordinarily he would have aged out on his birthday.rather,he claimed an award of compensatory public education beyond his birthday to make up for the deprivation of a free education for a period of time before he reached that age,burr,wl,and our holding was that an award of compensatory education beyond the birthday was proper for that reason.see burr,at.
finally,we conclude that vermont law unlike new york law is consistent with an application of idea to children through their year.a proposed regulation expressly affords special education services to children until their birthday.bd.of educ.proposed.counsel for the vde stated at oral argument that this proposed regulation reflects vermont current policy.the proposed regulation also is fully consistent with current state rules,which use the phrase through years of age.bd.of educ.b i emphasis added id.same see also.stat.ann.tit,a defining a legal pupil as an individual who has attained the age of five years but not specifying an upper age limit id.e allowing the provision of special education services to a disabled child having attained the age of.
this case is live,so we proceed to the merits.
b.the merits 
the academy argues that its fifth grade requirement for mainstream academic high school classes can not violate idea because the school is not directly subject to the statute standards.we agree.
in,the vde posed a closely related question to the office for special education programs of the department of education osep,the federal office that is responsible for administering idea.see a west a west.the vde legal counsel asked osep to provide a formal interpretation of federal regulations related to the general standards for private schools which serve eligible handicapped children.letter to reedy,at.the vde legal counsel explained that 
vermont presently is developing state regulations which would establish standards for private schools that would enable such schools to receive public tuition funds for serving students pursuant to iep.the dilemma we face is how to ensure that our standards are consistent with federal requirements while at the same time preserving the independence of vermont private schools that serve children with handicapping conditions.
id.the question posed was whether private schools are bound by the same admission and discipline policies that apply to the public schools id.at.osep responding policy letter makes clear that in all cases idea obligations fall upon the public agency,not the private school 
when a public agency places a child who is disabled in a private school or facility for the purposes of providing that child with fape,it does so as a means of providing that child with an educational program that it was unable to provide that child citing.thus,the public school remains responsible for the education of the child and for ensuring that the child has all the rights of a handicapped child served by a public agency.quoting b accord c 
with respect to admission,if a private school or facility is unable or unwilling to provide an appropriate educational program for a child who is disabled,the public agency remains responsible for providing,or ensuring the provision of,a fape to that child,either by locating another appropriate private school placement for the child or by educating the child in a public agency program.with respect to discipline,where a child who is disabled requires disciplinary action,the public agency responsible for the education of the child must ensure that any disciplinary action that is administered to the child meets applicable idea requirements.
id.at emphasis added.the policy letter also contemplated that the public agency could perform its obligations by negotiating enforceable agreements with the private schools for example,public agencies may include provisions regarding the administration of discipline in their contractual relat
