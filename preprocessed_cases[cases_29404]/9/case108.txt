esther mercado sued the commonwealth of puerto rico and three other puerto rico governmental entities under title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.she alleged that they had denied her access to public services and discriminated against her because she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment within the meaning of the ada.the only question that we must decide is whether mercado brought her suit too late.and the answer to that question turns on whether the limitations period set forth in applies to her case.
that provision establishes a,limitations period for statutes that,like the ada,do not set forth their own limitations period.but the period applies only to actions arising under a federal statute enacted after december,the date on which became law.the parties agree that if that,limitations period does apply here,then mercado suit was timely filed.otherwise,mercado concedes that puerto rico law would supply the limitations period,that the applicable period under puerto rico law would only be one year,and that her suit would have been filed too late.
the district court concluded that mercado regarded as claims did not aris e under a federal statute enacted after december,because the ada was passed prior to that date.thus,the district court applied the puerto rico statute of limitations and dismissed her suit as.we conclude,however,that limitations period does apply here because mercado legal claims were made possible by the amendments to the ada codified in the ada amendments act of the adaaa.we thus reverse the district court order of dismissal.
mercado initially filed her complaint in federal court on august,before filing an amended complaint on march.dkt.the amended complaint which we will refer to as the complaint from here on out names the commonwealth of puerto rico,the supreme court of puerto rico,the oficina de administración de tribunales,and the administración de servicios de salud mental y contra la addición as defendants.dkt.
the complaint alleges that the defendants subjected mercado to involuntary institutional confinement by ordering her committed to a psychiatric hospital without giving her an opportunity to be heard.am.compl.the complaint further alleges the defendants violated title ii of the ada because,in so confining her,they discriminated against her and denied public services to her by reason of her disability.am.compl.
the complaint sets out what it identifies as three separate causes of action.the first two are for damages based on discrimination or denial of public services under title ii of the ada.am.compl,the last is for an injunction ordering puerto rico to devise a system guaranteeing counsel,as well as notice and the right to be heard,to any disabled person who faces involuntary confinement in a psychiatric hospital.am.compl.
the complaint does not allege that mercado had a disability in the sense that she had what the ada refers to as an impairment.see a.nor does the complaint allege that she was discriminated against because she had such an impairment.instead,the complaint alleges that the defendants discriminated against mercado by reason of the fact that she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment within the meaning of the ada.see id.c,
in pleading regarded as discrimination claims under the ada,the complaint alleges that mercado had a disability within the meaning of the ada b y virtue of the ada amendments act of,and changes in definition of the term disability because defendants regarded her as having a major mental impairment.am.compl.the amendments altered the ada by,among other things,stating that 
a n individual meets the requirement of being regarded as having such an impairment if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.

the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.they argued that a statute of limitations applied to mercado claims under puerto rico law and that she had not filed within that period.dkts.mercado opposed the motion.she did so solely on the ground that her claims dependence on the amendments to the ada made the,period in,rather than the limitations period under puerto rico law,applicable to her suit.dkt.citing jones,at.
the district court rejected mercado argument.the district court concluded that her claims would have been actionable under the original provisions of the ada,mercado puerto rico,d,and thus that limitations period did not apply.because the district court agreed with the defendants that,under puerto rico law,a statute of limitations applied to mercado claims and that she had not complied with it,the district court dismissed her complaint as.id.at.
on appeal,mercado does not contest the district court ruling that the puerto rico statute of limitations would apply to her suit if the period established by does not apply in its stead.nor does she contest that her suit was not filed within that time period.rather,she challenges only the district court determination that limitations period does not apply.and so that is the only issue that we address.
the question that we must decide is one of statutory interpretation,for which our review is de novo.highmark allcare health mgmt.but the question is not one that we answer on a blank slate.rather,in jones donnelley sons,the supreme court interpreted the meaning of the key phrase in a civil action arising under an act of congress.we thus begin by describing jones in more detail.we then explain why,in light of jones,we conclude that the limitations period set forth in applies to mercado claims.
in jones,the court explained that many federal statutes do not set forth their own limitations period and that,in response,courts had developed the settled practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations to fill the void.id.at jones recognized,however,that this practice had generated a host of issues that required resolution on a basis and,as a result,had spawned a vast amount of litigation.id.at.for example,jones noted that in the course of undertaking such gap filling,courts had confronted a range of difficult issues.courts were required to decide,among other things,from which state the limitations period should be borrowed,which limitations period should be borrowed from that state,and whether federal or state law governed certain procedural matters related to the calculation of that period such as when an action was commenced,or when service of process had to be effectuated.id.at.
the court emphasized that congress was keenly aware of the difficulties federal courts faced in filling the void.id.at.the court thus concluded that the central purpose of,which congress enacted on december,was to reduce the need for courts to engage in such work.id.
in light of this legislative purpose,the court explained that the phrase a civil action arising under an act of congress in should be interpreted in a manner that fills more rather than less of the void that has created so much unnecessary work for federal judges.id.the court thus declined to construe text so narrowly that it would apply only to claims that are based on post statute s that establish a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
but the court also agreed that should not be interpreted in a way that disrupt ed the settled expectations of litigants.id.and so the court rejected a construction of under which any new amendment to federal law would suffice to trigger the year statute of limitations,id.at emphasis added,no matter how inconsequential that amendment might be to the plaintiff ability to bring the claims at issue.
having dispensed with each of these interpretations of the scope of,the court then described the course that it concluded congress had actually steered.according to the court,an enactment that creates a new right to maintain an action is one under which a civil action may aris e within the meaning of.id.at.and the court noted that congress routinely creates new rights of action by amending existing statutes,and altering statutory definitions,or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined,is a common way of amending statutes.id.at alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
no matter the form an enactment takes,though,the court made clear that w hat matters is the substantive effect of an enactment the creation of new rights of action and corresponding liabilities.id.thus,jones held,a claim that necessarily depend s on such an enactment is a claim that was made possible by a,enactment and thus a claim for which supplies the limitations period.id.at.
the court explained that it was not persuaded that any guess work is required to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the relevant statute as it stood prior to december,or whether her claims necessarily depend on a subsequent amendment.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the court did acknowledge that such a determination could be particularly complicated in cases in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute.id.at.a case of that type could require a court to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.id.but the court concluded that such an analysis was hardly beyond the judicial ken.id.after all,the court noted,c ourts must answer precisely the same question when deciding whether an amendment may be applied retrospectively.id.
the jones court then applied to the facts of that case.the jones plaintiffs had brought a number of race discrimination claims under,which was originally enacted in.that statute protects,among other things,the right to make and enforce contracts free from discrimination on the basis of race.id.at quoting.
section does not contain its own limitations period,however,and the limitations period that would have otherwise applied in jones had already expired by the time that the jones plaintiffs filed suit.id.the jones plaintiffs nonetheless contended that their claims were not.id.the plaintiffs argued that the limitations period established by applied to their claims due to the relationship between those claims and the changes that had been made to section after enactment.id.at.
specifically,in,the court had ruled in another case that did not protect against conduct that occurred after the formation of the contract.id.citing patterson mclean credit union.but,the plaintiffs noted,in and thus after the enactment of,congress amended to define the term make and enforce contracts to include the termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.id.at quoting b.as a result,this amendment enlarged the category of conduct that is subject to liability to include discriminatory conduct like that alleged by the jones plaintiffs.id.at quoting rivers roadway express,u.
in light of this legislative change,the court concluded that did supply the statute of limitations for the jones plaintiffs claims.the court explained that their legal claims did not allege a violation of the pre version of but did allege violations of the amended statute.id.at.as a result,the court held that the jones plaintiffs legal claims were made possible by the amendment to,as their suit to recover for defendants conduct could succeed only by virtue of that amendment and thus necessarily depend ed on it.id.at.
we have had one occasion to construe the scope of following jones.in millay me.dep t of labor,bureau of,div.for blind visually impaired,cir,we considered whether a statutory amendment sufficed to trigger the limitations period set forth in.we concluded that the amendment had a substantive effect that made possible the claim at issue because the amendment permitted expanded possibilities for judicial review of the administrative action that the plaintiff was challenging.id.
of course,an amendment that makes a new avenue of judicial review available has a substantive effect that is distinct from the effect of the amendment that was at issue in jones.but we nevertheless concluded in millay that such an amendment still met the jones standard of having made possible the claim at issue.id.at.
we explained that,although some courts had previously allowed similar challenges to the underlying administrative action to be enforced through,the relevant amendments still created a new and broader remedy than the one that had previously existed.id.at.we thus concluded that the amendments there at issue the amendments to the rehabilitation act,even if deemed purely procedural,made possible the plaintiff claims because they enabled the plaintiff to bring the then current proceeding for judicial review,id.and we explained that this conclusion made sense in light of the great interpretive weight that must be given to congress clear intention that be applied broadly in order to reduce the need for courts to borrow state limitations periods.id.at.
in light of jones,and consistent with our application of that precedent in millay,we conclude that establishes the limitations period for mercado regarded as claims.to explain why we reach this conclusion,we first describe the substantive effect of the changes that the adaaa made to the ada.we then explain why mercado claims necessarily depend on those amendments and thus why we conclude that the adaaa made possible mercado claims.see jones,at.
a review of the relevant legislative history reveals the substantive effect of the change made to the ada by the adaaa.when first enacted on july,the ada defined the term disability with respect to an individual as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.americans with disabilities act of,stat,codified as amended at.years later,however,the supreme court narrowly construed the third prong of that original definition.sutton united air lines.specifically,the supreme court interpreted that prong to require a plaintiff to plead and prove that she was regarded as having an impairment that fit the terms of the first prong that is,that she was regarded as having an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities.id.
nearly a decade later,however,congress passed the adaaa.those amendments expressly rejected the interpretation of regarded as having such an impairment that the court had set forth in sutton,b.in enacting those amendments,congress changed the relevant portion of the ada by adding a new paragraph.that new paragraph defined the scope of the term being regarded as having such an impairment,id,c,as follows 
an individual meets the requirement of being regarded as having such an impairment if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.
id,a emphasis added 
thus,the amendments codified in the adaaa made the ada definition of being regarded as having an impairment substantively broader than that definition had been in the period after sutton.during that period,a plaintiff could maintain an ada claim based on being regarded as having an impairment only if she pleaded that she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities.see sutton,at.after the enactment of the adaaa,however,a plaintiff bringing a regarded as claim under the ada needs to plead and prove only that she was regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.such a plaintiff no longer needs to plead and prove that such impairment substantially limited one or more major life activities,a.thus,while the change made to the ada by the adaaa may not be as significant as the change made by the amendment to section at issue in jones,the change is still one that had a substantive effect.mccormick miami,cir declining to apply where the operative amendments to the rehabilitation act essentially changed the nomenclature in the relevant section by replacing the word handicap with the word disability.
the remaining question is whether mercado regarded as claims necessarily depend on the substantive effect brought about by the change that the adaaa made to the ada.see jones,at.we conclude that the claims she brought in her complaint do necessarily depend on that change and thus that her claims were made possible by those amendments.see id.at.
mercado complaint expressly refers to the amendments in pleading her regarded as claims.by enlarg ing the category of conduct that is subject to liability,id.at,those amendments permit mercado to plead and prove one fewer element of her regarded as claims than she would have been required to plead and prove under the ada as it existed prior to those amendments.by virtue of those amendments,mercado need not plead and prove that the defendants regarded her as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited a major life activity.she need plead and prove only that the defendants regarded her as having a physical or mental impairment,no matter the defendants view of the magnitude of the effect of the perceived impairment on her life activities.
for that reason,mercado legal claims necessarily depend on the amendments.see id.at.accordingly,her claims aris e under an act of congress passed after december.see.
the district court mistakenly concluded otherwise by holding that the adaaa merely clarif ied a ada right to be protected from regarded as discrimination.mercado,d at.according to the district court,this conclusion followed because it was apparent that the elements of the ada definition of disability were identical pre and by the adaa.id.at.thus,the district court ruled that mercado claims would have been actionable under the original provisions of the ada.id.at.
but,as we have explained,the adaaa added a new paragraph to the ada that changed the definition of the term regarded as having such an impairment.ada amendments act of,a.that new paragraph removed a key element of that definition and thereby broadened the ada substantive scope.thus,contrary to the district court assertion,the elements of the definition pre and are not identical.they are instead substantively distinct,with the consequence that the amended definition creates a broader right to be free from regarded as discrimination than did the unamended definition.
to be sure,the preamble to the adaaa,a,b,does state that congress originally intended the term regarded as having such an impairment to be read more broadly than the supreme court read it to be in sutton,at.but,even if that statement can be said to have characterized the amendments as having merely clarified rather than altered the original scope of the ada,such a legislative statement can not strip the amendments of the substantive effect that they undeniably had.the adaaa explicitly rejected sutton.in so doing,the adaaa quite clearly broadened the definition of being regarded as having an impairment beyond what it had been under the previously controlling supreme court interpretation of that phrase,b,a.
thus,this is not a case in which there was a split of authority regarding the scope of the original statute that would require us to determine whether the amendment clarified existing law or created new rights and liabilities.jones,at.rather,this is a case in which the substantive effect of the amendments in question is clear.those amendments rejected the narrow interpretation of the statute set forth in a controlling supreme court opinion.by doing so,those amendments clearly created new rights and liabilities.and because,as we have explained,mercado claims necessarily depend on the expanded liability created by those amendments,her claims are governed by the limitations period that sets forth.see jones,at.
the defendants do make one additional argument against our conclusion,but we do not find it to be persuasive.the defendants argue that limitations period does not apply because mercado actual complaint alleges that she was regarded by the defendants as having a major mental impairment rather than a minor one.administración br.the defendants contend that this reference to a major impairment in her complaint shows that her complaint alleges facts that would have been sufficient to state a claim even under the ada as it stood after sutton but before the enactment of the adaaa.for that reason,the defendants assert,mercado claims do not necessarily depend on and thus are not made possible by the amendments set forth in the ada.rather,the defendants argue that her complaint on the strength of the factual allegation that she was regarded as having a major impairment states claims on which relief under the ada could have been granted even if the adaaa had never been enacted.
the defendants contention arguably draws support from the fact that the jones plaintiffs claims of hostile work environment,wrongful termination,and failure to transfer alleged violations of the amended statute but did not allege a violation of the pre version of section.at emphasis added.here,by contrast,defendants contend that mercado is by referring to a major impairment in her complaint alleging a claim that she could have brought under the original version of the ada.
but we do not believe jones requires that we attribute the significance that defendants do to the complaint reference to a major impairment.the amendment to that was at issue in jones left the version of the discrimination claim intact even as it also made possible new discrimination claims by subjecting conduct to liability for the first time.the adaaa,by contrast,replaced the regarded as claim with a new regarded as claim that requires a plaintiff to plead and prove one fewer element.the adaaa thus did not add a new claim so much as it reduced the requirements to prove an existing one.but this difference in the form that congress used to enlarge liability does not mean that the adaaa did not ma k e possible mercado claims.see jones,at.
just as the amendment to at issue in jones allowed plaintiffs to plead and prove elements of a discrimination claim that previously was not available,so,too,does the adaaa.under the amendments,on which mercado complaint relies,she may now recover for discrimination without showing as the ada previously required that the defendants regarded her impairment as a substantially one.thus,by asserting in her complaint a violation of the new,substantively broader right protected by the amended ada rather than the narrower right protected by the unamended ada,she is asserting a claim that did not exist before just as was true of the plaintiffs in jones.the amendments therefore made possible the particular legal claims that mercado has brought,even if her complaint also contains factual allegations that perhaps could have supported the different and regarded as claim that existed prior to the amendments but that congress has replaced and that she is not now bringing 
simply put,an amendment to a statute that bars a new,broader form of discrimination may still ma ke possible a plaintiff suit to redress that discrimination,even if it may be true that the plaintiff has also suffered a different,more specific form of discrimination that the unamended statute already barred.we thus conclude that notwithstanding the reference to a major impairment in mercado complaint mercado legal claims necessarily depend on the amendments to the ada no less than the jones plaintiffs legal claims necessarily depend ed on the amendment to.see id.at.indeed,in this case,a contrary conclusion would oddly make the limitations period that sets forth applicable only if mercado amended her complaint to delete a factual allegation that she need not make in order to plead the only regarded as claims that she actually brings in her complaint.we decline to read jones to require such a strange result.
congress enacted in order to reduce the need for litigation about how best to fill the void that arises when statutes fail to specify the limitations period a
