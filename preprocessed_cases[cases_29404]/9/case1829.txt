opinion of the court 
appellant johnny watson alleges that he was removed from his position of account executive at eastman kodak company kodak because of unlawful race and age discrimination.under federal law,a complainant has days from the date of the adverse employment decision to file a claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.in delaware state college ricks,d,the supreme court held that an adverse employment action occurs,and the statute of limitations therefore begins to run,at the time the employee receives notice of that action and termination is a delayed but inevitable result.relying on ricks,the district court measured the limitations period from the date on which watson was notified of his termination from the account executive position,and dismissed watson claim as untimely.watson asserts that ricks date of notification rule does not control the limitations period in his case because kodak left open the possibility of watson continued employment with the company.we disagree.because we concur with the district court that the relevant date from which to measure the timeliness of watson discrimination claim is the date on which he was removed from the account executive position,and because we conclude that the mere speculative possibility of continued employment does not alter ricks date of notification rule,we will affirm.
johnny watson began working for kodak in,and was promoted in to the position of account executive.he alleges that in that capacity he consistently met his sales quotas and received several employment awards,including five club awards and one master club award for reaching of his sales quota.he also reportedly received favorable performance evaluations and was not subject to any disciplinary action.
in december,watson transferred to kodak office in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,where he was the only account executive.roger gagnon was his immediate supervisor.watson alleges that,from the outset,gagnon interfered with his performance by refusing to provide support comparable to what he offered younger,white account executives.according to watson,gagnon interference prevented him from meeting his sales quotas for and.
in january,watson wrote a letter to gagnon complaining about these matters and contending that race discrimination was the reason for that lack of support.gagnon responded in a letter dated february,informing watson that,due to poor performance,he was retroactively removed from his account executive classification effective january.it also stated that watson would be allowed to remain with kodak beyond march,only if he was successful in obtaining another position within the company,an effort with which gagnon professed he would help.watson failed to find another position.consequently,kodak terminated his employment on march.
thereafter,watson was hospitalized briefly in pennsylvania.upon his release,in june,he traveled to florida where he stayed at his mother residence.while in florida on december,realizing that the administrative deadline for filing a discrimination charge was about to expire,watson filed a claim with the eeoc at its miami,florida branch,alleging violations of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,to,and the age discrimination in employment act adea,to.when he filed the discrimination charge,watson described the adverse action taken against him as follows 
i was employed by eastman kodak company for eighteen years.during that time there were several situations revolveing sic around pay,assignments to territory and like sic of understanding.i believe that my race and age at the time of my termination from sic played a roll sic in their decision to release me.
the eeoc investigator informed watson that the claim would be processed,then transferred back to pennsylvania.on may,after retaining counsel,watson filed an amended charge in which he added a pay discrimination claim.
relying upon delaware state college ricks,d,the district court concluded that watson unlawful termination claim accrued on february,the date he received gagnon letter.because watson submitted his eeoc charge days later,on december,the court determined his claim fell outside the statutorily allotted day filing deadline.consequently,the court granted kodak summary judgment.
on appeal,watson argues that the district court misconstrued ricks and that it erred in failing to conclude that his termination claim accrued on march,which is within days of the date he filed his eeoc discrimination charge in florida.he also contends that,even if we determine that the termination claim was untimely,we should find that his discrimination in compensation claim,based on a continuing violation theory,was timely.
this court review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary,and the record is judged by the same standard district courts use.witkowski welch,cir.federal rule of civil procedure governs summary judgment motions.subsection c provides,in part,that 
t he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and summary judgment is to be entered if the evidence is such that a reasonable fact finder could find only for the moving party.anderson liberty lobby,d doherty teamsters pension trust fund,cir.
under title vii and the adea,plaintiffs residing in states having an agency authorized to grant relief for federally prohibited employment discrimination must resort to that state remedy before they will be allowed access to federal judicial relief.see c title vii b adea oscar mayer evans,d.such states are termed deferral states.see evans,at.it is undisputed that pennsylvania is a deferral state.see.a,sharpe philadelphia hous,cir.
title vii and adea plaintiffs such as watson,who file in deferral states,must submit their administrative discrimination charge within days of the challenged employment action.see e title vii d adea colgan fisher scientific,cir en banc.therefore,watson attempt to obtain relief under federal law from kodak alleged employment discrimination on the basis of race and age may proceed only if he filed his administrative charge of discrimination within days of the unlawful employment actions he challenges.
the crucial issue in this case is whether the actionable adverse employment decision was the one to separate watson from the position of account executive or the one to terminate his employment with kodak entirely.we begin our analysis of the timeliness issue with the supreme court decision in delaware state college ricks.in ricks,a professor at delaware state college challenged the college decision not to grant him tenure as being unlawfully based on national origin discrimination.ricks,at.the professor pursued internal grievance procedures within the college to protest the tenure denial,and in the meantime the college,as it customarily did,entered into a one year terminal contract with him that allowed the professor one extra year of employment before his actual termination.id.at.
of primary importance in the case,due to the date the professor filed his administrative discrimination charge,was the date that his unlawful termination claim accrued.see id.at.the professor argued that it accrued on the date of his final day of employment under the terminal contract.see id.at.the supreme court rejected his theory,ruling instead that his unlawful termination claim accrued when he initially received the college notice that he had been denied tenure.id.at.
the court emphasized that the key inquiry was identifying the precise alleged unlawful employment practice.id.at.this was the central issue because the relevant federal statute,title vii,measured the administrative charge timeliness from the date the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.id.at.quoting e accord d for adea claims,timeliness of administrative charge is measured from date the alleged u
