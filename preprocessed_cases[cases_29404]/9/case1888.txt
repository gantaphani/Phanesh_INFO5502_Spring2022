on remand following the first appeal,the district court concluded that the plan violated the adea,and awarded partial summary judgment in favor of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on the issue of the county liability.the county filed this interlocutory appeal.upon our review,we hold that the district court correctly determined that the county plan violated the adea,because the plan employee contribution rates were determined by age,rather than by any permissible factor.we further conclude that the adea safe harbor provision applicable to early retirement benefit plans does not shield the county from liability for the alleged discrimination accordingly,we affirm the district court award of summary judgment on the issue of liability,and remand the case for consideration of damages.

the county did not fully fund the plan but instead required that employees contribute a certain fixed percentage of their annual salaries over the course of their employment employee contribution rates or the rates.the employee contribution rates were established based on calculations developed by buck consultants buck,an actuarial firm employed by the county.
the county directed buck to calculate rates to ensure that employees contributions,as well as earnings on those contributions,would fund about of employees pension benefits.the county contributions to the plan and related earnings would fund the remaining of the pension benefits.
to achieve these objectives and to ensure that all employees received the same level of pension benefits,buck based its calculations for employee contribution rates on the number of years that an employee would contribute to the plan before being eligible to retire at age.buck also considered numerous actuarial factors,including anticipated percentage increases in salaries,probable lengths of employees careers,the potential interest rates on earnings,mortality rates,and the likelihood of employees withdrawal from the plan before retirement.
using the retirement age of,buck ultimately concluded that older employees who enrolled in the plan should contribute a higher percentage of their salaries,because their contributions would earn interest for fewer years than the younger employees contributions.the county adopted buck recommended rates and determined that t he rate of contribution of the employee shall be determined by the employee age at the time the employee actually joins the plan.balt.thus,under the county decision,the older that an employee was at the time of enrollment,the higher the rate that the employee was required to contribute
