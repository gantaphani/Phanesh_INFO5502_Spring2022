pursuant to the indian and education assistance act isda,petitioner menominee indian tribe of wisconsin contracted with the indian health service ihs to operate what would otherwise have been a federal program and to receive an amount of money equal to what the government would have spent on operating the program itself,including reimbursement for reasonable contract support costs,a.after other tribal entities successfully litigated complaints against the federal government for failing to honor its obligation to pay contract support costs,the menominee tribe presented its own contract support claims to the ihs in accordance with the contract disputes act of cda,which requires contractors to present each claim to a contracting officer for decision,a.the contracting officer denied some of the tribe claims because they were not presented within the cda limitations period.see a a.
the tribe challenged the denials in federal district court,arguing that the limitations period should be tolled for the nearly two years in which a putative class action,brought by tribes with parallel complaints,was pending.as relevant here,the district court eventually denied the tribe claim,and the court of appeals affirmed,holding that no extraordinary circumstances beyond the tribe control caused the delay.
held equitable tolling does not apply to the presentment of petitioner claims.
a to be entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations,a litigant must establish that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.holland florida.the tribe argues that diligence and extraordinary circumstances should be considered together as factors in a unitary test,and it faults the court of appeals for declining to consider the tribe diligence in connection with its finding that no extraordinary circumstances existed.but this court has expressly characterized these two components as elements,not merely factors of indeterminate or commensurable weight,pace diguglielmo,and has treated them as such in practice,see lawrence florida.the tribe also objects to the court of appeals interpretation of the extraordinary circumstances prong as requiring the showing of an external obstacle to timely filing.this court reaffirms that this prong is met only where the circumstances that caused a litigant delay are both extraordinary and beyond its control.
b none of the tribe excuses satisfy the extraordinary circumstances prong of the test.the tribe had unilateral authority to present its claims in a timely manner.its claimed obstacles,namely,a mistaken reliance on a putative class action and a belief that presentment was futile,were not outside the tribe control.and the significant risk and expense associated with presenting and litigating its claims are far from extraordinary.finally,the special relationship between the united states and indian tribes,as articulated in the isda,does not override clear statutory language.

tribal contractors have repeatedly complained that the federal government has not fully honored its obligations to pay contract support costs.three lawsuits making such claims are relevant here.
the first was a class action filed by the ramah navajo chapter alleging that the bureau of indian affairs bia systematically underpaid certain contract support costs.ramah navajo chapter lujan,d nm filed.in,ramah successfully moved for certification of a nationwide class of all tribes that had contracted with the bia under the isda.see order and memorandum opinion in ramah navajo chapter lujan,d nm,app.the government argued that each tribe needed to present its claims to a contracting officer before it could participate in the class,at.but the trial court held that tribal contractors could participate in the class without presentment,because the suit alleged systemwide flaws in the bia contracting scheme,not merely breaches of individual contracts,at.the government did not appeal the certification order,and the ramah class action proceeded to further litigation and settlement.
