once again we are called upon to clarify the boundaries of the attorney fees award.we recently delineated those boundaries in arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cir,amended on other grounds by cir,in which we abandon ed the lodestar approach to awarding attorney fees,and adopted instead a presumptively reasonable fee calculation,whereby district courts are advised to bear in mind all of the variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of attorney fees in setting a reasonable hourly rate,id.at emphasis in original.
in this appeal by the new york city transit authority the ta following a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff rosetta simmons simmons on her disability discrimination claim,our attention is on the parameters of one such variable the circumstances in which a district court may depart from the traditional forum rule,under which district courts are directed to calculate attorney fees based on the rates prevalent in the forum in which the litigation was brought.the district court,relying on arbor hill,awarded attorney fees to simmons based on the prevailing hourly rates in the southern district of new york southern district,where simmons attorneys were based,even though the case was litigated in the eastern district of new york eastern district,where the prevailing hourly rates are substantially lower.
we conclude that in order to receive an attorney fee award based on higher rates,a litigant must overcome a presumption in favor of the forum rule,by persuasively establishing that a reasonable client would have selected counsel because doing so would likely not just possibly produce a substantially better net result.in this case,simmons has not overcome the presumption in favor of the forum rule.we address the remaining issues on appeal separately in a summary order filed concurrently with this opinion.
background 
the facts relevant to the attorney fees claim are as follows.simmons,a ta train operator since,filed the instant complaint in february after she was removed from train operator duty.she alleged that the ta had discriminated against her on the basis of her disability in violation of the rehabilitation act of,the americans with disabilities act ada,the new york city human rights law,city admin.code,and the new york state human rights law,exec,by failing to reasonably accommodate her impairment.after extensive discovery,the district court denied the ta motion for summary judgment.the first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a verdict.after the mistrial,the district court denied the ta and renewed summary judgment motions.at the close of the second trial,the district court reserved decision on the ta motion for a directed verdict.on december,the jury returned a verdict for simmons and awarded her in damages.
the battle was not over.although the parties agreed to try issues of economic damages to the court and stipulated to the calculation of back wages and pension credits,the parties disputed whether simmons was entitled to compensation for lost fringe benefit time.in march,the district court found against simmons on that issue.the ta then moved for judgment as a matter of law in the underlying discrimination case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,or in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,and the district court denied the ta motions in their entirety.
simmons then moved for attorney fees,as a prevailing party under the ada,the rehabilitation act,b,and the new york city human rights law,admin.code f.she calculated her attorney fees based on the hourly rates in the southern district where her attorneys were based,which,as the district court recognized,are higher than the hourly rates charged in the eastern district.simmons city transit,no,wl,at march,see also luciano v.the olsten,cir.the ta challenged simmons fees calculation,on the basis that,inter alia,the correct hourly rates were those that prevailed in the eastern district,where the case was litigated.
the district court agreed with simmons position.the district court first acknowledged that,according to the forum rule,t he reasonable rate used to determine the amount of attorney fees to award is calculated according to the prevailing rates in the district in which the court sits.simmons,wl,at citing polk state dep t of corr,cir.the district court concluded,however,that simmons was justified in retaining counsel under the circumstances,and therefore the court was permitted,under arbor hill,to adjust th e base hourly rate to account for simmons reasonable decision.id.quoting arbor hill,at first alteration in original.the district court found that,a lthough there may be other civil rights attorneys in the eastern district,simmons decision to hire counsel was reasonable due to counsel experience and success rate in litigating disability discrimination cases,and the fact that travel time between the southern and eastern districts is minimal.id.at.
following motions for interest on attorney fees,the district court awarded simmons attorney fees in the total amount of.
the ta appealed this award.
discussion 
legal standard 
we review decisions to award or deny attorney fees for abuse of discretion.jacobson healthcare fin,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it relies on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.kerin postal,cir quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d.
ii.the forum rule 
in arbor hill,we undertook to simplify the complexities surrounding attorney fees awards that had accumulated over time under the traditional lodestar approach to attorney fees the product of the attorney usual hourly rate and the number of hours worked,which could then be adjusted by the court to set the reasonable fee,and the separate johnson approach a inquiry that considered twelve specified factors to establish a reasonable fee.at.relying on the substance of both approaches,we set forth a standard that we termed the presumptively reasonable fee.id.at.we directed district courts,in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee,to bear in mind all of the variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of attorney fees in setting a reasonable hourly rate.id.at emphasis in original.the presumptively reasonable fee boils down to what a reasonable,paying client would be willing to pay,given that such a party wishes to spend the minimum necessary to litigate the case effectively.id.at.
the facts of arbor hill also required us to further develop the parameters of the forum rule,a methodology first developed by the supreme court in blum stenson,d.according to the forum rule,courts should generally use the hourly rates employed in the district in which the reviewing court sits in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.arbor hill,at quoting in re agent orange prod.liab,cir see also blum,at.polk,at.the court may apply an rate or some other rate,based on the aforementioned variables if,in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee,it is clear that a reasonable,paying client would have paid those higher rates.at.
arbor hill had no occasion to draw the exact parameters of the forum rule and,specifically,the exception to the rule.in defining the exception to the rule,we stated that 
w e presume a reasonable,paying client would in most cases hire counsel from within his district,or at least counsel whose rates are consistent with those charged locally.this presumption may be only in the unusual the party wishing the district court to use a higher rate demonstrates that his or her retention of an attorney was reasonable under the circumstances as they would be reckoned by a client paying the attorney bill.
id.emphasis added.thus,while we disavowed strict adherence to the forum rule where circumstances have warranted it,id.at citing polk,at agent orange,at,due to our belief that district courts should award fees just high enough to attract competent counsel,id.at quoting lewis coughlin,cir,we still emphasized that deviation from the forum rule is only appropriate in the unusual case,in which
