background 
except as indicated below,the facts,as asserted in defendants motion for summary judgment and admitted by in response to that motion,include the following.
a.the parties and the course of employment 
an of jamaican descent,was first employed by chro in the early as an investigator,initially in a provisional position and thereafter in a permanent position.in,she was promoted to be regional manager of chro office in bridgeport in,she became regional manager of its waterbury office.
defendant cynthia was executive director of chro from march until august.defendant leanne appleton was chro fiscal administrative supervisor from january until.
defendant donald newton,a chro employee for more than years,began serving as its chief of field operations in.in that capacity,he supervised chro regional managers.he continually reminded all regional managers,including,that they were expected to be at work every day in accordance with their approved schedules.
in her two positions as manager of chro regional offices,was responsible for supervising the staffs and operations of those offices.her scheduled working hours were to.in early,newton questioned about a time sheet representing that she had worked eight hours on january,a day on which newton had telephoned her office at and been informed that she was not in.responded that she had in fact been in the office when newton called,because she had arrived at work that day at not by as her schedule required.newton sought additional information to shed light on the discrepancy between insistence that she had been in her office by and the staff member statement that had not arrived by 
as had an official parking space in a garage with an electronic access system,newton asked appleton to obtain the records for january,from the garage operator.she did so,and the records for that date showed that had arrived in the garage at further,other records,whose accuracy does not concede,showed numerous occasions when arrived several hours late for work,occasions when she left work before the scheduled end of the day,and occasions when she both arrived late and left early.for example,for the period november,through february,encompassed records showed that arrived more than one hour late times,including days on which she arrived more than two hours late.after a review of these records,requested an audit of all chro employee time sheets.examination of time sheets revealed numerous hours claimed as work time that were contradicted by the garage records of her times of arrival and departure.
on march,informed in writing that an investigation of her time records had been conducted and that,based on that investigation,chro was considering formal discipline,including dismissal.chro held a formal hearing on march attended,but she refused to participate or answer questions.she requested and was granted an opportunity to provide a written response but her response provided no information addressing the discrepancies between her time sheets and the garage data.
on march,received a letter from,stating that employment with chro would be terminated effective april.see letter from to dated march,termination letter.the termination letter also informed that a lthough your dismissal will be effective april,and you will be paid through that date,from this day forward,you will neither be expected nor authorized to report to work.id.at.the letter stated that was being dismissed for the good of chro,as a result of her fraudulent use of state time.id.
on october,filed an administrative complaint with the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.she thereafter received a letter.
b.the present action and the motions to dismiss 
commenced the present action in december against the state and chro,against in her official capacity,and against appleton and newton in their official and individual capacities,alleging that had been the victim of discrimination on the basis of race,color,and national origin.the complaint alleged that the state and chro had subjected her to a hostile work environment and terminated her employment in violation of title vii.invoking,it alleged that defendants had discriminated against on the basis of race,color,and national origin in violation of and her right to equal protection.the complaint also alleged that defendants conduct violated the connecticut fair employment practices act cfepa.the parties consented to have the case assigned to a magistrate judge for all purposes.
following discovery,defendants moved to dismiss claims on various grounds.appleton and newton,who in their amended answer to the complaint had alleged insufficiency of service of process,sought dismissal pursuant to.b of the claims asserted against them in their individual capacities,arguing that they had not been served personally.they submitted affidavits stating that they had been served only through the office of the state attorney general and that they had not authorized that office to accept service on their behalf.
in addition,all defendants moved pursuant to.for summary judgment dismissing and claims against the state,chro,and the individual defendants in their official capacities on the ground that those claims were barred by the eleventh amendment.defendants contended that the eleventh amendment also barred pursuit of her claims in federal court,as the connecticut legislature only authorized suit in the connecticut superior court on such claims,not in the federal court.defendants memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment defendants summary judgment memorandum at emphasis in original.
defendants sought summary judgment dismissing title vii claims on the ground that they were because she had not filed her administrative charge with the eeoc within the period specified by e for filings with the eeoc.defendants noted that the period for to file an administrative claim of discriminatory discharge began on the date on which she received notification that her employment would thereafter be terminated see defendants summary judgment memorandum at citing delaware state college ricks,d that had received formal notice of termination on march,and that she had filed her charge with the eeoc on october,more than days later.defendants observed that e provides that the filing period is days rather than days where a claimant has filed her claims with a state or local agency,but they pointed out that 
did not institute proceedings with a state or local agency chro with authority to grant relief in compliance with e,nor did the eeoc defer the complainant charge to the state agency in connecticut for an investigation.therefore,the appropriate limitations period is days from march,
since there was no dual filing with both chro and eeoc it was filed only with eeoc,the plaintiff is not entitled to days and her title vii claim is untimely and must be dismissed for this reason among others.national rr passenger morgan,d.

defendants also argued that could not present a prima facie case of prohibited discrimination,asserting,inter alia,that her fraudulent reporting of time worked had been the sole reason for her dismissal.see id.at see also defendants rule a statement of facts plaintiff was terminated for falsifying her time records and the theft of state time.plaintiff rule b statement of facts admit.
opposed defendants motions to dismiss,arguing principally that she could present a prima facie case of discrimination.as to the motions of appleton and newton to dismiss the claims asserted against them,however,admitted that those defendants had not been personally served and that they had not authorized anyone to accept personal service on their behalf see defendants rule a statement of facts,plaintiff rule b statement of facts,and she did not offer any argument as to why the claims against them should not be dismissed for lack of service of process.nor did offer any argument as to why the state,chro,and the individual defendants in their official capacities did not have eleventh amendment immunity with respect to her and claims or her claims as asserted in this action.
with respect to defendants contention that her title vii claims were,argued as follows 
the defendants argue that the statute began to run on march,when was informed that she would be terminated.suggests that the court should not use the date that the defendant indicates she would be terminated but rather the date that she was in fact terminated.was effectively terminated april.further,the question whether a court may,for purposes of determining liability,review all such conduct,including those acts that occur outside the filing period,turns on the statutory requirement that a charge be filed within a certain number of days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.because such a claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice,it does not matter that some of the component acts fall outside the statutory time period.provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered for the purposes of determining liability.national railroad passenger corporation morgan,d.

c.the decision of the district court 
in a ruling on motion for summary judgment,dated march,district court opinion,the district court granted defendants motions and dismissed the complaint.the court first granted the motion to dismiss the claims asserted against appleton and newton in their individual capacities,noting that it was undisputed that process had been served on them only by service on the office of the attorney general.see district court opinion at.the court held that,as those defendants had not authorized anyone to accept service of process for them in their individual capacities,service on a state office was insufficient to constitute personal service on them for claims against them in their individual capacities.
the district court next concluded that the eleventh amendment barred claims under and against the state,chro,and the individual defendants in their official capacities,holding that the state had not waived its sovereign immunity and that congress enactment of and did not override the immunity that the states and their agencies enjoy under the eleventh amendment.id.at.the court ruled that the eleventh amendment also required the dismissal of claims.the court noted that the state had waived its immunity to suit in state court for cfe p a claims.but it has not clearly expressed a waiver to suit in federal court.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,the district court concluded that title vii claims were untimely.the court stated that title vii requires a plaintiff to file an administrative complaint with the eeoc within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,e and that a claim of discriminatory termination of employment accrues on the date the termination decision is made and communicated to the employee,district court opinion at citing delaware state college ricks,at.the court found that 
i n this case,plaintiff received her formal notice of termination on march,the termination notice stated that she was no longer authorized to report to work after march,her administrative charge was filed on october,days following her formal notice of termination plaintiff contention that the limitations period begins to run as of the effective date of her termination,april,is unsupported by the case law.
district court opinion at.
the district court noted that u nder certain circumstances,the filing period is extended to three hundred days,where the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a state or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from the alleged unlawful employment practice,id.at,but that h ere,plaintiff only filed a claim with the eeoc thus the day limitations period applies,id.the court found that there was no evidence of a continuing violation that could extend the filing period.
judgment was entered dismissing the complaint,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,contends principally that the district court erred in dismissing her title vii claims as,arguing that they were subject to the,rather than the,filing period.she also contends,inter alia,that the court should not have dismissed her claims against appleton and newton in their individual capacities but,at worst,should have given her an extension of time to effect personal service on them.we are unpersuaded.
a.the filing period applicable to the title vii claims 
contends that the district court erred in dismissing her title vii claims as untimely,arguing principally that the applicable period for the filing of her administrative charge,which she filed days after she received the termination letter,was not days but days.she argues that the state has a agreement with the eeoc,and that under such agreements the filing of an administrative charge with either the eeoc or the state agency here chro is deemed a filing with each dual is timely if made within days.we reject this contention because it was not raised in the district court and because has failed to present any reasonable ground for its consideration by this court.
i t is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.greene united states,cir.however,because th is rule is prudential,not jurisdictional,we have discretion to consider waived arguments,sniado bank austria ag,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,and w e have exercised this discretion where necessary to avoid a manifest injustice or where the argument presents a question of law and there is no need for additional,allianz insurance lerner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the circumstances normally do not militate in favor of an exercise of discretion to address new arguments on appeal where those arguments were available to the parties below and they proffer no reason for their failure to raise the arguments below.id.
it is clear that did not make her present argument to the district court,although she had ample incentive to do so.defendants motion for summary judgment asserted that there was no dual filing with both chro and eeoc it was filed only with eeoc,and thus that plaintiff is not entitled to days and her title vii claim is untimely and must be dismissed defendants summary judgment memorandum at emphases in original.as described in part above,response to this untimeliness contention made no reference to a agreement,or to the concept of dual filing,or to any possibility that the applicable period was days.her memorandum argued only that defendants had used the wrong starting date for calculating the period and that the deadline had been met.see memorandum opposing summary judgment at the court should not use the mar
