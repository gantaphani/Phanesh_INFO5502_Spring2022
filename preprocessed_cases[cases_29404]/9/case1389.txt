background 
harris,who is,was employed by niagara in a variety of capacities over a period beginning in february and continuing until his termination in june.although he began his employment with niagara as a temporary meter reader,by the time of his termination he had advanced to a managerial position in niagara collection services department.in and,he had filed complaints with the new york state division of human rights,alleging that niagara had failed to promote him to a management position due to discrimination based on his race,sex,and age,and in retaliation for his complaints of discrimination.the department of human rights found there to be probable cause to believe that plaintiff had suffered discrimination based on his race,color,and sex,and in retaliation for his complaints.as noted by the district court,t hese claims were eventually resolved by an order after stipulation dated september,in which plaintiff executed a general release and defendant agreed to pay plaintiff,elevate him to the position of supervisor accounting,as well as provide him with certain pay adjustments.following another complaint by harris,niagara was later found by the department of human rights to have failed to fully comply with the order,and was ordered to pay harris back wages in the amount of plus interest.
in may,harris began working at niagara syracuse facility as a supervisor in the revenue recovery unit of the collection services department.as such,he was in charge of assisting employees in the processing of bankruptcy accounts,handling final bills,processing of final bills,processing return post office mail,and for developing procedures by which the employees in the revenue recovery would carry out those tasks.
in october,the plaintiff was transferred out of the revenue recovery unit and made a supervisor within the communications center,another unit of the collection services department.kimberly scott evans,who was the director of collection services at the time of the plaintiff transfer,testified at trial that the transfer was neither a promotion nor a demotion,but rather part of a rotation designed to allow niagara supervisors to and to thereby help niagara build a deeper bench.while the plaintiff title and salary remained the same in his new position in the communications center,he alleged that his duties and working environment changed.specifically,he testified at trial that his duties were reduced to the monitoring of customer service calls,that he was placed in a less desirable office,that he was not provided with certain computer software needed to perform his job efficiently,and that he was subject to an additional level of supervision in his new position.the plaintiff therefore felt that he had been effectively demoted and filed an internal complaint with niagara that same month.
shortly thereafter,the plaintiff attempted to return to his former position in revenue recovery by applying for a job vacancy in that unit.he was interviewed for the position after richard lenart,the manager conducting the interviews,was advised by niagara eeo department that it would probably be best to interview the plaintiff so that niagara would get an eeo complaint.b ecause more than likely he would file if niagara did not interview him.the plaintiff was not chosen for the position.in february,the plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that his transfer to the communications center and the failure to transfer him back to the revenue recovery unit were based on his race and made in retaliation for his previous discrimination complaints.less than one month after the filing of his complaint,the plaintiff received a negative performance evaluation for his work in the communications center.
in november,the plaintiff received a memorandum from niagara vice president michael cahill stating that the collection services department would be moving to buffalo,and that managers willing to move there would retain their jobs.however,according to kimberly scott evans,cahill was soon replaced,and,early in,niagara decided that it wanted to change the management style and organization of the collection services department.according to evans and gary jesmain,niagara director of customer service,sometime before april,niagara management decided to abolish the senior supervisor as the one held by the to replace them with team leader positions.in march,niagara began posting information about the new team leader positions.the plaintiff applied for the team leader positions,and was interviewed by richard lenart.on june,harris was informed that he had not been chosen as a team leader.that same day,he was informed that his position as a supervisor had been abolished and that his employment was therefore terminated.when asked why harris was terminated,kimberly scott evans testified that harris had not been a successful candidate for the team leader positions.
harris was not the only supervisor terminated.while some other supervisors were kept on a temporary basis to help with the transition of the collection services department,four other supervisors in addition to harris were terminated on june.all four were caucasian,and there is no evidence in the record to indicate that any of them had a history of discrimination complaints against niagara.
on june,harris filed the instant action against niagara,alleging retaliation and discrimination on the basis of race in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et and section of the new york executive law.his claims were based on,among other actions,his transfer to the communications center,niagara failure to transfer him back to the revenue recovery unit,the failure to hire him as a team leader,and his termination.
on august,a jury was seated and sworn.at the close of the evidence,the jury was charged and given a special verdict form.the form first asked the jury to conclude whether any discrimination or retaliation had taken place,and then asked that the jury indicate,by letter as set forth on pages and of the jury charge,which adverse employment action alleged was done with intent to discriminate or in retaliation for plaintiff filing a complaint.the jury found that niagara had not discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of race,but that it had engaged in retaliation.specifically,the jury indicated that niagara had retaliated against the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff transfer to the communications center the failure to transfer the plaintiff back to the revenue recovery unit and the plaintiff termination.it did not indicate that niagara failure to hire the plaintiff for a team leader position was retaliatory.although the parties had agreed that the determination of damages would be made by the trial judge following a jury trial on liability,the jury was asked to give an advisory verdict with respect to damages.the jury recommended an award of.
following the trial,niagara made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that no reasonable juror could find that niagara actions were taken in retaliation for the plaintiff complaints the court denied the motion with respect to the plaintiff transfer to the communications center and the failure to transfer him back to the revenue r
