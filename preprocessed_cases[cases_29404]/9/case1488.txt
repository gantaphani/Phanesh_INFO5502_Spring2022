opinion of the court 
city of philadelphia police officers michael gwynn and brendon ryan appeal a summary judgment entered in favor of several of their fellow officers and the city.appellants asserted constitutional claims under,statutory claims under the fair labor standards act,and various state law claims.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
as this appeal comes to us following summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to appellants.see montone city of jersey city,cir.
on december,while on duty,appellants stopped and frisked men they believed were engaged in an illegal drug transaction.one of the men they frisked,keyshawn artis,accused appellants of stealing money from him.appellants denied the accusation,and told artis to move along.
when appellants returned to headquarters,a superior officer,sergeant salvatore fede,ordered them into his office.after informing appellants that a complaint about their behavior had been made to the internal affairs bureau,sergeant fede took appellants to captain melvin singleton office.appellants did not feel free to leave because they had been ordered to be in the captain office.app.after waiting fifteen to twenty minutes,appellants and sergeant fede were joined by captain singleton,patrick kelly,and lieutenant frank palumbo.
appellants were instructed to stay in captain singleton office until officers from the internal affairs bureau arrived.while appellants waited,captain singleton offered them water and told them that they could watch television,but instructed them not to use their cell phones.appellants then were questioned about their interaction with artis,including whether they had taken money from him.in that regard,appellants were asked to remove their jackets and gwynn was asked to remove his outer vest.appellants also were told to pull out their pockets,pull up their pant legs and pull down their socks,and open their wallets.finally,appellants were told that cooperation would be in their best interest insofar as it could demonstrate to internal affairs that they did not have arris money when they returned from their patrol.during the hour or so they spent in captain singleton office while awaiting the arrival of internal affairs officers,appellants did as they were told because the orders came from their superiors and supervisors,and they feared discipline and possible loss of employment if they disobeyed.app.
upon their arrival at captain singleton office,two internal affairs officers questioned appellants for about fifteen to twenty minutes and then left briefly to talk to artis,the complainant.appellants were told to stay put until the internal affairs officers returned after speaking with artis.as appellants waited,gwynn asked for permission to call his wife to arrange for her to pick up their son,and kelly granted permission.the internal affairs officers returned,stated that they believed artis,and told appellants that they were not needed for anything further that day.appellants left captain singleton office around and when they opened their lockers that evening,it appeared as though they had been searched.
in february,appellants sued captain singleton,lieutenant kelly,sergeant fede,and lieutenant palumbo along with the city and its police commissioner,charles ramsey.since appellants claims arose under federal and state law,the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to and.
appellants served requests for admission in june that went unanswered until the beginning of august,after the day deadline prescribed by the federal rules of civil procedure.see.a.because appellants requests for admission were deemed admitted by operation of rule,appellees filed a motion in the district court on september,to withdraw those admissions.the district court granted that motion,gave appellees ten additional days to respond,and extended the discovery period for days.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion of appellees.gwynn and ryan filed this timely appeal,which we have jurisdiction to hear pursuant to.
gwynn and ryan first argue that the district court abused its discretion when it allowed appellees to withdraw their admissions.had those admissions remained undisturbed,appellants argue,their summary judgment motion would have been granted.because the district court did not err when it allowed appellees to withdraw their admissions,we reject appellants first argument.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that a request for admission is deemed admitted if a party does not respond within days.nevertheless,courts may permit withdrawal of the admission if doing so would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits.b.courts may consider other factors as well,such as whether the moving party can show good cause for the delay,see conlon united states,cir,but they are not required to do so,see.b.
here,the district court discretionary decision to permit appellees to withdraw the admissions was consistent with both requirements of rule b.upholding the admissions would have significantly interfered with appellees ability to present the merits of their case,and appellants have failed to identify any prejudice they suffered as a result of the withdrawal.in their brief,appellants state that counsel detrimentally relied upon the admissions as indicated at pages of their opposition to the motion in the district court.there,appellants argued that counsel had not moved to compel discovery of certain documents in reliance on the admissions a concern that was adequately addressed by the extension of the discovery deadline.appellants further argued that counsel had developed a litigation strategy that placed reliance on the conclusive facts deemed from the admissions.dkt.at.the prejudice contemplated by rule b,however is not simply that the party who obtained the admission now has to convince the jury of its truth.something more is required.bergemann.united states,cir.
in sum,because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it withdrew appellees deemed admissions,it did not err when it denied appellants motion for summary judgment,which was premised upon the efficacy of those admissions.
appellants next argue that the district court erred when it entered summary judgment against them on their constitutional claims arising under,as well as their claims for false imprisonment and violations of the pennsylvania minimum wage act.ann.et,and the fair labor standards act,et we exercise plenary review over summary judgments,howley mellon fin,cir,and will affirm if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
appellants constitutional arguments are founded upon the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures,as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment.specifically,gwynn and ryan claim they were unreasonably seized when they were ordered to wait in captain singleton office until the internal affairs officers arrived,and that they were unreasonably searched when their superiors asked them to turn out their pockets,take off outer layers of clothing,and reveal the contents of their socks and wallets.although it is not entirely clear from their brief,appellants seem also to contend that appellees conducted an unreasonable search of their lockers.viewing the record in the light most favorable to appellants,the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment because appellants failed to establish either that they were seized or that they were subjected to an unreasonable search.
a person is seized under the fourth amendment only when his freedom of movement is restrained either by means of physical force or a show of authority.united states mendenhall,explaining that o nly when such restraint is imposed is there any foundation whatever for invoking constitutional safeguards.police officers,no less than civilians,are protected by the fourth amendment,and,in some circumstances,they may be seized as the result of an order given by another officer.see driebel city of milwaukee,cir recognizing the rule that men and women do not surrender their freedoms when joining the police force see also cerrone brown,cir explaining that when police officers are seized in the context of a criminal investigation,probable cause is required.
this does not mean,however,that every order a police officer feels compelled to obey amounts to a seizure.public employees,like their counterparts in the private sector,often must comply with orders issued by supervisors,and may suffer consequences if they disobey.see ins delgado,ordinarily,when people are at work their freedom to move about has been meaningfully restricted by the workers voluntary obligations to their employers.this is especially true for police officers,who are part of a paramilitary organization that must maintain the highest degree of discipline,confidentiality,efficiency,and espirit sic de corps among its officers,who are the first line of defense against lawlessness.driebel,at.officers are trained to obey orders from their superiors and may be subject to discipline if they fail to do so.id.at.characterizing demands as seizures whenever an officer feels compelled to obey them would not further any interest protected by the fourth amendment,and it would significantly interfere with the effective management of police forces.see mendenhall,at explaining that the purpose of the fourth amendment is to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals quoting united states martinez fuerte,ortega,acknowledging the realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter quoting connick myers.
to determine whether a police officer has been seized for purposes of the fourth amendment,our sister courts of appeals have recognized that the distinction between situations in which the police department issues orders in its capacity as an employer and those in which it acts as the law enforcement arm of the state.pennington metro.gov t of nashville davidson,cir quoting driebel,at see also aguilera baca,cir.an officer is not seized simply because he believes that he would lose his job or suffer other consequences if he were to leave the police station or fail to report to a designated area.pennington,at.rather,an officer is seized if a reasonable person in his position would believe that he were not actually free to disobey the command that is,if he feared he would be detained if he attempted to leave.id.we agree with the courts of appeals for the sixth,seventh,and ninth circuits that the distinction between police conduct qua employer and police conduct qua law enforcement agent is a valid one.
for example,in driebel city of milwaukee,an officer who was subject to an internal investigation was ordered to stand by at the police station until he received further instructions.f d at.while waiting at the garage,he was neither told that he was the subject of a criminal investigation nor was he read his miranda rights.id.at.he received overtime pay for the assignment and retained possession of his equipment while waiting.id.the seventh circuit held that this was not a seizure,explaining that the officer must have been aware that no officer was permitted to use force or any show of authority to prevent him from departing the garage if he so chose.id.
driebel also addressed the claims of another officer under investigation,who was ordered to report to internal affairs headquarters for questioning.while there,he was advised that he was under criminal investigation and read his miranda rights,and he was not permitted to use the restroom unaccompanied.id.at.police policy required,however,that officers be told their rights any time they were questioned,even as part of an internal investigation.id.the internal affairs officers also had a legitimate reason for supervising his trips to the restroom,namely,to ensure that he was not communicating with others about the investigation.id.in addition,the officer was not told that he was suspected of any particular crime he was not addressed in a threatening manner he retained his equipment and he was compensated for his time at the headquarters.id.although noting that this second incident was a more borderline case,the seventh circuit also determined that this was not a seizure.id.at.
the sixth circuit applied the same analysis in pennington metropolitan government of nashville and davidson county.there,while in a bar,police officer pennington was involved in an altercation in which he identified himself as a police officer.at.officers in his department were required to comply with department policy whenever they invoked their authority as police officers,and that policy forbade intoxication.id.at.another officer who arrived at the scene asked pennington to return to the station for a breathalyzer test as part of an internal investigation.pennington was neither handcuffed and placed in the back seat of the police car nor read his miranda rights,and he was allowed to return home before completing a report.id.he did not believe that he would be forcibly detained if he attempted to leave rather he claimed he was compelled by the threat of job loss to comply.id.at.the sixth circuit explained that a reasonable officer in pennington position would not have feared seizure or detention if he had refused to take the breathalyzer test.id.accordingly,pennington had not been seized.id.
likewise,in aguilera baca,the ninth circuit held that officers who were ordered to stay after work to speak to internal affairs officers had not been seized.at.the court emphasized that the department treatment of the officers differed from its treatment of detained criminal suspects.id.at.for example,the officers waited in unlocked rooms with intermittent supervision and no request to leave was denied.the officers also remained in possession of their equipment.in addition,they were asked if they wanted food or drink they were free to use the restroom unattended and free to leave after the interview and they were paid overtime.id.the ninth circuit explained that to characterize their treatment as a seizure would equate to a pronouncement that a law enforcement agency can not,even under the agency general policies to preserve public confidence and the integrity of its personnel in the discharge of their public safety responsibilities,order its employees to cooperate in an investigation of possible officer misconduct by standing by at their duty station after the end of their watch.id.at see also fournier reardon,cir plaintiff was not seized when he submitted to being handcuffed as part of a basic training academy course,even though objecting to such treatment may have had negative consequences for his continued employment.
the facts in driebel,pennington,and aguilera stand in contrast to those presented to the court of appeals for the second circuit in cerrone brown.there,the officer was stopped by the investigative team,who asked whether he was carrying a weapon,allegedly placed him in the felony position,placed him in the back of an unmarked police car where he was guarded,transported him to a hotel room,read him his miranda rights,and informed him that he was the target of a criminal investigation.cerrone,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the police officers conceded that their actions amounted to a seizure,so the court did not reach the issue.nevertheless,these are the kinds of circumstances that would make an officer feel he was not free to leave not by virtue of being an employee of the police department,but as a citizen who was being detained.see driebel,at explaining that a jury could find that a seizure occurred when an officer grabbed another officer,turned him around,and directed him toward the squad car.
we recognize that whether a police officer would reasonably have perceived his superior officer to be issuing orders as his supervisor or as a law enforcemen
