gaspar vincent garcia and greg williams are officers in the new london police department who participated in a traffic stop that ended in the death of passenger darrel holeman.they are sued under by the representatives of holeman estate for alleged violations of holeman fourth amendment rights,and take this appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut squatrito,denying in part their motion for summary judgment on the defense of qualified immunity.see holeman city of new london,d.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to to the extent that the district court denied qualified immunity as a matter of law.mitchell forsyth,d.
the narrative of events unfolded in four stages that are useful for organizing the questions presented on appellate jurisdiction and the merits officer williams initial investigative stop of the car officer garcia attempted of holeman officer garcia use of deadly force and officers williams and garcia use of force.as to the traffic stop,the district court ruled that a factfinder could find that officer williams lacked probable cause or a reasonable suspicion to justify the stop,and that his belief that he had such a justification was unreasonable.the district court similarly ruled that genuine disputes of material facts prevent a resolution by summary judgment as to the remaining three stages.
we reverse in part,and hold that enjoy qualified immunity as to their conduct during the traffic stop and the attempted.however,as to the use of deadly force and the use of force,we lack appellate jurisdiction to review the ruling that summary judgment is barred by genuine disputes over concededly material facts,and therefore dismiss that part of this appeal.see escalera lunn,cir.
except as indicated,the facts recited are uncontested.
on august,officer williams was investigating a prowler call in new london and followed a car with tinted windows that took a circuitous route through a troubled neighborhood.he decided to stop the car on suspicion of criminal activity and on the chance that the driver was lost.
as officer williams spoke with the driver,he was joined by officer garcia who was also investigating the prowler call.when officer garcia checked out the names of the driver and passenger,he learned that passenger darrel holeman was on parole for a narcotics felony.the driver gave officer williams consent to search the car contest,however,whether the driver acquiesced in a full search of the interior.williams asked holeman to step out so that the search could be done.holeman had to be asked repeatedly to get out.
when holeman emerged,officer garcia attempted a search.officers garcia and williams testified that holeman was uncooperative and aggressive the driver of the car corroborates that account contest it.it is uncontested,however,that holeman said,i show you what i got in my pocket and moved his hands towards his pocket,and that officer garcia asked officer williams to assist in restraining holeman.
a struggle ensued,during to officer drew a small silver handgun and pointed it at officer williams head.officer garcia felled holeman with three shots.officers garcia and williams testified that they could not see holeman hands to tell whether he was still armed,and that holeman did not respond to their commands that he show his hands.officer williams hit holeman several times in the head and commanded his police dog to engage holeman,which nero did.officers williams and garcia testified that holeman then showed his empty hands,and was handcuffed.
an ambulance arrived minutes later.while tending to holeman,the paramedics found a small silver handgun near him.contend that the handgun was planted by the police.the paramedics testified that holeman was uncooperative and combative and that,handcuffed as he was,he had to be strapped to a board to restrain him from injuring himself or others.do not dispute that holeman was combative when the paramedics arrived at the scene.darrel holeman died at the hospital shortly after.
we review de novo the district court denial of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.savino city of new york,cir.our review at this juncture is limited,however,to circumstances where the qualified immunity defense may be established as a matter of law.cartier lussier,cir.for factual matters,we review whether a given factual dispute is material for summary judgment purposes,but we may not review whether a dispute of fact identified by the district court is genuine.escalera,at internal citation omitted.so even when a district court appears to have erred in finding that there is sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact,we may only review the district court ruling that the issue is material to the outcome.at this stage in the proceedings,we can not review a determination that a material issue of fact is genuinely in dispute.
qualified immunity shields police officers acting in their official capacity from suits for damages under,unless their actions violate rights of which an objectively reasonable official would have known.thomas roach,cir.qualified immunity is thus a shield from suit,not simply liability.saucier katz,d quoting mitchell forsyth,d.
as the supreme court explained in saucier katz,the inquiry into whether a suit against officers should go forward is a process the court must determine whether the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting an injury,show a violation of a constitutional right and the court must determine whether the constitutional right was clearly established such that t he contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.at.quoting anderson creighton,d see also cowan breen,cir stephenson doe,cir.thus defendants are entitled to summary judgment unless,in response to defendants motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs have submitted evidence sufficient to establish that objectively reasonable persons in the defendants position would have known that their conduct violated plaintiffs rights.savino,at see also saucier,at.explaining that qualified immunity protects officers from the fourth amendment sometimes hazy borders mandell county of suffolk,cir.
a.the traffic stop 
the temporary detention of an individual during a traffic stop is subject to limitation under the fourth amendment as a seizure of the person.whren united states,d.the fourth amendment requires that an officer making such a stop have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that the person stopped has committed a traffic violation or is otherwise engaged in or about to be engaged in criminal activity.id.at.united states arvizu,d.whether probable cause or reasonable suspicion exists is an objective inquiry the actual motivations of the individual officers involved in the stop play no role in the analysis.whren,at.
in deciding that the traffic stop was unconstitutional under the fourth amendment and that it was objectively unreasonable,the district court considered five circumstances cited by the police the car hesitated and stopped at a stop sign after turning at the stop sign,the car followed a route it had already traveled when officer williams first spotted it the car was in new london,but was registered in groton it was approximately am and the car was in a high crime neighborhood.holeman,d at.the circular driving in the dead of night in a area is suggestive,and the totality of circumstances for this purpose may be greater than their sum but if these five circumstances were all,we might agree that they do not amount to a reasonable suspicion stopping at a stop sign is not sinister groton and new london are nearby and in the dead of night in a high crime neighborhood,it would be more suspicious to be on foot than in a car.
there were,however,at least three other uncontested facts that the district court did not consider at the time officer williams observed the car,he was investigating a prowler call in the area the car was the only vehicle he saw on the road and the car had tinted windows,which obstructed officer williams view into the
