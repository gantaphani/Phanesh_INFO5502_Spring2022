opinion of the court 
joseph tomasso appeals the district court grant of summary judgment against him in an age discrimination suit against the boeing company,which laid him off during a reduction in force rif.tomasso asserted claims under the age discrimination in employment act adea,the pennsylvania human relations act phra,and the employee retirement income security act erisa.the adea and phra claims are governed by mcdonnell douglas green,d although boeing conceded that tomasso made out a prima facie case of age discrimination,the district court found that tomasso failed,in the pretext phase,to produce sufficient evidence to discredit boeing rationales for his layoff.
before this court,as before the district court,boeing offered several reasons for tomasso layoff.some of these rationales,if believed,could fully explain the decision other explanations appear partial and secondary.we conclude that tomasso adduced evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether boeing proffered reasons are pretextual.first,under our decision in fuentes perskie,cir,tomasso has shown sufficient implausibilities and inconsistencies in boeing primary rationales to avoid summary judgment.second,a rational factfinder could dismiss the secondary reasons as pretextual,not because they played no role in tomasso layoff but because they can not explain the layoff sufficiently.we will therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment against tomasso on his adea and phra claims 
tomasso began working for boeing in,when he was.in,he entered the supplier quality department,which oversees the quality of aircraft component parts to be delivered to boeing by its subcontractors.eventually tomasso was promoted to procurement quality specialist,placing him at the second highest of four procurement quality specialist positions.procurement quality specialists would visit the sites where component parts were manufactured,verify the quality of the parts to be delivered,and monitor the subcontractors operations.
in october of,after having worked at boeing for nearly years,tomasso received a notice of possible layoff.afterwards,although he had been a salaried employee,he was offered only an hourly position in a different department.tomasso refused to accept this major demotion,viewing it as a slap in the face.he thought that accepting the new position would be tantamount to going back years and starting all over again.tomasso was thus laid off in january of at age,following years in the supplier quality department,and a total of years of service to boeing.he was able to retire and collect a pension.
tomasso layoff resulted from boeing decision in to reduce operating costs and overhead by twenty percent at the site where tomasso worked.as part of the plan,boeing undertook a rif in the supplier quality department.shortly before the rif,boeing had done away with a retention totem rating system that had been used to identify which employees would be laid off in the event of a rif.under the retention totem rating system,any employee,such as tomasso,who had worked at boeing for years or more was in the group least likely to be laid off.the retention totem rating system had been in place for at least years prior to,the year the rif began.
rather than using the retention totem rating system,boeing decided which employees to lay off by having managers rate them on evaluation forms.the evaluation form for the supplier quality department required that employees be assigned a score on a scale from one to five in nine categories organizational skills,problem solving,quality of work,quantity of work,technical competence,leadership,attitude,communications,and teamwork.a score of one meant n eeds i mprovement,three meant a cceptable,and five meant s trong.the employees received an overall score equal to the sum of the scores in each of the nine categories.
prior to the evaluation,employees were placed into groups with other employees performing the same or similar work.the employees in tomasso group were supervised by several different managers,and the managers rated their own employees.tomasso was evaluated by his manager,joseph wood.
tomasso received a score of,ranking last out of employees in the supplier quality department.he received the following scores in the individual categories 
despite tomasso low overall score,wood did not consider tomasso a bad employee.in fact,wood considered all of the employees who were evaluated to be good performing employee s.
the employees in a group were ranked against each other based on their overall scores.employees were then selected for layoff,beginning with the member in a group and moving up the list until the desired number of employees had been identified.
in the supplier quality department,the seven employees with the lowest scores were selected for layoff.all of these employees were over the age of.the oldest employee in the supplier quality department age was rated second to last.all employees under the age of forty were retained,and no employee under the age of forty was rated lower than fourteenth.however,only five of employees in the supplier quality department are under,and five of the retained employees were tomasso age or older at the time of the evaluation ages,and.
tomasso brought suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,alleging that boeing laid him off due to his age.in an amended complaint,tomasso claimed violations of the adea,phra,and erisa.boeing moved for summary judgment on all counts.because the mcdonnell douglas framework governs both the adea claim and the phra claim,and because boeing conceded that tomasso had made out a prima facie case of age discrimination,the district court discussion focused on the pretext phase.the district court found that tomasso failed to demonstrate that boeing proffered rationales for his layoff were pretextual,and granted summary judgment against tomasso on all of his claims.tomasso filed a timely notice of appeal 
ii.analysis 
fuentes perskie,cir,guides us as to the burdens that an employee and an employer bear when the employer moves for summary judgment on a mcdonnell douglas claim.because tomasso,as boeing concedes,has made out a prima facie case,the burden of production shifts to boeing,which must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale for his layoff.id.at this burden is relatively light,and the employer need only introduc e evidence which,taken as true,would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the unfavorable employment decision.id.
once boeing articulates a nondiscriminatory reason,tomasso must respond by citing evidence that the rationale is pretextual.id.as we have noted,low evaluation scores may be a pretext for discrimination,especially where,as here,an employer uses subjective criteria such as attitude and teamwork to rate its employees.see goosby johnson johnson,cir subjective evaluations are more susceptible of abuse and more likely to mask pretext.quoting weldon kraft,cir see also liu amway,cir where termination decisions rely on subjective evaluations,careful analysis of possible impermissible motivations is warranted.
in order to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered reasons are pretextual,tomasso must point to some evidence,direct or circumstantial,from which a factfinder could reasonably either disbelieve the employer articulated legitimate reasons or believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer action.fuentes,at.tomasso must do more than show that boeing was wrong or mistaken in deciding to lay him off.id.at.he must present evidence contradicting the core facts put forward by the employer as the legitimate reason for its decision.kautz,cir emphasis added.in other words,tomasso must demonstrate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence,and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.fuentes,at alteration in original footnote omitted citing ezold wolf,block,schorr,cir josey john hollingsworth,cir chauhan alfieri,cir.
we agree with the dissent that a decision to lay off an employee in a rif differs from a decision to fire an employee during ordinary circumstances.in either situation,however,we apply the mcdonnell douglas framework.in ordinary times,employees are fired for poor performance in a rif,even qualified employees are laid off in order to reduce personnel.in fact,wood testified that the individuals selected for layoff were not bad employees.but even in a genuine rif one that is motivated on a programmatic level by economic concerns,individuals may not be selected for layoff on the basis of age.for this reason,even in a rif,we use the mcdonnell douglas framework to expose such discrimination.the employer must have reasons for deciding to lay off certain employees,and the employee can challenge these reasons as pretextual.see,showalter of pittsburgh med,cir considering whether the employer rationales for terminating an employee during a rif were pretextual.
as we stated in fuentes,the employee need not always offer evidence sufficient to discredit all of the rationales advanced by the employer.if the defendant proffers a bagful of legitimate reasons,and the plaintiff manages to cast substantial doubt on a fair number of them,the plaintiff may not need to discredit the remainder.at see also kautz,at abramson william paterson coll.of new jersey,cir.in fuentes,we explained that the rejection of some explanations may so undermine the employer credibility as to enable a rational factfinder to disbelieve the remaining rationales,even where the employee fails to produce evidence particular to those rationales.at.
boeing offers several explanations for tomasso low score and the consequent decision to lay him off.we will consider these rationales in turn,applying the standard described above.
lack of interest in process validation assessments 
boeing foremost explanation of tomasso layoff is that he seemed uninterested in process validation assessments pvas,a type of inspection that boeing used to monitor its subcontractors.under the traditional system of standard source inspections,a boeing employee would simply inspect the products ready for delivery to boeing.in contrast,a pva does not involve actual product inspections but instead predicts a supplier ability to produce satisfactory products based on a review of the supplier production capacity.the supplier quality department was increasing its use of pvas,and wood characterized this shift as the primary focus and goal of our organization.
wood testified in his deposition that he gave tomasso low scores in at least four categories because he thought that tomasso lacked interest in performing pvas.according to wood,tomasso said that he was really an advocate to the pva process and was not comfortable working with it.in his affidavit,however,tomasso denies making such a statement at no time did i express to wood that i was not interested in pva,and i never told him that i would not participate in pva or the transfer to the pva method,or that i was not willing to accept new changes.
wood further stated that tomasso failed to attend a pva planning session.tomasso,however,claims that he did not attend the session because it was not mandatory,and because he was having health problems that would have made it difficult to travel to the session,which was held in new orleans.
wood also testified that tomasso did not initially list developing pva skills as a goal in a performance development partnership plan additionally,wood stated that procurement quality specialists were expected to identify,out of the suppliers with which they worked,those that were ready for the transition from standard source inspections to pvas,even if management had not already designated the suppliers as candidates for pvas.according to wood,tomasso did not engage in transition pva activities for suppliers that management had not already designated.
tomasso affidavit paints a very different picture.tomasso states that he was one of only three employees selected to participate in pva activities for a large supplier located in middle river,maryland.tomasso worked on this pva in,the year in which boeing laid him off.wood characterizes the middle river project as a pva training,and claims that tomasso did not participate as avidly as other employees.however,wood conceded that the middle river team did a good job and that as far as he knew,tomasso was an integral part of the team.
tomasso also claims that during reviews in august and december,wood did not state that tomasso performance,including his work on pvas,was deficient in any respect.in fact,wood wrote on tomasso evaluation for january through december and objectives achieved to acceptable levels for this year.initial pva process started with supply base.wood also marked on the evaluation that tomasso had met expectations relating to planning pva audits on his selected suppliers.
finally,tomasso states that he began to transition his primary supplier to pvas,and completed the transition in december of after he was selected for layoff.this supplier accounted for a full percent of tomasso workload.
in short,tomasso and wood tell radically different stories about tomasso interest in pvas.a factfinder who credited tomasso testimony could conclude that wood gave him acceptable evaluations for his pva work and never told him that he needed to improve or increase his pva work,that tomasso began to transition his primary supplier to pvas,and that he was selected to participate in an important pva project soon before he was laid off.the factfinder could further conclude that tomasso never expressed disinterest in pvas,and that he missed a pva transition meeting solely for health reasons.
since tomasso evidence relates directly to his interest in and aptitude for pvas,it involves core facts relevant to boeing explanation for tomasso dismissal.see kautz,at.tomasso evidence,if believed,does not merely suggest that the low score assigned by wood was wrong or mistaken,fuentes,at,or that wood innocently misperceived tomasso interest in pvas.rather,one who believed tomasso affidavit could find such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in boeing explanation as to deem it unworthy of credence.id.at citation omitted.to be sure,tomasso discredits boeing rationale in part by pointing to external evidence,such as earlier evaluations and his participation in the middle river project.but such evidence can be used to show pretext.see sheridan dupont de nemours and,cir en banc stating that an employee could show pretext in part by adducing affirmative evidence of her own accomplishments,including awards,a promotion,and a salary increase.in sum,tomasso alleged lack of interest in pvas does not provide a sufficient basis for summary judgment.
refusal to share technical knowledge 
wood also stated that tomasso received a low score on his evaluation because he was unwilling to share his technical knowledge with other boeing employees.wood testified i can almost quote tomasso i want to be left alone to do and handle my part of the supply base.i not interested in training people or providing working relationships with some of my other peers in those areas.tomasso,however,denies that such an exchange occurred i never told wood that i wanted to be alone or left alone,and i never told wood that i was not interested in training people or being involved in working relationships with my peers.
tomasso affidavit flatly contradicts wood deposition on this point.tomasso denies having made the very statement that apparently convinced wood that he was unwilling to share his technical knowledge.thus,our decision in fuentes precludes summary judgment on this basis.
boeing remaining rationales 
boeing offers additional rationales,but they do not appear sufficient to explain tomasso layoff.even if a rational factfinder would have to conclude that these rationales played some role in tomasso layoff,the factfinder would not have to conclude
