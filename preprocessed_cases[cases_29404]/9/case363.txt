background 
a.the factual milieu 
because we had the opportunity to develop the factual context of this case in some depth when considering an appeal from the district court prior entry of summary judgment for the defendants,see burke town of walpole burke i,cir vacating the district court grant of summary judgment as to burke fourth amendment claim against tpr.mcdonald,and affirming in all other respects,we will limit our factual exposition to a summary of the necessary details.except where indicated,these facts are not in serious dispute for purposes of these appeals.
on december,irene kennedy,a woman,was the victim of a particularly grisly murder involving a severe beating,strangulation,and multiple stab wounds.the victim breasts,which were exposed when her body was found in a wooded walpole,massachusetts park,each bore a human bite mark.the ensuing investigation into the crime included the collection of dna samples in the form of saliva from the bite marks on the victim body,and of saliva and other forensic samples from burke,a suspect in the crime.because massachusetts did not at that time operate a facility capable of expedited dna analysis of samples,the samples were sent to the maine crime laboratory for immediate analysis by theresa calicchio,a forensic dna chemist.
calicchio testified at the trial in this case that,on the morning of december,she called tpr.mcdonald and told him that the dna analysis had excluded burke as the source of dna collected from the victim body tpr.mcdonald,however,failed to convey this information to his colleagues,this despite the fact that he successfully conveyed the findings of other bite mark analyses that implicated burke in the crime.as a result,a warrant application was filed that afternoon which omitted any mention of the dna results,and an arrest warrant issued shortly thereafter.
burke was arrested at his home that afternoon and detained overnight,prior to being arraigned in state court the next day.shortly after the arraignment began,tpr.kevin shea,tpr.mcdonald colleague and into the murder of kennedy,entered the courtroom and interrupted assistant district attorney ada gerald pudolsky.the facts surrounding this event are disputed.in essence,it is mcdonald and shea contention that mcdonald called shea and told him about the dna exclusion of burke,thereby leading tpr.shea to interrupt ada pudolsky.at trial,however,burke marshaled evidence,discussed in detail below,suggesting that the results of the dna test were never communicated from tpr.mcdonald to those responsible for prosecuting the arraignment hearing,or to the presiding magistrate.
in any event,it is undisputed that after tpr.shea interrupted the arraignment and spoke to ada pudolsky,ada pudolsky was left with the impression that some evidence had come to light.he requested a recess,called his supervisors,and was told he does not remember by whom that more testing of the dna was required before any definitive result could be obtained.ada pudolsky then sought and secured burke detention without bail.burke spent the next days in custody until,after palm prints provided by burke pursuant to court order revealed that burke was not the source of a palm print on the victim body,the district attorney filed a nolle prosequi in the case on the ground that burke prosecution was premature.
b.the instant litigation 
burke subsequently filed a civil rights action in state court against the town of walpole,the dentist who provided the bite mark analysis,and various officers and supervisors of the walpole police department in their individual and official capacities.in addition to a claim,he claimed defamation based on having been publicly identified as kennedy murderer.shortly thereafter,burke filed a similar lawsuit in federal court against various massachusetts state police troopers,employees of the massachusetts chief medical examiner office,and the commonwealth of massachusetts.after the state case was removed to federal court,burke amended his complaint to combine the two cases,and then amended his complaint two more times to add claims of negligence against the commonwealth and to join a second dentist as a defendant.his attempt to amend the complaint a fourth time was denied.
in time,the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims,and burke appealed.as noted above,we affirmed the district court in every respect except for one we vacated the grant of summary judgment to tpr.mcdonald on burke claim alleging a fourth amendment violation,concluding that the record contains evidence,sufficient to create a jury question,that he intentionally or recklessly withheld exculpatory dna evidence from the magistrate who issued the warrant to arrest burke,and a reasonable officer would know that such conduct violated a clearly established fourth amendment right.burke i,at.
before,during,and after the ensuing trial,tpr.mcdonald maintained in the district court his position that he should not be found liable for damages incurred after the arraignment.in support of this position,tpr.mcdonald cited evidence,which he characterized as uncontroverted,suggesting that he had made a full disclosure of the exculpatory dna evidence to the prosecution before ada pudolsky requested burke continued detention without bail.in mcdonald view,the district attorney,who after tpr.mcdonald disclosure had all available information about the evidence inculpating and exculpating burke,made a and independent decision to ask for continued detention,and a magistrate agreed.tpr.mcdonald argued to the district court,and maintains on appeal,that the arraignment therefore cut off the damages for which he can be liable,either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact.
the district court disagreed,and instead submitted the question to the jury as a matter of proximate cause and consequential damages.the court instructed the jury that the plaintiff must establish the defendant acts were the proximate cause of injuries to him and consequent damages sustained by him.additionally,after defining and explaining the term proximate cause and emphasizing that an intervening cause cuts off liability the court instructed 
in this case it is the defendant contention that even if he had withheld material information from other investigators on december,he disclosed that the dna testing had excluded burke at the time of the arraignment on december,so that any continued detention of burke after that time could not have been caused by his withholding of information.that is also a factual issue for you to you to resolve,if,of course,you find that trooper mcdonald had withheld information prior to the application for a warrant.
before the jury retired,the district court held a sidebar discussion and invited objections and corrections to its instructions.tpr.mcdonald attorney objected,to no avail,as follows your honor,just for the record,i wanted to state that i believe i entitled to as a matter of law instruction that the probable cause determination by the court on the terminates any exposure my client has to damages.this objection was in addition to an instruction that tpr.mcdonald had proposed,also to no avail,which would have instructed 
y ou may award the plaintiff only such damages as will reasonably compensate him for such injury and damages as you find,from a preponderance of the evidence in the case,that he sustained from the time of his arrest until when the dna results were disclosed.you are not permitted to award any damages you find the plaintiff may have suffered following when the dna results were disclosed by the defendant.
the jury found in favor of burke using a general verdict form,and a flurry of motions followed.among them was burke request for attorneys fees,originally in the amount of,but voluntarily reduced to after a filing from tpr.mcdonald challenged the amount.the district court further reduced the fee award to,declaring the plaintiff success decidedly partial.in arriving at this amount,the district court depended heavily on the fact that the plaintiff obtained a jury verdict against only one of defendants on only one of sixteen causes of action.
as for the amount of the reduction,the district court described the time and billing records as providing little,if any basis for determining what work reflected in them was done to develop what claims,and therefore made a proportional estimate that,prior to burke i,it is fair to estimate that of the work was of direct or indirect benefit to the plaintiff ability to prevail on his successful claim against mcdonald.the district court recognized only of the claimed i hours,added them to the hours spent on the case after burke i of which were recognized,and proceeded to calculate the final award using the lodestar method.both parties appealed.
ii.tpr.mcdonald appeal 
the gravamen of tpr.mcdonald appeal is simply put he believes that his liability is limited to the damages burke incurred between the arrest and the arraignment.he advances this position with three related arguments.first,he argues that the district court should have cut off the damages as a matter of law with a legal ruling before trial,an instruction to the jury not to consider damages incurred after the arraignment,a judgment as a matter of law,or a remittitur second,tpr.mcdonald argues that even if the district court was theoretically correct in framing mcdonald potential liability for damages as a question of proximate cause,in this case the prosecutors informed and independent decision to proceed with the arraignment should have cut off his damages as a matter of law.third,tpr.mcdonald argues that the evidence of his liability for damages was insufficient on any theory to support the jury verdict.

discussion 
for his argument that the district court should have limited his liability for damages to the period preceding the arraignment,tpr.mcdonald relies primarily on the supreme court statement in heck humphrey that if there is a false arrest claim,damages for that claim cover the time of detention up until issuance of process or arraignment,but no more,d quoting page keeton et,prosser and keeton on law of torts.the appellant correctly acknowledges,however,that an exception to that rule exists where facts are withheld from the prosecutor or judge such that the affected official s can not be understood to have exercised an informed,independent judgment.see wagenmann,cir observing,in action against police officer for violating,inter alia,right to be free from excessive bail,if a person wrongfully brings about an end by manipulating another,in this case the court clerk responsible for setting the bail,the naked fact that he lacked authority to accomplish the end by himself does not provide an impenetrable shield against damages see also,harper city of los angeles,cir citing smiddy varney,cir prosecutor decision to proceed does not cut off investigating officers liability where plaintiff can show that the prosecutor was pressured or caused by the investigating officers to act contrary to his independent judgment townes city of new york,cir jones city of chicago,cir.thus,bearing in mind the applicable standard of review,tpr.mcdonald appeal of the district court refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law must fail if,when viewing the facts and drawing inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could have found that tpr.mcdonald withheld the exclusionary dna test results from the prosecutors and the magistrate in a manner that prevented those officials from making informed and independent decisions 
on the record before us,no stretch of imagination is required to fathom how a rational jury could have so found.for instance,the jury could have credited the testimony of walpole police officer james dolan,called by burke as a hostile witness,that the information presented to the magistrate at the arraignment did not include the exculpatory dna test results that,according to calicchio,had already been tendered to tpr.mcdonald.the jury could also have disbelieved tpr.mcdonald testimony that he fully informed the prosecutors involved in the bail decision about the dna test results.tpr.mcdonald claimed to have unburdened himself to first assistant district attorney john kivlan directly on the day of the arraignment,but ada kivlan was never called to testify,nor was any other evidence offered to support mcdonald assertion.
the jury might well have determined that tpr.mcdonald testimony was nakedly and not credible.tpr.mcdonald also claimed to have informed ada pudolsky of burke exclusion by way of tpr.shea,who testified that he told ada pudolsky that burke was excluded when he interrupted the arraignment.but the rest of the evidence does not fully corroborate that account.among the infirmities in tpr.mcdonald version of events is the fact that,while both tprs.mcdonald and shea testified that tpr.mcdonald told tpr.shea that burke is excluded based on the dna test results,and while tpr.shea testified that he passed this message on to ada pudolsky,ada pudolsky testified that tpr.shea only told him to go downstairs and call his supervisors,leaving ada pudolsky with the impression that there was some evidence that had come to light.ada pudolsky did not testify that tpr.shea told him that burke was excluded,nor did he testify that tpr.shea so much as mentioned dna or test results to him.the gap between these two versions of this chain of.mcdonald and shea version on the one hand,and ada pudolsky on the wide enough to accommodate the inference that tpr.mcdonald did not,in fact,unburden himself to the prosecution by way of tpr.shea.
other evidence before the jury bolstered this inference,such as the fact that ada pudolsky,after phoning his supervisors,argued to the magistrate that the dna test results were ambiguous as to burke culpability,a position he would have been unlikely to adopt had he heard calicchio opinion,which she said she rendered to tpr.mcdonald the previous day,that the dna test results unquestionably excluded burke.the jury also heard that tprs.shea and mcdonald were colleagues and that both participated in the investigation and arrest of burke,thus providing at least some basis for the jury to infer that the two troopers might have had untoward incentives or inclinations to corroborate each other testimony.when taken together,these additional facts could reasonably have led the jury to discount tprs.mcdonald and shea testimony about what disclosures tpr.mcdonald made to whom,and when 
none of the evidence just described leads inexorably to the conclusion that tpr.mcdonald failed to disclose the dna test results to the prosecution,but we need no such certainty to reject mcdonald argument that his liability for damages must end,as a matter of law,when the prosecutors weighed in at the bail hearing.all that is required is a finding that,when these facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could have found that tpr.mcdonald failed to disclose what he knew,and that this failure prevented the magistrate and prosecutors from making informed,independent judgments.the evidence discussed above supports that finding 
none of tpr.mcdonald other arguments in support of his appeal fare better.we find no cognizable error in the district court jury instructions,which framed the question of damages as a matter of proximate cause.this approach to the issue is consistent with supreme court precedent emphasizing that liability under flows against the defendant for all damages that are the natural consequences of his actions.malley briggs,d quoting monroe pape,d internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,in wagenmann we upheld a jury verdict against a police officer who manipulated the independent and informed decisions of judicial officers after the jury instructions had put the question of damages in terms of causation.at.in so doing,we noted that t he law looks to causation in fact when assessing damages,id.at,and that the evidence supported the finding that the defendant officer proximately caused bail to be set,id.at emphasis added.we also emphasized that should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions,id.quoting monroe,at,and endorsed the use of traditional tort principles for making intervening cause determinations in the milieu,id.citing springer seaman,cir.
the district court instructions were correct as a matter of substantive law.they properly and clearly explained the concept of proximate causation,and plainly and concretely committed the question of whether tpr.mcdonald disclosed the dna test results to the prosecution at the time of the arraignment to the judgment of the jury.the instructions also substantially incorporated tpr.mcdonald position that,so long as he timely disclosed the dna test results to the prosecution,he should not bear liability for damages after the arraignment.the instructions therefore were not erroneous.
for similar reasons,we are unpersuaded by tpr.mcdonald argument that the district court decision to allow evidence on the conditions of burke confinement so confused the jury as to taint the damages award.the jury was instructed not to consider this evidence if it found that tpr.mcdonald disclosed the dna test results to the prosecutors at the time of the arraignment,and we presume that the jury understood and followed those instructions.see.eye ear infirmary,at citing united states griffin,cir see also id.at where,as here,the jury heard a legally adequate instruction,which was supported by competent evidence,we will not assume jury confusion or verdict taint.
moreover,while we think it most plausible to infer that,as explained above,the jury disbelieved tprs.mcdonald and shea assertions that tpr.mcdonald informed the prosecutors about the dna test results,we also recognize an alternative possible basis for the jury award that the jury awarded damages to cover only the natural consequences of the false arrest which,as burke argues in his brief on appeal,did not come to a screeching halt in the twenty four hours between the arrest and the arraignment.
in light of our precedent,discussed below,the evidence at trial may be viewed as providing an adequate basis for the jury to award significant damages against tpr.mcdonald for his role in burke arrest.given the heinousness and visibility of the crime at issue,burke arrest attracted a significant amount of public attention.burke testified at trial to having seen the scene develop outside his house on the day of his arrest.he described looking out the window in the morning and seeing police everywhere,including what he believed to be unmarked observation vans in the parking lot.he also described hearing a helicopter circling the house.by lunchtime,burke said that he saw people other than police gathering on the sidewalk and across the street,perhaps as many as one hundred or more,some with cameras.thereafter,the police,including tprs.shea and mcdonald and officer dolan,entered burke house by breaking in through the back door,arrested him,and led him handcuffed into the street wearing a torn,crummy that was on inside out.
at trial,after a videotape of burke walk into the street was published to the jury,burke described the reaction of the bystanders as sounding sort of like the of july with floats going by,people clapping,you know,when you in a parade.he described a television reporter who stuck a microphone in his face and asked him if he murdered kennedy.he also testified to his newspaper and television news stories that publicized his arrest for the murder,saying,every video media,every tv station in boston and cable news new england was there.every newspaper was reporting the herald,the transcript,the walpole times,the globe.
burke also described his experience being held that night in a very small cell at the police station that was equipped with little more than a short wooden thing that you could sit on.he testified to hearing another inmate say from an adjacent holding cell at the courthouse the next day that the suspect in kennedy murder at that point,burke is not going to last long in prison,and that the suspect should be executed.he also testified to his humiliation at the prospect of being led into a public arraignment hearing in handcuffs,chains,and ankle bracelets,an event that eventually occurred.
burke qualitative assessments of the impact of these events on his life emphasized the extent of his mental and emotional anguish.he described feeling like his house was a pressure cooker as the police and bystanders gathered outside on the day of his arrest,making him very tense.of his anxiety leading up to the arraignment hearing,he stated,i thought it was the end of my life.it was something that i did think there was any way that i be able to deal with i did think i could get through what i was about to face it was too humiliating.of the publicity surrounding his arrest,burke said simply,it destroyed my life.it destroyed my life,and elaborated by pointing out that the articles had portrayed him not just as a murderer but also an abuser,weirdo,and loner,labels which clearly and understandably upset him.on multiple occasions during his testimony,burke hesitated to describe the full extent of his ordeal,stating that he was being asked to describe events that were uncomfortable for him to think about.
the jury was also presented with evidence that burke emotional and mental anguish had potentially effects.burke testified that he lost friends at the time of the arrest because they did want to be associated with what was about to come down.burke brother also testified that burke reputation in the walpole community prior to the arrest was as a gentle,kind,animal lover,and juxtaposed it with a more recent event he had witnessed in burke new home town in another state,during which a stranger yelled the word murderer at burke from a passing car.burke brother also contrasted burke personality,which he described as including a great sense of humor,with his personality,which he described as tearful,hopeless,despondent,enraged,and observed that,burke focused all his mental activity to try and understand how and why this happened to him i t engulfed his life.if the jury awarded damages to compensate burke for his trauma,there is a basis for concluding that it was entitled to do so the jury was presented with adequate evidence upon which to base the award,it was properly instructed as to the circumstances under which such damages are compensable,and it was entitled to make the award as a matter of law.see,wagenmann,at upholding a jury award based on the stress,fear,humiliation,embarrassment,anguish,and stigmatization that a defendant suffered and continues to suffer after his arrest without probable cause.
in sum,we discern no error of law by the district court when it refused to cut off damages at the moment of arraignment or when it instructed the jury as to tpr.mcdonald liability for damages.we further find that the jury award can fairly be understood to be supported by at least one and probably two rational appraisals of the damages.we therefore have no cause to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motions for a new trial and remittitur,nor reason to upset the verdict ourselves.
burke mounts two challenges to the district court attorneys fees award.first,burke argues that the district court erred in declaring burke victory decidedly partial,given that he ultimately secured a jury verdict in the amount of on his claim.burke acknowledges,of course,that many of his claims were unsuccessful,but he argues those claims were so inseparable from the successful claim that each and every minute spent was necessary to the actual verdict.second,burke characterizes the district judge decision as an adjustment to the lodestar amount based on the results obtained,and argues that the district court erred in so doing by considering burke success without also considering the relief actually achieved and the societal importance of the right which has been vindicated.

discussion 
in light of the limits of our review,we conclude that the district court fee reduction should be affirmed.it is that fees are appropriately excluded from the lodestar when different claims for relief are not interconnected,that is,when the claims rest on different facts and legal theories.bogan city of boston,cir quoting,cir.excluding fees for unsuccessful claims not interconnected with the successful claim is precisely what the district court did in this case in calculating the number of hours to recognize for purposes of its lodestar calculation,it distinguished burke successful claim against tpr.mcdonald from his other,unsuccessful claims,each of which was made against other defendants,premised on significantly different legal theories,or both.for instance,the district court noted that whereas the jury verdict against trooper mcdonald was supported by evidence that he,being the only investigating officer aware of exculpatory dna evidence prior to the plaintiff arrest,knowingly withheld that information from others who were applying for the arrest warrant emphasis added,burke lawsuit included unsuccessful claims that other officers executed his arrest without a validly issued warrant,that other defendants mishandled dna evidence,and that other defendants had withheld or misstated evidence bearing on probable cause such as the bite mark evidence.the district court further noted that burke brought completely distinct claims against forensic odontologists,and a separate defamation claim against the walpole police chief for statements he made to the news media about the arrest.while acknowledging that the multiple and varied claims asserted were all related in a very broad all pertained to the events that culminated in burke arrest,the district court nonetheless concluded that preparation of the successful case against mcdonald did not benefit from legal efforts expended in pursuit of theories based on different facts against different defendants,and it thus decided to exclude the hours burke attorneys spent on unsuccessful claims from the lodestar calculation.
the only wrinkle in this case is the manner in which the district court calculated the number of hours that were so unrelated to the successful claim as to be excludable from the lodestar calculation,to wit,a global reduction of percent to the i hours based on the district court proportionate estimate.to be sure,a more exacting approach to the lodestar method is preferred,but this case did not allow for more precision as the district court noted after providing examples of the ambiguous time entries contained in the time and billing records strategy meeting and telephone conference,those records provided little,if any,basis for determining what work reflected in them was done to develop what claims,and,despite the fact that he bore the burden to prove the reasonableness of the hours he claimed,burke did not provide an affidavit explaining with sufficient detail how the line item even categories of line item related to the meritorious claim.therefore,under the circumstances,we can not conclude that a global reduction based on a proportionate estimate of the time spent on the meritorious claim constituted error.
on the contrary,it was the best approach available to the district court,and it was consistent with burke burden to prove his hours.see hensley eckerhart,d noting that the district court,in reducing amount of fees calculated by the lodestar method,may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,or it may simply reduce the award to account for limited success see also,at permitting district courts,when computing the lodestar amount,to discount or disallow hours when time records are too generic and,thus,insufficient as a practical matter to permit a court t
