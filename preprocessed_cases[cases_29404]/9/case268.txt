background 
allegations of the complaint 
the complaint alleges as follows 
at all relevant times,ríos was an officer in the puerto rico police department.he holds a master degree in education from ana méndez university and has been certified to give drug prevention talks to schools,churches,and offices.the complaint asserts that he is of the negro race and that the color of his skin is black.
from to,ríos was assigned to the division prevención drogas mediante educación a la comunidad hereinafter the drug prevention division for the aguadilla area,which had offices near the aguadilla airport.his duties included giving drug prevention talks and required him to work nights and weekends.his earnings included approximately per month in overtime pay.
agent orlando adames cardona adames was also assigned to the drug prevention division.both ríos and adames were supervised by lieutenant eddie cordero martínez cordero.adames and cordero are white.
in august,cordero and another white lieutenant,elizabeth acevedo rivera acevedo,began exhibiting discriminatory animus against ríos in front of other officers.for example,the complaint alleges that cordero,in front of ríos,made reference to this damn nigger,and that acevedo said of ríos i will take that negro out of here,and i do want him here.acevedo and cordero also allegedly conspired to deprive ríos of the use of his office.
in february,cordero reassigned ríos to the bureau of illegal arms,airport illegal arms section,west region,also in aguadilla.the new position was less desirable in that it required ríos to travel to other airports by himself without backup and did not offer a private office or the same opportunity for overtime pay.no one was assigned to fill ríos former position at the drug prevention division.
in december,adames was transferred at his request,creating a second vacancy at the drug prevention division.cordero recommended a white agent,sixto salinas cabàn salinas,for the position,and he was appointed.the complaint asserts on information and belief that salinas was less qualified than ríos as he had only recently obtained a bachelor degree and was not certified to give drug prevention talks.
ii.the district court decisions 
on may,ríos filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,naming as defendants in both their personal and official capacities cordero acevedo and pedro toledo dávila toledo,who was superintendent of the puerto rico police department.the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.ríos colón toledo dávila,ccc,wl june.
the court ruled that the complaint failed under title vii because that statute applies to employers,not individual supervisors,and the complaint did not name the police department as a defendant.id.at.the court also held that the complaint did not plausibly allege violations of the first,fourth,fifth,and tenth amendments,or the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.without addressing whether the complaint stated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the court dismissed all of the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims under puerto rico law.
upon ríos motion for reconsideration,the court upheld its prior ruling.with respect to the title vii claim,the court acknowledged that the complaint clearly pled a cause of action for race discrimination,but adhered to the dismissal of the claim because the complaint did not name the police department as a defendant.once again,the court did not address whether the complaint stated a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the district court dismissal of the complaint de novo.sanchez pereira castillo,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.
ríos advances two arguments on appeal.first,noting the district court eventual acknowledgment that the complaint asserted a viable claim of violation of title vii,ríos contends the court erred in dismissing it on the ground that he brought the suit against his superior officers,rather than against his employer.second,ríos contends the complaint plausibly alleged a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.we agree with both contentions.
although acknowledging that the complaint clearly pled a cause of action for race discrimination in violation of title vii the district court dismissed the claim because it was asserted against ríos three supervisors,instead of against the police department,his employer.
given that the complaint named as defendants ríos supervisors including the department superintendent in their official capacities,the failure to name the police department itself did not justify dismissal of the title vii claim.we have ruled that a title vii claim brought against a supervisory employee in his official capacity as an agent of the employer operates as a claim against the employer.see vera mchugh,cir noting that,in a title vii suit brought by an employee of the puerto rico army solely against the secretary of the army,t he secretary was sued in his capacity as the plaintiff employer see also sauers salt lake,cir t he proper method for a plaintiff to recover under title vii is by suing the employer,either by naming the supervisory employees as agents of the employer or by naming the employer directly.quoting busby city of orlando,cir.
ii.equal protection 
the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety without addressing whether it plausibly alleged a violation of the equal protection clause.we agree with ríos that the complaint asserted a claim under the equal protection clause,which should not have been dismissed.to prevail on a claim of racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause,a plaintiff must establish that he was selected for adverse treatment compared with others similarly situated,and that the selection for adverse treatment was based on his race.see rubinovitz rogato,cir yerardi moody rest.lounge,bd.of selectmen,cir.
the complaint alleges that ríos was transferred from a position with the drug prevention division to a less desirable position with the bureau of illegal arms.the position to which he was transferred allegedly offered materially less attractive working conditions and fewer opportunities to earn overtime pay.the complaint furthermore plausibly alleges that the disadvantageous transfer was based on racial discrimination.it alleges that cordero,the supervisor who caused ríos to be transferred and who recommended a less qualified white candidate in preference to ríos when a position in the drug prevention division later became available,had used abusive and derogatory slurs expressing explicit racial bias.these allegations were sufficient to plead a cognizable claim under the equal protection clause,as they convey a plausible inference that cordero discriminated against ríos in official acts,depriving him of significant advantages because of his race.see iqbal.at a claim surv
