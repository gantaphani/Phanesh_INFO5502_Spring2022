in this case,north carolina seeks to do just that privilege speech on one side of a hotly debated issue reproductive silencing opposing voices.specifically,though north carolina invites citizens to m ake a statement,and promote themselves their causes with specialty license plates,it limits this invitation to only those citizens who agree with north carolina choose life stance.north carolina contends that it may so discriminate because specialty plate messages constitute pure government speech free from first amendment constraints.with this,we can not agree.
the supreme court and this court have recognized individual speech interests in license plate messages.and in this case,too,the specialty plate speech at issue implicates private speech rights,and thus first amendment protections apply.because issuing a choose life specialty license plate while refusing to issue a specialty plate constitutes blatant viewpoint discrimination squarely at odds with the first amendment,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and a permanent injunction in plaintiffs favor.

to develop a specialty license plate,nc dmv must receive three hundred applications from individuals interested in that plate.id.once the nc dmv issues the plate,any interested vehicle owner registered in north carolina may purchase it.over two hundred specialty plates are available,and north carolina invites vehicle owners to find the plate that fits you and m ake a statement with a specialized or personalized license plate.http.according to north carolina,its specialty plate program allows citizens with common interests to promote themselves their causes.
because north carolina refused to allow a specialized plate to promote their cause,north carolina vehicle owners who wanted a specialty plate,along with the aclu,brought this lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina.they sued the north carolina department of transportation nc dot and the nc dmv collectively called north carolina for first and fourteenth amendment violations.

at the outset,we note that north carolina does not deny that it engaged in viewpoint discrimination by approving the choose life plate while refusing to allow a plate.instead,north carolina contends that it was free to discriminate based on viewpoint because the license plate speech at issue was solely its own.and under the government speech doctrine,when the government speaks for itself,it can say what it wishes.plaintiffs disagree,arguing that the license plate speech at issue implicates private speech and all its attendant first amendment protections,including the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination.determining whether the choose life specialty plate embodies pure government speech or something else is therefore at the heart of this case.

although the supreme court has not yet recognized that speech may be not purely government or private but instead implicate both,this court has.in sons of confederate veterans,ex rel.griffin commissioner of the virginia department of motor vehicles scv i,this court held that virginia barring the sons of confederate veterans from obtaining a specialty license plate with a confederate flag logo constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.cir.while the panel opinion deemed the speech at issue private only,judge luttig,in a separate opinion regarding the denial of rehearing en banc,presciently recognized that speech in fact can be,at once,that of a private individual and the government.sons of confederate veterans,comm r of.dep t of motor vehicles scv ii,cir luttig.he noted that specialty plates were perhaps the quintessential example of speech that is both private and governmental because the forum and the message are essentially inseparable,the consequence being that it is difficult if not impossible to separate sufficiently what is indisputably the speech act by the private speaker from what is equally indisputably the speech act by the government.id.
two years later,in rose,this court embraced the notion of mixed speech.at in rose,a case strikingly similar to this one,south carolina had authorized the issuance of a choose life specialty license plate but no plate bearing a message.id.at.the plaintiffs in rose,as here,alleged that in doing so,the state engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.id.deeming the specialty plate speech at issue mixed speech implicating private speech rights,we agreed.id.we held that the speech at issue there appears to be neither purely government speech nor purely private speech,but a mixture of the two.id.at.we applied a forum analysis,which the supreme court has instructed courts to use when private speech occurs on government property,noted that the government may not in any forum,and held that south carolina allowing a plate but no plate constituted viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.id.at.
to determine whether speech is that of the government,private parties,or both,this court looks to instructive factors laid out in scv i 
the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs 
the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech 
the identity of the literal speaker and 
whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.

north carolina argues that this court abandoned the scv factors with page lexington county school district one,cir.according to north carolina,in page we lopped off several of the scv factors in favor of an exclusive focus on control of the message in question to determine whose message it is.we disagree.
first,we note that a panel of this court can not overrule,explicitly or implicitly,the precedent set by a prior panel of this court.only the supreme court or this court sitting en banc can do that.united states brooks,cir quotation marks omitted.page,which is neither a supreme court nor an en banc decision,thus did not supplant scv i.
second,page does not suggest any attempt to overthrow the scv factors in favor of a control test.instead,in page,a case about a school district speech,we cited to,and considered,several,who disseminates the speech,as well as who establishes and controls the speech.page,at.our flexible approach in page is not surprising,given our express acknowledgment in scv i itself that the four factors identified there are instructive but neither exhaustive nor always uniformly applicable.scv i,at.therefore even page does not support our having embraced a approach to determining who is speaking.
further,in opinions postdating page,we explicitly employed the scv factors to identify the pertinent speaker.see,turner city council of city of fredericksburg,cir noting that the fourth circuit has adopted a test for determining when speech can be attributed to the government,listing the scv factors,and a pplying these factors,to conclude that the legislative prayer at issue is governmental speech.clearly,then,this circuit has not recognized page as having displaced scv 
north carolina nonetheless presses that the supreme court implicitly overruled our scv test with johanns,d,and summum,d.specifically,north carolina contends that those cases instruct us to consider only the level of control the government exercises over the speech,not on who a reasonable observer views as the literal speaker.appellants br.at.again,we disagree with north carolina argument and thus decline its invitation to follow the control test for government speech set forth in johanns and affirmed in summum.id.at.
looking first at johanns,we agree with the ninth circuit that the case is factually distinguishable from specialty license plate cases.johanns involved a subsidy of government speech in johanns,the individual harm was being forced to give the government money to pay for someone else message.life coal.stanton,cir quotation marks omitted.in specialty license plate cases,by contrast,private individuals choose to pay the price for obtaining a particular specialty license plate.the first amendment harm is being denied the opportunity to speak on the same terms as other private citizens within a government sponsored forum.id.quotation marks omitted.
further,the supreme court itself limited its holding to compelled subsidies,expressly declining to address as not on point even compelled speech arguments.johanns,at while doing so,the supreme court recognized the continued validity of wooley maynard,in which the court held that vehicle owners had a first amendment right to cover the live free or die state motto on their new hampshire license plates.johanns,at citing and distinguishing wooley,d.the supreme court also recognized the continued validity of west virginia state board of education barnette,in which the court held a law requiring all schoolchildren to recite the pledge of allegiance and salute the american flag unconstitutional under the first amendment.johanns,at citing and distinguishing barnette.yet if north carolina were correct in its assertion that government control of the message is all that matters,both wooley and barnette would have been wrongly they surely would not have been cited in johanns as good compelled speech law.
indeed,summum underscores that the supreme court did not espouse a myopic control test in johanns.specifically,in summum,the supreme court held that placement of permanent monuments,including those designed and donated by private entities,in a city park constitutes government speech.at.as in johanns,the supreme court considered the control factor,observing that the city effectively controlled the messages sent by the monuments in the p ark by exercising final approval authority over their selection.summum,at quoting johanns,at.
importantly,however,the supreme court also focused on the perceived identity of the speaker.the court noted that monuments installed on property are routinely and reasonably interpret ed as conveying some message on the property owner behalf.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that there is little chance that observers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker as the property owner.id.
additionally,context mattered in summum.the supreme court focused on the fact that public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.id.at.as the court noted,s peakers,no matter how,eventually come to the end of their remarks,while monuments endure.id.at.we can not square the supreme court,reasoning in summum with north carolina blanket contention that all that matters is who controls the message 
the third supreme court case upon which north carolina seeks to irish american gay,lesbian bisexual group of boston has absolutely no bearing on this one,d.north carolina cites to hurley for the proposition that u nder the government speech doctrine,north carolina can claim the fundamental rule of protection under the first amendment,that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.appellants br.at quoting hurley,at.but hurley had nothing to do with the government speech,by its very nature,does not implicate the first amendment.see,summum,at noting that if the government engages in its own expressive conduct,then the free speech clause has no application because it does not regulate government speech.instead,that case centered on private parties free speech rights,holding that requiring private parade organizers to include amongst their marchers a group whose message they opposed violated the organizers first amendment rights.hurley,at.if anything,hurley hurts north carolina cause,not least due to its recognition that government regulation may not interfere with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message or discouraging a disfavored one,however enlightened either purpose may strike the government.id.at.
in sum,for over a decade,this circuit has found the scv factors instructive in determining whether speech is that of the government,private parties,or both.sometimes considering those factors has led us to conclude that speech implicated both government and private expression.see,wv ass of club owners fraternal,musgrave,cir rose,at.in other cases,considering the scv factors led to the conclusion that the speech at issue was purely government see,turner,at or purely private see scv i,at.but regar
