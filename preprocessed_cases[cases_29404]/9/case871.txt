discussion 
in reviewing a motion to dismiss,we accept the allegations in the complaint as true.boykin keycorp,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quotation marks omitted.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.the standards for evaluating hostile work environment and retaliation claims are identical under title vii and the nyshrl.weinstock columbia,cir.
although kelly has not appealed the dismissal of her hostile environment claims,we note first that the dismissal was manifestly correct.our circuit has long since rejected paramour preference claims,which depend on the proposition that the phrase discrimination on the basis of sex encompasses disparate treatment premised not on one gender,but rather on a romantic relationship between an employer and a person preferentially treated.decintio westchester cnty.med,cir see also id.at appellees were not prejudiced because of their status as males rather,they were discriminated against because their supervisor preferred his paramour.i t is axiomatic that in order to establish a hostile work environment under title vii,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct occurred because of her sex.alfano costello,cir quotation marks omitted.
to make out a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must demonstrate that she engaged in protected activity the employer was aware of that activity the employee suffered a materially adverse action and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action.lore city of syracuse,cir.
an employee complaint may qualify as protected activity,satisfying the first element of this test,so long as the employee has a good faith,reasonable belief that the underlying challenged actions of the employer violated the law.gregory daly,cir quotation marks omitted.and not just any law the plaintiff is required to have had a good faith,reasonable belief that she was opposing an employment practice made unlawful by title vii.mcmenemy city of rochester,cir see also id.vacating summary judgment where plaintiff belief that defendant alleged sexual harassment violated title vii was reasonable.the reasonableness of the plaintiff belief is to be assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances.galdieri ambrosini,at.
a plaintiff belief on this point is not reasonable simply because he or she complains of something that appears to be discrimination
