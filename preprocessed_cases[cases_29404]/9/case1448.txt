introduction 
though criminal convictions followed by imprisonment deprive defendants of their freedom,inmates nevertheless retain certain constitutionally protected property and liberty interests.thus,the due process clause in the fifth and fourteenth amendments prohibits the federal and state governments from depriving an inmate of life,liberty,or property without due process of law in this case,we consider whether a state has interfered unlawfully with an inmate protected liberty interests with respect to the conditions of his confinement and the possibility of his parole and whether a state officer may have unlawfully retaliated against the inmate for exercising his constitutional rights.
the commonwealth of pennsylvania incarcerated appellant phillip lee fantone in in a state correctional institution.the pennsylvania board of probation and parole the parole board granted him parole,but,by reason of prison discipline proceedings filed against fantone,the parole board rescinded that decision.fantone subsequently brought this case in the district court alleging that by their wrongful actions,defendants,now appellees,unlawfully caused him to be confined in a prison restrictive housing unit rhu,which,in turn,led the parole board to rescind his parole.defendants made a motion to dismiss under.b,which the court granted.fantone appeals,contending that the combination of the rescission of his parole and his confinement in the rhu infringed his legally cognizable liberty interests,thereby violating his right to due process of law.he further charges that defendants conspired to deprive him of these due process rights.finally,he claims that correctional officer joe burger unlawfully retaliated against him by having him retained in the rhu after the expiration of the period of his disciplinary confinement because fantone would not confess to the charges in the disciplinary proceedings and because he filed a grievance against burger charging that burger threatened him.
perhaps the most significant legal principle leading to our result on this appeal is that where state law provides parole authorities with complete discretion to rescind a grant of parole prior to an inmate release,the inmate does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being paroled before his actual release.see jago van curen.because pennsylvania law provides that the parole board may rescind a determination granting parole at any point before it is executed,an inmate is released we determine that fantone did not have a liberty interest in the grant of parole.moreover,inasmuch as an inmate does not have a right to be confined in any particular housing unit in a prison,absent certain atypical and significant hardship,when an inmate is placed in a restrictive custody unit,his liberty interests have not been infringed.see johnson commonwealth.we therefore will affirm the district court dismissal of fantone due process and conspiracy claims,as they are based on the rescission of his parole and the place of his confinement.for the reasons set forth below,however,we will reverse the court order dismissing his retaliation claims against burger and remand that aspect of this case for further proceedings.

iv.factual and procedural background 
pennsylvania incarcerated fantone as a parole violator in at that time,it held him at the state correctional institution pittsburgh sci pittsburgh.in march,when fantone was eligible for parole,he appeared before the parole board.the parole board exercised its discretion to grant him parole,and it informed him of this decision on or about april.however,in the weeks between fantone parole hearing and the parole board decision,prison officers charged fantone with cupping methadone and transferring it to other inmates.because of these allegations,the prison officers transferred fantone to the rhu.after fantone transfer,burger interrogated him about the methadone charges.burger told fantone that two nurses had seen him cupping his medication and that a surveillance video recorded this activity.fantone alleges that during this interrogation,burger threatened to bury fantone in this hole and you never see population here and then i have you shipped so far away you never get a visit.app.fantone subsequently filed a grievance against burger,complaining of these threats.
fantone appeared before an examiner,defendant ron mackey,for a hearing on the methadone allegations.defendant lieutenant fred latini and burger met privately with mackey before fantone entered the hearing room.during the hearing,mackey indicated that latini and burger had presented credible statements from two confidential informants supporting the cupping allegations.based on that evidence,mackey found fantone guilty of cupping his methadone and sanctioned him to serve days in the rhu,time he already had served.this disposition imposed a term of disciplinary custody,which is distinguishable from administrative custody as disciplinary custody,unlike administrative custody,is imposed as a punishment.
fantone contends that due to procedural improprieties,he was denied due process of law in those proceedings.he also alleges that during the hearing,burger remained within earshot outside of the hearing room,listening to the proceedings through an open door.fantone further alleges that burger informed latini of fantone sentence of time served but that latini nevertheless ordered fantone to remain in the rhu on administrative custody status until may.then,as a condition of release from the rhu,the prison staff required fantone to write a statement revoking his grievance against burger,and he did so under duress.
on may,after being back in the general population for four days,the prison officers transferred fantone again to the rhu on administrative custody status during the investigation of a second misconduct charge against him,this one relating to graffiti in his cell.the hearing on the second misconduct charge was continued until june,and until that time,fantone remained in the rhu.when the hearing reconvened with latini appearing as a witness,mackey found fantone guilty once again and sanctioned him to days of disciplinary custody.fantone contends that as he was being escorted back to the rhu,burger taunted him by flex ing his biceps with a slow robot type gait as if in victory.app.
fantone contends,and we accept the contention in these proceedings,that these disciplinary actions led the parole board to rescind fantone parole.however,fantone successfully obtained dismissal of both misconduct charges on administrative appeal due to a lack of reliable evidence.nevertheless,the parole board did not reinstate fantone parole,and he remained in the rhu until the prison authorities transferred him to another correctional institution on november.we were told at oral argument that fantone was not released from the second institution until he had served his entire term,or in the vernacular,had maxed out.
on november,fantone initiated a pro se civil action in the district court against latini,burger,and mackey his complaint,as later amended,set forth claims for due process violations,conspiracy,and retaliation.fantone attributed his loss of parole and confinement to the rhu to defendants unlawful actions.in addition,as we have indicated,fantone asserted that burger wrongfully retaliated against him because he would not confess to the methadone charge and because he filed a grievance against burger.the parties agreed to present the case to a magistrate judge for disposition,and the case was assigned to magistrate judge cynthia reed eddy.pursuant to a motion by defendants,now appellees,the court dismissed this case in its entirety by order of august,for failure to state a claim.in reaching its conclusion,the court reasoned as follows defendants did not deprive fantone of a liberty interest and thus did not infringe his due process protection his related conspiracy claim failed because there could not be a conspiracy to violate the due process clause without a violation of the clause and the retaliation claim failed because fantone pleadings did not adequately claim that his filing of a grievance against burger and his refusal to confess to the methadone allegations led to burger retaliating against him.fantone timely filed a notice of appeal,and we now decide the case 
discussion 
we are guided here by the concerns undergirding the liberty interests protected by the due process clause.under certain circumstances,states may create liberty interests with respect to inmates rights that are protected by the clause,but these interests generally will be limited to freedom from restraint that imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.sandin conner,see bd.of pardons allen.accordingly,though inmates do not shed all constitutional rights at the prison gate,l awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights,a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.jones prisoners labor union,quoting price johnston.discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct falls within the expected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.
due process claim fantone combination theory does not create a liberty interest.
the district court properly dismissed fantone due process claim.in his complaint,fantone asserts that he was denied due process in the methadone misconduct proceedings that resulted in his sentence to disciplinary confinement in the rhu and,in turn,led to the rescission of his parole.the court dismissed fantone claim based on a determination that his due process rights had not been implicated in the misconduct proceedings because those proceedings resulted in such brief confinements to the rhu that,even when coupled with the rescission of the grant of parole,the proceedings did not implicate his liberty interests.
the requirement that the government afford due process of law to the entities and individuals with whom it deals applies only in situations in which the governmental action implicates some protected life,liberty,or property interest of the entity or individual.in this case,fantone contends that the implicated interest relates to the place of his confinement and his possibility of being paroled.the supreme court and this court long have held that liberty interests may arise from two sources the due process clause itself and the laws of the states.hewitt helms,citing meachum fano,asquith dep t of,cir.fantone concedes that he does not have a liberty interest arising directly from the due process clause but contends that the combination of his confinement in the rhu and the rescission of his parole infringed his liberty interests.in short,he went from the verge of release on parole to being denied parole and being confined in the rhu.his argument includes the contention that his liberty interests were implicated because the rescission of his parole effectively lengthened his sentence.though there is no question that this theory is thoughtful and well crafted,we reject it.
sandin connor provides that an inmate liberty interests generally will be limited to freedom from restraint imposing atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.at.at.although we have not conclusively determined the baseline from which to measure what is atypical and significant in any particular prison system,and we do not do so here,we are satisfied that fantone has not demonstrated that he had a liberty interest that defendants could have infringed.
fantone rests his combination argument on the supreme court decision in wilkinson austin.wilkinson involved the placement of an inmate in one of ohio most extreme penitentiaries,its supermax facility,in which conditions are more restrictive than any other form of incarceration in ohio,including conditions on its death row or in its administrative control units.id.at.at.once confined in the supermax facility,an inmate remains there indefinitely,with only annual reviews.moreover,inmates lose parole eligibility while incarcerated in the supermax facility.id.at.at.the wilkinson court held that this combination of circumstances sufficed to create atypical and significant hardship,in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,so that confinement in the supermax facility could infringe an inmate liberty interests and the inmate therefore had a due process right in the procedure leading to that deprivation.id.at.at.in reaching its result the court emphasized the facility extreme conditions,especially its prohibition on almost all human contact,the indefinite confinement,and a supermax inmate automatic disqualification for parole consideration.id.
these factors,however,do not commix here analogously.fantone circumstances do not present hardship that is atypical and significant when compared to the ordinary incidents of prison life,so it can not be said that defendants actions infringed his liberty interests.id.at.at.the conditions in the rhu at sci pittsburgh are quite different from those in the supermax facility that the supreme court described in wilkinson.as a baseline point of contrast,the rhu offers the inmates confined in it,whether on administrative or disciplinary confinement,markedly more human interaction and bodily movement than is allowed in ohio supermax facility.wilkinson describes how the supermax facility prisoners are kept in a single small cell for hours each day and are permitted to leave only for one hour exercise.as the court described,it is fair to say inmates are deprived of almost any environmental or sensory stimuli and of almost all human contact.id.at.at.fantone faced far less restrictive constraints in the rhu.moreover,placement in the supermax facility is indefinite,and,after an initial day review,the placement is reviewed just annually.fantone,in contrast,was in the rhu,at least while on disciplinary confinement,for a set term of days,and his confinement in the rhu was subject to regular reviews see,e,stallings werholtz,app x,cir existence of periodic review of administrative custody in the kansas system distinguishes it from wilkinson.finally,unlike the supermax inmates,fantone was not disqualified for parole consideration.
this last consideration is significant despite the language with which fantone describes the rescission of his parole,he did not become ineligible for parole simply because of his placement in the rhu.to the contrary,when the parole board rescinded fantone parole,it repeated the procedural process that it had followed when it granted him parole as both times it reached its decision by exercising its discretion.where state law provides parole authorities complete discretion to rescind a grant of parole prior to release,an inmate does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being paroled.see jago,at.at blackman,concurring.critically,as we have pointed out,pennsylvania law provides that the parole board may at any time rescind an order granting parole until it is executed,the inmate is released on parole.see johnson,at.though the misconduct allegations against fantone probably caused the parole board to rescind his parole,and we assume as much on this appeal,n othing in a state code requires the parole board to deny parole in the face of a misconduct record or to grant parole in its absence.sandin,at.at.in this regard,we have not overlooked the fact that fantone was cleared of the misconduct charges on administrative appeal.rather,we will not equate such vindication with a defendant acquittal at a criminal trial following which the defendant can not be punished in that proceeding for committing the offense for which he had been tried.
ultimately,we conclude that fantone due process argument is unvailing.th
