opinion of the court 
appellant cathy fiscus,who was an employee at appellee,suffered from renal disease from until she received a kidney transplant in september.renal disease means kidney failure.from until september,therefore,fiscus was required to undergo and uncomfortable dialysis treatments to cleanse and eliminate waste from her blood.
fiscus sought a reasonable accommodation from her employer during the period of her dialysis.declined.as a consequence,she was placed on leave,which expired before the recuperation period from her kidney transplant.
fiscus sued under the americans with disabilities act.asserted that her kidney failure was not a covered disability,arguing that the inability to cleanse one own blood and eliminate body waste does not amount to the limitation of a major life activity under the statute.the district court agreed with.we do not.because we conclude that a physical impairment that limits an individual ability to cleanse and eliminate body waste does impair a major life activity,we will reverse the judgment of the district court in favor of.
from october through march,cathy fiscus served as an employee of stores,working at the company sam warehouse club store in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.during her tenure at the store,fiscus was assigned to a number of different departments,including paper goods,housewares,hard lines,grocery,and bakery.fiscus was responsible for lifting and stocking goods in the aisles.in the fall of,fiscus was placed in the bakery department and was eventually assigned to the position.
in november of,fiscus was diagnosed with renal kidney failure.over the next few years,her condition deteriorated,and in july,she was diagnosed as having renal disease,the condition of total or permanent kidney failure.fiscus had dialysis treatment from july through september.for the first half of her treatment,from july through december,fiscus underwent hemodialysis,a process by which the blood is cleansed mechanically.fiscus spent four to six hours,three times a week,hooked to a machine to have her blood cleansed.throughout the course of her hemodialysis treatment,she continued to work in her overnight position at sam warehouse club.
because of complications associated with hemodialysis,fiscus changed her treatment to peritoneal dialysis in.this regimen required fiscus to administer the minute dialysis process to herself every four to six hours each day.at the start of her treatment,fiscus was allowed to perform the dialysis at her work premises.
around the time she started peritoneal dialysis,fiscus suffered a fall at work and was absent from work for a short period of time.in january,fiscus returned to work and was removed from her position as a after she indicated in a company form that she was not able to perform functions without reasonable accommodation when the store manager proposed that fiscus take a day shift position,such as a greeter,fiscus requested that she be able to perform dialysis on premises.this request for accommodation was denied,and fiscus was informed that there were no available positions for her.instead,the store manager advised her to take disability leave,which she did.
in september of,fiscus underwent a kidney transplant and was unable to work for five and a half months,until march.on march,fired fiscus because she had been unable to return to work within a year 
fiscus filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging disability discrimination and later filed suit in district court.fiscus alleged in her complaint that she suffered from renal disease and that renal disease is a disability within the ada as it is a physical impairment that substantially limits major life activities.app.at.fiscus also claimed that removed her from her position because of disability,failed to accommodate her disability,and terminated her because of her disability.app.at.
filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that fiscus was not significantly limited in a major life activity.fiscus countered by asserting that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of processing body waste and cleaning her blood and that complete failure of her kidneys substantially limits her ability to perform the major life activities of eliminating body waste of cleaning her blood and of caring for herself.
in his report and recommendation,the magistrate judge recommended that motion for summary judgment be granted.she concluded that t he activities of processing bodily waste and cleansing blood do not comport with the definition of major life activity under the ada and that these activities were kidney function s,which were not a major life activity under the ada.the magistrate judge also concluded that fiscus had not identified other major life activities that were substantially limited by her renal disease.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and granted summary judgment for.we exercise plenary review over a grant of summary judgment.northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.
the ada mandates that covered businesses provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability b a.a qualified individual with a disability under the statute is someone with a disability who with or without reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of a particular job.disability,in turn,is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual.thus,to establish a statutorily protected disability,the employee must show that she has an impairment identify the life activity that she claims is limited by the impairment and prove that the limitation is substantial.bragdon abbott,d.
in this case,there is no dispute that renal disease,with which fiscus was afflicted during and until her transplant,is a physical impairment.the kidneys are vital organs that clean the blood and help eliminate bodily waste.kidney failure is incurable it requires either regular blood a transplant.but argues,and the district court agreed,that cleansing the blood and processing bodily waste do not constitute a major life activity within the meaning of the ada.the district court stated that fiscus allegation that she could not cleanse her blood and process waste without mechanical assistance was simply another way of stating that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of kidney function.magistrate.the court reasoned that impairment of an organ does not in itself constitute a limitation on a life activity.so,the district court concluded,to succeed,fiscus would have to show that the inability to cleanse blood limited her in doing something else that would be described as a life activity.
the district court erred in its point of departure.fiscus does not allege that her disease limited her in the life activity of kidney function.she contends that she was limited in the major life activities of cleansing her blood and processing waste.appellant br.at.by recharacterizing fiscus claim as an allegation that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of kidney function,the district court simply assumed away her argument.fiscus position is clear absence of kidney function was the impairment the consequence was the impact on the activity of blood cleansing and body waste processing.thus,it was incorrect for the district court to conflate the two,and to interpret fiscus contention as nothing more than claiming a limitation on the life activity of kidney functions.
that leads to the cleansing and eliminating waste from the blood a major life activity to be sure,these are normally internal body functions which are not,which occur automatically.but that does not mean that they may not be considered a major life activity.even internalized and autonomous body activities may qualify as major life activities within the meaning of the ada.
the ada itself does not comprehensively define the meaning of major life activity,but it does specifically direct that the statute be construed so that it meets the standards
