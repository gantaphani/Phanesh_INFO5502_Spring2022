plaintiff john kogut,convicted of rape and murder in but retried and acquitted of those charges in,appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york following a jury trial before joanna seybert,judge,dismissing his claims brought pursuant to and state law against defendants county of nassau the county and individual employees or former employees of the nassau county police department ncpd for,inter alia,due process violations and malicious prosecution.kogut claims were tried jointly with the similar claims asserted in an action brought by john restivo and dennis halstead,who also had been convicted in of rape and murder of the same victim and whose convictions had also eventually been vacated.at the joint trial here,the jury found in favor of the defendants.on appeal,kogut contends principally that the district court erred in denying his motion for a separate trial of his claims,at which certain evidence that was admitted at the joint trial would,he argues,have been inadmissible,and in denying his motion for a new trial after unadmitted and inadmissible evidence was given to the jury at the joint trial.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
on november,theresa fusco failed to return home after leaving work in lynbrook,new york.her body was found on december.an autopsy revealed that her death was caused by ligature strangulation a vaginal swab produced seminal fluids.
a.the criminal prosecutions 
during the investigation by detective joseph volpe and other ncpd detectives,kogut,halstead,and restivo allegedly made various incriminating statements.on march,ncpd brought restivo to ncpd headquarters for questioning.on march,restivo signed a statement the restivo statement,written out for him by volpe,which stated in part as follows 
i would like to say that sometime back,possibly nov or,i stopped by my friend dennis halstead apartment we were talking for about or minutes.at this point and kinda of sic out of the blue,dennis started to talk strange.he started talking about a broad.dennis said he was with a broad girl,and that he was either by a cemetary sic,in a cemetary sic or across from a cemetary sic.he said he tried to fuck her,then he had to fuck her up,but when he said that he did tell me how he fucked her up.he then told me that he strangled her and killed her.
restivo statement at.
two weeks later,kogut was brought in for questioning.after being questioned,and denying knowledge about the crimes against fusco,kogut agreed to return on a later date to take a polygraph examination.kogut took the polygraph exam on march he was then interrogated by volpe and defendant detective robert dempsey throughout the night.on march,kogut signed a detailed confession,written out for him by volpe,in which he implicated himself as well as halstead and restivo in the crimes against fusco the kogut confession or confession.acknowledging at the outset that he had been informed of his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present see kogut confession at,kogut stated,inter alia,that on a night in november,he,restivo,and halstead had been driving along in restivo van they saw a girl,about or years old,walking along the road by the cemetery and offered her a ride home,which she accepted id.at.after the girl declined an invitation to have sex,restivo drove the van into the cemetery halstead raped the girl while kogut held her down then restivo raped her.see id.at.restivo and halstead carried the girl out of the van when she began to revive and started saying she would tell,the men decided that she must die,and kogut strangled her to death with a nylon rope.id.at.kogut took the girl body back to the van and the men then drove from the cemetery to a wooded area,where they left the body in deep brush,covered with leaves and wooden pallets.see id.at.
a videotape was made,in which an assistant district attorney ada advised kogut of his constitutional rights kogut acknowledged that he understood them and he repeated the above story.kogut was promptly arrested.he was indicted on three counts rape,murder in the course of rape and intentional murder.following additional investigation,restivo and halstead were also arrested and were indicted on the same charges.
at kogut trial in,the written and videotaped iterations of his confession were admitted in evidence.the prosecution also introduced hairs of fusco that were allegedly found in restivo van.kogut denied any involvement in the crime he testified that the confession was the creation of volpe and dempsey and was coerced.kogut was found guilty on all counts.he was sentenced to serve years to life in prison.
thereafter,halstead and restivo were tried together.neither the kogut confession nor the restivo statement to the police was admitted at their trial.the prosecution introduced the hair evidence and evidence as to statements allegedly made by restivo or halstead to third parties.the latter evidence included a statement by halstead that halstead,restivo,and kogut had raped fusco and statements by restivo that restivo,halstead,and kogut had raped fusco,that restivo knew who had killed fusco,and prior to the discovery of her body that the police would find that fusco had been strangled.restivo and halstead were convicted on all counts each was sentenced to serve years to life in prison.
vacatur of the convictions 
beginning in,samples of semen that had been recovered from fusco body at autopsy were subjected to dna testing,along with dna samples taken,by consent,from kogut,restivo,and halstead.tests conducted in and excluded all three men as the source of male dna found in the samples recovered from fusco body.based on these results,kogut,restivo,and halstead promptly moved to vacate their convictions,but their motions were denied.in,new dna testing was done by three laboratories.these tests identified the same single,intact dna profile of a male who was unknown,was not kogut,restivo,or halstead,or anyone in law enforcement combined dna index system database as the source of the semen recovered from fusco body.in the spring of,the county agreed to have the convictions of all three men vacated.halstead and restivo were not retried,and the charges against them were ultimately dismissed.kogut,based on his written and video confession kogut brief on appeal at,was retried.following a bench trial in,he was acquitted.
c.the present action 
kogut commenced the present action in december pursuant to against numerous defendants,including the detectives involved in the investigation,alleging,inter alia,malicious prosecution with respect to his prosecution in and his retrial in.two days later,restivo and halstead or commenced a similar action pursuant to against many of the same defendants,alleging,inter alia,malicious prosecution with respect to the events in.
kogut complaint asserted,in addition to malicious prosecution,numerous claims,including denial of due process,false arrest,and false imprisonment.it alleged that the confession attributed to him was entirely fictitious that he was coerced into signing the confession after some continuous hours of questioning,during which he was repeatedly abused,verbally and physically and that he was coerced into repeating the fictitious account on videotape.see,kogut complaint.kogut alleged,inter alia,that he in fact was not informed of his constitutional rights see id,although he repeatedly asserted those rights see id.that he persistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of the events involving fusco see id,that the facts set out in the confession had been learned by volpe and dempsey during the course of their investigation,were not provided by kogut,and were put in the confession to create the illusion that kogut had specific personal knowledge about the victim,her manner of death,and the location of the body,amongst other things id.and that defendants had conspired and agreed to lie about the interrogation events,both before the grand jury and at kogut criminal trials see id.
the amended complaint filed by restivo and halstead complaint similarly asserted claims alleging that they were deprived of their rights to due process and a fair trial and that defendants maliciously prosecuted them.it alleged,inter alia,that restivo,when questioned in march by volpe,dempsey,and other members of ncpd,had truthfully and repeatedly denied knowing anything about the fusco crimes.see,e,complaint.it alleged that,some seven hours after bringing restivo to ncpd headquarters against his will,and after subjecting him to questioning and a polygraph test see,id,defendants began to abuse restivo,choking and punching him in order to coerce him into making a false accusation against halstead id.only then did restivo sign a written statement created by defendants falsely indicating that halstead had told him that he raped a girl in,near,or across from a cemetery and then strangled and killed her.id.the complaint alleged that restivo had no involvement in the fusco rape and murder nor did he know anyone who did id.
consolidation and the motions for separate trials 
in,the district court granted a joint request by all parties to consolidate the kogut and cases for purposes of discovery.in march,finding that the claims of kogut and involved common questions of law and fact,the court sua sponte consolidated the actions for all purposes.
in a memorandum and order dated august,kogut i,the district court dismissed some of plaintiffs claims,including their claims for false arrest and false imprisonment.see kogut i,at.the court also dismissed malicious prosecution claims and kogut malicious prosecution claim,see id.at but those claims were reinstated upon reconsideration,in a memorandum and order dated december,kogut ii,at.
in the summer of,kogut and filed motions requesting that their cases be tried separately.the motions argued that,pursuant to this court decision in boyd city of new york,cir or boyd,the core question for the plaintiffs respective claims of malicious prosecution was,as to each individual plaintiff,whether the defendants had probable cause to believe the prosecution of that individual could succeed based on the admissible evidence.argued that the kogut confession could not be considered in the assessment of whether defendants had probable cause to prosecute restivo or halstead because it was inadmissible against them in their criminal proceedings,and that since the confession would be admissible against kogut,a joint trial would be highly prejudicial to restivo and halstead.kogut,adopting the legal arguments,argued that a s is the case with the kogut confession vis a vie sic,various alleged statements that will undoubtedly be used against are likewise inadmissible against kogut,and at a joint trial they would potential ly prejudice kogut.kogut motion dated august,for a severance of his claims for trial,at.
kogut listed statements attributed to restivo or halstead that kogut viewed as excludable at a trial of his claims if not consolidated with trial of the claims of.of those statements,the following mentioned kogut 
john restivo stated to thomas mcbride that he was present for the commission of the rape and murder of theresa fusco,but that dennis halstead and john kogut really did it.
john restivo stated to steven dorfman that he,john kogut and dennis halstead did engage in sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion with theresa fusco.
dennis halstead stated to brian that he,john restivo and john kogut engaged in sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion with theresa fusco.
id.at emphases ours.
at a status conference on august,the district court denied both and kogut motions for separate trials,ruling that the challenged statements would be admissible against each plaintiff for a limited purpose.see hearing transcript,august,kogut iii,at.the court noted that 
t o establish malicious prosecution plaintiffs need to show that,one,the prosecution was initiated against them two,that it was brought with malice three,but without probable cause to believe that it could succeed and,four,that the prosecution terminated in favor of the accused plaintiff.
id.at.it stated that although under boyd the statements that were inadmissible at plaintiffs underlying criminal proceedings were not admissible in this civil trial to show that defendants had probable cause to prosecute,they could nonetheless be admissible to negate another disputed element of the malicious prosecution claims,that defendants had prosecuted the plaintiffs with malice.see id.at.
the joint trial 
at the joint trial,the plaintiffs presented expert testimony to indicate that the hairs introduced at their criminal trials had not been found in restivo van but instead were taken from fusco body at autopsy see trial transcript tr,and kogut and restivo testified,consistent with their respective complaints,that the incriminating statements they supposedly made to the police were false,were created by volpe and dempsey,and were the product of abuse and coercion see id.at.the restivo statement was introduced and was the subject of testimony from various witnesses.other statements focusing on statements attributed to restivo and halstead were also introduced.
of the statements listed in kogut motion for a separate trial as likely to prejudice him unless his claims were tried separately,only the three described in part.above mentioned kogut.of those three,neither of the statements attributed to restivo was introduced at the joint trial.the statement attributed to halstead,his alleged statement to that halstead,restivo,and kogut raped fusco the halstead statement was the subject of testimony from three witnesses here restivo criminal defense attorney who testified that had testified to that statement at the criminal trial,a former ada who testified that testified at that trial that halstead said kogut killed fusco,and halstead who testified at the joint trial here that he had made no such statement to.
the jury was asked to decide the claims of kogut,restivo,and halstead,individually,against each of six or seven specified individual defendants a for deprivations of plaintiffs respective rights to due process and a fair trial either by fabricating evidence or by withholding material exculpatory or impeachment evidence verdict sheet,november,questions,and b for malicious prosecution see id.questions.it found in favor of each defendant in response to each of those questions.in addition,as to defendant sean spillane,who was head of ncpd homicide bureau in,the jury found that while supervising volpe,dempsey and the other defendant police officers,spillane created a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred,but that a reasonable officer in spillane position as the commanding officer of the homicide bureau in would not have understood his conduct to be unconstitutional.id.questions b,c.and with regard to a claim for negligent supervision,asserted by kogut,the jury found that although the county was responsible for the acts of defendant spillane in failing to supervise,the failure to supervise did not cause an injury to plaintiff kogut.id.questions.
plaintiffs motions for a new trial 
both kogut and moved pursuant to.a for a new trial.kogut argued principally that there were procedural and evidentiary errors see part.below,that the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence,and that the denial of his pretrial motion for separate trials caused him prejudice because of the admission of evidence that would not have been admissible if his claims had been tried separately.in particular,he claimed to have been prejudiced by the introduction of character evidence as to halstead dating a teenage girl and contributing to the delinquency of teenage girls,and by testimony concerning statements about fusco murder allegedly made to third parties by restivo.none of the alleged restivo statements about fusco mentioned or described kogut,although one of the defendant detectives testified that restivo,when questioned about the fusco murder,said he was fearful of those two guys,which the detective interpreted as meaning kogut and halstead tr.
the district court denied kogut motion for a new trial,see kogut county of nassau,cv,cv,wl,at july,kogut iv,stating,inter alia,that it was not persuaded that any of the evidence kogut cited was prejudicial to him or affected his substantial rights,see id.at.
the district court granted motion in part,finding,inter alia,that the jury charge on the probable cause element of restivo and halstead malicious prosecution claims may have misled the jury as to the correct legal standard,may have led the jury to believe that it could consider the kogut confession in determining whether defendants had probable cause to prosecute restivo or halstead.id.at.the court ordered that kogut case and case be unconsolidated,and it ordered that final judgment be entered terminating kogut case.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,kogut contends principally that the evidence relating to statements attributed to restivo or halstead was not admissible against him at his criminal trials,and that the district court therefore erred a in denying his pretrial motion for separate trials and b in denying his posttrial rule motion for a new trial.see kogut brief on appeal at.he also argues that he was entitled to a new trial because,inter alia,certain unadmitted evidence was inadvertently sent into the jury room,and he challenges certain of the court instructions and evidentiary rulings.for the reasons that follow,the circumstances of which kogut complains do not,either singly or in combination,warrant the conclusion that the district court erred or otherwise abused its discretion.
a.the denial of separate trials 
both a decision by the district court to consolidate cases and a denial by the court of a motion for separate trials are reviewed under an standard.see,johnson celotex,cir.consolidation,cert.denied,alaniz zamora quezada,cir separate trials see generally garber randell,cir severance wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed an order granting or denying separate trials is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.a district court has abused its discretion if it has based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.manganiello city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
kogut contends,in part,that the court decision is entitled to no deference because in denying his motion to sever,the court gave absolutely no consideration to his interests,whatsoever.kogut brief on appeal at see id.at.this contention borders on the frivolous.
the rulings denying kogut and motions for separate trials were announced at a status conference that began with the court noting the motion,noting the motion by kogut,and noting that there were aspects of the motion with which kogut disagreed.see kogut iii,at.although in explaining its denial of the separate trial motions,the court expressly discussed only the extent to which the kogut confession would be admissible against restivo and halstead,the court fundamental rationale that a statement inadmissible at a criminal trial could nonetheless be admissible in an ensuing civil action asserting claims of malicious prosecution because of its relevance to the malice element of such a claim see id.at was obviously applicable to kogut challenge to the admissibility against him of the statements of restivo or halstead listed in kogut motion.and its applicability was evidently understood by the attorneys representing kogut at that conference there was ample opportunity for them to speak up if they believed the court had not sufficiently considered kogut position.they made no such suggestion.
as a substantive matter,the district court explanation no doubt focused more explicitly on the admissibility against restivo and halstead of the kogut confession because it posed a clearer danger of unfair prejudice to them than any of the statements described in kogut motion posed to kogut.the kogut confession was the sole focus of the motion and was a written and videotaped confession to the authorities,recounting the rape and murder of fusco by kogut,restivo,and halstead in devastating detail.in addition,had made a motion in limine to preclude introduction of the kogut confession as a defense to their malicious prosecution claims.kogut motion,in contrast,did not involve any direct evidence such as a videotaped confession.rather,kogut motion listed statements that he anticipated would be offered against restivo and halstead nine of them were statements attributed to restivo or halstead by persons other than the authorities,and the tenth attributed to restivo by the authorities did not mention kogut.indeed,seven of the statements anticipatorily challenged by kogut did not mention him,either explicitly or implicitly and kogut had not made any in limine motion to preclude admission of any of the restivo or halstead statements against him.kogut has not proffered any persuasive basis for a conclusion that in substance the denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion.
nor is there merit in kogut contention that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the ground that it should have granted separate trials.in making his motion for a new trial on this ground,kogut principally incorporated by reference his pretrial motion for separate trials he made no effort to focus his posttrial motion on the statements that were actually admitted at the joint trial.as it turned out,from the item list set out in his pretrial motion,the only two restivo statements that mentioned kogut allegedly made to thomas mcbride and steven dorfman,see part.above as well as several of the statements that did not mention kogut were not introduced.only one of the statements that mentioned kogut the halstead statement was introduced at trial.but kogut motion for a new trial contained no discussion of the halstead statement.he did argue that he was prejudiced by the introduction of various statements attributed to restivo,only one of which had been listed in his pretrial severance motion and none of which mentioned kogut,and these arguments were addressed by the district court.although kogut motion also stated that it incorporated the arguments he had made in his severance motion in which the halstead statement was one of the listed that pretrial motion had argued the potential for prejudice.kogut motion for a new trial made no argument that the evidence admitted with regard to the halstead statement caused him actual prejudice.
as kogut did not argue to the district court that he was entitled to a new trial because he was prejudiced by the admission of the evidence as to the halstead statement,his present reliance on that evidence see kogut brief on appeal at is reviewable only for plain error.a plain error is an error that is plain,that prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights and that seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,internal quotation marks omitted.kogut can not meet this standard.
kogut complaint about the evidence as to the halstead statement does not satisfy even the first element of this test,for we can not conclude that its admission was error.with regard to that statement as with regard to evidence against restivo or halstead that did not mention kogut kogut argues simply that the evidence was admissible only as to restivo and halstead and its admission prejudiced kogut.kogut brief on appeal at see,id.at.but the basis for his premise that it was inadmissible against him in the present case is his argument,relying principally on boyd city of new york,see,kogut brief on appeal at reply brief on appeal at,that those statements were not admitted,and were inadmissible,at his criminal trial.he also argues that many of these alleged statements were irrelevant because they were made after kogut was arrested.see,kogut brief on appeal at id.at characterizing boyd as holding that a criminal defendant statement,made after his arrest,can not contribute to the probable cause determination emphasis in brief reply brief at.kogut arguments misconstrue boyd and ignore the basis for the district court ruling on admissibility here.
boyd was an appeal from the dismissal of a claim for malicious p
