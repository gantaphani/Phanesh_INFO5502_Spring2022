andrew novarro,an ithaca,new york policeman,appeals from that part of a memorandum decision and order dated march,by the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,judge denying his motion for summary judgment on a false arrest claim brought by joseph amore under.the claim is based on novarro arrest of amore pursuant to new york penal law section,which,on its face,prohibits loitering in a public place for the purpose of soliciting another person to engage in deviate sexual behavior amore alleges that his apprehension constituted a false arrest because the statute,although then officially and unofficially published as currently effective law,had been ruled unconstitutional by the new york court of appeals eighteen years before.
the district court concluded that novarro was not entitled to qualified immunity amore had a clearly established constitutional right to be free from unlawful arrest,and it would have been clear to a reasonable officer in novarro position that making an arrest under section after it had been held to be unconstitutional by the new york court of appeals in people uplinger,mem,was unlawful.
we disagree.we conclude that novarro is entitled to qualified immunity under these circumstances.it was unreasonable to expect this police officer to know that a statute that was,and is,still on the books and being enforced had been held to be unconstitutional.we therefore reverse that part of the district court order dismissing novarro motion for summary judgment on the false arrest claim based on qualified immunity,and remand the cause with instructions to grant the motion.
background 
plaintiff joseph amore met defendant andrew novarro on october,in a public park in ithaca,new york.novarro was there acting as an undercover police officer,watching for drug activity.amore,not knowing who novarro was or what he was doing,offered to perform a sexual act on him.
novarro identified himself as a police officer and asked amore for identification,which he produced.novarro told amore that he did not have a ticket to write out and would have to call for backup,which he proceeded to do.novarro later testified that he did so in part because he did not have an appearance ticket with which to charge amore with loitering.
while they waited for another police officer to arrive,novarro told amore that he was being charged with loitering for the purpose of deviant sexual activity.deposition of andrew novarro novarro dep.at.novarro explained to amore that they were cracking down on this kind of activity in the park.deposition of joseph amore amore dep.at.
novarro testified,and it is not disputed in the briefing of this appeal,that the new york police academy he had attended issues a copy of the new york penal law to every officer,and that most officers carry a copy of it with them on duty it is in the form of a looseleaf booklet containing the text of the penal law that is published by gould publications,the ithaca police department furnishes each of its officers with yearly updates consisting of a stack of substitute pages reflecting new laws that have been enacted during the previous year,or deleting laws that are no longer in effect.when the officers receive these yearly updates,they are supposed to remove those pages that have become outdated and insert into the booklet,in their stead,the substitute pages reflecting the current law.the booklet is unannotated,without interpretations,case law,or the like.when the backup officer arrived,he gave novarro a copy of this version of the penal law,because novarro had left his own copy in his office.
after consulting the booklet,novarro issued amore an appearance ticket.novarro then released amore from custody.the appearance ticket required amore to appear in ithaca city court to answer a charge of loitering in violation of new york penal law.
novarro then had amore formally charged with a violation of that offense.accusatory instrument,ithaca city.
some time later,the city prosecutor informed novarro that amore had moved to dismiss the charge against him based on people uplinger,a ruling by the new york court of appeals holding,in a memorandum decision,that the loitering statute pursuant to which amore had been arrested,penal law,was unconstitutional.the city prosecutor told novarro that she therefore could not continue the prosecution.is undisputed that novarro was unaware that the statute had been held to be unconstitutional prior to this conversation.
on november,the prosecutor,as she had told novarro she would,moved to dismiss the charge against amore based on uplinger.the ithaca city court granted the motion on that basis.the court observed that it was puzzling that the statute continued to be published in the mckinney consolidated laws of new york annotated compendium of new york statutes that is separate from,and more formal and complete than,the unannotated booklet provided to novarro and other officers by the police the present day as if it is still a viable statute.people amore,ithaca city.it is hard to understand why the legislature would continue this statute on the books,given that it is now close to years since it was determined to be unconstitutional.id.
some two and years later,on february,amore filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of new york against novarro and the city of ithaca for damages pursuant to.his claims against novarro were for false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,and violation of his right to equal protection.his claims against the city were made pursuant to monell department of social services,for failure to train city employees and for maintaining an improper policy,custom or practice of permitting officers to make arrests under the unconstitutional statute.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.amore opposed the motion,filing a for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.
on march,the district court denied amore for summary judgment with respect to all claims,and,treating the defendants motion as a motion for summary judgment,granted the defendants motion in part and denied it in part.the district court granted the motion on the malicious prosecution,abuse of process,and equal protection claims against novarro,and the maintenance of an improper policy or custom claim against the city.see amore city of ithaca,civ,dist.lexis,none of those claims are at issue on this interlocutory appeal.
the district court denied summary judgment on the false arrest claim,however.see id.the court reasoned that novarro lacked probable cause to arrest amore under section because the new york court of appeals had declared that statute unconstitutional in uplinger.id.at.
the district court conceded that such a situation presents a difficult choice for a police officer because a common sense reading of would place amore actions squarely within the purview of that provision.id.at.it also acknowledged that novarro would have had to conduct legal research or seek expert advice in order to discover the statute invalidity.id.at the court concluded nonetheless that novarro was not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the false arrest claim because amore right to be free from unlawful arrest under was clearly established at the time that he was arrested.id.at.in the court view,in light of uplinger,it was objectively unreasonable for novarro to believe that the arrest was lawful,because courts must at least hold public officials to a basic standard of awareness where the state highest court has pronounced a statute facially unconstitutional.id.at.
the district court also denied the motion for summary judgment on the claim against the city.the court based its decision on evidence submitted by amore to the effect that the city knew that its police officers operating in stewart park would encounter individuals soliciting and engaging in sex.see id.at.at argument before this court,the parties represented that the claim against the city was still pending.it is therefore not before us on this appeal 
on june,the district court denied amore motion to reconsider the denial of his motion for summary judgment on the false arrest claim.see amore city of ithaca,civ,dist.lexis june.
on june,the defendants petitioned the district court for leave to appeal from the march,memorandum opinion and order.the district court denied leave to appeal.on october,we concluded that we had jurisdiction over the march memorandum opinion and order to the extent that it denied novarro qualified immunity on the false arrest claim,and directed the clerk of the court to issue a briefing schedule for an appeal on the qualified immunity question.
the sole question on appeal,then,is whether novarro is entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claim.

jurisdiction and standard of review 
as a general rule,the denial of summary judgment is not immediately appealable.finigan marshall,cir citing.the collateral order doctrine,however,allows review of a district court denial of summary judgment on the ground that the movant was not entitled to qualified immunity to the extent that the district court has denied the motion as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
our jurisdiction is limited such that we may only review novarro assertion of qualified immunity based on stipulated facts,facts accepted for purposes of the appeal,or the plaintiff version of the facts that the district court deemed available for jury resolution.kelsey county of schoharie,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while we must examine whether a given factual dispute is material for summary judgment purposes,we may not review whether a dispute of fact identified by the district court is genuine.jones parmley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
summary judgment should be granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the court construes all evidence in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in his favor.see,lasalle bank ass nomura asset capital,cir.we review the district court denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds,as in other contexts,de novo.see,moore andreno,cir.
ii.qualified immunity 
qualified immunity is an affirmative defense designed to protect the defendant public official not just from liability but also from suit thereby sparing him the necessity of defending by submitting to discovery on the merits or undergoing a trial,pataki,cir.government officials are entitled to qualified immunity insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald.a police officer who has an objectively reasonable belief that his actions are lawful is entitled to qualified immunity.okin village of police dep t,cir.
the central purpose of affording public officials qualified immunity from suit is to protect them from undue interference with their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability.elder holloway,quoting harlow,at.the qualified immunity defense is supposed to provide ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs.
in order to overcome a qualified immunity defense,a plaintiff must demonstrate that t aken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the facts alleged show that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,and that the right allegedly violated was clearly established.saucier katz,overruled in part on other grounds,pearson callahan.for a constitutional right to be clearly established for purposes of determining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.mollica volker,cir quoting anderson creighton,see also saucier,at the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.
thus the inquiry into whether it was objectively reasonable for an officer to believe that his conduct did not violate a constitutional right has been viewed as part of the inquiry into whether the constitutional right allegedly violated was clearly established.see harlow,at reliance on the objective reasonableness of an official conduct is measured by reference to clearly established law okin,at saucier makes it clear that the objectively reasonable inquiry is part of the clearly established inquiry.we have,however,sometimes framed the objectively reasonable inquiry as separate from the clearly established inquiry.see,cornejo bell,cir q ualified immunity is sufficient to shield executive employees from civil liability under if either their conduct did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known,or it was objectively reasonable to believe that their acts did not violate these clearly established rights.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.whether the objectively reasonable inquiry is framed as part of the clearly established inquiry,or apart from it,does not affect the outcome of the qualified immunity analysis here 
iii.novarro qualified immunity 
we assume here,not without reason,that when novarro arrested amore he violated a constitutional right of amore not to be arrested for activity made criminal by section,which had been held unconstitutional by the new york court of appeals.lemon kurtzman,plurality opinion indicating that a statute is a legal basis for arrest only u ntil judges say otherwise.and the broad right not to be arrested pursuant to an unconstitutional statute may well be considered clearly established.but the question here is whether the right not to be arrested under this statute was clearly established,that is,whether it was objectively reasonable for novarro to fail to realize that the statute he was attempting to enforce against amore had been held to be unconstitutional by the new york court of appeals.see okin,at framing inquiry as whether the law was clearly established for the particular context in which the challenged conduct occurred.a policeman lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he has probable cause,and being mulcted in damages if he does.pierson ray,
to spare police officers the unenviable choice between failing to enforce the law and risking personal liability for enforcing what they reasonably,but mistakenly,think is the law,we generally extend qualified immunity to an officer for an arrest made pursuant to a statute that is on the books,so long as the arrest was based on probable cause that the statute was violated.see ex rel.blumenthal crotty,cir officials charged with enforcing a statute on the books are generally entitled to rely on the presumption that all relevant legal and constitutional issues have been considered and that the statute is valid.see also id.at in order to determine whether the defendant may prevail,we consider many factors,but rely primarily on one factor as particularly persuasive that the challenged conduct involved enforcement of a presumptively valid statute.vives city of new york,cir distinguishing crotty from case which did not involve state officials acting under the color of a statute emphasis in original grossman city of portland,cir c ourts have continued to adhere to the central principle that where a police officer has probable cause to arrest someone under a statute that a reasonable officer could believe is constitutional,the officer will be immune from liability even if the statute is later held to be unconstitutional.shero city of grove,okl,cir referring to reliance on statute as extraordinary circumstance that could so prevent the official from knowing that his or her actions were unconstitutional that he or she should not be imputed with knowledge of a clearly established right.
we noted some years ago that 
i t has long been clearly established that an arrest without probable cause is a constitutional violation.nonetheless,the arresting officer is en
