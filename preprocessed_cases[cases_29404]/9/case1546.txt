opinion of the court 
this is an interlocutory appeal by pat thompson thompson,a pennsylvania department of corrections doc records specialist at sci albion,from the district court order denying her motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.in an action brought under,plaintiff miguel montanez montanez alleges that he was incarcerated beyond the expiration of his maximum term of imprisonment as a result of the defendants deliberate indifference in responding to his inquiries and challenges.because we find that we may properly exercise appellate jurisdiction over this appeal and that thompson was entitled to qualified immunity on this claim,we will reverse.
background 
on august,judge quinones of the court of common pleas sentenced montanez for burglary,imposing a maximum term of imprisonment with a minimum term effective july,quinones sentence.as such,his period of incarceration on this sentence ran through july.on january,shortly after his minimum term of imprisonment had expired,the pennsylvania board of probation and parole parole board paroled montanez from the quinones sentence.
on february,after about a year at liberty from the quinones sentence,montanez was arrested and detained on several new state charges,including multiple counts of luring a child into a motor vehicle,harassment,open lewdness,indecent exposure,and corrupting the morals of a minor.montanez first went to trial on these charges in philadelphia municipal court,where he was convicted after a bench trial the municipal court sentenced him on april,to a maximum term of imprisonment with a minimum term.montanez appealed the conviction to the court of common pleas on may,nullifying the conviction and sentence of the municipal court over a year later,on june,he pleaded guilty to the charges before judge smith of the court of common pleas and was again sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment with a minimum term smith sentence.the court judgment did not provide montanez with any credit for time served while awaiting his sentence.
while the proceedings were underway against montanez for these new charges,the parole board lodged a detainer against him for possible violation of his parole on the quinones sentence.the parole board held a hearing on july,and found that montanez was a convicted and technical parole violator.he was recommitted on the quinones sentence to serve months of backtime as a convicted violator and recommitted to serve a concurrent six months of backtime as a technical violator.despite this,the parole board later realized that recommitting montanez as a convicted violator was untimely,likely due to confusion resulting from the nullification of montanez municipal court conviction.the parole board eventually rescinded the backtime sentence on november,but retained its finding that montanez was a technical violator.accordingly,only the parole board recommitment for montanez technical violation was left intact.the parole board order rescinding the sentence noted that the case was retroactively closed effective july,the maximum release date on the quinones sentence.
after the quinones sentence had officially expired,montanez remained in prison on the smith sentence.montanez first contact with thompson occurred on october,when he submitted an inmate request form seeking copies of his commitment papers app.at.thompson responded that he would have to submit a fee of for each copy of commitment papers before she could process his request.shortly after receiving thompson response,on october,montanez was transferred from sci albion to philadelphia county prison,and there is no indication that he followed through with his initial document request at that time.montanez served time in county custody until january,and,upon returning to the state prison system,resumed his communications with thompson.on may,he submitted another inmate request form,in which he sought,inter alia,information about commitment credit and his commitment papers from judge smith.app.at.as to his question about commitment credit,thompson responded that she had sent a letter to judge smith regarding montanez commitment credit on february.she further noted that no commitment credit would be applied towards montanez sentence until the records office received a response from judge smith because it is not appropriate to give credit for time being served in satisfaction of a separate and distinct sentence.id.although there is no indication in the record that judge smith responded to thompson inquiries,montanez doc record reveals that at some point he received days of commitment credit on the smith sentence for this incarceration period five days for the period between his arrest and the lodging of the parole board detainer,and days for the period between his municipal court conviction and the filing of his appeal to the court of common pleas.eventually,after a review of montanez sentence computation,thompson and her superiors determined montanez was entitled to full commitment credit for time served during his incarceration between arrest on the new charges february,and eventual sentencing by judge smith june.after application of this credit,montanez had served the maximum term of imprisonment on the smith sentence.as such,on december,montanez was released.
montanez filed a complaint in the district court on october,alleging that the named defendants took ineffectual action in resolving the supposed errors in his sentencing calculation,resulting in violations of his constitutional rights.initially,thompson filed a motion to dismiss the complaint partly on the basis of qualified immunity,which the district court denied.when discovery was completed,thompson filed a motion for summary judgment,again based partly on qualified immunity.the district court denied this motion without elaboration.thompson then moved for reconsideration,which the district court also denied without elaboration.
thompson thereafter timely filed this interlocutory appeal.in response to thompson notice of appeal,the district court entered a memorandum opinion explaining its prior denial of thompson motion for summary judgment.the district court noted that the parties had advanced different calculations of montanez maximum release date and found that the difference in proposed release dates presented a factual dispute that precluded entry of summary judgment 
montanez believes his release date should have been february.the state argues his release in december,was too early because montanez was never reparoled after serving his six months back time and,therefore,he did not begin serving judge smith year sentence until july.the difference in dates presents a factual question which prevents the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant thompson.
dist.op.at.the district court held,without explanation,that evaluating these disparate calculations and determining the correct maximum release date was a question of fact for the jury to decide.the district court also noted that the jury would need to determine whether montanez adequately demonstrated that thompson acted with deliberate indifference to succeed on his eighth amendment claim.additionally,the district court determined that,if montanez was held beyond his maximum term of imprisonment,thompson would not qualify for qualified immunity because there is a clearly established right not to be held.dist.op.at.

the district court had jurisdiction over montanez federal civil rights claims pursuant to and a.our jurisdiction is contested.we necessarily exercise de novo review over an argument alleging a lack of appellate jurisdiction.reilly city of atlantic city,cir.to the extent that we do have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal,w e review the denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo.we apply the same test required of the district court and view inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.bayer monroe county children and youth,cir quoting haybarger lawrence county adult prob.parole,cir.
jurisdiction 
montanez argues that we do not have jurisdiction to entertain the issues raised in this interlocutory appeal.typically,a denial of summary judgment is not a final appealable order,but the supreme court has held that a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.the supreme court has made clear,however,that this qualified immunity exception does not include interlocutory appeals of a district court evidence sufficiency determinations at summary judgment,which facts a party may,or may not,be able to prove at trial.johnson jones,d.accordingly,our jurisdiction to review the district court order denying summary judgment depends on whether the defendants appeal raises pure questions of law or whether it challenges the district court determination of which facts were sufficiently supported by evidence.reilly,at quoting blaylock city of philadelphia,cir.for instance,an appeals court can not review whether the district court erred in denying a qualified immunity motion because the judge was mistaken as to the facts that are subject to genuine dispute.see forbes twp.of lower merion,cir.our review in these circumstances is therefore somewhat analogous to the review of a rule b motion,where we would not evaluate the underlying evidence to support the plaintiff claims which the district court chose to accept.walter pike county,cir quoting atkinson taylor,cir.despite this,we may review whether the set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.reilly,at citing forbes,at.additionally,i f there are minor gaps in the district court factual recitation,we can determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.walter,at quoting rivas city of passaic,cir.
montanez argues that we should dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the appeal does not raise a pure question of law,but rather is a challenge to the district court factual determination that the record evidence presented at summary judgment sufficiently raised a genuine dispute.this argument seems to be based on the district court holding that the parties final release dates for the disputed term of imprisonment presented a factual question that prevented the entry of summary judgment.montanez suggests that we would not be able to review this holding to the extent it indicates that the district court found sufficient record factual support for his proffered calculation.thompson disputes this contention,arguing that this appeal does not raise evidence sufficiency issues because an inmate release date is a mixed question of fact and law.thompson further points out that,in denying summary judgment,the district court identified the applicable historical facts,including montanez convictions,incarceration time,and parole history,and they have not been challenged on this appeal.
though we will briefly examine montanez claim that he was held beyond his maximum release date as an aid to our analysis,we do not need to finally determine the claim to resolve this appeal.we can determine whether thompson is entitled to qualified immunity under the clearly established prong of saucier katz,d.as montanez concedes,we clearly do have appellate jurisdiction over this issue.amicus br.at.we may therefore properly exercise jurisdiction over this appeal to determine whether the set of facts identified by the district court was sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established right.see reilly,at.
qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity applies regardless of whether the government official conduct results from a mistake of law,mistake of fact,or mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.id.in saucier,the supreme court provided a sequential inquiry for analyzing claims of qualified immunity 
first,a court must decide whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right.second,if the plaintiff has satisfied this first step,the court must decide whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of a defendant alleged misconduct.qualified immunity is applicable unless the official conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right.
pearson.at citing saucier,at internal citations and quotations omitted.recently,however,the supreme court has eliminated the requirement that saucier two steps be analyzed in sequential order 
on reconsidering the procedure required in saucier,we conclude that,while the sequence set forth there is often appropriate,it should no longer be regarded as mandatory.the judges of the district courts and the courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.
in this case,the parties focus on the first prong of saucier in analyzing whether montanez has shown that he was held beyond his maximum release date.montanez claims that his eighth amendment rights were violated when his detention exceeded the maximum release date on his term of imprisonment this court has previously held that an inmate detention beyond his or her maximum term of imprisonment could constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.see sample diecks,cir.thompson argues that montanez has not shown a viable constitutional deprivation because the undisputed historical facts about montanez conviction and incarceration history reveal that he was not subjected to unjustified incarceration.montanez claims that he has shown a genuine dispute of fact on this issue that would preclude summary judgment.
considering the facts adopted by the district court,it would seem unlikely that montanez could show he was held beyond his maximum release date under these circumstances.the pennsylvania parole statute provides that parole violators are to be recommitted for the remainder of their original sentence a technical parole violator may be reentered to serve the remainder of the original sentence or sentences from the date the parolee is taken into custody on the warrant of the board.con.stat.ann.c.it is true,as montanez points out,that he was ultimately recommitted for only six months of backtime for technical violation of his parole on the quinones sentence because the board rescinded its finding that he was a convicted parole violator.despite this,he was not necessarily entitled to be released after his backtime sentence had expired.in pennsylvania,backtime is considered to be a new minimum sentence,which only affects a parole violator entitlement to seek reparole.see riverbark,pennsylvania bd.of prob.and parole,the period of recommitment set by the board,which may be less than the unexpired term of the parolee sentence,simply establishes a new parole eligibility date for the does not entitle him to release after that period of time.upon completion of this period of backtime,the parolee has the right to again apply for parole and have his application considered by the board.emphasis added.additionally,montanez contends that he received no credit for the between his arrest on the new charges and eventual sentencing by judge smith.however,the maximum release date for the quinones sentence was july,which is the date the case was closed by the final parole board order on that matter.accordingly,every day between the date the quinones sentence was imposed july,and the quinones case closing july,was fully credited towards that sentence,which appears to be a correct application of pennsylvania law.see martin pennsylvania bd.of prob.and parole,w e hold that,where an offender is incarcerated on both a board detainer and new criminal charge
