metropolitan hired freadman in and promoted her to manager in.in march,freadman became ill with ulcerative colitis,and from march to july,she took medical leave for treatment of this condition.at the time,freadman reported to assistant vice president robert smith.
during her convalescence,smith visited freadman and phoned her on several occasions.during these conversations,freadman and smith discussed freadman need for reasonable hours,fewer last minute time driven assignments,balance,being able to exercise,and having adequate staff.smith agreed to freadman request for a better balance and to make changes indeed,he told freadman that she worked too hard.
freadman returned to work in july.she was accommodated by being allowed to work for the first several weeks,even though such work was not normally available for managers.
upon her return,smith reassigned freadman training,compliance,and performance enhancement duties to other employees in an attempt to reduce her workload,as she had requested.smith also arranged for freadman to take over a new project known as ease of doing business edb,which was headed by smith boss,chris cawley.although smith did not request that she do so,freadman began working long hours again,including nights and weekends.according to plaintiff,she needed to work such hours because of the assignments she received.smith in fact had previously told her on more than one occasion that it would be okay for her to do a b job instead of an a job.freadman discounted that statement and did not discuss the matter with him further.
within approximately six months after her return to work,freadman received two salary increases in the amounts of and,for a total salary of.she received these raises at the election of smith,her supervisor.in february,smith gave freadman a rating of,the highest possible performance rating,in her review.this rating was higher than the rating freadman had received before the onset of her illness.freadman was also selected in to participate in a program for the development of,employees.smith had nominated her for the program.
in march,one of freadman subordinates left metropolitan.freadman spoke to smith about replacing this employee,noting that the subordinate was her top performer.freadman explained that she was already working nights and weekends on edb,and she expressed her belief that she would not be able to keep the project on track without impairing her health,unless she could replace the departed employee.although there was a hiring freeze,smith arranged for freadman to hire a replacement.freadman hired someone to fill the position,and that employee worked for freadman through june.
in may,metropolitan ceo,catherine rein,asked freadman to give a presentation on edb to the officers strategic planning group on june.freadman was under the supervision of cawley,smith superior,for this project,and cawley had authority to make changes in her presentation.in an dated may,freadman asked cawley for his views on the presentation.
freadman ulcerative colitis became active again in june.this led to an important conversation,the significance of which is at issue in this appeal.freadman stated that on june,she advised smith that she was working too hard,and that she needed to take some time off because she was starting not to feel well.freadman also told smith that some of her symptoms may be returning.according to freadman,smith responded by saying,just get through the presentation on june.take your time off after.keep it up.you doing great.everything is going excellent.
it is undisputed that freadman was not any more explicit than the words quoted.she did not explicitly request a postponement of the june presentation,which the ceo of the company had requested.she did not explicitly say that she wanted time off before the june presentation.she did not explicitly state that her ulcerative colitis had returned and that she needed to be accommodated immediately.
further,it is undisputed that when smith expressed confidence in her and suggested she take time off after the presentation,she did not say to him that she needed time off before the presentation.nor did she raise the topic again with smith or anyone else.nor was there any physical manifestation obvious to others that freadman should not have been working between june and june.
after this litigation started,in an answer to an interrogatory,freadman explained that she believed that she could not take any time off as a result of this meeting with smith because she would be viewed as a complainer and a liability.she alleges that she feared punishment and retaliation.she did not,however,raise these concerns with anyone at the company at any time.
on june,cawley stopped by freadman cubicle to look at freadman work on the june presentation on edb.freadman does not allege that her illness impaired her ability to prepare for this meeting,or that it affected her ability to request an accommodation on june.during the june meeting,cawley was critical of the slides freadman had prepared and told her to shorten the presentation.cawley was concerned about making good use of the officers time and wanted to leave half an hour for the officers to talk about their products in light of the presentation.freadman asked cawley what she should remove from the presentation.cawley responded that it was her job to decide which slides to cut smith,who was present at this meeting,testified that cawley had suggested to freadman that the presentation had too many slides,that the individual slides were too busy,and that freadman needed to shorten the presentation and simplify the slides.lyndalu pieranunzi,a metropolitan employee subordinate to freadman who was present throughout the meeting,confirmed that there had been a discussion about shortening the presentation and streamlining the content.pieranunzi also testified that there was tension between freadman and cawley during the meeting.
after the meeting with freadman,cawley reiterated to smith that freadman presentation was too busy and contained too many slides.later that night,freadman telephoned smith,who advised her to shorten the presentation and clean up the slides,as cawley had suggested.
on june,freadman gave her presentation to the officers strategic planning group.freadman had the officers participate in breakout sessions,and the presentation was longer than cawley wanted.due to time constraints,cawley intervened and ended the breakout sessions early.freadman noted that cawley was upset when he shortened the presentation.smith,who attended the presentation,remembered the introduction going longer than he had expected it would,based on the instructions cawley had given freadman.pieranunzi,who assisted freadman on the day of the presentation,testified that they ran out of time.
metropolitan ceo,rein,testified that she was surprised that freadman used breakout sessions at the strategic planning meeting.shortly after the presentation,cawley explained to rein that he had instructed freadman in advance of the presentation not to hold breakout sessions.
on the next business day,june,freadman went into the office.smith stopped by her cubicle that day and said,i thought you were going to take some time off.freadman responded that she was going to take the rest of the week off,and that she would use some personal days as she was not feeling well.smith agreed to this plan.freadman worked at home for the remainder of that week.
on june,cawley told smith that he could not rely upon freadman to do what he told her to do at a high profile environment,that he did want her to be the project manager on something that would put her in that position,and that she should be rotated into another position.smith recommended freadman for a vacant position in the desktop life cycle management program,and cawley accepted this recommendation.
after june,cawley twice spoke with metropolitan vice president of human resources about rotating freadman into a new position.cawley explained that freadman had ignored his instructions to alter her presentation and remove breakout sessions from the agenda.
freadman worked from home until june,an extra week beyond the period upon which she and smith had agreed.on june,freadman advised her administrative assistant that she would again work from home that day,due to her illness.later that day,smith called freadman and told her she needed to come into the office.freadman responded that she was still feeling sick,and she asked if she could come in the next day.according to freadman,smith then said,no,you have to come in the office today.you have two choices.you go out on disability or you come in the office.there changes in the department that affect you.
freadman went into the office on june and met with smith.smith advised her that her job function was being rotated,and that she would now be working on the desktop life cycle management program under richard sitkus.freadman would now be reporting to joann kraemer,a manager two levels below smith.also,her new position was in a technical,not a management,area.freadman met with sitkus,the head of her new project,and he informed her that he was moving her cubicle closer to him so that everyone on the team could be together.freadman remained at work for the rest of the day,and then took personal time off the next two days.she was hospitalized on june,and was in and out of the hospital for approximately ninety days for treatment of her ulcerative colitis.freadman never returned to her new position.
freadman brought suit in december against metropolitan under the ada and under state law.she alleged that she had been discriminated against on account of her disability in july when she was assigned to the edb project,as well as in june when she was assigned to the desktop life cycle management program.freadman also claimed that metropolitan failed to provide reasonable accommodations around the time of her medical leave in and during the recurrence of her illness in june.further,she alleged that metropolitan retaliated against her for requesting accommodations.freadman also brought several claims against metropolitan for discrimination in violation of state law.see rhode island fair employment practices act fepa,laws to rhode island civil rights of individuals with handicaps act ricriha,id.to.she sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as compensatory and punitive damages,alleging that metropolitan conduct caused her to suffer great physical injury and pain of body,emotional distress,humiliation,indignity,and economic losses.
after discovery,metropolitan moved for summary judgment,arguing that freadman had failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment,failure to accommodate,or retaliation.metropolitan argued,inter alia,that freadman june,and june,conversations with smith did not constitute requests for reasonable accommodations,that there was no causal connection between freadman disability and the alleged adverse employment action,and that in any event freadman had failed to rebut metropolitan evidence that the change in her duties was motivated by legitimate business reasons.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that metropolitan motion for summary judgment be granted.on plaintiff disparate treatment claims,the magistrate judge assumed that freadman would be able to show that she suffered from a disability within the meaning of the ada and that she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation.the magistrate judge also assumed,without deciding,that the change in plaintiff duties in june constituted a materially adverse employment action the magistrate judge found,however,that freadman had failed to present any evidence which would enable a rational jury to find that the reassignment of her duties in june was based,either in whole or in part,on her alleged disability.further,the magistrate judge stated that a rational jury would not have been able to find that metropolitan explanation for the change in freadman duties in june was a pretext for disability discrimination.on plaintiff reasonable accommodation claims,the magistrate judge again assumed that freadman would be able to demonstrate that she was disabled and that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation.the magistrate judge concluded,however,that freadman had not met her burden of showing that metropolitan,despite knowing of plaintiff disability,failed to reasonably accommodate it in particular,he faulted plaintiff for not making sufficiently direct and specific requests for accommodations in june finally,on plaintiff retaliation claims,the magistrate judge held that the change in freadman duties in june had not been ordered in retaliation for any protected activity under the ada 
freadman objected to the magistrate judge conclusions regarding her disparate treatment,failure to accommodate,and retaliation claims,but only with respect to events occurring in june.
the district court granted metropolitan motion for summary judgment.the court agreed with the magistrate judge that freadman had failed to show causation on her prima facie case of disparate treatment.freadman,wl,at.the court also held that freadman had failed on june to articulate a request that was linked to her disability or that was specific enough to communicate a request for immediate leave.id.at.it further held that freadman request on june to come into work the next day also was insufficiently linked to her disability.id.at.finally,the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that freadman retaliation claims must fail because her requests did not constitute protected activity.id.at.
freadman appeals from the grant of summary judgment.

ada disparate treatment claim 
the ada prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.
we apply here the framework articulated by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir dichner liberty travel,cir.if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for its employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason.tobin liberty mut.ins,cir.if the defendant offers a legitimate,reason,the initial inference of discrimination evaporates,mesnick,cir,and the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to proffer evidence to establish that the defendant justification is mere pretext,cloaking discriminatory animus,tobin,at.the employer burden of articulating a reason is only a burden of production,not a burden of persuasion the burden of proving unlawful discrimination rests with the plaintiff at all times.reeves sanderson plumbing,d dichner,at.
freadman argues that metropolitan violated the ada by removing her from the edb project on june.on appeal,she asserts that the district court erred in holding that she did not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she failed to show causation.we bypass the prima facie case issue because it is clear that plaintiff has not mustered enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that metropolitan stated reason for her job rotation was pretextual.see fennell first step designs,cir on summary judgment,the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated,and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the framework,focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to pretext and discriminatory animus.
metropolitan says it removed freadman from the edb project because of her behavior during her june meeting with cawley,her unsatisfactory presentation to the officers strategic planning group,and cawley resulting loss of confidence in freadman.it is undisputed that at the june meeting,cawley expressed concern over the length of freadman presentation for june and told her that he wanted it shortened.it is also undisputed that cawley,after the presentation,concluded that freadman had not shortened the presentation enough.freadman herself concedes that cawley was upset when he ended the june presentation early because of its length.further,it is undisputed that cawley told ceo rein he had instructed freadman in advance of the presentation not to use breakout sessions,and that rein was surprised that freadman had done so.there is no evidence that the statement to rein was motivated by discrimination.it is also undisputed that after the presentation,cawley told smith and the vice president of human resources that a new position needed to be found for freadman because she had ignored his instructions.whether or not freadman had explicitly been told to remove the breakout sessions,there is no evidence that cawley did not genuinely believe that freadman had violated his instructions,or that his belief was motivated by discrimination based on this evidence,it is clear that defendant met its burden of articulating a legitimate,reason for freadman job rotation.
plaintiff argues that metropolitan explanation was pretext.she first points to the temporal relationship between her june requests and her job rotation.freadman cites oliver digital equipment,cir,for the proposition that the occurrence of an adverse employment action soon after an employee engages in a protected activity is indirect proof of a causal connection between the adverse employment action and the activity.id.at.
timing may bear on the question of causation in a retaliation claim,but we have also warned that a narrow focus on timing may ignore the larger sequence of events and also the larger truth.soileau guilford of me,cir.here,the larger sequence of events shows that the company had accommodated freadman requests concerning her ulcerative colitis.after her return from medical leave,she was allowed to work for several weeks,even though such work was not normally available for managers.she also received two salary increases shortly after returning to metropolitan,and in she was selected to participate in a program for rising stars at the company.moreover,freadman was allowed to hire a replacement when one of her subordinates left metropolitan,even though there was a hiring freeze in effect.also,the company had given her a performance rating in early that was higher than the rating she earned before the onset of her illness.
further,the timing between the june request for time off and the june job rotation does not support a finding of pretext.there is uncontradicted evidence that the motivation for the change in freadman responsibilities lay with cawley interactions with freadman on june and june and his resulting inability to trust her in a position.as for the june request to work from home,this request can not support a finding of pretext because it occurred after the decision to remove freadman from the edb project had been made.
the record as a whole demonstrates that the decision to move freadman into a new position was not causally linked either to her disability or to her june conversations with smith.see dep t of justice,cir finding that temporal proximity was sufficient to make out a prima facie case,but affirming dismissal of claim because plaintiff had failed to demonstrate pretext wright compusa,cir c hronological proximity does not by itself establish causality soileau,at acknowledging that discharge occurred immediately after request for accommodation,but concluding that t he larger picture undercuts any claim of causation.
freadman also attempts to argue that metropolitan reasons for removing her from the edb project are pretextual because cawley failed to follow metropolitan disciplinary is,he did not counsel her about the purported misconduct that led to her rotation.there is no evidence that if there was a violation of the discipline policy it was motivated by discrimination.indeed,the claim that there was a violation is undercut by the fact that metropolitan policy does not require counseling for extreme cases such as insubordination.given his dissatisfaction with freadman presentation and his lack of confidence in her ability to follow his instructions,cawley reasonably determined that freadman behavior qualified as an extreme case,and he was thus under no obligation to counsel freadman regarding her actions or her reassignment.the decision to rotate freadman into another position without providing counseling was within the bounds of metropolitan disciplinary policy and raise d no inference of pretext.colburn parker portland,cir.there was nothing idiosyncratic or questionable about the employer decision.gray new eng,cir quoting loeb textron,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
freadman disparate treatment claim fails as a matter of law.see ingram,at noting that summary judgment can not be avoided by relying on improbable inferences or conclusory allegations.
ada reasonable accommodation claims 
on appeal,freadman claims that metropolitan failed to accommodate her disability on two,before her presentation to the officers group,when she requested time off,and june,when she asked to work at home for an additional day 
the definition of discrimination under the ada includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless the covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the entity business.b a see also higgins,at.in order to survive a motion for summary judgment on a reasonable accommodation claim,the plaintiff must produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada,he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation,and the defendant,despite knowing of the plaintiff disability,did not reasonably accommodate it.rocafort ibm,cir.
june request 
freadman alleges that metropolitan knew of her disability yet failed to reasonably accommodate it after she told smith that she needed to take some time off because she was starting not to feel well and that some of her symptoms may be returning.
the ada imposes liability for an employer failure to accommodate known physical or mental limitations of an employee.b a emphasis added.ordinarily,the employer duty to accommodate is triggered by a request from the employee.reed lepage bakeries,cir see also lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law ed perritt,americans with disabilities act handbook,at ed.that is because an employee disability and concomitant need for accommodation are often not known to the employer.reed,at.thus,the plaintiff has the burden of showing that she sufficiently requested the accommodation in question.id.at
