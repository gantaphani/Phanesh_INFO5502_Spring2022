appellants paul cameron,paul ferris,paul gleason,and kenneth rosenthal are former sales representatives in the premise sales unit of appellee idearc media corporation idearc.each was discharged in july.idearc says they were let go for poor performance the employees allege that the terminations were motivated by age discrimination and a desire to negate pension benefits,and they also advance a retaliation claim.the district court rejected all of their claims.
the lawsuit revolves around idearc minimum standards plan msp included in its collective bargaining agreement the cba with local of the communications workers of america the union.the cba terms governed the employment relationship between appellants and the company from june,to june.after the cba expired,no cba was in effect until december,when idearc and the union agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement the cba.
the cba msp authorized idearc to terminate employees as specified by the plan.employees were divided into three channels premise sales,senior telephone sales,and telephone sales which were subdivided into seven peer groups.employees in each peer group were ranked within periods by percent net gain which was calculated by comparing a salesperson revenues against the revenue produced by his accounts in the previous year.until january,the bottom percentile of each peer group in any semester failed that semester unless the employee met an alternative net gain objective.cba.
idearc was permitted to terminate employees failing out of consecutive semesters with the caveat that no more than percent of a peer group could be terminated in any given semester.cba,d.the cba also provided for appeals of terminations under the msp to a joint performance plan review board.id.at.in substance,the msp aimed to cull those sales representatives who were weaker performers but only if they were regularly at the bottom of the tally and also below the company net gain objective target.
the msp was designed to identify percent of employees for termination per year.the cba required idearc and the union to revise the failing percentile originally percent in january and so as to better achieve the middle of the percent target range if the number of employees qualified for termination fell outside the percent range.cba.as of january,only one employee had been terminated under the msp.idearc then raised the failing figure to the percentile and also lowered the alternative net gain objective target,making the latter figure much more important but still subject to the percent limit on terminations within a single peer group 
appellants in this case each qualified for termination under the msp after failing the first semester of as well as the necessary number of prior semesters and were terminated in july.each plaintiff was over years old at the time of termination,and each had between and years of service at idearc.rosenthal and gleason were about two years away from qualifying for service pensions that respectively vested after and years of service ferris was about years from his service pension and cameron was years from his service pension and less than years from his deferred vested pension.
appellants brought the present lawsuit against idearc in december.without denying that they had failed under the msp,they alleged that they were fired not because of the msp but because of their age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,and in order to deprive them of pension benefits,in violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.appellants also allege idearc later retaliated against them for filing this suit,also in violation of erisa,by refusing to reinstate them as required by the cba 
on summary judgment,the district court assumed arguendo that appellants could establish a prima facie case for their discrimination theories.but,idearc having proffered a explanation for the terminations,the court found that appellants had not provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that idearc reason was pretextual neither was there sufficient evidence of retaliation for filing this suit.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment to the defendants.
in the alternative,the district court considered appellants claims barred by section of the lmra,primarily because the court found that the discrimination claims,if they went forward,depended on interpreting the cba thus arguably being subject to the cba dispute resolution provisions.lingle norge div.of magic chef.because we affirm on the ground that appellants claims failed to present a jury issue on the charges of discrimination or retaliation,the question of lmra preemption need not be pursued.
the adea protects employees against,among other things,discriminatory discharge based on age.a.absent direct evidence of discrimination of which there is just about none here adea claims are evaluated under the familiar standard of mcdonnell douglas green.vélez thermo king de puerto rico,cir.a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case,which is fairly easy to do,by showing 
that he or she was at least years old at the time of discharge 
that he or she was qualified for the position but was nevertheless fired and 
that the employer subsequently filled the position.
the employer must then produce a legitimate reason for termination and,if this is done,the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defendant proffered reasons were a pretext for discrimination.vélez,at.this brings the plaintiff back to having to prove his or her case but with the added,often critical,advantage to the employee of having pinned down the defendant purported justification.
section of erisa prohibits inter alia discharge for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of rights under an employee benefit plan.again the mcdonnell douglas framework is used when direct evidence of discrimination is lacking.kouvchinov parametric tech,cir.a plaintiff must establish a prima facie he was prospectively entitled to erisa benefits,was qualified for his position,and was discharged under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination.lehman prudential ins.of,cir.
on summary judgment,the district court assumed without deciding that the appellants could establish a prima facie case of age discrimination and interference with prospective pension rights but,given idearc explanation for termination,the court found that appellants had not provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude idearc reason for the discharges poor performance under the msp was pretextual and that age or pension related concerns were the actual reason for the discharges.
whatever one thinks of eliminating weaker performing sales personnel in middle age or near to their pensions,poor performance in a job is a conventional business motive and not age discrimination or purposeful interference under erisa.appellants do not deny that they were subject to discharge under the msp.instead,they argue that the msp percentile figure was raised to the percentile level without a mathematical basis in january and left unchanged in january,in alleged violation of the cba,and that idearc knew the revised msp would capture too many employees for termination.
reducing the safe harbor from the top percent of employees ranked by performance to the top percent which was the effect of the january change was amply explained not by age discrimination but by experience showing that the earlier safe harbor was so large that it prevented the msp from capturing all but a few employees far from the removal target.in deposition testimony below,the union conceded that idearc acted with legal authority under the cba in raising the msp standards as it did.
appellants argue,relying in part on the views of their expert,that the company and union both misunderstood what the cba required to justify the new percent figure but this is beside the point the question here is not the cba meaning but the appellants need to show that idearc had fired them because of their age or to target their pension rights merely to show that the p
