this appeal arises out of a lawsuit brought by an organization that calls itself students for fair admissions,sffa challenging harvard college consideration of race in its undergraduate admissions decisions.an opposing group of current and prospective harvard students students who claim to be benefited by the school current practice sought to intervene,over the objection of both parties,in order to advocate vigorously for the defeat of sffa claims.the district court denied students motion to intervene,instead granting students leave to file amicus briefs.students for fair admissions,president fellows of harvard.students now appeal,arguing that the district court either committed an error of law or abused its discretion in denying their motion to intervene.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court ruling.
background 
the underlying lawsuit in which students seek to intervene commenced on november,when sffa filed a complaint with the district court alleging that harvard undergraduate admissions policy is racially and ethnically discriminatory,in violation of title vi of the civil rights act of and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.harvard admits,indeed proclaims,that it does consider an applicant race,among many other factors,in deciding whether to admit the applicant.harvard says that it considers race in order to increase student body diversity,including racial diversity.it denies that this consideration is unlawful.
during the early stages of discovery,students filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure a and b,seeking to intervene in this lawsuit either by right or by permission of the court.the district court denied the motion to intervene,holding that although students motion was timely,students failed to satisfy the remaining requirements of rule a and b.students do not appeal the denial of their motion for permissive intervention under rule b.rather,they focus this appeal on the district court denial of their motion to intervene by right under rule a.
ii.analysis 
federal rule of civil procedure a states 
on timely motion,the court must permit anyone to intervene who claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action,and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant ability to protect its interest,unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.
successful intervention by right under this rule requires intervenors to demonstrate that their motion is timely they have an interest related to the property or transaction that forms the foundation of the ongoing action the disposition of the action threatens to impair or impede their ability to protect their interest and no existing party adequately represents their interest.ungar arafat,cir.failure to satisfy any one of the four requirements defeats intervention by right.id.at.
applying these requirements calls for discretion in making a series of judgment calls a balancing of factors that arise in highly idiosyncratic factual settings.id.while the district court discretion in the context of intervention by right is somewhat more circumscribed than in the context of intervention generally,negrón almeda santiago,cir,we will only reverse i f the district court either fails to follow the general recipe provided in rule a or reaches a plainly incorrect decision.ungar,at.
rather than reviewing each challenge to the district court opinion,we train our analysis on the district court finding that students have failed to show that no existing part y adequately represent s students interest.a.in conducting this analysis,we begin with a recognition that students burden of establishing inadequate representation should be treated as minimal and can be satisfied by showing that representation of the interest may be inadequate.trbovich united mine workers of,d emphasis added.on the other hand,we require putative intervenors to produce something more than speculation as to the purported inadequacy of representation.moosehead sanitary dist.phillips,cir.
in trying to sustain even this minimal burden,students buckle at the outset.the interests they claim increasing their chances of gaining admission being educated among a critical mass of students who can relate to their racial identities lead them to adopt harvard goals of defend ing harvard right to consider race and defeat ing sffa request for declaratory judgment.given such a congruence in goals,this court presumes adequate representation.fernández,kellogg usa,cir daggett comm on governmental ethics election practices,cir moosehead,at.adding heft to that presumption in this case are the facts that harvard has the resources necessary to litigate the case,that it has retained counsel of whom students offer no criticism,and that it has publicly characterized the lawsuit through its highest officials as a threat to its most fundamental values.
with that factually reinforced presumption in mind,we next consider students specific arguments for why we should nevertheless find as a matter of law that students raise sufficient doubt about the adequacy of harvard representation in pursuing the shared goal of preserving harvard ability to consider an applicant race in its admissions decisions.fernández,at quoting trbovich,at.we undertake that consideration in light of the issues at stake in the particular litigation,pub.serv.of patch,cir,as they reveal themselves based on a commonsense view of the overall litigation.id.at citing united states hooker chems.plastics,cir.
students point to what they claim is harvard unwillingness to recognize the need for admissions policies to balance the adverse effect of other admissions criteria and practices like the legacy policy,referring to harvard practice of giving some admissions preference to certain relatives of alumni.students claim that harvard will not discuss the effects of those policies,but that they will.
to establish that a party representation of the intervenor interest will be per se inadequate because the party might not make a particular argument,we ask whether pursuit of the shared goal obviously calls for the argument to be made.see daggett,at see also maine,fish wildlife serv,cir.it is by no means obvious to us that the goal of defeating sffa claims calls for chronicling and highlighting the manner in which harvard other voluntary admissions practices supposedly decrease diversity.to the contrary,such an undertaking would seem to cut against harvard essential position that admissions practices are necessary to increase diversity.see fisher of at austin,d stating that a university consideration of an applicant race is permissible,provided that it is necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.this may well be why the district court reasoned that sffa was likely to try to show precisely what students say they would seek to show about the effect of legacy preferences students for fair admissions,at.in this respect,students intervention in the action would seem more likely to hinder rather than to help the pursuit of the very goal they share with harvard.
in a slightly different variation on this theme,students argue that they will be more zealous than harvard because harvard balancing of competing priorities may pose a settlement risk if harvard prioritizes practices,like the legacy policy,that encourage donors and continued financial support of the institution and it perceives them to be at risk in this litigation,then it might modify or abandon its policies in order to settle.exactly how any relief ordered by the court on sffa complaint might require harvard to terminate practices like the legacy policy,students do not explain.their argument also assumes that intervention would somehow enable students to limit harvard discretion in deciding whether to settle or fight.yet students point to no basis for such an assumption.to the contrary,students concede that they lack any legal basis for requiring harvard to maintain its current practices.therefore,if students theory that putting legacy practices under scrutiny during the litigation might c
