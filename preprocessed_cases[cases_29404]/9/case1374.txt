this appeal concerns the availability of a qualified immunity defense for five administrators at the new york maritime college college who discharged a teacher for leading a classroom word association exercise.the administrators concluded that the teacher had acted unprofessionally when he failed to terminate the exercise in which students,some standing on chairs,shouted out vulgar,sexually explicit terms,many of which the teacher wrote down,in words or initials,on a blackboard.the administrators appeal from the september,order of the district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,district judge denying their motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.without deciding whether the discharge of the plaintiff,professor edward vega,might have entitled him to any relief from the college that would not encounter eleventh amendment obstacles we conclude that qualified immunity shields the administrators from any obligation to pay vega any money damages.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to dismiss.
background 
the college is a institution that aims to prepare its as the college calls them,cadets for service as engineers or officers in various branches of the armed services.it requires its students to demonstrate r espect for others and regimental discipline at all times.edward vega began teaching at the college in august.he was a professor,and could be terminated at will.
in the summer of,vega taught a composition course at the college summer institute,a program designed for who need remedial courses prior to matriculation.the students were male and female,aged and.on july,vega conducted a exercise called clustering,in which students were invited to select a topic,then call out words related to the topic,and finally group related words together into clusters.according to vega,the exercise is intended to help students reduce the use of repetitive words in essays.
the students selected sex as the topic for the clustering exercise.vega understood the topic to be sex and relationships.vega then invited the students to call out words or phrases related to the topic,and he wrote at least many of their responses on the blackboard.the first words called out were,as vega described them,very safe words,such as marriage,children,and wedding ring.as the exercise continued,the words called out included penis,vagina,fellatio,and cunnilingus.toward the end of the exercise,with all but one of the students yelling and two standing on chairs,the following words and phrases were called out cluster fuck,slamhole,bearded clam,fist fucking,studded rubbers,your sic so hard,and eating girls out.
vega wrote many of the words on the blackboard,but said that he used initials for some of the words that admiral floyd miller president of maritime college found to be disgusting examples of sexual harassment,and some i did even abbreviate.at no point in the session did vega seek to curtail the vulgarity of what the students were yelling,or terminate the exercise.he contends that after the exercise he cautioned the students that such terms would alienate their readers and should not be used at all or used rarely and then only where it was essential to enlighten and persuade the reader.complaint.
none of the students or their parents ever complained about the exercise.it came to the attention of the college administrators in the course of investigating a complaint by a student on another matter.
when the college administrators became aware of the clustering exercise,admiral miller asked howard english,of academic affairs,to meet with vega.english and dean of admissions peter cooney confronted vega on august.vega handed english copies of his lesson plans,which included many provocative topics english explained that he and miller found the clustering exercise inappropriate,and that it opened the door to bad publicity and possible sexual harassment complaints.english told vega that they would not offer him reappointment for the upcoming school year.
english officially terminated vega contract by correspondence dated august.english drafted a memorandum to the file that explained vega firing,attributing it to vega reliance on sex as a theme and use of sexually explicit vocabulary in the clustering exercise.english claims that he also wrote a very brief memo without an explanation for the firing for vega personnel file 
miller met with vega on august to review the decision.miller called vega conduct vile,vulgar,pornographic,and irresponsible,and told vega that it could be considered sexual harassment,and could create liability for the college.miller ratified english termination of vega.both english and miller acknowledge that the sole reason they decided to fire vega was because of his conduct in the july,clustering exercise.
on august,vega filed a suit in the district court,alleging numerous causes of action against several administrators and various school entities.over the next several months,judge cote dismissed the complaint in its entirety against many of the defendants,and dismissed some of the claims against the remaining defendants.however,she denied motions to dismiss three of the claims against five of the defendants,appellants on this appeal.they are admiral miller,english,dean cooney,james desimone,commandant of cadets,and carolyn jones,director of the summer institute.
the remaining claims are all brought under.they allege that the decision not to reappoint vega violated his first amendment right to academic freedom the academic freedom claim,was made pursuant to an unconstitutionally vague or overbroad sexual harassment policy the sexual harassment policy claim,and infringed his fourteenth amendment due process right to a hearing prior to governmental adverse employment action that sullies his good name and reputation the claim.
the defendants first filed a motion to dismiss on november,arguing,among other things,that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that the law concerning vega claims was not clearly established in.judge cote denied this motion,ruling that the law as to both the academic freedom claim and the claim was clearly established in,and that the question of whether the defendants sexual harassment policy was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad was a fact intensive one that can not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.vega state university of new york board of trustees,d.the defendants did not appeal this decision.
after the close of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff claims and that they were protected against claims for money damages by qualified immunity.on,judge cote denied the summary judgment motion from the bench.on the academic freedom claim,she ruled that an issue of fact remained as to the relationship between clustering and vega educational objective and as to the context and manner of the classroom exercise.on the sexual harassment policy claim,she ruled that there was a factual issue as to whether vega was terminated pursuant to the policy,that she could not rule as a matter of law that the policy was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad,and that qualified immunity was not available on this claim because cases such as keyishian board of regents,d,and dube state university of new york,cir,clearly establish vega right to be free from enforcement of a college policy that constitutes on its face or as applied a vague or overbroad restriction on classroom speech.she distinguished a ninth circuit case that had afforded qualified immunity to defendants in similar circumstances,cohen san bernardino valley college,cir,because the policy in that case was different and narrower than the one at issue here.judge cote also found fact questions as to vega claim whether stigmatizing statements were made in the course of vega termination and whether the statements were publicized.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
acknowledging that the denial of a qualified immunity defense is subject to an interlocutory appeal when the appeal can be decided as a matter of law,see mitchell forsyth,d,vega nonetheless contends that the defendants are barred from filing the present appeal from the september ruling denying their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity because they did not appeal the september ruling denying their earlier rule b motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity.vega maintains that the pending appeal,if permitted,would amount to an around the time requirement in rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,since a defendant who was late in appealing from a rule b denial could theoretically obtain a new clock simply by filing another motion for qualified immunity.
there are three possible approaches to the availability of an interlocutory appeal from a trial court second denial of a motion asserting an immunity defense a defendant could be permitted to appeal the second denial a only if he did not appeal the first denial,b only if he did appeal the first denial,or c regardless of whether he appealed the first denial.
if the motion that results in the second denial is virtually a reprise of the motion that was denied the first time,there is a substantial argument for dismissing the appeal of the second motion as an evasion of the appellate timeliness requirement.see armstrong texas state board of barber examiners,cir appeal from denial of second qualified immunity motion dismissed where the two motions are substantially the same taylor carter,cir same.
however,the supreme court has ruled that an appeal will lie from a rejection of qualified immunity on a motion for summary judgment,notwithstanding a previous unsuccessful appeal from a rejection of the defense on a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage.behrens pelletier,d.the court rejected the arguments that one judiciously timed at the motion to dismiss stage or at summary sufficient and that the availability of multiple appeals will simply delay the proceedings.the court reasoned that multiple appeals will often be necessary due to the different posture of the case at the pleading stage and at summary judgment,and that if necessary,i t is well within the supervisory powers of the courts of appeals to establish summary procedures and calendars to weed out frivolous claims.id.at.
behrens makes clear that an appeal is available from denials of an immunity defense at both the pleading and summary judgment stages,and nothing in that decision suggests that a defendant is required to appeal an initial denial at the pleading stage in order to appeal a subsequent denial on summary judgment.such an approach would precipitate many needless appeals.see grant city of pittsburgh,cir declining to adopt rule that would dramatically increase the number of interlocutory appeals at the dismissal stage.moreover,even the dissenters in behrens,who favored permitting only one appeal,noted that a defendant could decline to appeal from a denial of their defense at the pleading stage and appeal the subsequent denial at the summary judgment stage.see behrens,at.breyer,with whom stevens,joins,dissenting.
in the pending case,even though there is some overlap between the contentions made in the defendants first and second assertions of the qualified immunity defense,the second motion differs from the first in that it relies on matters developed during discovery.the denial of that motion is appealable,notwithstanding the absence of an appeal at the pleading stage.see grant,at.
ii.qualified immunity 
government officials are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.wilson layne,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.the qualified immunity defense requires consideration of the clarity of the law establishing the right allegedly violated and whether a reasonable person,acting under the circumstances then confronting a defendant,would have understood that the applicable law was being violated.these inquiries combine to form a standard that the supreme court has called objective legal reasonableness,behrens,at.harlow,at,that is,whether it was objectively reasonable for a defendant to think that the challenged conduct did not violate the plaintiff clearly established rights.see anderson creighton,d.we apply this standard to each of vega claims,viewing the evidence at this stage from the standpoint of the plaintiff.see salim proulx,cir.
although vega contends that there are numerous factual issues that preclude summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity,we adjudicate this appeal on the basis of the facts that are either admitted by vega,or presented by the defendants in sworn affidavits or depositions and not contested by any opposing affidavit.the critical undisputed facts are the words and phrases called out by the students during the clustering exercise that vega invited and permitted to continue 
academic freedom claim 
it has been clear long before,when the defendants termination of vega occurred,that neither teachers nor students shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines independent community school district,d.although cases had outlined some guideposts concerning the free speech rights of a college professor to express his views in a classroom,see dube state university of new york,cir,and the free speech rights of students to express their views,see hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d,the available authorities did not settle with certainty the extent to which a college professor could be disciplined for permitting student speech in a classroom to exceed reasonable bounds of discourse.the authority of educational administrators to take actions reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,id.at,leaves room for uncertainty.two years after the action challenged in this case,the ninth circuit observed that n either the supreme court nor this circuit has determined what scope of first amendment protection is to be given a public college professor classroom speech.cohen,at.
in the pending case,a college teacher has been disciplined for permitting a classroom exercise,initiated for legitimate pedagogical purposes,to continue to the point and beyond where students are calling out a series of vulgar,sexually explicit words and phrases,many of which the professor writes on the blackboard,either in words or with initials.we must determine whether,in light of law,college administrators could reasonably believe that they were not violating the teacher first amendment rights by disciplining him for such conduct.
not surprisingly,no decision before and none since had clearly established that dismissal for conduct of the sort that vega undisputedly took violated a teacher first amendment rights.although qualified immunity is not available simply because the precise conduct at issue has not been previously held unlawful,see anderson,at,the available precedents that might usefully have guided the defendants leave the unlawfulness of their action at least unclear.dube,much relied on by the plaintiff,upheld the right of a teacher,in a course on racism,to express the view that zionism was a form of racism.see dube,at.protection was accorded despite the offensiveness of the teacher viewpoint to some students and some members of the community.dube serves as a caution to governmental administrators not to discipline a college teacher for expressing controversial,even offensive,views lest a pall of orthodoxy inhibit the free exchange of ideas in the classroom.see keyishian,at.vega toleration of the students shouted vulgarities was far removed from dube expression of his political views.
somewhat more pertinent is the decision of the first circuit in keefe geanakos,cir.a teacher was protected in assigning to a high school senior english class a scholarly article that used the word and explained its origin.see id.at.the teacher was careful to offer an alternate assignment to any student who found the assigned material offensive.see id.at.keefe makes clear that a teacher may not be disciplined simply because a vulgar word is contained and discussed in assigned materials,at least for students of suitable age.a contrary decision would have left teachers vulnerable to discipline for assigning many well regarded literary works.however,the vulgarities vega permitted to be called out in his classroom were not part of an etymological exploration,nor was the scene in which all of the students but one were yelling their contributions,with two standing on chairs,an academic discussion.
particularly pertinent is our circuit decision in silano sag harbor union free school district board,cir,decided the same year as the episode at issue here a teacher was denied protection because of the materials he included in a mathematics class for the purpose of illustrating what he called the persistence of vision phenomenon.see id.at.of the six mm.film clips he distributed to his students,one portrayed two woman naked above the waist.see id.we ruled that the school officials action in barring the teacher from the classroom was reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.id.at.we pointed out that d epictions of women were entirely unnecessary to illustrate th e scientific phenomenon that the teacher wished to explain.id.although vega students were high school graduates in a program and thus two years beyond those in sag harbor,the students shouting of vulgarities was as unnecessary to his clustering exercise as silano film clip was to his explanation of a scientific phenomenon 
since this episode occurred seven years ago and involves a highly unusual set of circumstances,unlikely to be repeated,we see no reason to rule definitively on whether the defendants action was unlawful.for purposes of the pending appeal,we rule only that on the state of the law in,the defendants could reasonably believe that in disciplining vega for not exercising professional judgment to terminate the episode,they were not violating his clearly established first amendment academic freedom rights.even though no students complained,what students will silently endure is not the measure of what a college must tolerate or what administrators may reasonably think that a college need not tolerate.
sexual harassment policy claim 
in considering the sexual harassment policy claim,we encounter an initial difficulty in understanding precisely what vega contends this claim adds to his first amendment academic freedom claim.he maintains,and there is no basis for any dispute,that he was terminated because of his conduct in permitting the clustering exercise to continue vega academic freedom claim asserts that the first amendment prevented the defendants from disciplining him for this conduct,and we have ruled above that,whether or not that claim is valid,the defendants were objectively reasonable in believing that it did not.since the defendants have a qualified immunity defense from damages liability for a first amendment academic freedom violation,it does not matter whether they not only thought that vega conduct exceeded the proper bounds of a teacher classroom conduct but also thought that it violated the college sexual harassment policy.the conduct remains activity for which they may terminate him without incurring damages liability.
this is not a case of dual motivation in which a plaintiff contends that adverse action was taken for an impermissible reason,exercising first amendment rights by providing information to a radio station,and the defendant contends that the action was taken for a different,permissible reason,using obscene gestures to correct students.see healthy city school district board of education doyle,d.in such circumstances,if the evidence shows that the impermissible reason was a motivating factor of the adverse action,the defendant is liable unless it can show that it would have taken the adverse action in the absence of the impermissible reason.id.at.but where,as here,there is only one conduct of the discharged employee that motivates the adverse action,and a defendant has qualified immunity for taking such action,the immunity is not lost even if the defendant thinks that this same conduct also provides an additional reason for the adverse action.to take an extreme example,if a teacher ordered a female student to disrobe in front of a class and was fired because the school administrator reasonably concluded that such conduct was not related to a legitimate pedagogical purpose,the administrator would not lose qualified immunity just because of an additional belief that the teacher conduct also violated the school sexual harassment policy,no matter how impermissibly vague or overbroad that policy was 
even if vega could show that it is relevant that the defendants were partially motivated by the additional belief that his conduct violated the college sexual harassment policy,we are satisfied that it would have been objectively reasonable for them to believe in that enforcing the policy against vega did not deny him any constitutional right in,two years after vega termination,the ninth circuit held qualified immunity available to college administrators for disciplining a tenured professor for violating a sexual harassment policy that violated the first amendment.cohen,at.the legal issues raised in this case are not readily discernable and the appropriate conclusion to each is not so clear that the officials should have known that their actions violated the professor rights.see also dileo greenfield,cir regulation permitting termination of teacher for other due and sufficient cause not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied to teacher who made comments with sexual connotations to students.moreover,in view of the vulgarities that vega permitted to be expressed,no reasonable jury could fail to find that the defendants would have terminated vega solely because they considered his conduct beyond the bounds of proper classroom performance,even if the college had no sexual harassment policy.
vega contends that he was denied a liberty interest without procedural due process,grounding his alleged interest on an allegation that the defendants stigmatized him by making defamatory statements in the course of terminating his employment.the supreme court has made clear that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard are prerequisites to government employment places a person good name,reputation,honor,or integrity at stake.see board of regents of state colleges roth,d.the charges must be made public by the government employer,brandt board of cooperative educational services,cir,the employee must allege that the charges are false,and the alleged defamatory statements must be made in the course of terminating the employment,see paul davis,d 
vega contends that he was stigmatized by both a memo that was placed in his personnel file and by oral statements of some of the defendants.whether or not the alleged stigmatizing statements occurred after vega termination,as the defendants contend,or in the course of termination,as he contends,see saulpaugh monroe community hospital,cir liberty interest implicated only if defamatory statement made in the course of termination of employment,there was no violation of a federally protected right.
as to the memo,it merely reports english meeting with vega on august,at which english asked vega if the resident advisor notes fairly reflected the content of the clustering exercise and vega replied that they did.there is nothing false in the memo.as to the oral statements,vega takes some liberties with the record in recounting them.for example,he contends that desimone and english informed the entire department that professor vega was a pornographer and a sexual harasser.brief for appellee at.the cited record references to english deposition reveal that sexual harassing was used only in a question put to english and not adopted in his answer,and that english accurately referred to the words used in the clustering exercise as pornographic,but did not label vega a pornographer.the only cited remark that appears to be false is admiral miller remark to english that vega had drawn dirty pictures.even if a stigmatization claim could arise from a statement that a plaintiff had put dirty pictures on a blackboard when in fact he had placed dirty words there,there is no evidence that miller remark was conveyed to anyone other than his fellow administrator,english.see white plains towing patterson,cir stating that no court had determined whether a claim could be grounded on a statement communicated only within a police department.the claim fails for lack of evidence.at a minimum,it was objectively reasonable for the defendants to believe that their actions did not violate a clearly established federal right.
conclusion 
we do not decide whether termination of vega employment was an appropriate response to his allowing the classroom exercise to get out of hand,or whether some lesser sanction might have been sufficient.the issue for us is whether,on the undisputed facts of what occurred,the defendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity from his claims against them for money damages for all of the reasons set forth above,the order of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint against the appellants.
i respectfully dissent 
the majority opinion,in my view,overlooks the first amendment prohibition of vague and overbroad restrictions on speech and undermines its protection of academic freedom as clearly established by the supreme court.in finding that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,the majority opinion tells us that a college professor can be fired summarily for engaging in a classroom discussion with students when it reaches a topic that some college administrator either believes is in violation of a policy on sexual harassment,that is,upon examination,overbroad and vague,or deems to be beyond the reasonable bounds of discourse,majority opinion at.today the loser is a college teacher in a conservative academic setting who used an alternative teaching technique with profane effect.in the future,the major losers are likely to be traditionalist and unconventional college teachers,whose method or speech is found offensive by those who usually dominate our institutions of higher learning the first amendment,with its special concern for academic freedom,keyishian bd.of regents of the of the state of,d,must protect all college teachers,especially in the performance of their most important in the classroom.
my colleagues assert that they do not adjudicate the lawfulness of vega discharge because they are ruling only that college administrators,based on the state of the law when the discharge occurred in,are protected by qualified immunity from personal liability for damages.majority opinion at.it is,however,precisely the majority view of the first amendment that serves as the basis for its conclusion that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.although the lawfulness of vega discharge is not specifically decided,the majority opinion does state its interpretation of the law,at least as it was in,and by inference,as it may still be.i dissent because i disagree with the majority interpretation of the law,as it was in,and as it is today.
from the start,the majority opinion fundamentally misapprehends vega two first amendment claims.vega first claim is grounded in the first amendment prohibition of vague and overbroad restrictions on speech.vega claims that he was discharged pursuant to an overbroad and vague college policy on sexual harassment second amended complaint filed june.see vega state of bd.of,d.vega second claim is grounded in the first amendment protection of academic freedom.second amended complaint.see vega state of bd.of,d at.he argues that even if the policy is not void for overbreadth and vagueness,his right to academic freedom independently prevents the college from punishing him for his classroom,more precisely,for permitting certain speech by his students.these two claims are distinct.
because the majority opinion finds that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to vega academic freedom claim and that vega conduct is the basis for which the defendants may terminate vega without incurring damages liability,majority opinion at,it encounter s difficulty in understanding precisely what vega contends the overbreadth and vagueness claim adds to his first amendment academic freedom claim.majority opinion at.for the majority,the inquiry ends once the defendants have shown that they are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions with respect to one claim.it does not matter to the majority whether vega was fired because the defendants thought his conduct exceeded the proper bounds of a teacher classroom conduct or because they thought that it violated the college sexual harassment policy.majority opinion at.in either case,the majority concludes,the defendants could fire vega because vega conduct was not protected by principles of academic freedom rooted in the first amendment.
the majority is incorrect.vega claims that he was fired because school administrators decided that his actions violated the college policy on sexual harassment.thus,a court considering vega lawsuit must determine whether that policy violates the first amendment prohibition of overbroad and vague speech restrictions.in these circumstances,the majority entire discussion on dual motivation is,in my view,misleading.majority opinion at.vega has two independent first amendment claims against the college because the college actions with respect to each of the claims were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law,see ford moore,cir,the district court properly denied the defendants qualified immunity and left open the possibility of a trial to determine issues of fact.
it has long been clearly established law that overbroad and vague policies restricting speech on state university campuses violate the first amendment.keyishian bd.of regents of the of the state of,d see also uwm post,bd.of regents of the of,doe of.in keyishian,a law prohibited the employment in a university of anyone who by word of mouth or writing willfully and deliberately advocates,advises or teaches the doctrine of forceful overthrow of the government.keyishian,at.the supreme court found the law unconstitutional because it was wholly lacking in terms susceptible of objective measurement and had the quality of extraordinary ambiguity such that m en of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.id.at.
vega claims,and the defendants do not dispute,that he was fired pursuant to the college policy on sexual harassment,which vega argues is as overbroad and vague as the restriction in keyishian.second amended complaint.see vega state of bd.of,d.to determine whether a particular policy is overbroad in violation of the first amendment,we must first decide whether it reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d,or protected speech judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick oklahoma,d see united states rahman,cir.
the college policy on sexual harassment at issue here was presented in the january edition of the suny maritime college employee handbook eight months before vega was fired.it is rather brief.here is the full text of that policy 
every employee is entitled to a work environment free from any form of discrimination on the basis of race,creed,color,religion,national origin or sex.sexual harassment is one form of sex discrimination.
sexual harassment is any unwanted verbal or physical sexual advance,sexually explicit derogatory statements,or sexually discriminatory remarks made by someone in the workplace,which is offensive or objectionable to the recipient or which causes the recipient discomfort or humiliation,or which interferes with the recipient job performance.
it may include 
verbal harassment or abuse 
subtle pressure for sexual activities 
unnecessary touching,patting,or pinching 
leering at a person body 
constant brushing against a person body 
demanding sexual favors accompanied by implied or overt threats concerning one job,performance evaluation,promotion.
physical assault 
any employee who believes he or she has been sexually harassed should contact 
the immediate department supervisor 
the director of personnel 
emphasis added.see also majority opinion at.there is no reference to the possible consequences of a violation to the person who has direct authority to apply the policy or to the procedures by which any complaint might be resolved or decided.
by defining sexual harassment to include,in part,sexually explicit derogatory statements or sexually discriminatory remarks,this sweeping policy forbids a broad class of protected speech.even limiting harassment to speech or conduct which is offensive or objectionable to the recipient,or causes the recipient to feel discomfort or humiliation,is inherently vague,dependent for its meaning on the unpredictable and varying sensibilities of different persons.such a definition inevitably outlaws a substantial amount of protected speech.it is clear that under our constitution the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.street new york,d.the college policy proscribes speech based upon the listener subjective feeling of offense,and could thus render as prohibited harassment,in the view of an especially sensitive listener,nearly all speech related to sex.a straightforward application of the policy would allow,for example,the college to punish a student or professor who,in a classroom discussion on the roles of women and men in the military,makes broad generalized statements about the sexes that someone in the class finds discomforting or offensive.this silencing of discussion is especially troubling when it involves teachers in a university setting because when we impose a straight jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities,we imperil the future of our nation.sweezy new hampshire,d plurality opinion.
a statute,regulation,or policy is impermissibly vague when it does not allow a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.grayned rockford,d see marchi board of cooperative educ.servs.of albany,cir,cert.denied,d.whenever a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic first amendment freedoms,it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms.grayned,at.alterations and internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the college policy is impermissibly vague on its face.even if one interprets the policy to avoid reaching sexually discriminatory remarks protected under the first amendment so as to avoid overbreadth,the terms of the policy do not indicate or warn where the boundary between permissible and impermissible speech might be.limiting sexually discriminatory or sexually derogatory remarks to those perceived as offensive,humiliat ing,objectionable,or discomfort ing by another person does not provide any objective definition as to what such remarks might be and who,as a final matter,is to define them.unavoidably,faculty and students alike are left to guess at the policy meaning and differ as to its application.keyishian,at.
indeed,it is unclear whether a complaint must be lodged in order to activate the policy,or whether,as in this case,sanctions can be exacted by the administration on its own initiative without any complaint at all.a vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.grayned,at.the college policy states that sexual harassment grievances may be filed by employees however,it does not state whether,pursuant to the policy,the college may fire summarily a faculty member without being afforded opportunity for some kind of a hearing.bd.of regents roth,d.
because the law prohibiting overbroad and vague policies that restrict speech in a classroom was clearly established at the time of vega discharge,and the college policy on sexual harassment was by its terms both overbroad and vague,i would conclude that it was not objectively reasonable for the college to fire vega pursuant to that policy.any reasonably competent and college official,in so much as setting eyes on such a policy,could have recognized that the policy terms were so sweeping in a context where,unlike a business or industrial setting,hierarchies are blurred and teachers perform their duties under the most general directions and virtually no it would have violated not only vega first amendment rights,but also the college own policies on academic freedom.
the college policy on academic freedom provides in relevant part that faculty members may,without limitation,discuss their own subject in the classroom they may not,however,claim as their right the privilege of discussing in their classroom controversial matter which has no relation to their subject.this college policy substantially tracks the language of the statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure by the american association of university professors aaup,academic freedom and tenure louis joughin,an organization founded to promote and protect academic freedom in higher education see walter metzger,academic freedom in the age of the university prtg.metzger,the preeminent student of the history of academic freedom in the united states,observes to examine the activities and achievements of the aaup since its establishment is to view the main outlines of the problems of academic freedom in the twentieth century.the aaup statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure has been relied upon as persuasive authority by courts to shed light on,and to resolve,a wide range of cases related to academic freedom and tenure.see,mayberry dees,cir quoting from an aaup report deemed an authoritative source on tenure,t he association of american colleges and the aaup were the framers of the statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure,the fundamental document on the subject.jimenez almodovar,cir american court decisions on tenure are consistent with the statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure widely adopted by institutions of higher education and professional organizations of faculty members.browzin catholic of,the statement represent s widely shared norms within the academic community,having achieved acceptance by organizations which represent teachers as well as organizations which represent college administrators and governing boards.see generally gray bd.of higher,city of new york,cir certain aaup policy statements have assisted the courts in the past in resolving a wide range of educational controversies,such as speech by professors.adamian jacobsen,cir.since it was the students who uttered the terms during a concededly legitimate writing exercise in the classroom in,no college administrator in reasonably could have concluded that vega actions violated the college policy on sexual harassment or fell outside the protection of the policy on academic freedom.see wilson layne,d government officials are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.
the majority reliance upon dileo greenfield,cir,majority opinion at,to support the conclusion that the defendants actions were objectively reasonable given the state of the law at the time vega was fired,is misplaced.in that case,we upheld a state statute allowing the discharge of a junior high school teacher for other due and sufficient cause and declined to find that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad dileo,at.we held in dileo that the teacher had engaged in a persistent pattern of neglecting his professional duties and harassing and humiliating students.id.at.we reached this conclusion after observing that the teacher had met with,and been cautioned by,school administrators for his behavior several times before and that he reasonably knew that the behavior was the cause for the discharge.id.moreover,we limited the challenged provisions of the statute by construing its vague terms in light of the restrictions in the remainder of the statute and by concluding that other due and sufficient cause was limited only to conduct relating to a teacher professional duties.id.at.
indeed,on its facts,dileo,a case decided more than two decades before the episode at issue here,should have alerted the defendants in vega case that its actions were likely to violate vega first amendment rights.unlike in dileo,the college administrators here did not meet with vega or caution him prior to firing him.furthermore,the vague and overbroad college policy on sexual harassment at issue here is not susceptible to a limiting construction,as was the statute in dileo,because there are no other specific terms to constrain the policy broad restrictions.the college policy on sexual harassment did not in its own terms limit its sweep to conduct outside the protection of the first amendment.
the majority also relies on the decision of a panel of the ninth circuit in cohen san bernardino valley,cir,for the notion that a court in can conclude that it was reasonable for school officials,in,not to know that this policy on sexual harassment applied to a faculty member classroom work might violate the first amendment.majority opinion at.see cohen,at neither the supreme court nor the ninth circuit has determined what scope of first amendment protection is to be given a public college professor classroom speech.i disagree.although in determining whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity this court must carefully define the scope of the right assertedly violated so that it would be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right,shechter comptroller of the city of new york,cir,it has never been required that the right be defined so narrowly as to require precedent that is on all fours with the case at hand.jeffries harleston,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.vague and overbroad speech codes in an academic setting,whether they seek to restrict ideas related to political affiliation,as in keyishian,or speech related to sex,have long been understood to run afoul of the first amendment.see uwm post,bd.of regents of the of.doe of.the defendants failed to realize that their sexual harassment policy was vague and overbroad because of their own inadequate training and judgment,not because the law on the subject was unclear.
on the facts presented by this plaintiff,the defendants decision to fire the plaintiff based on a vague and overbroad policy on sexual harassment was not objectively reasonable.accordingly,the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff first amendment claim of vagueness and overbreadth.
by,this court had clearly established that state universities and their administrators were not entitled to qualified immunity when they sanctioned a college professor based on the content of his classroom discourse.dube state of,cir emphasis added.such sanctions would violate and clearly established first amendment law.id.at.in dube,a professor was denied tenure because university defendants disagreed with the views of his course,entitled the politics of race,which referred to nazism,south african apartheid,and zionism as forms of racism.the course spurred controversy on and off the campus.we concluded that retaliation against dube based on his course teaching was as a matter of law,objectively un reasonable.id.at emphasis in original.relying upon principles articulated by the supreme court,we held that it has been clearly established that the first amendment tolerates neither laws nor other means of coercion that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the free exchange of ideas in the classroom.id.at citing keyishian bd.of regents of the of the state of,d.
the majority dismisses dube on the ground that vega toleration of the students shouted vulgarities was far removed from dube expression of his political views.majority opinion at.in dube,however,we did not condition first amendment protection of academic freedom on the requirement that the speech in question itself be political in nature.nor has the supreme court held that the protections of the first amendment are limited solely to political speech.see roth united states,d all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social ideas,controversial ideas,even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of the full protection of the guaranties universal city studios,corley,wl,at cir,newman,virginia state bd.of pharmacy virginia citizens consumer council,d prescription drug price information is speech.the majority concedes that vega discussion in class was initiated for legitimate pedagogical purposes.majority opinion at.if the discussion was begun legitimately,then it can not become illegitimate solely because it reaches content of which college administrators disapprove see mahoney hankin,political science professor stated a claim based on academic freedom when college attempted to restrict speech on current controversial college matters which were.see also kingsville indep.sch.dist.cooper,cir high school teacher discussions of slavery and war reconstruction protected by first amendment despite school administrator order that nothing controversial should be discussed in the classroom martin parrish,cir denying professor claim based on academic freedom and holding that professor condemnation of students attitude as bullshit was not germane to the subject matter in his class and had no educational function.to allow administrators the authority to censor the academic content of a class is to allow a pall of orthodoxy to enter into the classroom keyishian,at.
the majority finds support for its decision in the fact that,in this case,students were yelling and two were on chairs.majority opinion at.let us be clear it was neither the volume nor the enthusiasm of the students that prompted vega dismissal,but rather,in the words of howard english,the vice president of academic affairs who fired vega,i t was the subject matter and the words in the classroom that were elicited emphasis added.deposition of howard english,april,at.it is precisely this admitted censoring of the subject matter of a class discussion that violated vega first amendment right to academic freedom.
this right surely has its bounds,but,on the facts before us,vega did not exceed them.we have held that a school teacher academic freedom in the classroom is limited to actions that are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.silano sag harbor bd.of,cir quoting hazelwood kuhlmeier,d.whether a teacher action is reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns depends in part upon the age and sophistication of the students,the relationship between teaching method and valid educational objective,and the context and manner of the presentation.id.see also ward hickey,cir mailloux kiley,cir per curiam silva of.applying these principles in silano,we found no protection under the first amendment for a high school teacher who showed a picture of two topless women to a mathematics class to illustrate a lesson on the phenomenon of persistence of vision.silano,at.
applying the same three principles in vega case should lead to the conclusion that his activity is protected.first,vega was teaching a class to students who were of maturity,and we can not think that the terms were unknown to many students,keefe geanakos,cir holding that a high school english teacher discussion of the etymological origins of the word motherfucker was protected by first amendment right to academic freedom.indeed,it was the students themselves,not vega,who offered the terms for consideration.
second,there is no dispute in this case as to whether vega pedagogical method was legitimate within the meaning of the case law the majority concedes that the clustering technique used by vega in the classroom at issue here was initiated for legitimate pedagogical purposes.majority opinion at.
third,the context and manner of the writing exercise show that vega did nothing to forfeit the protection of the first amendment.in this case,the clustering exercise occurred during the last ten minutes of a single class.vega allowed the students to choose the subject matter for brainstorming
