opinion of the court 
appellant edward snell appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment and dismissal of his monell claims for municipal liability in this action pursuant to.snell is a advocate who regularly speaks to pregnant women as they enter the medical clinic hereinafter clinic or facility of planned parenthood of central pennsylvania planned parenthood in york,pennsylvania.appellee sergeant ronald camacho,a member of the city of york police department,is one of several officers assigned to overtime detail at the clinic under a contract between planned parenthood and the city.snell appendix.detailed officers are required to enforce the law and maintain order at the clinic.mcternan appendix.to dissuade pregnant women from undergoing an abortion,snell emphasizes the sanctity of the fetus,distributes literature,and discusses alternatives to,and the health risks of,abortion.snell activities emanate from deeply rooted christian religious beliefs.
this case and those of two other protesters at the clinic mcternan city of york,and holman city of york,were consolidated for oral argument.each of the three appellants sued individually complaining of restrictions on his first amendment rights of free speech,peaceful assembly,and religious expression.additionally,snell and holman complain that their arrests for activity outside the clinic violated their fourth amendment rights.while certain facts as stated in the three appeals are similar,the claims of each plaintiff were separately asserted in,and decided by,the district court.we therefore write separately on each case,and we note that the analysis as it relates to snell differs from the others somewhat,based on the nature of the government conduct at issue.
the clinic and its environs are described in full in our opinion in mcternan city of york,filed concurrently herewith,and that description will not be repeated here.
background 
on november,appellee sergeant ronald camacho was stationed at the planned parenthood clinic on overtime duty.he advised abortion protesters,including appellant edward snell,that they were prohibited from entering rose alley.several days later,at the hearing on snell disorderly conduct charge,sergeant camacho explained the purpose of the restriction number,one,i did want any more physical contact between planned parenthood people and the protesters.and,number two,again,it a busy alleyway.i did want anybody getting hit by any vehicles.sergeant camacho indicated that he did not communicate the restriction to planned parenthood escorts,who were permitted to accompany patrons across the alley.
shortly after on november,a planned parenthood patron,dorothy sponseller,stopped her car briefly in rose alley to obtain directions.as snell approached sponseller car,peggy welch,planned parenthood director of client services,intercepted snell and asked him to step aside.snell returned to the curb,and sponseller deposited her daughter at the rear entrance of the clinic,looped around the block,and parked in the clinic front lot.there,three planned parenthood escorts joined her.as the group crossed the alley toward the clinic,snell approached sponseller to hand her a pamphlet.witnesses accounts differ as to whether snell impeded sponseller progress to the clinic however,it is undisputed that he did not actually stop sponseller,and that sponseller,walking around snell,was only momentarily delayed.afterwards,sergeant camacho admonished snell,threatening to arrest him if he entered rose alley again.
approximately ten to minutes later,a second patron entered the alley.it is not clear whether the second patron was walking or driving when snell evidence was offered.snell testified that the second patron was on foot,accompanied by several planned parenthood escorts.walsh corroborated snell account and the next time we began to walk someone across the alley,snell walked forward.however,sergeant camacho,testifying that snell came close to the vehicle,suggested that the second patron was in her car when snell approached.
when the second patron entered the alley,snell stepped off the curb to engage her,and was promptly arrested by camacho for disorderly conduct snell testified that he was approximately five feet from the client,and witnesses essentially concurred.
after his arrest,a backup policeman,officer hernandez,snell.snell complains that officer hernandez affixed the cuffs too tightly,leaving them sore and bruised.snell did not complain to sergeant camacho or seek medical treatment.
district justice haskell dismissed the summary citation but expressed the view that snell aggressive tactics,which risked creating a donnybrook in the alley,approached the line of disorderly conduct.
snell filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania under,claiming violations of his first amendment rights of free speech,peaceful assembly,and religious expression.in his complaint,snell named as defendants the city of york,mayor john brenner and police commissioner mark whitman in their official capacity,and sergeant camacho,in his individual and official capacities.snell sought declaratory relief,temporary and permanent injunctions,and compensatory and punitive damages.
defendants brenner,whitman,the city of york,and sergeant camacho jointly filed a motion to dismiss under.b.claims against defendants brenner,whitman,and sergeant camacho in their official capacity were dismissed.citing kentucky graham,d noting that an suit is,in all respects other than name,to be treated as a suit against the entity,since i t is not a suit against the official personally,for the real party in interest is the entity.dismissing snell municipal liability claim against the city,the district court found that snell failed to identify a municipal custom or policy of depriving him of his constitutional rights.claims against sergeant camacho in his individual capacity,however,survived dismissal.
after discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of sergeant camacho on snell first and fourth amendment claims.following form with its analysis of mcternan free exercise claim,the court concluded that the restriction enforced by sergeant camacho was neutral,generally applicable,and only incidentally burdened snell religious expression and,therefore,withstood constitutional review.the district court determined,alternatively,that the restriction survived strict scrutiny,as it was narrowly tailored to promote public safety and traffic flow in rose alley compelling governmental interests.
turning to the free speech and peaceful assembly claims,the district court found that the restriction survived intermediate scrutiny because it was,narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,and left open ample alternative channels for communication of information.
as to the claim of unlawful arrest and excessive force under the fourth amendment,the district court concluded that sergeant camacho acted reasonably in believing that snell intended to cause public inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm by creating a hazardous or physically offensive condition by an act that serves no legitimate purpose.a.
the district court concluded that the excessive force claim failed because officer sergeant the handcuffs too tightly.since sergeant camacho had no personal involvement in the misconduct alleged,he was not liable for snell injuries.the district court also rejected snell alternative any force applied in executing an unlawful arrest is excessive per sergeant camacho had probable cause to arrest snell for disorderly conduct.
on appeal,snell urges that his rights of free speech,peaceful assembly and religious expression were burdened by the restriction placed on him and by his arrest the restriction was neither neutral nor generally applicable there was no compelling interest in safety,especially because the planned parenthood escorts and patients routinely crossed the alley at the same location and,finally,less restrictive means existed to protect public safety in the alley,including having sergeant camacho direct traffic.snell urges,moreover,that probable cause was lacking for his arrest because he neither created a hazardous condition nor intended to cause a public inconvenience or annoyance.
ii.first amendment claims 
we incorporate herein the discussion of the standards applicable to snell free exercise and free speech claims from our opinion in mcternan city of york,filed concurrently herewith while the specific conduct the parts of both the protester and the somewhat from the conduct alleged in mcternan,our concerns are quite similar.
free exercise 
the issue as to whether the restriction enforced by sergeant camacho was neutral and generally applicable is more easily resolved than in mcternan case.here,there is uncontroverted evidence that snell was treated differently than others using the alley,namely planned parenthood escorts and patients prior to his encounter with sponseller,and several times thereafter,snell was told that he could not enter the alley they were not.snell was admonished when he approached sponseller and the second patron in the alley they were not.snell was arrested while disobeying sergeant camacho order they were not.we conclude that in snell case,there is no question for a jury.no reasonable jury could find that the restriction,enforced solely against snell,was generally applicable.
if not generally applied,a restriction burdening religiously motivated expression must satisfy strict is,it must serve a compelling government interest and must be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d tenafly eruv ass n,borough of tenafly,cir.relying on precedent and the specific facts here,the district court concluded that the restriction served a compelling government traffic safety and the free flow of cars and pedestrians in the alley.for its conclusion,the court cited schenck network of western new york,d and madsen women health,d,where the supreme court,applying intermediate scrutiny,identified as significant the government interest in promoting vehicular and pedestrian safety and traffic flow.the district court also emphasized certain characteristics of the alley exacerbating the safety hazard presented,including its narrow physical dimensions and the presence of heavy that twice nearly resulted in accidents.
our concerns here mirror those expressed in mcternan.was the safety interest snell activity truly compelling,given the frequency with which pedestrians and drivers were in,and crossing,the alley was snell,who engaged patrons crossing the alley in exactly the same location as clinic escorts,doing anything more dangerous than clinic escorts who were granted unfettered access to the alley did snell complete exclusion from the alley truly represent the least restrictive means of avoiding violent altercations and promoting vehicular safety these are questions for the jury,which should not have been decided on summary judgment.
we pause specifically to address two governmental interests asserted by sergeant camacho,which were not urged by the defendant officer in mcternan ensuring patient access to the clinic and protecting clients from physical harassment.appellant br.at.neither interest,we conclude,is compelling on the facts before us.
as to clinic access,sergeant camacho failed to demonstrate that snell significantly impeded access to the facility.it is undisputed that snell did not actually stop sponseller,and that sponseller was only momentarily delayed in her progress to the clinic.sponseller acknowledged,moreover,that snell overarching aim was not to block her ingress to the clinic but rather to communicate his get his point across.in rejecting sergeant camacho access argument,we also contrast snell conduct with the impediments addressed in other abortion protest cases,where hundreds of advocates imposed physical blockades on clinic driveways and entrances.see madsen,at.upholding fixed buffer zone around reproductive health clinic,where throngs of up to protesters would congregate in the clinic driveways,surround clinic patients,and picket outside of clinic employees private residences 
we are also unpersuaded that the contact between snell and,isolated,and without attendant a compelling public safety threat,justifying the challenged restriction.sergeant camacho,conceding the contact was de minimis,characterized the encounter as not serious and just kind of like forcing the literature on them and making some sort of physical contact.the essentially peaceful nature of the exchange is confirmed by sponseller,who emphasized that snell did not mean anybody harm,and that she simply walked around snell.further,no pattern of violence or unruliness at the clinic is alleged.the handful of protesters typically present at the clinic are generally peaceful.the scene here,therefore,contrasts sharply with the chaos described at the reproductive health clinic in schenck,at.there,scores of protesters threw themselves on top of the hoods of cars,grabbed pregnant women and volunteers with varying levels of belligerence,and elbowed and spit on clinic that often triggered physical altercations.id.the scene here,moreover,differs markedly from that depicted in madsen,where throngs of up to protesters,congregating outside a reproductive health clinic,overwhelmed law enforcement.at.we conclude that the brief,isolated encounter alleged here,involving de minimis contact by a single protester against a single client,does not establish a compelling public safety hazard as a matter of law.
whether the interests asserted by the government,individually or in combination,are compelling is thus properly an issue for jury determination.finding the district court grant of summary judgment on snell free exercise claim to be error,we will remand the issue for jury decision.
free speech 
our concerns with the district court analysis of the free speech issue in mcternan are also present here.although we conclude that the challenged restriction was,advanced an important governmental interest,and left adequate alternatives for communication of information,we have substantial doubt that it complied with the tailoring requirement mandated under heightened scrutiny.for the reasons set forth below,we will thus remand the issue for jury determination.
as to content neutrality,as in mcternan,there is no evidence of police hostility to snell message.while it is clear that snell was treated differently than planned parenthood personnel,snell fails to identify statements or conduct by sergeant camacho demonstrating animus to his substantive views.if a jury were to conclude that safety concerns did not motivate sergeant camacho,could they conclude that his treatment of snell was prompted by disagreement with snell message we think not.as we noted in our opinion in mcternan,there must be some evidence tending to show that sergeant camacho articulated concern for traffic safety was a pretext for viewpoint discrimination.here,that would be a matter of unsupported conjecture.
narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest 
under the second prong of ward,a restriction on the time,place,or manner of speech must serve a significant government interest and be narrowly tailored to serve that interest.ward rock against racism,d quoting clark cmty.for creative,d.
i significance of the governmental interest 
the district court determined that the restriction enforced by sergeant camacho promoted traffic safety and traffic flow in rose that the court found compelling.we rejected that conclusion in our analysis of snell free exercise claim,but find that the government interest in protecting public safety and ensuring the free flow of traffic in rose alley,while not compelling,was real and could be termed,significant.
our reasoning here largely mirrors our analysis in mcternan,where we addressed a similar factual situation.there,we underscored the risk of collisions between drivers,clients,personnel,and protesters in rose alley.that hazard,we found,was exacerbated by the specific characteristics of rose alley,including its narrow physical dimensions and the presence of large trucks.these concerns,centering on the layout and use of the alley,apply with equal force here.accordingly,we conclude that the government interest in promoting traffic safety and traffic flow in rose alley,while not compelling,were significant.
ii narrowly tailored 
we now consider whether the challenged restriction was narrowly tailored.in mcternan,we observed that speech restrictions embodied in the form of oral police directives present a greater risk of arbitrary enforcement than legislative enactments,justifying a more searching review.accordingly,in mcternan,we applied heightened rather than intermediate scrutiny.similar concerns support the application of heightened scrutiny here.as in mcternan,the challenged restriction here was embodied in oral directive,issued ad hoc by sergeant camacho without reference to any formal administrative or policy channels accordingly,the directive here presents a similar risk of arbitrary or unreasonable enforcement.hence,we will apply heightened scrutiny,upholding the restriction only if it burden s no more speech than necessary to serve the interest asserted.madsen,at.
here,we can not conclude that the challenged restriction burden s no more speech than necessary to protect traffic safety in rose alley as a matter of law.madsen,at.snell identifies a plausible alternative to safeguard pedestrians and drivers without curtailing advocates first amendment rights.sergeant camacho,he urges,could have directed traffic at the intersection of beaver street and rose alley.as we explained in mcternan,this approach would have enabled snell and other advocates to communicate with clients in the alley safely.the district court did not address this alternative but concluded that the restriction was narrowly tailored.it was error for the district court to conclude that excluding protesters from rose alley necessarily constituted the least restrictive means of protecting public safety.
the significant fact issues present here also preclude summary judgment on the tailoring requirement.a restriction can not be narrowly tailored in the abstract it must be tailored to the particular government interest asserted.only when the contours of that interest are clear may we decide whether the means selected to accomplish it have been narrowly tailored.here,sergeant camacho cited traffic safety to justify restricting access to rose alley.we previously identified traffic safety as a significant governmental interest,but query whether the safety issues are sufficiently defined,on the record before us,to sustain summary judgment that the restriction was narrowly tailored to that interest.we conclude that significant fact questions persist,precluding summary judgment on this issue.as we noted in mcternan,largely unknown is how drivers,advocates,and clinic personnel interacted in the alley.absent this information,we are hard pressed to conclude,as a matter of law,that sergeant camacho selected the least burdensome alternative to promote traffic safety in the alley.
other evidence confirms that a triable issue existed,and that summary judgment was improper on the issue of tailoring.the three assigned security detail at rose alley adopted distinct approaches to address the safety hazard allegedly created by protesters activities in the alley.sergeant camacho excluded advocates outright from the alley,but granted planned parenthood personnel unfettered access to it.officer koltunovich,by contrast,cautioned advocates about potential safety hazards but did not restrict access.holman appendix.finally,officer barth prohibited individuals from lingering or walking aimlessly in the alley.these divergent approaches only serve further to undermine our confidence that sergeant camacho selected the least burdensome alternative to promote traffic safety in the alley.
nor are we persuaded that prohibiting protesters from entering rose alley represented the least restrictive means of avoiding confrontations between patients and protesters and ensuring patient access to the clinic.as we noted,there is no evidence of physical altercations among clients,volunteers,and the handful of protesters typically present at the clinic.although sergeant camacho maintains that snell made physical contact with sponseller,he concedes that the contact was momentary,harmless,and did not impede sponseller progress to the clinic.there is no evidence that sergeant camacho could not have managed a potential dispute between a protester and a patron.on this sparse record,we can not conclude that the challenged prohibition represented the least restrictive means of preserving order at the clinic.accordingly,we will remand the issue for jury determination.
adequate alternatives 
the final ward requirement is that the restriction leave ample opportunities for communication of information.the district court concluded that snell,capable of espousing his views from several public sidewalks surrounding the clinic,possessed adequate alternatives to convey his message.snell contention on appeal is a narrow one.he expresses dissatisfaction with the impediments to speech that he parenthood personnel and railings at the rear ramp of the facility that purportedly block his access to the patrons themselves.his argument,that the alley presents the best opportunity momentarily to speak and hand out literature as they patrons are crossing the street,is merely that,argument.appellant br.at emphasis added.there is no evidence that escorts interfered with snell efforts to distribute literature to patrons,or that the public sidewalk in front of the clinic did not afford snell equivalent opportunities to converse momentarily with clients.as to the blockage due to the railings,we are unpersuaded that a simple metal railing poses an impediment to speech.hence,the district court properly concluded that this aspect of ward was satisfied 
iii.fourth amendment claims 
snell also contends that sergeant camacho arrested him for disorderly conduct without probable cause,and applied excessive force,in violation of his fourth amendment rights.we address snell arguments in turn.
unlawful arrest 
snell argues that his arrest for disorderly conduct was unsupported by probable cause.under pennsylvania law,disorderly conduct requires proof that a person with intent to cause public inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act that serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.a.snell maintains that he merely intended to distribute to cause public harm or that his peaceful distribution of literature in rose alley did not create a hazardous or physically offensive condition.the district court concluded that sergeant camacho had probable cause to arrest snell for disorderly conduct,after snell twice ignored camacho warning to stay out of the alley.however,reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to snell,we identify genuine fact issues,precluding summary judgment.at t jmc telecom,llc,cir.
in assessing the presence of probable cause,a court must determine the fact pattern the officer encountered and,in light of that,whether the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.sharrar felsing,cir.the court has explained the standard as whether,at the moment the arrest was made,the officers had probable cause to make it.beck ohio,d quoted in burton,cir.in other words,whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.id.mere suspicion,however,is insufficient.burton,at quoting orsatti state police,cir.
notwithstanding the district court conclusion that sergeant camacho acted reasonably,we are not so sure.for one thing,we can not discern exactly what occurred.while the various accounts as to the encounter with sponseller are confusing,the evidence as to what happened was the basis for the even less clear.did snell approach a car,or was the second patron on foot what was his exact distance from that patron what aspect of what he did created a hazardous or physically offensive condition clarification of the specific factu
