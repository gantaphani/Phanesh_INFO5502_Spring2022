once again,we are asked to find the balance between a student right to free speech and a school need to control its educational environment.in this case,two students purchased bracelets bearing the slogan i boobies keep a breast as part of a nationally recognized campaign.the easton area school district banned the bracelets,relying on its authority under bethel school district fraser,to restrict vulgar,lewd,profane,or plainly offensive speech,and its authority under tinker des moines independent community school district,to restrict speech that is reasonably expected to substantially disrupt the school.the district court held that the ban violated the students rights to free speech and issued a preliminary injunction against the ban.
we agree with the district court that neither fraser nor tinker can sustain the bracelet ban.the scope of a school authority to restrict lewd,vulgar,profane,or plainly offensive speech under fraser is a novel question left open by the supreme court,and one which we must now resolve.we hold that fraser,as modified by the supreme court later reasoning in morse frederick,sets up the following framework plainly lewd speech,which offends for the same reasons obscenity offends,may be categorically restricted regardless of whether it comments on political or social issues,speech that does not rise to the level of plainly lewd but that a reasonable observer could interpret as lewd may be categorically restricted as long as it can not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on political or social issues,and speech that does not rise to the level of plainly lewd and that could plausibly be interpreted as commenting on political or social issues may not be categorically restricted.because the bracelets here are not plainly lewd and because they comment on a social issue,they may not be categorically banned under fraser.the school district has also failed to show that the bracelets threatened to substantially disrupt the school under tinker.we will therefore affirm the district court.
factual background 
as a leading youth focused global breast cancer organization,the keep a breast foundation tries to educate thirteen to women about breast cancer.br.of amicus curiae kabf at.to that end,it often partners with other merchants to products that raise awareness.and because it believes that young women negative body image s seriously inhibit their awareness of breast cancer,the foundation products often seek to reduce the stigma by speaking to young people in a voice they can relate to.id.at.if young women see such awareness projects and products as cool and trendy,the thinking goes,then they will be more willing to talk about breast cancer openly.
to start a conversation about that taboo in a way and to break down inhibitions keeping young women from performing,the foundation began its i boobies initiative.id.at.part of the campaign included selling silicone bracelets of assorted colors emblazoned with i boobies keep a breast and check y urself keep a breast.id.at.the foundation website address and motto cation,awareness,action.appear on the inside of the bracelet.id.
as intended,the i boobies initiative was a hit with young women,quickly becoming one of the foundation most successful and high profile educational campaigns.id.at.two of the young women drawn to the bracelets were students and.they purchased the bracelets with their mothers before the school year because she saw a lot of her friends wearing the bracelets and wanted to learn about them,and because of the bracelet popularity and awareness message.app.
but the bracelets were more than just a new fashion trend.purchase prompted her to become educated about breast cancer in young women.the girls wore their bracelets both to commemorate friends and relatives who had suffered from breast cancer and to promote awareness among their friends.indeed,their bracelets started conversations about breast cancer and did so far more effectively than the pink ribbon.app.that made sense to,who observed that no one really notices the pink ribbon,whereas the bracelets are new and more appealing to teenagers.app.
and three other students wore the i boobies keep a breast bracelets at easton area middle school during the school year.a few teachers,after observing the students wear the bracelets every day for several weeks,considered whether they should take action.the teachers responses varied one found the bracelets offensive because they trivialized breast cancer.others feared that the bracelets might lead to offensive comments or invite inappropriate touching.but school administrators also believed that boys did not need the bracelets as an excuse to make sexual statements or to engage in inappropriate touching.see,viglianti,app,testifying that such incidents happened before the bracelets and were going to happen after the bracelets because sexual curiosity between boys and girls in the middle school is a natural and continuing thing.
in mid to late september,four or five teachers asked the assistant principal,amy braxmeier,whether they should require students to remove the bracelets.the assistant principal,anthony viglianti,told the teachers that they should ask students to remove wristbands that have the word boobie written on them,app,even though there were no reports that the bracelets had caused any disruptions or inappropriate comments 
with breast cancer awareness month approaching in october,school administrators anticipated that the i boobies keep a breast bracelets might reappear the school was scheduled to observe breast cancer awareness month on october,so the day before,administrators publicly announced,for the first time,the ban on bracelets containing the word boobies.using the word boobies in his announcement,viglianti notified students of the ban over the system,and a student did the same on the school television station.the middle school still encouraged students to wear the traditional pink,and it provided teachers who donated to susan komen for the cure with either a pin bearing the slogan passionately pink for the cure or a reading real rovers wear pink.
later that day,a school security guard noticed wearing an i boobies keep a breast bracelet and ordered her to remove it.refused.after meeting with braxmeier,relented,removed her bracelet,and returned to lunch.no disruption occurred at any time that day.
the following day,and each wore their i boobies keep a breast bracelets to observe the middle school breast cancer awareness day.the day was uneventful until lunchtime.once in the cafeteria,both girls were instructed by a school security guard to remove their bracelets.both girls refused.hearing this encounter,another girl,stood up and similarly refused to take off her bracelet.confronted by this act of solidarity,the security guard permitted the girls to finish eating their lunches before escorting them to braxmeier office.again,the girls actions caused no disruption in the cafeteria,though told braxmeier that one boy had immaturely commented either that he also love d boobies or that he love d her boobies.
braxmeier spoke to all three girls,and agreed to remove her bracelet.and stood firm,however,citing their rights to freedom of speech.the middle school administrators were having none of it.they punished and by giving each of them one and a half days of suspension and by forbidding them from attending the winter ball.the administrators notified the girls families,explaining only that and were being disciplined for disrespect,defiance,and disruption.
news of the bracelets quickly reached the rest of the easton area school district,which instituted a ban on the i boobies keep a breast bracelets,effective on november.the only incident reported by school administrators occurred weeks after the ban two girls were talking about their bracelets at lunch when a boy who overheard them interrupted and said something like i want boobies.he also made an inappropriate gesture with two red spherical candies.the boy admitted his rude comment and was suspended for one day 
this was not the first time the middle school had banned clothing that it found distasteful.indeed,the school district policy prohibits clothing imprinted with nudity,vulgarity,obscenity,profanity,and double entendre pictures or slogans.under the policy,students at the middle school have been asked to remove clothing promoting hooters and big pecker bar grill,as well as clothing bearing the phrase save the another slogan.typically,students are disciplined only if they actually refuse to remove the offending apparel when asked to do so.
procedural history 
through their mothers,and sued the school district under compl,ecf,easton area sch,cv mam.they sought a temporary restraining order allowing them to attend the winter ball and a preliminary injunction against the bracelet ban.easton area sch,d.at the district court urging,the school district reversed course and permitted and to attend the winter ball while retaining the option to impose a comparable punishment if the bracelet ban was upheld.id.the district court accordingly denied the motion for a temporary restraining order.id.
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction.it soon became clear that the school district rationale for disciplining and had shifted.although and disciplinary letters indicated only that they were being disciplined for disrespect,defiance,and disruption,the school district ultimately based the ban on its together with the bracelets alleged sexual innuendo.according to the school district witnesses,the middle school assistant principals had conferred and concluded that the bracelets conveyed a sexual double entendre that could be harmful and confusing to students of different physical and sexual developmental levels.sch.dist.br.at.and the principals believed that students,who often have immature views of sex,were particularly likely to interpret the bracelets that way.for its part,the foundation explained that no one there ever suggested that the phrase i heart boobies is meant to be sexy.app.to that end,the foundation had denied requests from truck stops,convenience stores,vending machine companies,and pornographers to sell the bracelets.
after the evidentiary hearing,the district court preliminarily enjoined the school district bracelet ban.according to the district court,and were likely to succeed on the merits because the bracelets did not contain lewd speech under fraser and did not threaten to substantially disrupt the school environment under tinker.the district court could find no other basis for regulating the student speech at issue.the school district appealed,and the district court denied its request to stay the injunction pending this appeal.
although the district court preliminary injunction is not a final order,we have jurisdiction under a,which grants appellate jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders of the district courts granting,continuing,modifying,refusing,or dissolving injunctions.see sypniewski warren hills reg l bd.of,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,its legal conclusions de novo,and its ultimate decision to grant the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.id.at.four factors determine whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate 
whether the movant has a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably harmed by denying the injunction whether there will be greater harm to the nonmoving party if the injunction is granted and whether granting the injunction is in the public interest.
id.quoting highmark,upmc health plan,cir.the district court concluded that all four factors weighed in favor of and.in cases,though,the first factor the likelihood of success on the merits tends to determine which way the other factors fall.id.at.because the same is true here,we focus first on b.and burden to show a likelihood of success on the merits.id.
the school district defends the bracelet ban as an exercise of its authority to restrict lewd,vulgar,profane,or plainly offensive student speech under fraser.as to the novel question of fraser scope,jurists seem to agree on one thing t he mode of analysis employed in fraser is not entirely clear.morse,at on this point,we think the supreme court cases are more consistent than they may first appear.as we explain,fraser involved only plainly lewd speech.we hold that,under fraser,a school may also categorically restrict speech that although not plainly lewd,vulgar,or profane could be interpreted by a reasonable observer as lewd,vulgar,or profane so long as it could not also plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.because the i boobies keep a breast bracelets are not plainly lewd and express support for a national campaign unquestionably an important social issue they may not be categorically restricted under fraser.
a.the supreme court decision in fraser 
a s a general matter,the first amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.ashcroft aclu.of course,there are exceptions.when acting as sovereign,the government is empowered to impose time,place,and manner restrictions on speech,see ward rock against racism,make reasonable,decisions about what speech is allowed on government property that is not fully open to the public,see.educ.television comm forbes,decide what viewpoints to espouse in its own speech or speech that might be attributed to it,see johanns livestock mktg.ass n,and categorically restrict unprotected speech,such as obscenity,see miller california,
sometimes,however,the government acts in capacities that go beyond being sovereign.in those capacities,it not only retains its sovereign authority over speech but also gains additional flexibility to regulate speech.see in re kendall,cir collecting examples.one of those other capacities is k educator.although students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,the first amendment has to be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment and thus students rights to freedom of speech are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.morse,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the supreme court first expressed this principle nearly a half century ago.in,the united states deployed over troops to vietnam as part of operation rolling thunder and thus began the vietnam war.that war divided this country as few other issues e ver have.tinker,at black,dissenting.public opposition to the war made its way into schools,and in one case,a group of and students wore black armbands to express their opposition.id.at majority opinion.school officials adopted a policy prohibiting the armbands and suspending any student who refused to remove it when asked.id.some students refused and were suspended.id.the supreme court upheld their right to wear the armbands.id.at.tinker held that school officials may not restrict student speech without a reasonable forecast that the speech would substantially disrupt the school environment or invade the rights of others.id.at.as nothing more than the silent,passive expression of opinion,unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance on the students part,the students armbands were protected by the first amendment.id.at.
under tinker general rule,the government may restrict school speech that threatens a specific and substantial disruption to the school environment or that inva des the rights of others.saxe state college area sch,cir citing tinker,at.since tinker,the supreme court has identified three narrow circumstances in which the government may restrict student speech even when there is no risk of substantial disruption or invasion of others rights.id.at.first,the government may categorically restrict vulgar,lewd,profane,or plainly offensive speech in schools,even if it would not be obscene outside of school.fraser,at.second,the government may likewise restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and that can not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue.morse,at alito,concurring see also id.at majority opinion t his is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.and third,the government may impose restrictions on speech that are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns a power usually lumped together with the other speech doctrines but that,strictly speaking,simply reflects the government more general power as sovereign over speech hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier.
the first exception is at issue here.we must determine the scope of the government authority to categorically restrict vulgar,lewd,indecent,or plainly offensive speech under eraser.eraser involved a assembly during which a student nominated a peer for class office through an an elaborate,graphic,and explicit sexual metaphor.saxe,at quoting eraser,at.fraser speech glorif ied male sexuality

fraser,at brennan,concurring.in response,s ome students hooted and yelled some by gestures simulated the sexual activities pointedly alluded to in fraser speech.id.at majority opinion.still o ther students appeared to be bewildered and embarrassed by the speech.id.the school suspended fraser and took him out of the running for graduation speaker.id.
the supreme court upheld fraser suspension.id.at.rather than requiring a reasonable forecast of substantial disruption under tinker,the court held that lewd,vulgar,indecent,and plainly offensive student speech is categorically unprotected in school,even if it falls short of obscenity and would have been protected outside school.saxe,at discussing fraser morse,at had fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context,it would have been protected.fraser,at blackmun,concurring if fraser had given the same speech outside of the school environment,he could not have been penalized simply because government officials considered his language to be inappropriate.for this proposition,the court relied on precedent holding that the government can restrict expression that would be obscene from a minor perspective even though it would not be obscene in an adult view where minors are either a captive audience or the intended recipients of the speech.see fraser,at relying on ginsberg new york,nn.upholding criminal punishment for selling to minors any picture depicting nudity bd.of,island trees union free sch.dist.pico,plurality opinion acknowledging that the free speech clause would allow a local board of education to remove pervasively vulgar books from school libraries and fcc pacifica found,rejecting a free speech clause challenge to the fcc broad leeway to regulate material on broadcast television during hours when children were likely to watch.
fraser did no more than extend these cases to another place where minors are a captive audience schools.indeed,as the court explained,schools are tasked with more than just educating our youth about books,the curriculum,and the civics class.id.at.society also expects schools to teach students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior,including the fundamental values of habits and manners of civility essential to a democratic society.id.at,citation omitted.consequently,fraser sexually explicit monologue was not protected.id.at.
it is important to recognize what was not at stake in eraser.eraser addressed only a school power over speech that was plainly lewd not speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as either lewd or.see,doninger niehoff,cir fraser reference to plainly offensive speech must be understood in light of the vulgar,lewd,and sexually explicit language that was at issue in that case.chandler mcminnville sch,cir interpreting fraser as limited to per se vulgar,lewd,obscene,or plainly offensive school speech.after all,the court believed fraser speech to be plainly offensive to both teachers and students indeed to any mature person.fraser,at.
and because it was plainly lewd,the court did not believe that fraser speech could plausibly be interpreted as political or social commentary.in hindsight,it might be tempting to believe that fraser speech was political because it was made in the context of a student election.citizens united fec,u,describing the importance of political speech as the means to hold officials accountable to the people.but that kind of revisionist history is belied by both the logic and language of fraser.fraser permits a school to prohibit words that offend for the same reasons that obscenity offends.saxe,at quoting fraser,at.obscenity,in turn,offends because it is no essential part of any exposition of ideas,and is of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from it is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.fraser,at quoting pacifica,at plurality opinion.in other words,obscenity and obscenity to minors,like other historically unprotected categories of speech,have little or no political or social value.united states stevens.by concluding that fraser speech met the standard,the court necessarily implied that his speech could not be interpreted as having serious political value.miller,at.
in fact,the majority in fraser made this explicit.t he fraser c ourt distinguished its holding from tinker in part on the absence of any political message in fraser speech.guiles ex rel.guiles marineau,cir.in the court own words,there was a marked distinction between the political message of the armbands in tinker and the sexual content of fraser speech.fraser,at emphasis added see also defoe ex rel.defoe spiva,cir tinker governs this case because by wearing clothing bearing images of the confederate flag,tom defoe engaged in pure speech,which is protected by the first amendment,and thus fraser would not apply.several courts of appeals have similarly interpreted fraser.guiles,at,newsom ex rel.newsom albemarle cnty.sch,cir explaining that fraser distinguish ed tinker on the basis that the lewd,vulgar,and plainly offensive speech was unrelated to any political viewpoint quoting fraser,at chandler,at goodwin,concurring concluding that fraser does not apply because this case clearly involves political speech.and the supreme court later characterized fraser reasoning the same way.morse,at noting that fraser was plainly attuned to the sexual,content of fraser speech.in fact,morse refused to stretch fraser so far as to encompass any speech that could fit under some definition of offensive out of a fear that much political and religious speech might be perceived as offensive to some.id.at.fraser therefore involved plainly lewd speech that did not comment on political or social issues.
b.how far does a school authority under fraser extend 
the school district asks us to extend fraser in at least two ways to reach speech that is ambiguously lewd,vulgar,or profane and to reach speech on political or social issues the first step is justified,but the second is not.
under fraser,schools may restrict ambiguously lewd speech only if it can not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a social or political matter.
although fraser involved plainly lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive speech that offends for the same reasons obscenity offends,saxe,at quoting fraser,at,student speech need not rise to that level to be restricted under fraser.we conclude that schools may also categorically restrict ambiguous speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive unless,as explained below,the speech could also plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.after all,fraser made clear that the determination of what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.at.the supreme court three other cases suggest that courts should defer to a school decisions to restrict what a reasonable observer would interpret as lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive.see morse,at explaining that,under tinker,courts determine whether school officials have reasonably conclude d that student speech will substantially disrupt the school id.at explaining that,under kuhlmeier,courts uphold a school reasonable,pedagogically related restrictions on speech that an observer could reasonably attribute to the school id.at alito,concurring explaining that schools may restrict student speech that could reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use and that could not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.this makes sense.school officials know the age,maturity,and other characteristics of their students far better than judges do.our review is restricted to a cold and distant record.and we must take into account that these same officials must often act suddenly and unexpectedly based on their experience.id.at majority opinion see,walkerserrano ex rel.walker leonard,cir there can be little doubt that speech appropriate for high school students is not necessarily acceptable for grammar school students.human sexuality provides the most obvious example of matter citing fraser,at sypniewski,at what is necessary in one school at one time will not be necessary elsewhere and at other times.
it remains the job of judges,nonetheless,to determine whether a reasonable observer could interpret student speech as lewd,profane,vulgar,or offensive.see morse,at taking the same approach with respect to the message of drug advocacy on frederick banner see also christian legal soc y chapter of the of cal.martinez,this court is the final arbiter of the question whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints,and we owe no deference to universities when we consider that question.whether a reasonable observer could interpret student speech as lewd,profane,vulgar,or offensive depends on the plausibility of the school interpretation in light of competing meanings the context,content,and form of the speech and the age and maturity of the students.see,chandler,at analyzing the word scab on buttons worn by students during a teacher strike to determine whether it was a vulgar,offensive epithet or just common parlance and concluding that,at the stage,fraser did not apply.
although this is a highly contextual inquiry,several rules apply.a reasonable observer would not adopt an acontextual interpretation,and the subjective intent of the speaker is irrelevant.see morse,at explaining that frederick desire to appear on television was a description of his motive for displaying the banner and not an interpretation of what the banner sa id see also saxe,at noting that students intent to offend or disrupt does not satisfy tinker.and fraser is not a blank check to categorically restrict any speech that touches on sex or any speech that has the potential to offend.see morse,at,refusing to stretch fraser so far as to encompass any speech that could fit under some definition of offensive and rejecting the argument that the bong hits jesus message on frederick banner could be banned under fraser,even though it is no doubt offensive to some accord eugene volokh,may jesus is not a homophobe be banned from public high school as indecent and sexual,the volokh conspiracy,pm,but fraser hardly suggested that all speech on political and religious questions related to sexuality and sexual orientation could be banned from public high school.after all,a school mission to mold students into citizens capable of engaging in civil discourse includes teaching students of sufficient age and maturity how to navigate debates touching on sex.
fraser does not permit a school to restrict ambiguously lewd speech that can also plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a social or political issue.
a school leeway to categorically restrict ambiguously lewd speech,however,ends when that speech could also plausibly be interpreted as expressing a view on a political or social issue.justices alito and kennedy concurrence in morse adopted a similar protection for political speech that could be interpreted as illegal drug advocacy.their narrower rationale protecting political speech limits and controls the majority opinion in morse,and it applies with even greater force to ambiguously lewd speech.
justice alito concurrence,joined by justice kennedy,provided the crucial fourth and fifth votes in the majority opinion.but the two justices conditioned their votes on the understanding that the majority opinion goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue.morse,at alito,concurring see id.at regarding the categorical regulation of advocacy of ambiguous illegal drug advocacy as standing at the far reaches of what the first amendment permits and join ing the opinion of the court with the understanding that the opinion does not endorse any further extension.the purpose of justice alito concurrence was to ensur e that political speech will remain protected within the school setting subject,as always,to tinker principle.ponce socorro indep.sch,cir.
because the votes of justices alito and kennedy were necessary to the majority opinion and were expressly conditioned on their narrower understanding that speech plausibly interpreted as political or social commentary was protected from categorical regulation,that limitation is a binding part of morse.this conclusion requires a minor detour.the most familiar situation in which we follow the narrowest rationale was expressed t by the supreme court in marks united states when no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.but that situation is not the only one in which we tally the justices views and look for the narrowest rationale.the supreme court and this court have both applied the approach in circumstances beyond those posed by marks,including to determine holdings in majority opinions not just plurality opinions involving no single legal rationale explain ing the result and to count even dissenting justices votes that,by definition,could not explain the result not just the votes of those who concurred in the judgments see united states johnson,cir noting that the supreme court has moved away from adhering to the strict circumstances in marks.
and it makes sense that the limitations in justice alito concurrence would narrow the majority opinion.when an individual justice vote is not needed to form a majority,the meaning of a majority opinion is to be found within the opinion itself because the gloss that an individual j ustice chooses to place upon it is not authoritative.mckoy north carolina,blackmun,concurring.but when an individual justice joins the majority and is essential to maintaining the majority,and then writes separately,the opinion is not a majority opinion except to the extent that it accords with his views.id.at scalia,dissenting.of course,that linchpin justice opinion can not add to what the majority opinion holds by binding the other four j ustices to what they have not said because his views would not be the narrowest grounds.id.but that justice separate opinion can assuredly narrow what the majority opinion holds,by explaining the more limited interpretation adopted by that necessary member of the majority.id.in that case,the linchpin justice views are the least common denominator necessary to maintain a majority opinion.see generally sonja west,concurring in part and concurring in the confusion.advocating the same approach and explaining that it is consistent with determining precedent from the traditional supreme court seriatim opinions.
indeed,this is not the first time that we have been compelled to limit a majority opinion by a linchpin justice narrower concurrence.in horn thoratec,we considered whether the federal regulation of medical devices preempts only requirement s specific to medical devices or also preempts general claims not specific to medical devices such as negligence.see,cir.that,in turn,required us to analyze the supreme court decision in medtronic lohr.we read part v of the lohr majority opinion which justice breyer formally joined as the fifth vote as saying that only requirements,not general claims,are preempted.see horn,at noting that the majority in part v conclud ed that claims escape preemption because their generality leaves them outside of the preempted category of requirements quoting lohr,at id.at explaining that justice breyer joined in some parts of justice stevens plurality opinion thus making it a majority opinion at times,including in part v.but we also read justice breyer concurrence as reaching the opposite conclusion,despite his having joined that portion of the majority opinion.see id.faced with an apparent conflict between part v of the majority opinion and justice breyer concurrence,we followed the latter because it was narrower,just as the fifth,sixth,seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits had done.id.at see also martin medtronic,cir kemp medtronic,cir mitchell collagen,cir papike tambrands,cir.in doing so,we rejected our dissenting colleague argument that the approach was simply inapplicable because justice breyer joined part v of the majority opinion and that the correct course of action in the event of a conflict would be to follow part v as the majority opinion.horn,at fuentes,dissenting see id.at explaining that the horn majority and the seventh and ninth circuits also perceived a contradiction and chose to ignore justice breyer vote for part v,instead crediting the apparently contrary reasoning in his concurrence.
likewise,in united states bishop,cir,we relied on the narrower concurring views of justices kennedy and to limit the majority opinion in united states lopez,which they formally joined as the fourth and fifth votes.we declined to read the majority opinion so broadly as to upend judicial deference to congress judgment about whether an activity substantially implicates interstate commerce,instead following the concurrence view that the majority had reached a necessary though limited holding that still counseled great restraint before finding that congress had transgressed its commerce clause power.bishop,at quoting lopez,at kennedy,concurring.as in horn,we took that approach notwithstanding our dissenting colleague argument that we should follow the breadth of the majority opinion and ignore the narrower concurrence because justices and kennedy joined in the majority opinion.id.at becker,concurring in part and dissenting in part.as even our dissenting colleague explained,we followed the narrower views of justices and kennedy because they form ed an intermediate bloc of the majority which would view lopez as.id.and horn and bishop are not the only examples.see,united states monclavo cruz,cir relying on the narrowing construction given to the majority opinion by justice powell,who was also a necessary member of the majority,to limit the majority holding in south dakota opperman,united states wilson,cir similar.
to be sure,the supreme court once said in a case not involving a linchpin concurrence that federal courts should not give much precedential weight to a concurring opinion,even if it coheres with the majority opinion.alexander sandoval,see also vasquez hillery,n describing the marks rule as inapplicable to an opinion to which five justices expressly subscribed.yet we have already decided that this principle from alexander is inapplicable to a concurrence that cast the swing vote,which was crucial to the outcome of the case and without which there could be no majority,and took a narrower approach than the majority opinion.horn,at distinguishing alexander on this basis.
which brings us back to justice alito concurrence in morse.the linchpin justices in morse justices alito and kennedy expressly conditioned their joining the majority opinion on a narrower interpretation of the opinion namely,that it did not permit the restriction of speech that could plausibly be interpreted as political or social speech.had they known that lower courts would ignore their narrower understanding of the majority opinion or had the majority opinion expressly gone farther than their limitations then,by their own admission,they would not have joined the majority opinion.that would have transformed the majority opinion into a plurality opinion,with their concurring views becoming the controlling narrowest grounds under an uncontroversial application of the marks doctrine.why,then,should it matter whether they formally joined the majority opinion or not 
it should not.ignoring limitations placed on the majority opinion by a necessary member of the majority would mean that four justices could fabricate a majority by binding a fifth to their interpretation of what they say,even though he writes separately to explain his own more narrow understanding.mckoy,at scalia,dissenting.that produces inexplicable anomalies.if a plurality holds x and y,and a fifth justice concurs in the judgment to hold only x and rejects y,the fifth member more limited views become binding under a straightforward application of marks.the same interpretation is true if the fifth justice joins the majority opinion and concurs in part.yet if the same concurring justice joins the majority opinion while concurring,then the majority opinion holding x and y becomes binding and the fifth member narrower views evaporate.such an approach places all of its weight on the distinction between a justice choice to follow his name with concurring instead of concurring in part or concurring in the judgment.west,concurring in part and concurring in the confusion.at explaining why these after the comma phrases can not bear such weight tristan pelham webb,note,powelling for precedent binding concurrences,ann.surv.am,same.that elevates formalism over substance at the expense of ignoring the very conditions on which a necessary member of the majority expressly chose to join the majority.
in short,because justice alito concurrence provides a single legal standard that when properly applied,produce s results with which a majority of the justices in the case articulating the standard would agree,united states donovan,cir alterations in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted,his opinion in morse forms the narrowest grounds necessary to secure a majority,planned parenthood of se.casey,cir,aff in part and rev in part on other grounds.as a result,we agree with the en banc fifth circuit that the limitations placed on the majority opinion by justice alito concurrence are binding on us see morgan swanson,cir en banc majority opinion of elrod,describing justice alito morse concurrence as controlling see also morgan piano indep.sch,cir we have held justice alito concurrence to be the controlling opinion in morse.citing ponce,at.
justice alito would have protected political or social speech reasonably interpreted to advocate illegal drug use,and that protection applies even more strongly to ambiguously lewd speech.in morse,the court added a new categorical exception to tinker,student speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as advocating illegal drug use but that can not plausibly be interpreted as addressing political or social issues.id.at.the exception was justified because illegal drugs pose an immediately obvious,grave and unique threat to the physical safety of students.id.at.despite that threat,however,the court held that speech advocating illegal drug use is not categorically unprotected if it can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue,including speech on issues such as the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.even with that limitation,the court made clear that this new exception to tinker stand s at the far reaches of what the first amendment permits.id.at.
if speech posing such a grave and unique threat to the physical safety of students can be categorically regulated only when it can not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue and that regulation nonetheless stand s at the far reaches of what the first amendment permits then there is no reason why ambiguously lewd speech should receive any less protection when it also can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue.id.at.one need not be a philosopher of mill or feinberg to recognize that harmful speech posing an immediately obvious threat to the physical safety of students,id.at,presents a far graver threat to the educational mission of schools thereby warranting less protection than ambiguously lewd speech that might undercut teaching the appropriate form of civil discourse to students,fraser,at.it would make no sense to afford a exclaiming i pot legalize it protection under morse while declaring that a bracelet saying i boobies keep a breast is unprotected under fraser.
those limits are persuasive on their own terms,even if we disregard the controlling limitations of justice alito morse concurrence.fraser reflects the longstanding notions that not all speech is of equal first amendment importance and that speech on matters of public concern is at the heart of the first amendment protection.snyder phelps,quotation marks and citations omitted see also connick myers,s peech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values,and is entitled to special protection.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.and it is only a limited exception to the otherwise bedrock principle of the first amendment that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.texas johnson,see also sable commc ns of,fcc,sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected by the first amendment.the supreme court has never held that schools may bore through that bedrock principle.but it has made clear that minors are entitled to a significant measure of first amendment protection and the government does not have a power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed.brown entm t merchs.ass n.to be sure,fraser rejected the idea that simply because an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point,the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school.fraser,at.as we have explained,though,fraser was limited to plainly lewd speech,and that refusal to protect a student plainly lewd speech where the same speech by an adult would be protected does not extend to political speech that is not plainly lewd.on that score,our conclusion puts us in good company with five justices in who were expressly unwilling to permit a categorical exception to tinker that would intrude on political or social speech and two who all but said as much.
what more,this limitation is consistent with our previous intuitions as well as those of the sixth and second circuits.see saxe,at alito,noting that the dichotomy between fraser and tinker is neatly illustrated by the comparison between cohen fuck the draft jacket and tinker armband defoe,at rejecting the eleventh circuit extension of fraser to displays of the confederate flag and instead holding that such displays by students are protected political speech that school officials may only regulate by satisfying the tinker standard citing barr lefon,cir guiles,at holding fraser inapplicable because the was not as plainly offensive as the sexually charged speech considered in fraser,especially when considering that it was part of an political message.
consequently,we hold that the fraser exception does not permit ambiguously lewd speech to be categorically restricted if it can plausibly be interpreted as political or social speech.
under fraser,schools may restrict plainly lewd speech regardless of whether it could plausibly be interpreted as social or political commentary.
as the supreme court made clear in fraser,though,schools may restrict plainly lewd speech regardless of whether it could plausibly be interpreted to comment on a political or social issue.fraser,at t he first amendment gives a high school student the classroom right to wear tinker armband,but not cohen fuck the draft jacket.that is true by definition.plainly lewd speech offends for the same reasons obscenity offends because the speech in that category is no essential part of any exposition of ideas and thus carries very slight social value.id.at quoting pacifica,at plurality opinion.as with obscenity in general,obscenity to minors,and all other historically unprotected categories of speech,the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,if any,at stake,that no process of adjudication is required because the balance of competing interests is clearly struck.stevens.at quoting new york ferber.in other words,we do not engage in a determination of whether obscenity to minors and by extension,plainly lewd speech under fraser carries social value.as a result,schools may continue to regulate plainly lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive speech under fraser even if a particular instance of such speech can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue.morse,at alito,concurring.
in response,the school district recites a mantra that has fraser providing schools the ultimate discretion to define what is lewd and vulgar.it relies on the supreme court sentiment that schools may define their basic educational mission and prohibit student speech that is inconsistent with that mission.kuhlmeier,at indeed,before morse,some courts of appeals adopted that broad interpretation of the supreme court cases.see,lavine blaine sch,cir a school need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission.boroff van wert city bd.of,cir w here boroff contain symbols and words that promote values that are so patently contrary to the school educational mission,the school has the authority,under the circumstances of this case,to prohibit those under fraser.
whatever the face value of those sentiments,such sweeping and total deference to school officials is incompatible with the supreme court teachings.in tinker,hazelwood,and morse,the supreme court independently evaluated the meaning of the student speech and the reasonableness of the school interpretation and actions.there is no reason the school authority under fraser should receive special treatment.more importantly,such an approach would swallow the other cases,including tinker,effectively eliminating judicial review of restrictions.see guiles,at making this point.that is precisely why the supreme court in morse explicitly rejected total deference to school officials 
the opinion of the court does not endorse the broad argument advanced by petitioners and the united states that the first amendment permits public school officials to censor any student speech that interferes with a school educational mission.the educational mission argument would give public school authorities a license to suppress speech on political and social issues based on disagreement with the viewpoint expressed.the argument,therefore,strikes at the very heart of the first amendment.
morse,at alito,concurring.
instead,morse settled on a narrower view of deference,deferring to a school administrator reasonable judgment that frederick sign qualified as drug advocacy only if the speech could not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.morse,at stevens,dissenting see also id.at majority opinion s chools may restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting illegal drug use.id.at alito,concurring a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use.our approach to lewd speech provides the same degree of deference to schools as the court did in morse.we defer to a school reasonable judgment that an observer could interpret ambiguous speech as lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive only if the speech could not plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.
the school district invokes a parade of horribles that,in its view,would follow from our framework protecting ambiguously lewd speech that comments on political or social issues like the bracelets in this case will encourage students to engage in more egregiously sexualized advocacy campaigns,which the schools will be obliged to allow.see.sch.bd.ass amicus br.in supp.of appellant at listing examples,including i balls apparel for testicular cancer,and i va jay jays apparel for the human papillomaviruses app.raising the possibility of apparel bearing the slogans i balls or i titties.like all arguments,the school district point can be inverted with equal logical force.if schools can categorically regulate terms like boobies even when the message comments on a social or political issue,schools could eliminate all student speech touching on sex or merely having the potential to offend.see frederick schauer,slippery slopes,harv,i n virtually every case in which a slippery slope argument is made,the opposing party could with equal formal and linguistic logic also make a slippery slope claim.the ease of turning a argument on its head explains why the persuasiveness of such a contention does not depend on its logical validity.id.instead,the correctness of a argument depends on an empirical prediction that a proposed rule will increase the likelihood of some other undesired outcome occurring.id.to some people,one argument will seem more persuasive than the other because the underlying empirical reality makes one equally logical possibility seem substantially more likely to occur than the other.see also eugene volokh,the mechanism of the slippery slope,harv,making a similar point in the context of extending precedent.because courts usually lack the data necessary for such a prediction,fear of what at the bottom of a long,slippery slope is not a good reason for today decision.marozsan united states,cir en banc easterbrook,dissenting.the terror of extreme hypotheticals produces much bad law,and so our answer to the school district extreme hypothetical s is that we will cross that bridge when we come to it.id.
to make matters worse,the school district has greased the supposedly slippery slope by omitting any empirical evidence.we have no reason to think either that the parents of students will be willing to allow their children to wear apparel advocating political or social messages in egregious terms or that a student will overcome the typical embarrassment,immaturity,and social pressures by wearing such apparel.and many of the school district hypotheticals pose no worries under our framework.a school could categorically restrict an i tits keep a breast bracelet because,as the supreme court explained in pacifica,the word tits and also presumably the diminutive titties is a patently offensive reference to sexual organs and thus obscene to minors.see pacifica,at plurality opinion explaining that the comedian george carlin seven dirty words,which includes tits,offend for the same reasons that obscenity offends see also lavine,at concluding that a poem filled with imagery of violent death and suicide was not vulgar,lewd,obscene,or plainly offensive because it was not an elaborate,graphic,and explicit sexual metaphor as was the student speech in fraser,nor did it contain the infamous seven words that can not be said on the public airwaves fcc fox television stations,concluding it was not arbitrary or capricious for the fcc to regulate even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words,including carlin seven dirty words,because e ven isolated utterances can be made in pander ing,vulgar and shocking manners and can thus constitute harmful first blow s to children alterations in original.the same is true of a student drawings of stick figures in sexual positions,even if used to promote contraceptive use.ex rel.ochshorn city sch,cir.and even if students engage in more questionable speech,the school retains the government normal sovereign authority to regulate speech as well as its additional powers as educator to restrict speech under tinker,kuhlmeier,and morse.see,hardwick heyward,cir holding that a school prohibition on wearing depicting the confederate battle flag was permissible under tinker because of a history of racial tension and disruptions related to the confederate flag.
by contrast,there is empirical support for the opposite worry.some schools,if empowered to do so,might eliminate all student speech touching on sex or merely having the potential to offend.indeed,the middle school administrators seemed inclined to do just that.they initially testified that they could ban the word breast,even if used in the context of a campaign,because the word,by itself,can be construed as having a sexual connotation.app.if anything,the fear of a slippery slope cuts against the school district.
in a similar vein,we need not speculate on hypotheticals to give guidance to schools and district courts.the fault lines of our framework are adequately mapped out in the rest of first amendment jurisprudence.the supreme court case law marks the contours of plainly lewd speech.see,brown entm t merchs.ass n,refusing to extend the categorical nonprotection for obscenity to minors to speech that is violent from a minor perspective ginsberg,at approving a state prohibition on selling minors sexual material that would be obscene from the minor perspective.those contours necessarily admit of some flexibility and can be adjust ed to social realities by permitting the sexual appeal of this type of material to be assessed from the minors perspective.see also fox television stations,at explaining that based on the case law,the fcc properly dr aws distinctions between the offensiveness of particular words based upon the context in which they appeared on basis without having to rely on empirical evidence as to the degree of offensiveness.and the government is not a stranger to determining whether speech plausibly comments on a political or social issue.for that,we look to case law on whether speech involves a matter of public concern.see,garcetti ceballos,pickering and the cases decided in its wake identify two inquiries to guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded to public employee speech.the first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern if the answer is yes,then the possibility of a first amendment claim arises.of course,these rules lack perfect clarity just as every legal rule contains fuzzy borders.brown.at breyer,dissenting united states williams,p erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.even so,just because a precise standard for political speech or plain lewdness obscenity to minors proves elusive,it is still easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate regulation.brown.at breyer,dissenting.over time,the fault lines demarcating plainly lewd speech and political or social speech will settle and become more as precedent accumulates.
to recap under the government sovereign authority,a school may categorically ban obscenity,fighting words,and the like in schools the cases do not supplant the government sovereign powers to regulate speech.see,doe pulaski cnty.special sch,cir en banc holding that the government,as k educator,could punish a student for making a true threat cuff ex rel.valley cent.sch,cir pooler,dissenting indeed,despite the expansion of exceptions to the first amendment general prohibition against government restrictions on speech,certain rules apply to adults and adolescents alike.under fraser,a school may categorically restrict plainly lewd,vulgar,or profane speech that offends for the same reasons obscenity offends regardless of whether it can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on social or political issues.saxe,at quoting fraser,at.as we have explained,see supra at,plainly lewd speech can not,by definition,be plausibly interpreted as political or social commentary because the speech offends for the same reason obscenity offends and thus has slight social value.fraser also permits a school to categorically restrict ambiguous speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as having a lewd,vulgar,or profane meaning so long as it could not also plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a social or political issue.but fraser does not permit a school to categorically restrict ambiguous speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as having a lewd,vulgar,or profane meaning and could plausibly interpret as commenting on a social or political issue.and of course,if a reasonable observer could not interpret the speech as lewd,vulgar,or profane,then fraser simply does not apply.as always,a school other powers over student speech under tinker,kuhlmeier,and morse remain as a backstop.
c.the middle school ban on i boobies keep a breast bracelets 
under this framework,the school district bracelet ban is an case.the i boobies keep a breast bracelets are not plainly lewd.the slogan bears no resemblance to fraser pervasive sexual innuendo that was plainly offensive to both teachers and students.fraser,at.teachers had to request guidance about how to deal with the bracelets,and school administrators did not conclude that the bracelets were vulgar until and had worn them every day for nearly two months.in addition,the middle school used the term boobies in announcing the bracelet ban over the public address system and the school television station.what more,the bracelets do not contain language remotely akin to the seven words that are considered obscene to minors on broadcast television.pacifica,at plurality opinion lavine,at concluding that speech was not vulgar,lewd,obscene,or plainly offensive because it was not an elaborate,graphic,and explicit sexual metaphor as was the student speech in fraser,nor did it contain the infamous seven words that can not be said on the public airwaves under pacified.indeed,the term boobie is no more than a sophomoric synonym for breast.and as the school district also concedes,a reasonable observer would plausibly interpret the bracelets as part of a national campaign,an undeniably important social issue.oral arg.tr.at see also ex rel.braun sauk prairie sch,cv,slip op.at,when one reads the entire phrase,it is clearly a message designed to promote breast cancer awareness.accordingly,the bracelets can not be categorically banned under fraser 
fraser,of course,is only one of four avenues for regulating student speech the parties rightly agree that kuhlmeier and morse do not apply no one could reasonably believe that the middle school was somehow involved in the morning fashion decisions of a few students,and no one could reasonably interpret the bracelets as advocating illegal drug use.
that leaves only tinker as possible support for the school district ban.under tinker general rule,the government may restrict school speech that threatens a specific and substantial disruption to the school environment or inva des the rights of others.saxe,at citing tinker,at.i f a school can point to a expectation of disruption especially one based on past incidents arising out of similar speech the restriction may pass constitutional muster.id.at blue mountain sch,cir en banc t he school district need not prove with absolute certainty that substantial disruption will occur.the school district has the burden of showing that the bracelet ban is constitutional under tinker.see,at.that it can not do.
tinker meant what it said a specific and significant fear of disruption,not just some remote apprehension of disturbance.id.tinker black armbands did not meet this standard,even though the armbands caused comments,warnings by other students,the poking of fun at them,a warning by an older football player that other,nonprotesting students had better let them alone,and the wreck ing of a math teacher lesson period.tinker,at black,dissenting.
here,the record of disruption is even skimpier.when the school district announced the bracelet ban,it had no more than an undifferentiated fear or remote apprehension of disturbance.sypniewski,at.the bracelets had been on campus for at least two weeks without incident,d at see also app.n one of the three principals had heard any reports of disruption or student misbehavior linked to the bracelets.nor had any of the principals heard reports of inappropriate comments about boobies.that track record speaks strongly against a finding of likelihood of disruption.sypniewski,at.
the school district instead relies on two incidents that occurred after the ban.in one,a female student told a teacher that she believed some boys had remarked to girls about their boobies in relation to the bracelets an incident that was never confirmed.b,d at.in the other,two female students were discussing the bracelets during lunch,and a boy interrupted them to say i want boobies while making inappropriate gestures with two spherical candies.id.the boy was suspended for a day.id.
even assuming that disruption arising after a school speech restriction could satisfy tinker a question we need not decide two isolated incidents hardly bespeak a substantial disruption caused by the bracelets.s tudent expression may not be suppressed simply because it gives rise to some slight,easily overlooked disruption,including but not limited to a showing of mild curiosity by other students,discussion and comment among students,or even some hostile remarks or discussion outside of the classrooms by other students.holloman ex rel.holloman harland,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.given that tinker black armband worn to protest a controversial war and divisive enough to prompt reactions from other students was not a substantial disruption,neither is the silent,passive expression of awareness tinker,at.if anything,the fact that these incidents did not occur until after the school district banned the bracelets suggests that the ban exacerbated rather than contained the disruption in the school,at drawing this same conclusion on a similar record.
undeterred,the school district invokes the other half of tinker general rule,arguing that the bracelets invade other students title ix rights to be free from sexual harassment.see tinker,at.under title ix,students may sue schools that act with deliberate indifference to harassment that is so severe,pervasive,and objectively offensive that the victim students are effectively denied equal access to an institution resources and opportunities.saxe,at quoting davis ex rel.lashonda monroe cnty.bd.of.according to the school district,the i boobies keep a breast bracelet was deemed inappropriate for school due to the likelihood of a resultant increase in sexual harassment.sch.dist.br.at.
that argument suffers from several flaws,not the least of which is the school district failure to raise it in the district court and that court consequent failure to address it.freeman pittsburgh glass works,llc,cir we generally refuse to consider issues that the parties have not raised below.citing singleton wulff.but there is an even more basic reason why the school district invocation of title ix is not the shield it claims to be.even assuming that protecting students from harassment under title ix would satisfy tinker prong the school district does not explain why the bracelets would breed an environment of pervasive and severe harassment.see,dejohn temple,cir u nless harassment is qualified with a standard akin to a severe or pervasive requirement,an harassment policy may suppress core protected speech.saxe,at rejecting a school district similar argument that it could ban speech creating a hostile environment without showing that the particular speech covered by the policy would create a severe or pervasive environment see also nuxoll ex rel.nuxoll indian prairie sch.dist,cir i t is highly speculative that allowing the plaintiff to wear a that says be happy,not gay would have even a slight tendency to provoke such incidents of harassment,or for that matter to poison the educational atmosphere.
the bracelet ban can not be upheld on the authority of tinker.
because the school district ban can not pass scrutiny under fraser or tinker,and are likely to succeed on the merits.in light of that conclusion,the remaining factors also favor them.the ban prevents and from exercising their right to freedom of speech,which unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.ex rel.ayers pocono mountain sch,cir quoting elrod burns,plurality opinion.an money judgment would hardly make up for their lost opportunity to wear the bracelets in school.see elrod,at the timeliness of political speech is particularly important.
and the preliminary injunction does not result in even greater harm to the school district,the party.alleg hen y energy,dqe,cir.the school district complains that unless the bracelet ban stands,it has no clear guidance on how to enforce its dress code.appellant br.at.but the injunction addresses only the school district ban of the i boobies keep a breast bracelets.it does not enjoin the school district regulation of other types of apparel,such as the save the or apparel bearing the phrase feelmyballs.org.whether the injunction stays or goes,the school district will have to continue making individualized assessments of whether it may restrict student speech consistent with the first amendment,just as school administrators have always had to do.see,castorina ex rel.rewt madison cnty.sch,cir the foregoing discussion of the three supreme court cases demonstrates the importance of the factual circumstances in school speech cases.the district court injunction against the bracelet ban does not change that.
lastly,granting the preliminary injunction furthers the public interest.the school district argues that the injunction eliminates its authority to manage its student population and thus harms the public.appellant br.at.again,that hyperbolic protest ignores the narrow breadth of the injunction,which addresses only the constitutionality of the bracelet ban under the facts of this case.more importantly,allowing a school unconstitutional speech restriction to continue vindicates no public interest,wl,at citation omitted.for these reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion by enjoining the school district bracelet ban.
school administrators have a difficult job,and we are that the job is not getting any easier.morse,u.at.besides the teaching function,school administrators must deal with students distracted by cell phones in class and poverty at home,parental under and,bullying and sexting,preparing students for standardized testing,and funding.when they are not focused on those issues,school administrators must inculcate students with the shared values of a civilized social order.fraser,at see also mccauley of the,cir quoting brown bd.of,public elementary and high school education is as much about learning how to be a good citizen as it is about multiplication tables and united states history.
we do not envy those challenges,which require school administrators to make numerous difficult decisions about when to place restrictions on speech in our public schools.morgan swanson,cir en banc majority opinion of elrod.and the school district in this case was not unreasonably concerned that permitting i boobies keep a breast bracelets in this case might require it to permit other messages that were sexually oriented in nature.but schools can not avoid teaching our how to appropriately navigate the marketplace of ideas.just because letting in one idea might invite even more difficult judgment calls about other ideas can not justify suppressing speech of genuine social value.tinker,at the classroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas.the nation future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues,rather than through any kind of authoritative selection.quoting keyishian bd.of regents of of state of,see id.at s chool officials can not suppress expressions of feelings with which they do not wish to contend.citation omitted.
we will affirm the district court order granting a preliminary injunction.
today the court holds that have a constitutional right to wear in school a bracelet that says i boobies keep a breast.because this decision is inconsistent with the supreme court first amendment jurisprudence,i respectfully dissent.
my colleagues conclude that the supreme court decision in bethel school district fraser,can not justify the easton area school district bracelet ban because the bracelets comment on a social issue.typescript at.this limitation on the ability of schools to regulate student speech that could reasonably be deemed lewd,vulgar,plainly offensive,or constituting sexual innuendo finds no support in fraser or its progeny.the majority high value speech modification of fraser is based on the following two premises it derives from the supreme court decision in morse frederick,first,that justice alito concurrence in morse is the controlling opinion in that case,typescript at,and second,that morse modified the supreme court decision in fraser,typescript at.both premises are wrong.
i begin with the majority first premise,namely,that justice alito concurrence in morse is the controlling opinion in that case,despite the fact that chief justice roberts majority opinion was joined in full by four other justices.typescript at.this distinctly minority view is contrary both to the understanding of morse expressed by eight of our sister courts of appeals and to what we ourselves have repeatedly articulated to be the court holding in morse.by endorsing the fifth circuit mistaken understanding of morse,the majority applies an incorrect legal standard that leads to the unfortunate result the court reaches today.
the notion that justice alito concurrence in morse is the controlling opinion flows from a misunderstanding of the supreme court narrowest grounds doctrine as established in marks united states.in marks,the petitioners had been convicted of distributing obscene materials pursuant to jury instructions that were modeled on the definition of obscenity articulated in miller california.marks,at.because the petitioners conduct occurred before the court had decided miller,they argued that due process entitled them to jury instructions not under miller,but under the more favorable obscenity formulation of memoirs massachusetts.id.that formulation was unclear,however,because the memoirs court had issued a fractured decision no more than three of the six justices who voted for the judgment endorsed any one of three separate opinions,each of which articulated a different standard for obscenity.see memoirs massachusetts,plurality opinion justice brennan,joined by chief justice warren and justice fortas,stating that obscenity may be proscribed if it is utterly without redeeming social value id.at,black and douglas,concurring in judgment concurring separately on the grounds that obscenity can not be proscribed id.at stewart,concurring in judgment concurring on the grounds that only pornography is proscribable as obscene.the lack of a majority opinion in memoirs led the sixth circuit in marks to reject the petitioners argument that the plurality utterly without redeeming social value standard was the governing rule.it reasoned that because the memoirs standards never commanded the assent of more than three justices at any one time memoirs never became the law.marks,at describing the lower court holding.
on appeal,the supreme court rejected the sixth circuit reasoning and articulated the following standard when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds id.at quoting gregg georgia,plurality opinion.based on this reasoning,the court concluded that because three justices joined the plurality opinion and justices black and douglas concurred on broader grounds,t he view of the memoirs plurality constituted the holding of the court and provided the governing standards.marks,at.
as marks demonstrates,the narrowest grounds rule is a necessary tool for deciphering the holding of the court when there is no majority opinion.see,grutter bollinger,attempting to apply the marks rule to derive a holding in the fractured decision regents of the university of california bakke.contrary to the majority holding today,neither marks nor other supreme court decisions support the unprecedented argument that a statement of legal opinion joined by five justices of th e court does not carry the force of law,vasquez hillery.rather,the narrowest grounds rule applies only to discern a single holding of the court in cases in which no opinion on the issue in question has garnered the support of a majority.black law dictionary ed defining a majority opinion as a n opinion joined in by more than half the judges considering a given case.
unable to find persuasive supreme court authority to buttress its novel reading of marks,the majority argues that our court has applied the approach in circumstances beyond those posed by marks,including to determine holdings in majority opinions.typescript at footnotes,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.for support,the majority cites our decisions in horn thoratec,cir,and united states bishop,cir.typescript at.neither case counsels the majority application of the doctrine to interpret morse.
in horn,we looked to justice breyer concurrence in medtronic lohr,for guidance on how to address an issue central to our case,but that the lohr court discussed only in dicta.see horn,at comparing justice breyer more narrow view on preemption with justice stevens sweeping pronouncement in his plurality opinion that the statute at issue almost never preempts a state common law claim.likewise,in bishop,we cited justice kennedy concurrence in united states lopez,in order to reinforce the already established principle that courts must exercise great restraint before a court finds congress to have overstepped its commerce power despite lopez revolutionary holding.bishop,at quoting lopez,at kennedy,concurring.critically,in neither of these cases did we indicate a belief that a concurring justice can create a new rule of law simply by both asking and answering a question left unaddressed by the majority opinion.in fact,we noted that justice breyer concurrence in horn was particularly persuasive because justice breyer did not discuss issues in his concurring opinion that justice stevens,writing on behalf of the plurality,did not reach.horn,at.that is not the case here.
the majority concedes that a concurring justice opinion can not add to what the majority opinion holds by binding the other four j ustices to what they have not said.typescript at quoting mckoy north carolina,scalia,dissenting.yet by holding that justice alito concurrence controls the majority opinion in morse,typescript at,the majority violates this very principle.the majority in morse noted that this is plainly not a case about political debate,morse,at,and refused to address what the result of the case would have been had frederick banner been political.the majority implies that justice alito concurrence provides a definitive,controlling answer to fill the void left by the morse majority opinion,but the supreme court has disavowed this approach the court would be in an odd predicament if a concurring minority of the justices could force the majority to address a point they found it unnecessary and did not wish to address,under compulsion of the dissent new principle that silence implies agreement.alexander sandoval.put another way,a majority holding is not made coextensive with the concurrence because the majority opinion does not expressly preclude is consistent with the concurrence approach.id.
notwithstanding the majority statement to the contrary,we have never applied the marks rule to hold that a concurrence may an opinion joined by at least five justices.rather,consistent with marks,we have looked to the votes of dissenting justices if they,combined with votes from plurality or concurring opinions,establish a majority view on the relevant issue.united states donovan,cir emphasis added see also student pub.interest research grp.of,v.at t bell,cir.in donovan,we used marks to analyze the supreme court fractured decision in rapanos united states,a case in which only three other justices joined justice scalia plurality opinion and four others dissented.donovan,at.nowhere did we suggest that marks would have been applicable had rapanos featured a single majority opinion.likewise,in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania casey,cir,rev on other grounds,we held that marks stands for the proposition that the controlling opinion in a splintered decision is that of the justice or justices who concur on the narrowest grounds.casey,f d at emphasis added.we then applied this principle while interpreting the supreme court plurality decisions in webster reproductive health services,and hodgson minnesota.see casey,at noting that in webster t he five justices in the majority issued three opinions,none of which garnered five votes on the legal issue in dispute,and that hodgson was decided in a similar manner.once again,we gave no indication that marks would have applied had five justices or more joined the same opinion.
i also find it significant that,in the six years since morse was decided,nine of ten appellate courts have cited as its holding the following standard articulated by chief justice roberts in his opinion for the court a principal may,consistent with the first amendment,restrict student speech at a school event,when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use,morse,at not one of these courts indicated that justice alito concurrence controls,or that his dicta regarding political or social speech altered or circumscribed the court holding in morse.we too have articulated the import of morse consistent with these eight appellate courts i n morse,the court held that schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use.ex rel.ayers pocono mountain sch,cir citation omitted this widespread consensus is further proof that chief justice roberts majority opinion,not justice alito concurrence,is the controlling opinion in morse.
before today,only the fifth circuit had held otherwise.see morgan piano indep.sch,cir we have held justice alito concurrence to be the controlling opinion in morse.citing ponce socorro indep.sch,cir see also morgan,at interpreting the holding in morse to be that schools may regulate speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and that could not be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue internal quotation marks omitted however,the fifth circuit did not cite marks or any other narrowest grounds case and provided no justification to support its conclusion that justice alito concurrence is the controlling opinion in morse.as the seventh circuit has aptly noted 
the plaintiff calls justice alito concurrence the controlling opinion in morse because justices alito and kennedy were part of a majority,so that their votes were crucial to the decision.but they joined the majority opinion,not just the decision,and by doing so they made it a majority opinion and not merely,as the plaintiff believes as does the fifth circuit,ponce socorro independent school district,cir,a plurality opinion.the concurring justices wanted to emphasize that in allowing a school to forbid student speech that encourages the use of illegal drugs the court was not giving schools carte blanche to regulate student speech.and they were expressing their own view of the permissible scope of such regulation.
nuxoll ex rel.nuxoll indian prarie sch.dist,f d,cir emphasis added citation omitted.this interpretation of the relationship between justice alito concurrence and the majority opinion in morse is the correct one because it is faithful to marks and its progeny.
for the reasons stated,i would not read justice alito concurrence as altering or circumscribing a majority opinion for the court that he joined in toto.thus,the court holding in morse remains the familiar articulation that has been consistently stated,time and again,by this court and eight other courts of appeals a principal may,consistent with the first amendment,restrict student speech at a school event,when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.morse,at.
if justice alito concurrence is not the controlling opinion in morse,the majority has committed legal error by engrafting his dicta regarding social or political commentary as a limitation upon the ability of schools to regulate speech that runs afoul of fraser.but even assuming,arguendo,that justice alito concurrence alters or circumscribes the court opinion in morse,it is far from clear that it had anything to say about the realm fraser carved out of tinker des moines independent community school district.
tinker established the general rule that student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.morse,at quoting tinker,at see also,saxe state coll.area sch,cir.tinker substantial disruption test does not apply in every case,however.as alito wrote when he was a member of this court,the supreme court has carved out a number of narrow categories of speech that a school may restrict even without the threat of substantial disruption.id.at see also,at emphasizing that the exceptions to tinker are narrow.first came fraser,in which the supreme court held that schools may restrict the manner in which a student conveys his message by forbidding and punishing the use of lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive speech.see fraser,at.then,in hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,the court held that administrators may regulate speech that is or could reasonably be viewed as the school own speech.id.at.most recently,in morse the court held that schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use.morse,at.
as these cases indicate,s ince tinker,every supreme court decision looking at student speech has expanded the kinds of speech schools can regulate.palmer ex rel.palmer waxahachie indep.sch,cir morse,at thomas,concurring observing that the court has since scaled back tinker standard,or rather set the standard aside on an ad hoc basis.in derogation of this consistent trend,the majority makes us the first united states court of appeals to suggest that morse has circumscribed fraser,thereby limiting the ability of teachers and administrators to regulate student speech.
in addition to overriding the careful steps taken to allow schools to regulate student speech since tinker,the majority errs by placing morse at the center of a case that has nothing whatsoever to do with illegal drug use.that morse is not central to this case is borne out by the way the case was litigated and adjudicated.the district court concluded that only the standards of tinker and fraser are implicated,and neither party ever argued otherwise.see easton area sch,d,the two supreme court cases examining student speech that are most relevant to this case are fraser and tinker.i the school district primarily contends that the i boobies bracelets are prescribable because they express sexual innuendo that can reasonably be classified in the middle school context as lewd,vulgar,and indecent speech.plaintiffs rejoin that the word boobies is neither inherently sexual nor vulgar,especially when conspicuously tied to breast cancer awareness.until the case reached the en banc court,no party or judge had suggested that morse provided the governing standard for this dispute.and rightly so,because this is a fraser case,not a morse case,and there are critical differences between the two.
courts have recognized,time and again,that the three exceptions to tinker general rule are independent.see,saxe,at.the supreme court has given no in morse or any of its subsequent it has modified the standard,first articulated in fraser more than years ago,that governs how schools are to regulate speech they may reasonably deem lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive.moreover,although the appellate courts have had dozens of opportunities to do so,no court has suggested that morse qualified fraser in any way.since morse,we have had occasion to consider fraser and have consistently interpreted it to permit school officials to regulate lewd,vulgar,indecent,and plainly offensive speech in school,at quoting saxe,at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted see also,at in fraser,the court held that schools may restrict the manner in which a student conveys his message by forbidding and punishing the use of lewd,vulgar,indecent,and plainly offensive speech.citation omitted layshock ex rel.layshock hermitage sch,cir same.
in fact,the appellate opinions addressing morse,fraser,and kuhlmeier treat them as independent analytical constructs that permit schools to regulate certain types of speech that would otherwise be protected under tinker.see,hardwick,at w e must continue to adhere to the tinker test in cases that do not fall within any exceptions that the supreme court has created until the court directs otherwise.doninger,at b ecause the were not vulgar,could not reasonably be perceived to bear the school imprimatur,and did not encourage drug use,they could be subject to regulation different from that permissible for adults in settings only if they threatened substantial disruption to the work and discipline of the school.citations omitted.it is especially notable that even the fifth circuit,which mistakenly held that justice alito concurrence in morse is controlling,continues to treat the tinker as independent exceptions rather than overlapping categories of proscribable speech.see morgan,at cir characterizing fraser as holding schools may prohibit lewd,vulgar,obscene or plainly offensive student speech and,in the same string citation,separately characterizing morse as holding that schools may regulate speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and that could not be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue citations omitted.the majority own analysis demonstrates that threshold questions in a school speech case are whether the speech at issue is governed by one of the three tinker and,if not,whether the school acted properly under tinker.see typescript at.
in addition,we have emphasized that the touch on several narrow categories of speech that a school may restrict even without the threat of substantial disruption,f d at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.this does not mean,as the majority suggests,that the narrow one another.see typescript at citing,at.rather,it is simply a recognition that they are narrow within their separate spheres.indeed,courts have been especially careful to underscore the narrowness of the court holding in morse.see,defoe,at t he morse holding was a narrow one,determining no more than that a public school may prohibit student expression at school or at events during school hours that can be reasonably viewed as promoting drug use.emphasis added citation omitted barr,at same farmington r sch,cir same.
in,we too recognized the narrowness of the court holding in morse,at there,we declared that morse did not apply to a school punishment of a student for creating a myspace profile using graphic language and imagery to disparage her teacher,see,at indisputably,neither kuhlmeier nor morse governs this case.instead,we indicated that the only way for the punishment to pass constitutional muster is if speech can be prohibited under the fraser exception to tinker.id.at.if the proper standard under fraser is the majority formulation of whether a student lewd speech may plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a social or political issue,surely we would have considered whether online profile touched on any such issue.instead of doing so,we applied the fraser test while disavowing the relevance of morse.
the fact that courts have maintained analytical separation among the different tinker makes sense because the supreme court created each one for a unique purpose.in we addressed these vital interests that enable school officials to exercise control over student speech even in the absence of a substantial disruption,at.the vital interest at issue in morse that allow s schools to restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting illegal drug use is the special characteristics of the school environment,and the governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse.id.quoting morse,at.fraser allowed schools to punish lewd,indecent,or offensive speech,at,to further society interest in teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior,at quoting fraser,at.and in kuhlmeier,the interest that entitle s educators to exercise greater control over publications is to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach,that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity,and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school,at quoting kuhlmeier,at.the court willingness to curtail the first amendment rights of students to enable schools to achieve these important goals vindicates the principle that the rights of students must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.morse,at quoting kuhlmeier,at.because each case was intended to address a separate concern,i disagree with the majority that language qualifying one type of applies equally to the others.
in sum,morse narrow holding does not apply unless a school has regulated student speech that it viewed as advocating illegal drug use.notwithstanding its critical reliance on morse,at one point the majority seems to agree that morse does not apply to this case when it states that no one could reasonably interpret the bracelets as advocating illegal drug use.typescript at.the majority ca have it both ways.the decision to engraft justice alito morse concurrence onto fraser erodes the analytical distinction between the two lines of cases and turns this appeal into some sort of hybrid.the law governing restrictions on student speech can be difficult and confusing,even for lawyers,law professors,and judges.the relevant supreme court cases can be hard to reconcile,and courts often struggle to determine which standard applies in any particular case.doninger,at.by using morse to modify the distinct established in fraser,the majority has muddied the waters and further encumbered the ability of educators to run their schools.
the majority attempts to make more palatable its decision to engraft morse supposed prohibition of any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue onto fraser.for instance,it claims that the supreme court did not believe that fraser speech could plausibly be interpreted as political or social commentary.typescript at.by claiming that such an interpretation of matthew fraser speech nominating a fellow student for student elective office,fraser,at,is wholly implausible,the majority demonstrates the difficulties that arise when it blends together the disparate tinker.
as the majority rightly notes,the fraser court opined that there was a marked distinction between the political message of the armbands in tinker and the sexual content of fraser speech.typescript at quoting fraser,at.that does not mean,however,that it was implausible to conclude that fraser speech was political.if it were truly implausible to interpret fraser speech as commenting on any political or social issue,one must wonder why the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit characterized fraser speech as student political and a campaign speech.fraser bethel sch.dist,cir,rev,id.at wright,dissenting.the three appellate judges who heard fraser case were deemed by the supreme court to have erred when they likened his speech to tinker armband,but that does not mean that it was implausible for those three judges to view fraser speech as political.it was,after all,a campaign speech.
a brief hypothetical further demonstrates the problems posed by the majority articulation of the fraser.suppose a student makes a speech at a school assembly.like matthew fraser speech,the content is about supporting a candidate for office,but the sexual references are muted enough such that the majority would deem them ambiguously lewd instead of plainly lewd.if the student speech is about a classmate running for school office,the majority would say that the school may punish the speaker.but if an identical speech is given and the classmate name is replaced with the name of a candidate for president,mayor,or even school board,the majority would conclude that the first amendment insulates the student speech.in my view,the two speeches are indistinguishable under fraser.
in sum,the majority approach vindicates any speech cloaked in a political or social message even if a reasonable observer could deem it lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive.in both cases,the inappropriate language is identical,but the speech is constitutionally protected as long as it meets the majority cramped definition of politics or its notion of what constitutes social commentary.fraser repudiated this very idea.the first amendment guarantees wide freedom in matters of adult public discourse it does not follow,however,that simply because the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point,the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school.fraser,at emphasis added.
as noted,the majority holds that fraser permits a school to categorically restrict ambiguous speech that a reasonable observer could interpret as having a lewd,vulgar,or profane meaning,but only so long as it could not also plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a social or political issue.typescript at.it is important to emphasize here that,despite my disagreement with the second part of the majority formulation,i agree fully with its understanding of the inquiry compelled under fraser.see typescript discussing why courts should defer to a school decisions to restrict what a reasonable observer would interpret as lewd,vulgar,profane,or offensive 
the majority did not find that the school interpretation of the bracelets message as lewd was objectively unreasonable.see typescript at w e need not determine whether a reasonable observer could interpret the bracelets slogan as lewd.thus,had the majority not engrafted justice alito concurrence in morse onto the fraser standard,my colleagues might agree that the school did not violate the first amendment when it proscribed the bracelet.because the majority chose not to analyze whether the school was reasonable in determining that the bracelet could be proscribed under fraser,however,i will briefly discuss why that is so.
in this close case,the i boobies keep a breast bracelets would seem to fall into a gray area between speech that is plainly lewd and merely indecorous.because i think it objectively reasonable to interpret the bracelets,in the middle school context,as inappropriate sexual innuendo and double entendre,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the preliminary injunction.
the district court correctly ascertained the standard of review to apply in a case that arises under fraser,but proceeded to misapply that standard.first,by emphasizing whether plaintiffs intended a vulgar or sexual meaning in their i boobies bracelets and determining that a nonsexual,interpretation of the bracelets was reasonable,the court inverted the proper question.instead of asking whether it was reasonable to view the bracelets as an innocuous expression of breast cancer awareness,the district court should have asked whether the school officials interpretation of the bracelets,as expressing sexual attraction to breasts was reasonable.so long as the school district interpretation was objectively reasonable,the ban did not contravene the first amendment or our jurisprudence.
second,in its substantive conclusion that i boobies can not reasonably be regarded as lewd or vulgar,the district court highlighted the bracelets social value while disregarding their likely meaning to immature as the school district argues,the fact that plaintiffs laudable awareness message could be discerned from the bracelets does not render the school district ban unconstitutional.i boobies not only expresses support for those afflicted with breast cancer,but also conveys a sexual attraction to the female breast.
it is true that certain facts indicate that a sexual interpretation of the i boobies bracelets may be at the outer edge of how a reasonable observer would interpret speech.most obviously,the bracelets always modify the i boobies phrase with keep a breast or other messages.when one reads the entire phrase,it is clearly a message designed to promote breast cancer awareness.sauk prairie sch,cv,slip op.at.additionally,school administrators did not immediately recognize the bracelets as vulgar or lewd students had been wearing the bracelets for two months before they were banned,and teachers had to request guidance on whether and how to deal with the bracelets.moreover,the school itself was compelled to use the word boobies over the public address system and school television station in order to describe the proscribed bracelets,which suggests that the word alone is not patently offensive.
notwithstanding the facts supporting plaintiffs case,i conclude that i boobies can reasonably be interpreted as inappropriate sexual double entendre.in the middle school context,the phrase can mean both i support measures and i am attracted to female breasts.many twelve and children are susceptible to juvenile sexualization of messages that would be innocuous to a reasonable adult.indeed,at least one acknowledged that immature boys might read a lewd meaning into the bracelets and conceded that she understood why the school might want to ban the bracelets,d at,and other students parroted the phrase on the bracelets while conveying sexual attraction to breasts.another school administrator has concluded that the bracelets at issue here elicit attention by sexualizing the cause of breast cancer awareness.sauk prairie,cv,at.and as judge crabb,the only other federal judge to consider these bracelets,put it in sauk prairie,hints of vulgarity and sexuality in the bracelets attract attention and provoke conversation,a ploy that is effective for kabf target audience of immature middle school students.id.at.finally,as the gender equality amicus brief points out,breasts are ubiquitously sexualized in american culture.
the easton area middle school principals willingness to say boobies to the entire school audience does not imply that the word does not have a sexual meaning it merely suggests that boobies is not plainly lewd.moreover,although kabf decision not to market its products through porn stars and at truck stops is laudable,the interest such organizations have shown in the bracelets is further evidence that the bracelets are read by many to contain a sexual meaning.and the i boobies bracelets breast cancer message is not so obvious or overwhelming as to eliminate the double entendre.for one thing,the bracelets come in many colors other than the shade of pink widely associated with the fight against breast cancer.
additionally,although plaintiffs and their amici argue that the casual language of the i boobies bracelets is intended to make breast cancer issues more accessible and less stigmatized for girls and young women,that purpose does not undermine the plausibility of a sexual interpretation of the bracelets.nor does the fact that these plaintiffs mothers were happy not only to purchase the bracelets for their teenage daughters but also to wear them render the bracelets immune from school regulation.the mothers intent that the bracelets convey a message,like plaintiffs own subjective motive,is irrelevant to interpreting the meaning of the speech.
likewise,the school district administrators subjective beliefs,expressed at the time of the ban and later during this litigation,do not affect my determination of whether it is objectively reasonable to infer a sexualized meaning from the bracelets.their failure to use the words lewd,vulgar,indecent,or plainly offensive is not fatal to their claim of regulatory authority.similarly,some principals inconsistent testimony regarding what other phrases they might censor does not make the phrase at issue here more or less vulgar.therefore,it is not probative that administrators intermittently indicated that they thought the word breast by itself has an impermissible sexual connotation.
plaintiffs rely on the initial statements by teachers at the middle school that the word breast alone in any context and the phrases breast cancer awareness and.org could also be banned to argue that the school district has left them no other means to convey their message.but those words were not,students are permitted to wear kabf check y urself keep a breast the administrators changed their position prior to the evidentiary hearing,opining that such phrases would not be inappropriate at school.also significant is the fact that the easton area middle school has not stifled the message of breast cancer awareness in the course of a robust breast cancer awareness campaign it merely imposed a permissible restriction on the way in which that message may be expressed.see saxe,at fraser speaks to the form and manner of student speech,not its substance.it addresses the mode of expression,not its content or viewpoint.citation omitted.
nor is plaintiffs position saved by the fact that the i boobies phrase was chosen to enhance the effectiveness of the communication to the target audience,d at.the district court focus on the strategic purpose of the words and format used in the bracelets was misguided.if indecency were permitted in schools merely because it was intended to advance some laudable goal,matthew fraser speech would have been constitutionally protected insofar as he intended to win the attention of his classmates while advocating the election of his friend.
finally,if we were to hold that the breast cancer message here makes any sexual reading of the bracelets unreasonable,schools would be obliged to permit more egregiously sexual advocacy messages.as divietro acknowledged,other bodily parts in the human anatomy can get cancer and other types of slang terms would have to be condoned.app.divietro raised the specter of an i balls slogan to support testicular cancer awareness.id.at.these examples are not speculative.the testicular cancer awareness project sells feelmyballs bracelets to encourage male and general awareness.see testicular cancer awareness project,http last visited june.if middle school students have a constitutional right to wear i boobies bracelets,it would be difficult to articulate a limiting principle that would disallow these other catchy phrases,so long as they were aimed at some socially beneficial objective.
simply stated,the district court correctly articulated the proper standard of review to be applied in cases that implicate fraser such as this one,but it strayed from that standard when evaluating the reasonableness of plaintiffs intended meaning.for that reason,and because the school district reading of i boobies as inappropriate sexual double entendre was a reasonable interpretation in the middle school context,i would hold that plaintiffs can not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction.
as this case demonstrates,running a school is more complicated now than ever before.administrators and teachers are not only obliged to teach core subjects,but also find themselves mired in a variety of causes during school time.and they do so in an era when they no longer possess plenary control of their charges as they did when they acted in loco parentis.see,morse,at thomas,concurring.the decisions school administrators must make regarding the deportment of their students what they say,what they wear,or what they do require common sense and good judgment.many of those decisions will involve matters about which reasonable people can disagree.in the close cases,such as this one,there is virtue in deferring to the reasonable judgments of those responsible for educating our nation youth.with respect,i dissent.
my colleagues have determined today that i boobies is an ambiguous phrase that may connote an attraction to female breasts,but which falls under the protection of the first amendment in the middle school context because it may plausibly be interpreted as commenting on a political or social issue.reasonable minds may come to varying conclusions on this test,but one thing is not open to debate a school district faced with the same dilemma in the coming weeks,months,or years is given no greater guidance regarding its ability to determine whether a particular message may be proscribed than before the majority opinion issued.
the majority lauds the intent of the two middle schoolers responsible for introducing i boobies keep a breast bracelets into their school,which encouraged serious discussion regarding a medical issue of increasing social import.appellees actions may or may not reflect an admirable maturity,but the intent of appellees is not at issue.in many cases,when the first amendment is implicated,the intent of the speakers will be admirable or at worst benign.the majority concludes that,as long as the ambiguous speech may be interpreted by a reasonable person as plausibly related to a political or social issue,it is protected.despite its express disavowal of intent as a consideration,the majority inadvertently the students intent into the fray by mandating an analysis of whether a political or social issue is addressed by the speech.this is improper but it is not my sole criticism.
the majority test leaves school districts essentially powerless to exercise any discretion and extends the first amendment protection to a breadth that knows no bounds.as such,how will school districts apply this amorphous test going forward the majority test has two obvious flaws.first,what words or phrases fall outside of the ambiguous designation other than the seven dirty words second,how does a school district ever assess the weight or validity of political or social commentary the absence of guidance on both of these questions leaves school districts to scratch their heads.
practical problems with the majority test abound.where and how do school districts regarding the nouns used to describe the subject matter of the particular awareness campaign the majority has established that at opposite ends of the spectrum are boobies,on the one hand,and tits,one of the seven dirty words,on the other hand.what lies between those two extremes and how a school district is to make a principled judgment going forward remain open questions.no doubt,there are some words and phrases that all would agree should be afforded no protection in the middle school context,despite their use in promoting an important social issue.my recalcitrance to extend first amendment protection to the slogan at hand is simple why is this word,boobies,different why does it deserve protection is boobies a term that is inherently innocuous or sophomoric,as the majority asserts as noted in the majority,ta tas is used as the descriptive term in some breast cancer awareness campaigns.the ambiguity of ta tas in this context is beyond question.what also seems beyond question is that the school district,according to the majority,must lay dormant to a student use of ta tas or any synonym of breast other than tits as long as the student is commenting on a political or social issue,here,breast cancer awareness.the lack of certitude or a workable parameter unnecessarily handcuffs school districts.
what of the circumstance when an anatomically correct term is used in an awareness campaign applying the majority test,i penises,i vaginas,i testicles,or i breasts would apparently be phrases or slogans that school districts would be powerless to address.would the invocation of any of these slogans in a cancer awareness effort fail to garner protection under the majority test it would appear not.what of the other slogans that the majority mentions in its opinion that are sufficiently ambiguous the majority blithely states that it does not enjoin the school district regulation of other types of apparel,such as the save the or apparel bearing the phrase.this is exactly my concern.what may a school district do these phrases are both ambiguous and speak to political and social issues.how is a school district now better able to discern when it may exercise its discretion to impede the use of a particular slogan,as it relates to an awareness program,than before the issuance of this opinion 
the other practical problem which arises from application of the majority test is judging the validity of political and social comment.in the context of these social awareness campaigns,when would the students involvement not invoke political or social comment the constriction of plausibly be interpreted as adds little to our discourse.for instance,when would a student using a term that is admittedly ambiguous not be able to assert that the use of the offending word,term,or phrase is speech that is commenting on a political or social issue what is the balancing that a school district engage in to determine the merit or value of the proposed political or social comment the unabashed invocation of a lewd,vulgar,indecent or plainly offensive term is not what is at issue here what is at issue is the notion that we have established a test which effectively has no parameters.the political or social issue prong entirely eviscerates the school district authority to effectively evaluate whether the student speech is indeed protected.this shortcoming in the application of the test exemplifies its inherent weakness a failure to resolve the conundrum school districts face every day.
in light of the majority approach,school districts seeking guidance from our first amendment jurisprudence in this context will find only confusion.i can not adhere to this approach.i respectfully dissent.
in before the ban was publicly announced,school administrators received some unrelated reports of inappropriate touching,but neither the word boobies nor the bracelets were considered a cause of these incidents.
the middle school permits students to wear the foundation check y urself keep a breast bracelets.
after the ban was in place,there were several incidents of boys inappropriately touching girls,but they were unrelated to the i boobies keep a breast bracelets.
and do not assert a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the policy.
the district court had both jurisdiction under and jurisdiction under a.see max republican comm.of lancaster,cir.
even the middle school administrators seemed unsure which words would be prohibited by the dress code.when deposed,viglianti and principal angela divietro testified that the word breast as in apparel stating.org or breast cancer awareness would be inappropriate because the word breast can be construed as having a sexual connotation.app.at the district court evidentiary hearing,they reversed course.viglianti stated that.org would be appropriate i n the context of breast cancer awareness month,and diveitro no longer believed the phrase breast cancer awareness was vulgar to students.
the rest of the supreme court jurisprudence might fairly be described as opaque.see morse,at thomas,concurring i am afraid that our jurisprudence now says that students have a right to speak in schools except when they do not id.at breyer,concurring in part and dissenting in part c ourts have described the tests these cases suggest as complex and often difficult to apply.see,doninger niehoff,cir the law governing restrictions on student speech can be difficult and confusing,even for lawyers,law professors,and judges.the relevant supreme court cases can be hard to reconcile,and courts often struggle with which standard applies in any particular case.guiles ex rel.guiles marineau,cir acknowledging some lack of clarity in the supreme court cases and stating that the exact contours of what is plainly offensive under fraser is not so clear.
other examples of categorically unprotected speech include child pornography,see new york ferber,advocacy that imminently incites lawless action,see brandenburg ohio,per curiam,fighting words,see chaplinsky new hampshire,true threats,see watts united states,per curiam,commercial speech that is false,misleading,or proposes illegal transactions,see cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,and some false statements of fact,see united states alvarez.
we have not yet decided whether tinker is limited to speech.see blue mountain sch,cir en banc declining to reach this issue see also id.at smith,concurring i write separately to address a question that the majority opinion expressly leaves open whether tinker applies to speech in the first place.
as we explain in part,the limitations that justice alito concurrence places on the majority opinion in morse are controlling.

fraser differs from this case in a third way fraser involved speech at an official school assembly,whereas the school district bracelet ban extends to the entire school day,not just functions.but like other courts of appeals,we do not think that this difference matters.see,ex rel.ochshorn ithaca city sch,cir w e have not interpreted fraser as limited either to regulation of speech or to the spoken word.chandler,at concluding that restriction of vulgar,lewd,and plainly offensive speech under fraser is not limited to speech given at an official school assembly bystrom by and through bystrom fridley high,indep.sch.dist,cir it is true that fraser involved a speech given before a student assembly but t his possible difference,in our view,does not amount to a legal distinction making the bethel rule inapplicable here.as we explained,fraser reflected an extension of the court jurisprudence,which permits the government to restrict lewd speech to children where children are either a captive audience or the intended recipients of the speech.children are just as much of a captive audience in the hallways,cafeteria,or locker rooms as they are in official school assemblies and classrooms.naturally,then,we have never described a school authority under fraser as being limited to official school functions and classrooms.see,at the first exception is set out in fraser,which we interpreted to permit school officials to regulate lewd,vulgar,indecent,and plainly offensive speech in school.emphasis in original quoting saxe,at.although justice brennan concurrence and justice stevens dissent in fraser suggested that this difference might matter,nothing in the majority opinion endorsed their distinction.see fraser,at brennan,concurring opining that fraser speech may well have been protected had he given it in school but under different circumstances,where the school legitimate interests in teaching and maintaining civil public discourse were less weighty id.at stevens,dissenting it seems fairly obvious that fraser speech would be inappropriate in certain classroom and formal social settings.on the other hand,in a locker room or perhaps in a school corridor the metaphor in the speech might be regarded as rather routine comment.indeed,if fraser were so limited,then a school authority under fraser would largely merge with its power to reasonably regulate speech under kuhlmeier,yet we have always viewed fraser and kuhlmeier as separate exceptions to tinker.see,at.

in addition to justices alito and kennedy,three dissenting justices justices stevens,souter,and ginsburg would not have extended the morse exception to political or social speech.these five justices instead split over whether morse speech could reasonably be interpreted as advocating illegal drug use.morse,at,stevens,dissenting concluding that morse banner is constitutionally protected because it could not reasonably be interpreted as advocating illegal drug use and was at most a minority viewpoint in the national debate about a serious issue deserving first amendment protection.
