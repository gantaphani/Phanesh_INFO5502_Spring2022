on february,plaintiffs santos rivera,his wife daisy,and two daughters yasira and zahira brought this claim against the municipality of sabana grande and four municipal officers pursuant to.rivera alleged that he was the victim of adverse employment actions motivated by political animus,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.after a series of preliminary orders removing three of the four individual defendants from the action,the trial began on december,against the municipality of sabana grande and miguel ortiz velez ortiz,the mayor of sabana grande,who was sued in both his individual and official capacities.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found that protected political activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendant decision to politically discriminate against the plaintiff,and awarded rivera in lost wages and benefits in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.the jury also awarded compensatory damages in the amount of to plaintiff wife,and to each of plaintiff daughters.with several alterations,the court entered judgment on the jury verdict,and the defendants filed these timely appeals.
defendants raise a plethora of objections to the proceedings below,challenging inter alia the court denial of qualified immunity,its refusal to stay proceedings pending the resolution of an attempted interlocutory appeal,various evidentiary rulings at trial,the court interrogation of a defense witness,and the validity of the jury damage award.after careful review of the record,we reject defendants challenges and affirm the judgment.
in,rivera was hired by the mayor of sabana grande to work in various capacities at the municipal gym plaintiff duties included training boxers and weight lifters,teaching classes for children,and organizing weight lifting,boxing,gymnastics,and karate competitions at locations around sabana grande.most municipal jobs in puerto rico are as career positions akin to civil service jobs or trust positions political appointments.municipal employees are similarly designated career or trust employees.at all times,rivera was a career employee,and his job was designated a career position.in,twelve years after plaintiff was hired,the incumbent mayor promoted him to be in charge of the gymnasium.although this managerial post was originally a trust position,the municipality reclassified it as a career job to facilitate plaintiff promotion.
at the time of the promotion,rivera was a member of the popular democratic party pdp,though his allegiances were gradually shifting to the new progressive party npp.over the next six years,from to,rivera tenure as manager of the municipal gym was uneventful,and the record indicates that he received only positive employment evaluations.in december,plaintiff formally joined the npp,and local party leaders asked him to run as the npp candidate for mayor of sabana grande.one week later,plaintiff publicly accepted the party mayoral nomination at an npp plebiscite caucus.
rivera candidacy created a potentially awkward work environment.his opponent in the mayoral election was incumbent mayor miguel ortiz velez,who also happened to be plaintiff boss by virtue of being mayor.rivera testified at trial that his relationship with ortiz changed dramatically after he announced his candidacy.that month,after returning from a vacation,plaintiff discovered that the telephone had been removed from his office in the gymnasium.rivera also learned that the mayor was requesting daily reports on his work habits from other coworkers stationed at the gym.in march,the mayor observed rivera outside his area during working hours,and ordered his secretary to make notations on plaintiff time card documenting his absence from work.when plaintiff confronted the of sabana grande over the incident,he received a suspension for being disrespectful to the.rivera appealed this suspension to the commonwealth board of appeals for the personnel administration system jasap,which reversed his suspension and awarded rivera thirty days back pay.the board decision was affirmed on appeal to the commonwealth court of appeals,and the puerto rico supreme court denied certiorari.
in the aftermath of the jasap proceedings,rivera continued to experience harassment at work.the locks on the gym were changed to inhibit his access,and on one occasion rivera found a stack of his personal and office documents torn up next to a trash can near his office.he was stripped of authority to direct the activities of subordinates at the gym,and he had several prolonged arguments with ortiz at the gymnasium.on one occasion,the mayor ordered him to complete maintenance tasks that were not within the scope of his duties.the defendants did not seriously dispute these incidents at trial.
in may,rivera sought and received an offer of employment at the commonwealth department of sports and recreation in nearby mayaguez.at the time,the head of the sport administration department was eric labrador,a fellow member of the npp.because puerto rico law prohibits individuals from simultaneously holding state and employment,rivera petitioned the municipality for a transfer.however,mayor ortiz refused to approve rivera transfer.rivera testified that the mayor secretary informed him that the mayor would not sign unimportant papers.
rivera was anxious to accept the position before the november elections,anticipating that the employment offer would be rescinded if a pdp administration were elected into office.thus,on june,rivera submitted an irrevocable letter of resignation to the municipality.the consequences of resigning in lieu of obtaining a transfer were severe.plaintiff stood to sacrifice the twenty years of seniority he had accumulated since for salary and benefit purposes.however,even this initiative proved unavailing when ortiz refused to accept rivera resignation,citing an ongoing investigation into rivera excessive absenteeism over the previous five months.mayor ortiz testified at trial that under puerto rico law,a municipality loses the authority to discipline a municipal employee once that employee has been transferred to a state agency.hence,it was critical to delay plaintiff transfer request until the administrative investigation into his absenteeism had been resolved.
rivera insisted that his absences were due to illnesses,and he instructed his doctor,silva cherena,to submit medical reports to the municipality documenting his symptoms.indeed,cherena had sent plaintiff medical information to the municipality on july.however,mayor ortiz office claimed not to have received the doctor letter until october.two weeks later,mayor ortiz finally accepted rivera irrevocable resignation,nearly months after it was tendered.in the intervening period,the npp party had been voted out of key commonwealth positions,and the job offer at the commonwealth department of sports and recreation was no longer available.rivera was unable to find other work,and his family suffered significant financial and emotional hardship as a result.
in the opinion accompanying its november,order granting partial summary judgment to defendants,the district court distilled rivera accusations into five discrete allegations of political discrimination 
in january,defendants removed the phone from plaintiff office 
in january,defendant ortiz ordered arenas,another employee of the municipality,to take on plaintiff job duties,supervise plaintiff,and track his movements 
in march,defendants falsely accused and unjustly suspended plaintiff for leaving his and being absent from work 
in april,defendant ortiz refused to approve plaintiff transfer to the commonwealth sports and recreation department in mayaguez 
on june,defendant ortiz declined to accept plaintiff resignation and then intentionally deferred the decision,accepting the resignation only after the elections.
the defendants conceded that rivera had properly preserved allegations and,but argued that the first three allegations were.the district court agreed,and dismissed allegations,and in its partial order of summary judgment on november.of particular relevance to this case,the district court november order also denied mayor ortiz request for qualified immunity.on december,the case proceeded to trial on rivera two preserved allegations of discrimination.the jury delivered its verdict on december,and these appeals followed.
denial of summary judgment 
the defendants level a attack on the district court failure to dismiss rivera case outright on summary judgment.first,they argue that the determination of the court that plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case rested on evidence that was ultimately inadmissible at trial and on inferences from facts not properly on the summary judgment record.see finn consolidated rail,cir material that would be inadmissible at trial can not be considered on a motion for summary judgment because,if offered at trial,it would not serve to establish a genuine issue of material fact.second,defendants allege that rivera failed as a matter of law to proffer evidence sufficient to overcome summary judgment.finally,defendants challenge the district court denial of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage.
these objections are unavailing.because the appeal in this case follows a full trial and verdict,the district court rulings at the summary judgment stage were overtaken by subsequent events 
we need not address the merits of a preverdict challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the motion for summary judgment.such an attack on the denial of defendant motion for summary judgment has been overtaken by subsequent events,namely,a trial and an adverse jury verdict the rationale for this rule has been based on the procedural fact that a denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge determination that genuine issues of material fact exist.it is not a judgment,and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.hence,a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced on the motion to support the district court conclusion that genuine issues of material fact exist will not lie on appeal.
eastern mountain platform tennis,cir internal citations omitted.although eastern mountain specifically references sufficiency of the evidence challenges,objections to the court denial of qualified immunity in its summary judgment ruling are subject to the same rule of trial preemption.as we noted in iacobucci boulter,cir,that rule generally bars appeals grounded solely in error at the summary judgment stage 
although the defendant tried in this forum to assign error to the denial of that motion,a pair of procedural impediments frustrates the attempt.for one thing,an order denying summary judgment typically does not merge into the final judgment and therefore is not an independently appealable event if the case thereafter proceeds to trial.
id.at citing eastern mountain,at.
consequently,although a grant of immunity would still confer a benefit on defendants by shielding them from any liability for monetary damages awarded by the jury,a defendant determined to persist in challenging the court denial of qualified immunity can not rest on the objection lodged at the summary judgment stage,but must move for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of the trial.if the court adheres to its original position,the defendant may then appeal from the denial of judgment as a matter of law.a contrary rule would contradict the principle enshrined in our jurisprudence that facts elicited at trial are often probative of the defendant entitlement to qualified immunity.see stella kelley,cir declining to permit interlocutory appeals from a court rejection of qualified immunity to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure.o nce trial has been had,the availability of official immunity on final judgment of appeal should be determined by the trial record,not the pleadings nor the summary judgment record.
here,defendants failed to properly preserve their challenge to the court denial of qualified immunity by restating their objections in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.accordingly,we deem the defendants challenge waived.
a forsyth appeal 
on december,one week after the district court ruling granting partial summary judgment and denying qualified filed a notice of appeal of the district court decision to deny qualified immunity.in mitchell forsyth,d,the supreme court ruled that a defendant denied qualified immunity by a district court could file an interlocutory appeal to obtain review of any disputed question of law.w e hold that a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.forsyth,id.at.the forsyth court reasoned that the entitlement to qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.id.at.emphasis in original.
the act of filing an interlocutory appeal has jurisdictional implications 
the filing of an interlocutory appeal,confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.griggs provident consumer discount,d per curiam.the district court does not regain jurisdiction over those issues until the court of appeals issues its mandate.courts have carved out a few narrow exceptions to this rule,such as where the defendant frivolously appeals or takes an interlocutory appeal from a order.
united states defries,emphasis added.these exceptions to the jurisdictional rule recited in defries figure prominently in the jurisprudence of several circuits.in apostol gallion,cir,the court of appeals observed that 
although forsyth protects the interests of the defendants claiming qualified immunity,it may injure the legitimate interests of other litigants and the judicial system defendants may seek to stall because they gain from delay at plaintiffs expense,an incentive yielding unjustified appeals.defendants may take forsyth appeals for tactical as well as strategic reasons disappointed by the denial of a continuance,they may help themselves to a postponement by lodging a notice of appeal.
id.at.in a subset of interlocutory appeals of qualified immunity rulings,the notice of appeal may be so baseless that it does not invoke appellate jurisdiction even when filed.id.at.to address other sham appeals whose lack of merit is not so transparent as to preclude the transfer of jurisdiction to the appellate court in the first instance,the seventh circuit developed a certification process whereby a district court may certify to the court of appeals that the appeal is frivolous and retrieve jurisdiction to get on with the trial.id.the court admonished that 
s uch a power must be used with restraint,just as the power to dismiss a complaint for lack of jurisdiction because it is frivolous is anomalous and must be used with restraint.but it is there,and it may be valuable in cutting short the deleterious effects of unfounded appeals.
id.following the seventh circuit lead,the sixth,ninth,and tenth circuits established similar certification procedures to address interlocutory appeals challenging the denial of qualified immunity forsyth appeals.see yates city of cleveland,cir chuman wright,cir stewart donges,cir.
the circuits adopting this certification procedure have held or implied that the district court act of filing the certification of frivolousness is an event of jurisdictional significance.
i t is the district court certification of the defendant appeal as frivolous or forfeited rather than merely the fact that the appeal is frivolous which allows the district court to retain jurisdiction to conduct a trial once a notice of appeal on an appealable issue such as qualified immunity is filed,the status quo is that the district court has lost jurisdiction to proceed.to regain jurisdiction,it must take the affirmative step of certifying the appeal as frivolous or forfeited,and until that step is taken it simply lacks jurisdiction to proceed with the trial.
stewart,at emphasis in original see also chuman,at yates,at apostol,at.
this a district court must actually file the certification of frivolousness to retrieve jurisdiction over the the springboard for defendants argument that the trial in this case was a nullity.on november,the district court initially entered an opinion and order denying defendants request for qualified immunity.on december,defendants responded by filing a notice of appeal from the denial of immunity and moving the district court to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the appeal.immediately thereafter they petitioned this court for a stay of the district court proceedings without the benefit of an order from the district court denying the motion to stay,we denied the requested stay in a summary order issued that same day 
the motion to stay trial is denied.in denying appellants motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,the district court stated that ortiz motivation for denying and deferring plaintiff resignation is an unresolved issue of material fact.as appellants have not adequately explained why the denial is immediately appealable,see stella kelley,cir a district court pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact,the motion for stay is denied.
on december,the district court began the trial.meanwhile,defendants had filed a motion for reconsideration of our december,order denying the stay.by order dated december,we rejected the defendants motion for reconsideration 
to the extent that defendant is asking this court to immediately stay any further trial,the request is denied.we request the district court,however,to expressly act on defendant motion for stay.see hegarty somerset county,cir chuman wright,cir should the district court find that the defendants claim of qualified immunity is frivolous or has been waived,the district court may certify,in writing,that defendants have forfeited their right to pretrial appeal,and may proceed with trial.any renewed request for a stay filed in the court of appeals must be accompanied by sufficient portions of the record to allow for intelligent review.
in the interim,however,the district court had nearly completed the trial.on december,after entertaining closing arguments and issuing instructions to the jury,the district court denied the defendants motion for stay in an order dated that day 
o ur denial of summary judgment turned on an unresolved issue of fact in a clearly established legal scenario strongly indicative of improper political discrimination.under these circumstances,an appeal of an unresolved factual question is baseless and is not immediately appealable.therefore,we necessarily certify that defendant appeal is frivolous under the present circumstances.
civil at december.defendants now insist that g iven the uncontested fact that the trial court proceeded without jurisdiction,the judgment entered in the instant case suffers from the incurable vice of nullity and must be vacated.
this jurisdictional dispute might have been avoided if the district court had promptly ruled on the defendants motion to continue the trial pending the resolution of their forsyth appeal.see fed.a a party must ordinarily move first in the district court for a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal.under law,courts entertaining a motion for stay are compelled to evaluate the merits of the petition and anticipate its disposition on appeal.see,cir the sine qua non of the stay pending appeal standard is whether the movants are likely to succeed on the merits.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this evaluation closely resembles the frivolousness analysis required under the apostol certification procedure,as the court order of december noting the unappealability of its qualified immunity ruling demonstrates.see supra.if the court had entered that order denying the stay on december,prior to beginning the trial,its jurisdiction over the proceedings would have been clearly established even without the inclusion of certification language in the opinion.
we have never adopted the apostol certification procedure in this circuit.although appellants urge us to do so here in the hopes of adding fuel to their trial nullity argument,we decline their invitation.whatever the merits of the certification procedure may be,its primary the district court to reclaim jurisdiction from the court of appeals in the wake of a forsyth no relevance to this case.the defendants notice of appeal was patently meritless,and therefore failed to divest the district court of jurisdiction in the first instance.as we observed in united states brooks,cir 
l ike most rules,the rule that either the trial or the appellate not have jurisdiction over a case at any given point in time admits of some exceptions.thus,a district court can proceed,notwithstanding the filing of an appeal,if the notice of appeal is defective in some substantial and easily discernible way if,for example,it is based on an unappealable order or if it otherwise constitutes a transparently frivolous attempt to impede the progress of the case.
id.at.in this case,the defendants interlocutory appeal was based on an unappealable order.as we ruled in stella 
a district court pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact in such a situation,the movant must await the entry of final judgment before appealing the adverse ruling.
stella,at emphasis added.this principle,which we reiterated in our initial order denying defendants request for stay,rendered the district court denial of qualified immunity unappealable.
to avoid the application of this principle,appellants now lamely defend the legitimacy of their interlocutory appeal by arguing that the district court qualified immunity determination turned on the legal question of whether a municipal officer subjective intent is relevant to the qualified immunity analysis,and insisting that the court improperly considered the element of subjective intent as part of the qualified immunity inquiry.superficially,ortiz draws support for his opposition from the supreme court decision in britton,d,and our jurisprudence.see tower,cir ford,cir evidence concerning the officer subjective intent is simply irrelevant to a qualified immunity defense.sheehy town of plymouth,cir.to illustrate the flaw in ortiz argument,one must differentiate between constitutional violations that are strictly a product of the perpetrator actions,and offenses where the perpetrator subjective intent is an essential element of the violation.for example,an individual fourth amendment rights are violated by the very fact that a police officer arrests him without probable cause,regardless of the officer subjective intentions at the time of the arrest.see,at.similarly,a suspect who is interrogated by the police without being advised of his right to counsel suffers a fifth amendment injury regardless of the questioning officer intent or motives.in these situations,the rule of sensibly excludes evidence of the officer intent from the qualified immunity analysis.
on the other hand,subjective intent is an essential element of political discrimination.we have previously observed that 
w hen a former government employee brings a first amendment suit against his employer for taking an adverse employment action against him on the basis of his speech,the premier precedent is healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.under the healthy paradigm,the plaintiff must show both that his speech was constitutionally protected,and that it was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse action taken against him.
stella,at emphasis added.in other words,an employee first amendment right to be free from political discrimination is violated when the employer adverse employment decision is motivated by the employee political speech.hence,the employer subjective motive is an essential element of the constitutional violation itself,and can not be divorced from the qualified immunity inquiry.our previous decisions underscore the importance of the employer subjective intent in political discrimination cases 
harlow fitzgerald,d does not rule out the need to inquire into the actual reasons behind an official conduct when the official state of mind is a necessary component of the constitutional violation he allegedly committed t he official abnormal expertise in law,or his subjective,below par,lack of expertise,makes no difference.but determining whether defendant fired an employee for a discriminatory reason is an altogether different matter.
cir.in,cir,we similarly dismissed defendants contention that subjective intent is irrelevant to qualified immunity,explaining that t he plaintiffs allege that they were terminated because of their political affiliation,a constitutional claim that has no meaning absent the allegation of impermissible motivation.id.at.accordingly,the proffered legal basis for the defendants forsyth appeal is meritless,having been foreclosed by our prior decisions in and,see supra,properly cited by the district court in its order denying defendants request for a stay,and characterizing the interlocutory appeal as frivolous.
finally,we must note that the circumstances surrounding the defendants forsyth appeal betray its frivolousness.the district court order of december denying ortiz motion to stay the proceedings recounts that after the defendants motion for summary judgment was denied on november,counsel for defendants failed to appear in court on december,the day the trial was scheduled to begin.defendants insisted that they were unable to proceed because johanna,the counsel of record for defendants,was simultaneously involved in another trial.the court rejected this excuse,sanctioned emmanuelli law firm,and rescheduled the trial for december.later that day,ortiz filed his notice of appeal,and immediately thereafter moved to stay the proceedings in the district court,asserting to the judge that this honorable court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to submit to the rigors of trial.the timing and haste of the defendants notice of appeal reveals its intended cloak a request for postponement in forsyth interlocutory raiments.see apostol,at defendants may take forsyth appeals for tactical as well as strategic reasons disappointed by the denial of a continuance,they may help themselves to a postponement by lodging a notice of appeal.
in summary,we conclude that appellants notice of appeal never divested the district court of jurisdiction,and we reject the claim that the entire trial was a nullity.
b.the trial 
defendants raise a handful of objections to the district court evidentiary rulings and conduct at trial.we address these claims in the order they were raised on appeal.
the district court admission of evidence regarding dismissed claims 
defendants argue that the district court erred in permitting the plaintiff to introduce evidence pertaining to allegations that were dismissed before trial as.in general,we review judgment calls that certain evidence is either irrelevant or cumulative for abuse of discretion.yankee candle,bridgewater candle,llc,cir.as noted above,the district court grant of partial summary judgment disposed of rivera claims arising from the january deprivation of office equipment,the mayor january decision to strip rivera of his duties and authority,and rivera march suspension for disrespecting the.significantly,the district court summary judgment order anticipated that evidence concerning these dismissed claims could still be admissible at trial as relevant background although we need not decide the issue at this time,it is possible that the prior incidents will be admissible as relevant background evidence,civil at november,citing city of providence,cir.indeed,the supreme court has observed that a discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at issue.united air lines,evans,d see also,at morrison carleton woolen mills,cir.the district court prerogative to admit evidence of dismissed claims insofar as it provides relevant background for surviving claims is firmly established by our precedents,and we discern no abuse of discretion in the court exercise of this prerogative.
the defendants also ground their objections to the admissibility of dismissed claims evidence in federal rule of evidence,arguing that o nce a jury has heard about all these alleged,and,actions taken against plaintiff it becomes almost impossible to make a fair assessment of the subsequent issues,which are the ones actually being tried.we disagree.the nature and severity of the events underlying the dismissed claims including the confiscation of rivera personal telephone,the gradual erosion of his authority,and his suspension pale in significance to events that form the predicate of his surviving refusal to approve rivera transfer,and the delayed acceptance of his letter of resignation.the dismissed claims involve employment decisions that resulted in inconvenience or brief financial hardship the surviving claims implicate adverse employment acts that threatened plaintiff livelihood.accordingly,there was no abuse of discretion in the district court implicit determination that the unfairly prejudicial effect of this evidence did not outweigh its probative value.
cross examination by the judge 
during the cross examination of mayor ortiz,counsel for rivera interrogated the mayor about why he insisted on investigating plaintiff sick leave absences in lieu of permitting his transfer to a position with the commonwealth.in the midst of this line of questioning,the judge interjected with several of his own questions,resulting in the following exchange between the judge and the witness 
judge well,there was no impediment in you giving him the transfer authorization irrespective of the investigation,correct 
witness well,the fact of the matter is that the investigation had reflected that there had been improper use of the sick leave days.we would have to go to the municipality regulations regarding the possibility of a violation of those regulations or of any law.and not doing so could have entailed a finding against us by the controller office.it could be called negligence in the fulfillment of a supervisor duties.
judge but even if he had been transferred,you could always have obtained relief from him if he had taken those days for the wrong reasons 
witness well,at least regarding that aspect,he could have raised that matter when the letter was sent to silva on june.and then we would have consulted the attorney himself or from ocalar,which is the personnel agency for the commonwealth which deals with these personnel affairs.and if they said this was okay,we would have issued the letter.
judge at this time when these things were happening had he already changed parties 
witness yes,he was already a candidate.this was the year.
judge do you think it would have been prudent to allow him to go to the commonwealth and out of sabana grande so that you would have any more problems with him 
witness if we were to look at it from that point of view,it would have been beneficial for the municipality because we then would have had a regular position that we could have filled.but the problem was that since he was under investigation we could not do so.
on appeal,defendants argue that 
this grilling of codefendant ortiz,far from aiding the jury in understanding the evidence,was a cross examination,comprised mostly of leading and argumentative questions geared towards making the following point the mayor had no legal basis for denying plaintiff transfer,this action was carried out while plaintiff was a candidate for mayor,and defendant was not prudent in making this decision.
the federal rules of evidence provide that t he court may interrogate witnesses,whether called by itself or by a party.b see also united states,cir it is well settled that the trial judge has a perfe
