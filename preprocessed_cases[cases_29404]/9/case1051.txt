the plaintiff,thomas aulicino,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.aulicino is a motor vehicle operator mvo at the hinsdale depot of the new york city department of homeless services dhs.he claims that he was denied a promotion at dhs because he is white,was subjected to a discriminatory hostile work environment,and was retaliated against for engaging in protected activity.the district court sterling johnson,judge,adopting a report and recommendation by magistrate judge lois bloom over aulicino objections,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed aulicino complaint in its entirety.
in our view,the failure to promote and hostile work environment claims should not have been dismissed.we conclude that the record reflects genuine issues of material fact with respect to the failure to promote claim.we therefore vacate the dismissal of that claim and remand the cause for trial.we also think the district court,in applying the legal standard governing hostile work environment claims,failed to consider the record evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,as it was required to do.we therefore vacate and remand the complaint with respect to that cause of action for reconsideration 
background 
evidence of derogatory racial comments 
according to aulicino deposition testimony,frank john,an who was a fleet coordinator at the hinsdale depot beginning in november,made several nasty and harassing racial comments to or about aulicino.aulicino dep.for example,john told aulicino that it was all right for a dhs client to call aulicino a white mother fuck and that aulicino deserved it.id.at see also id.at same.in the same encounter,according to aulicino,john threatened to withhold aulicino pay for that day,though he did not follow up on the threat.see id.at.on another occasion,john remarked to aulicino that white people are lazy.id.at.and on another,john asked a white colleague why he and aulicino all take off the same days like there was some sort of white conspiracy.id.at.on still another,aulicino was told by one of his supervisors,gary brown,that john called him a white fuck and had threatened to get him.id.at 
it is not clear from aulicino testimony or other material in the record when the statements in question were allegedly made.aulicino second amended complaint and brief on appeal assert that they occurred in a period between late december and september.see amended appellant br.
aulicino also testified that his supervisor,larry singleton,made the sort of comments frank john makes.aulicino dep.singleton became aulicino supervisor several months before aulicino deposition was taken in august.see id.at.the excerpted deposition transcript in the record does not specify any particular derogatory comments made by singleton.
in an affidavit dated march,and submitted in opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment,however,aulicino testifies to several recent examples of derogatory comments made by singleton,all of which,he says,occurred during the pendency of this action.according to the affidavit,on january,singleton handed him a copy of an old union contract and grievance form.when aulicino asked why he had done so,singleton mentioned the instant lawsuit in an aggressive and inappropriate manner,as he had several times before.aulicino aff.according to the affidavit,aulicino told singleton to stop harassing him and threatened to file a complaint about the incident.at that point,according to the affidavit,singleton stated that he singleton was an.id.aulicino interpreted that as a threat that he would be assault ed if he were to file such a complaint.id.the affidavit also asserts that on april,singleton confronted aulicino saying,go back to bensonhurst and tell everyone that you report to a black man who is making your life miserable.id.aulicino stated in his affidavit that he thought the comment was racist and that he told singleton that he was creating a hostile work environment.id.singleton replied,i show you what a hostile work environment is.id.
the affidavit also alleges that in july,singleton discussed a book he displayed on his desk titled black and white separate,hostile,and unequal with colleagues while pointing at aulicino and laughing.id.according to aulicino,singleton also commented in aulicino presence that a lynching of an man could have been avoided if the man friend had not given the man up to white people and that the moral of the story was that black people need to stick together against white people.id.
overall,aulicino swore,the racial remarks by john and singleton rendered aulicino short fused.aulicino dep.at.aulicino has contemplated an attempt to transfer out of the hinsdale depot,but has not done so because he does not know where else to go,in light of what he characterizes as his very limited choices.id.
the denial of a promotion 
on may,dhs posted a job opening for a motor vehicle supervisor mvs position at the hinsdale depot.the vacancy notice specified these qualifications 
preferred skills 
one year of permanent service in the title of motor vehicle operator.
one year of experience in motor vehicle dispatching,and 
a valid nys class b motor vehicle driver license 
minimum qualifications 
one year of permanent service in of motor vehicle operator or 
one year of experience vehicle dispatching.
license requirement 
a motor vehicle driver license valid in the state of new york.for appointment to certain positions,possession of a class b commercial driver license cdl valid in the state of new york may be required.there may be certain age requirements to obtain this license.employees must maintain the class b commercial driver license during their employment.
city of new york,department of homeless services,job vacancy notice,may,mvs posting,at.aulicino submitted his application for the position on may,and he was interviewed by john on june.
aulicino,according to his deposition testimony,found the interview very unbelievable because it seemed like john was trying to discourage him and disqualify him all at the same time from taking the job by telling aulicino that the position was for a later shift and that john knew aulicino did want to change shifts.when aulicino tried to tell john about his dispatching experience john stopped him and said that he knew all about it and that was the end of the conversation.aulicino dep.john also asked aulicino if he had a cdl license sic.aulicino did not,but he said to john that the cdl was not an official requirement,in light of the fact that motor vehicle supervisors basically do drive.aulicino also volunteered that if it was necessary he would upgrade his license.id.at.
john declined to promote aulicino.aulicino testified that one of his supervisors,sterling ferguson,later told aulicino that he had heard john make derogatory comments about aulicino in connection with his application,saying that he would hire aulicino,referring to aulicino as a white fuck.id.at see also id.at ferguson told me about stuff that john said to him when he spoke to john in regard to whether i was qualified for the position i was applying for and john responded by saying something to the effect of i would hire that white fuck.
john testified in his deposition that he rejected aulicino for the mvs position because aulicino did have the appropriate driver license he had a class e license,and,john thought,the job vacancy posting required a valid new york state class b license.john dep.john also testified that looking at aulicino record,it was that good,it was good.id.at.and indeed it appears that although aulicino performance was consistently rated good,he was written up several times for misconduct on the job.
joseph johnson,an,was awarded the mvs position.at the time,johnson had a commercial learner permit but no class b license,some dispatching experience,johnson dep,and more than one year of experience as an mvo.
procedural history 
on january,aulicino filed a pro se complaint with the eeoc.he received a right to sue letter from the agency on march.he initiated this action pro se on may,pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,et,by completing and filing a form complaint alleging discrimination and retaliation on the basis of his race,color,and national origin.aulicino checked a line on the form to reflect his assertion that the defendants were still committing these acts against him.on august,shortly after pretrial matters in the action had been referred to magistrate judge bloom,aulicino,continuing to act pro se,filed an amended form complaint adding john as a defendant.
discovery ensued.on march,counsel retained by aulicino union filed a notice of appearance on behalf of aulicino.the parties subsequently agreed that aulicino complaint would be amended and discovery extended.
the second amended complaint,the operative complaint for present purposes,added linda gibbs,the commissioner of dhs,as a defendant,and dismissed the complaint against frank john.it also set forth aulicino factual allegations in greater detail,and it proffered the new york city and state human rights laws as bases for relief in addition to title vii.after several further extensions,the magistrate judge ordered that discovery would be closed on july.in a status conference,aulicino stipulated to the dismissal of his claims against gibbs,inasmuch as title vii does not provide for individual liability.the parties also stipulated to substitute the city of new york for dhs,and the magistrate judge set a schedule for the city proposed motion for summary judgment 
on september,aulicino received new counsel through his union.after two extensions,the city served its motion for summary judgment on january.aulicino new counsel opposed it by,inter alia,submitting the aulicino affidavit dated march,referred to above,in which he specifies derogatory comments made by singleton after the filing of the second amended complaint but before the close of discovery.
in a report and recommendation dated august,the r r,the magistrate judge recommended that the city motion be granted in its entirety.in her view,aulicino failure to promote claim was insufficient because the record lacked evidence that aulicino was qualified for the mvs position or that the denial of the promotion was discriminatory.the r r reflects the magistrate judge conclusion that the defendants stated reasons for not promoting aulicino were legitimate and nondiscriminatory,and that aulicino had failed to produce evidence that those reasons were pretextual.see r r.
the r r recommended dismissing the hostile work environment claim because,in the magistrate judge view,john and singleton comments were isolated and discrete and had not interfered with aulicino job performance or responsibilities.id.at.the r r further recommended dismissing the retaliation claim for want of an adverse employment action.see id.at.
aulicino submitted no objections to the r r,and the district court initially adopted it in full.but the district court subsequently granted aulicino application to submit belated objections inasmuch as their lateness was caused by problems counsel encountered with the court electronic filing system.the court nonetheless concluded that the objections were without merit,affirming its earlier dismissal of the complaint.
aulicino,acting pro se,filed a notice of appeal.through what we understand to be yet a fourth lawyer,he pursues this appeal from the dismissal of his failure to promote and hostile work environment claims.as noted,he has not sought to appeal from the dismissal as it relates to his retaliation claim.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the grant of a motion for summary judgment.beyer county of nassau,cir.such a judgment should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a dispute about a genuine issue exists where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the favor.beyer,at.the court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.id.quoting dallas aerospace,cis air,cir.
aulicino seeks relief under title vii and the new york state and new york city human rights laws.inasmuch as we are able to resolve this matter on federal grounds,we need not and do not address the reach of the city or state statutes.
ii.the failure to promote claim 
a.the applicable legal standard 
at the stage title vii claims are ordinarily analyzed under the familiar framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and its progeny.mathirampuzha potter,cir.
at the first stage under that framework,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case.
to establish a prima facie case of a discriminatory failure to promote,a title vii plaintiff must ordinarily demonstrate that she is a member of a protected class she applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants she was rejected for the position and the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants having the plaintiff qualifications.
petrosino bell,cir quoting brown coach stores,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in all cases,for the plaintiff to avoid an adverse judgment,there must be proof that the plaintiff was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
if the plaintiff carries that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant,which is required to offer a legitimate,rationale for its actions.terry ashcroft,cir.if the defendant meets this second burden,to defeat summary judgment the plaintiff admissible evidence must show circumstances that would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer that the defendant employment decision was more likely than not based in whole or in part on discrimination.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
application of the standard 
we conclude that aulicino has made out a prima facie case for his failure to promote claim.there is no dispute that aulicino is a member of a protected class,a race or color,that he applied for an mvs position that was posted within dhs,that he was denied the position,or that the position remained open until it was given to johnson.the issue is whether the magistrate judge was correct to conclude as a matter of whether the district judge was correct to uphold the aulicino was unqualified for the position and that there was no proof of discriminatory intent.we think those conclusions could not be made as a matter of law on the record before the district court.
viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to aulicino,as we must,beyer,at,a rational jury could find that aulicino was qualified for the mvs position.the necessary qualifications,as reflected in the job posting,were either o ne year of permanent service in the title of motor vehicle operator or o ne year of experience in motor vehicle dispatching,a motor vehicle driver license valid in the state of new york,and possibly possession of a class b commercial drivers license valid in the state of new york.mvs posting.there is evidence from which a rational jury could conclude that aulicino had more than one year of permanent service as an mvo,see resume of thomas aulicino reflecting employment as an mvo from september,and a valid new york driver license,see john dep.aulicino has a class e license.aulicino therefore met his burden to present evidence on that element of his prima facie case.
the r r rightly points out that aulicino did not have at least one year of experience as a motor vehicle dispatcher,nor the class b commercial drivers license set forth in the job posting.r r.but the former was not necessary,in light of aulicino experience as an mvo,and as to the latter,the job posting only notes that it may be required.mvs posting.and even if those qualifications could be interpreted as minimum qualifications from the job posting,a rational jury could nonetheless conclude that dhs did not in practice consider them part of the basic eligibility for the position at issue,slattery swiss reinsurance am,ci
