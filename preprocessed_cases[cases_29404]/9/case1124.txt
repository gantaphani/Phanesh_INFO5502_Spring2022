plaintiff john robert zellner appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,sandra townes,judge,dismissing his claims,brought under,against defendants robert summerlin and thomas weber collectively defendants,as members of the new york state police state police,for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and use of excessive force during arrest.following jury verdicts awarding zellner a total of in compensatory and punitive damages on the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims,the district court granted defendants motion pursuant to.b for judgment as a matter of law dismissing those claims on the ground of qualified immunity.on appeal,zellner contends principally that,in granting judgment as a matter of law,the district court impermissibly decided questions of fact.he also contends that the jury verdict in favor of defendants on his excessive force claim should have been set aside,and a new trial granted on that claim.because we conclude that,in granting judgment as a matter of law,the district court erred by making factual findings adversely to zellner,rather than viewing the record in the light most favorable to him,we reverse so much of the judgment as dismissed zellner false arrest and malicious prosecution claims we remand for entry of an amended judgment reinstating the jury awards of compensatory and punitive damages on those claims.we affirm so much of the judgment as dismissed the excessive force claim.
background 
the present action arises out of a february,demonstration protesting the construction of a new housing development called parrish pond,across a highway from the shinnecock indian reservation shinnecock reservation or reservation in the town of southampton,new york the town.photographs introduced at trial as plaintiff exhibits px showed demonstrators holding placards stating,sacred land,indian land forever,and stop the desecration.
zellner,a adjunct professor of american history at southampton college,served as of the southampton task force,a committee of citizens appointed by the town to investigate complaints of bias and discrimination.he was called to the site of the demonstration by benjamin haile,a shinnecock reservation resident.
the scene of the demonstration was a field area surrounding a driveway leading from a paved public road to the parrish pond development construction site.troopers from the state police were present weber,a major,was in charge.during the demonstration,a truck attempted to enter the driveway and was temporarily blocked by some of the protestors.zellner was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct in violation of penal law penal law mckinney,and resisting arrest,in violation of penal law mckinney.more than a year later,after over a dozen court appearances and adjournments,the charges against him were dismissed for lack of prosecution.
a.the present action 
zellner brought the present action in,alleging,to the extent pertinent here,claims of false arrest,malicious prosecution,and use of excessive force during arrest.a trial was held on those claims against major weber and trooper summerlin other claims and defendants having been dismissed earlier.the trial produced sharply divergent versions of the events leading to zellner arrest.the witnesses included zellner and several residents of the shinnecock reservation who supported his version,and major weber,trooper summerlin,and several other troopers who supported key elements of defendants version.in addition,a videotape,produced by a camera that had been mounted on one of the state police vehicles,was played.
testimony by zellner and reverend davis 
early on the morning of february,zellner received a call at home from haile,asking him to look at a situation on andrew road,just off the reservation.trial transcript tr.at.zellner responded that he was involved in a project he suggested that haile instead call the other of the task force,but that if haile were unable to find someone else to help he should call zellner again.eventually haile called zellner back,stating we need you.tr.
zellner arrived at the demonstration site on andrew road sometime after noon and was greeted by reverend holly davis,a pastor at two area presbyterian churches,who introduced him to some of the protestors.for about a,zellner received information about the situation from some of the shinnecock elders and from reverend davis,learning that the shinnecocks had sought and been granted a temporary injunction against the construction work and that a written restraining order was on the way.reverend davis had been engaged in discussions with major weber most of the day see id.at,see also id.at testimony of weber the reverend davis was telling me all afternoon that the paperwork was being signed,that it was coming.i wanted the injunction order to cease work to arrive so i could calm things down.after zellner arrived,davis,accompanied by a few others including a woman who was a shinnecock elder,introduced zellner to major weber.see id.at.
zellner and weber shook hands,and zellner identified himself as of the task force.zellner described his ensuing conversation with major the follows 
i explained that i had been called and asked to come down and talk to the police an effort to keep things calm.
and,sir,did he respond to you at that point 
a.he did.he said,asked me what business was it of mine,and i reiterated i was of the task force and that i was asked by the community to make sure that he knew that there was a restraining order against the work going on in that area and that i understood that the restraining order was on the way and would they be able to wait before they took any action until the restraining order got there.
q.at that point,sir,what was your demeanor can you describe that for the jury.
my demeanor was very respectful.it was quiet because everybody there was very solemn and respectful and quiet.
and,sir,what next happened,please.
major weber indicated that he knew that there was a restraining order and he said it not here yet,and i said,i understand it not here,but i just wanted to make sure that you know it on the way,and what we concerned about is that there an evenhanded treatment of everyone in this situation.
q.did he respond to you at that point 
well,he did,and i said,c ould you assure me that there will be evenhanded treatment and he said,with some excitement,that we had to keep the road open,and i had observed that the road traffic was moving back and forth on the road,and i said,i t seems that everything is reasonable at this moment.
q.then what happened 
with i was literally speaking to the major,just a few seconds after we had actually shaken hands,i was grabbed from behind and pushed down and pulled backwards out of in front of the major.
and at that time,sir,did you have anything in your hands 
i had a coffee cup.i think i had put it down at some point,but i had picked it back up.i had a coffee cup in my hand,as i recall.that the only thing i had in my hand.
and,sir,at the point that you were pulled,as you indicated,what next happened 
i was very roughly pulled out and my arm was placed behind my back and my arm was twisted extremely painfully and i looked over my right shoulder and i said,you breaking my arm.please do break my arm.
now,sir,at that point that you said that,was there any response to your statement 
q.what was the response 
a.the response was a much more severe twisting of my arm and the words,resisting are you and i said,no.you breaking my arm,please do break my arm.
tr.emphasis added see also id.at i was with major weber and i was grabbed from behind,pulled backwards and down.
zellner testified that his right arm was held at the elbow while his wrist was being turned in the way that his arm did turn,and he could feel the cartilage or tendons cracking.id.at.he stated that he was also kicked or kneed in the jaw and that his left knee was either kicked or stepped on.see id.at.zellner later learned that one of the troopers who had grabbed him from behind was summerlin.see id.at.
zellner testified that before being grabbed,he was not asked to do anything and was not ordered to do anything.id.at see also id.at.he was simply grabbed from behind,without any idea of why or by whom,and was not even told that he was under arrest.id.zellner testified that he did give any resistance except verbally asking them not to injure his arm further.id.at.
reverend davis testified that after she introduced zellner to major weber,she was never more than feet from zellner before he was taken away by the troopers.see tr.she testified that before zellner was grabbed by the troopers,she did not hear any of the troopers give him an order.see id.at.as she and zellner and the others were all standing there id.at,they grabbed bob i called it an attack in my deposition,and down on the ground he was id.at.
the testimony of major weber 
major weber testified that he had been informed by reverend davis on february that an injunction order was being signed,ordering the cessation of construction work at the site.when zellner arrived,weber was waiting for the injunction to arrive so we could put things to rest.tr.weber and zellner shook hands,and weber said to zellner,are you the lawyer.he said yes.id.
q.when he said yes,what is the next thing that you say happened 
i said to him,where is the paperwork.
q.did he respond to you 
q.what did he say 
a.he said you keep this truck out of here even without the paperwork.
major weber testified that when he proceeded to inform zellner that trucks were coming in to refuel equipment and instructed one of the troopers to let the arriving truck enter,zellner sat down on the ground.see,id.at.weber stated that at first he thought zellner had had a heart attack,but zellner then yelled for everyone else to sit down as well.see,id.at.weber testified that he was no more than six or eight inches from zellner at the time,and he described the event as follows 
q.when you were standing that distance from zellner,could you describe for the jury how you claim he sat down 
i shook hands with zellner.he introduced himself.i said,are you the lawyer.zellner replied,either yes or yeah.i said,where is the paperwork,meaning the injunction.he started saying that you should keep these trucks out without the paperwork.
i explained to zellner that the truck was coming in to refuel equipment so they could leave.they already stopped the work.they wanted to leave the scene to go to other projects for the next thirty days,construction projects.they needed some of their equipment.their purpose was to gas the equipment and leave.
with that,zellner again said to me,you should keep the trucks out.i was confused.the trucks were going to move out in ten or fifteen minutes.
with that i said to him,the trucks are coming in and they sic are coming in now.and i told my captain to get these trucks sic in because the trucks sic created a danger to the children that were at the scene.the captain proceeded to try to get the trucks sic in.
with that,zellner dropped to the ground right in front of me.
okay.sir,can you describe how zellner dropped to the ground 
a.zellner proceeded down.while attempting to sit down he stated,everybody down,everybody down.then he either went down on his backside or on his ankles.
sir,when you say either went down on his backside or his ankles,you were standing six inches from him 
q.so which was it 
either his rectum or his ankles.i am not sure.
sir,he did 
a.this happened in a split second.
q.he did sit on his rectum,did he 
either sat on his backside or his ankles.
sir,when this happened,that being zellner allegedly sitting down on his ankles or his backside,as you indicated,were there other officers standing right behind zellner 
take a look at the picture,sir.did their position change any you are looking at px,right 
a.this picture does tell me that zellner is going to sit down.he standing up.
was the position of the officers with regard to zellner different from the point at which px depicts and the point at which zellner sat down on his ankles or his backside 
a.at the time,when zellner dropped,i did notice any troopers around him.nor was i looking for any troopers around him.i was concerned with zellner sitting down because at first i thought he was sick.something was happening right in front of me.he was going down.i was unsure what it was until he stated everybody down,everybody down.then i knew i had a problem.
up to this point that he began dropping,how long had your conversation with the plaintiff lasted 
twenty,thirty seconds.
q.when he began dropping,what was your reaction 
did you think you had probable cause of an arrest of any kind 
q.did he say anything when he was sitting down 
i thought when he started going down,this had never happened to me before,i thought i had somebody sick on thought i had a heart attack on my hands.he started going down.okay.then when he started yelling,everybody down,everybody down,i knew i had what we call passive resistance.he was going to sit down and try to block traffic and he was going to try to get the twenty,thirty,forty other demonstrators to follow his lead,and i knew i had a problem.i had women and children.if they started squatting in front of that pickup truck,and tribal members or demonstrators started gathering on that pickup truck 
i knew i had a problem.if that operator attempted that turn,people would have been hurt.
q.how many times did the plaintiff yell everybody down 
i believe,two times.maybe three.
q.did you see anyone else sit down 
q.what did you do when the plaintiff sat down and said everybody down 
i knew i had to get him.i had two objectives at that point.get him away from the scene and get the trucks sic inside the driveway,to defuse the situation.
q.did you say anything to the plaintiff when he sat down 
i grabbed him right armpit with my left arm.i said get up.
q.did he get up 
what,if anything,was the crowd doing at that point 
i heard the crowd behind me,yelling and screaming.
what did you do at that point 
a.when zellner would get up,i looked up and i saw two or three troopers there and i said,get him out of here,dis con,which is disorderly conduct.
at his deposition some months before trial,major weber had been asked what zellner had done that constituted disorderly conduct.weber answer had then been he sat down on a driveway in a paved portion of the road,i do know exactly where,for the purposes of obstructing vehicle traffic,and i determined that was disorderly conduct tr.internal quotation marks omitted.
the testimony of other troopers 
summerlin testified that after someone came running down the road wa ving their cell phone and stating that they had received a court order tr,zellner was yelling at the major,pointing his finger,saying you should wait for the court order,you should wait for the court order id.at.at the time,summerlin testified,major weber was trying,in a professional and businesslike manner,to explain that the truck was entering solely to refuel an vehicle,and that the project was shutting down.see id.at.
q.after major weber explained why the truck was attempting to enter and the plaintiff was yelling at major weber and pointing at him,what happened next 
a.at some point in time all i can remember is that as i was looking out i heard someone say everybody down,zellner fell down to his knees and folded his legs scissor fashion.

the videotape and photographs 
the video camera did not record any part of zellner interaction with major weber.it was located to the north of the driveway and was pointed south at a short stretch of andrew road.the videotape shows sparse vehicular traffic on the road,some pedestrian,and a congregation of people at the west edge of the road,north of the driveway.the driveway still photographs show as no more than a somewhat path leading through a field of brush and bushes see,px is not visible on the videotape.for some minutes,according to the display on the videotape,zellner is shown at the edge of the road talking to demonstrators a zoom shot during this period shows zellner holding a coffee mug.
at,the videotape shows a pickup truck arriving,signaling for a left turn into the parrish pond development.a trooper goes into the road to the truck,which begins a left turn but stops as people appear to congregate around it.at about the same time zellner walks away from the road and into another crowd of people,away from the camera,moving closer to the driveway.the videotape shows zellner,partially obscured,bending forward from the waist at,straightening up at,bending forward again at,and straightening up again at.zellner then all but disappears into the crowd,and for most of the next approximately four minutes,only his hat is visible on the tape.a still photograph,px,which by all accounts depicts the scene inside that crowd moments before zellner began speaking with major weber see,tr,shows zellner coffee mug in hand standing with gumbs,wright,and two other protestors,surrounded by summerlin,parker,and two other unidentified troopers.no one appears to be saying anything major weber,his side turned toward this group,is standing a few feet away from zellner.
at about on the videotape,zellner hat disappears from view,and he is not seen again on the tape for some seconds.a still photograph,however,px,was taken in the interim.it shows zellner tilted backward at about a angle,with summerlin holding his left arm,parker holding his right arm,drew with a hand on the back side of zellner jacket see tr,and major weber leaning forward with his left arm outstretched,his hand on zellner right shoulder see,id.at.the postures of troopers summerlin and parker indicate that they are pulling zellner backwards.major weber testified that px shows the troopers escorting zellner away after he sat down in the driveway.tr.zellner,in contrast,testified that px shows the exact moment when he was unexpectedly pulled from behind and taken to the ground.tr.reverend davis similarly testified that,in px,the troopers were pulling zellner to the ground.tr.
at about,the videotape shows zellner,upright and walking,being brought out through the crowd by two troopers.a subsequent still photo,px,shows zellner prone,on the ground with troopers summerlin and parker apparently cuffing his hands behind his back,and trooper drew watching.
when zellner was asked about the segment of the videotape at,which showed him twice bending forward at the waist,he testified that he had bent first to put his coffee mug down in order to button his coat or tie its belt,and then had bent again to retrieve the mug.see tr.major weber,however,after having been shown that part of the videotape,testified,i like to call them practice runs id.at.
i sorry,sir 
i like to call it a practice run.
id.shown that segment again,weber testified that he viewed zellner as practicing sitting down and showing the demonstrators how to sit down 
sir,we at.the truck is there correct 
q.zellner is still standing there 
yes,he is.there he is.
q.when you just at,and that would have been or seconds.you saying that was a dry run 
i believe after seeing this video that was a practice run on how to engage in passive resistance,sitting down.
sir,when he leaned forward as though to go to whatever in sic front of him,you saying that that is the equivalent of sitting down 
that is the equivalent of sitting down.
instructing the demonstrators how to sit down.
the relevant part of the videotape had no sound,and hence provided no evidence that anyone had shouted everybody down.neither the videotape nor any of the still photographs showed zellner sitting.
b.the rule a motions and the instructions to the jury 
following the conclusion of zellner case,defendants moved pursuant to.a for judgment as a matter of law,arguing a that zellner had failed to present evidence that was legally sufficient to support his claims,and b that,in any event,defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion.it stated,inter alia,that the matter of qualified immunity needed to be briefed by both sides.see tr.and the court stated that there were factual issues to be decided by the jury 
this case comes down to factual issues,either the jury believes that the plaintiff was attacked for no reason,kicked and whatever,or they believe that he jumped down on the driveway to obstruct traffic.that is what the issue is going to be.
id.at.after the close of all the evidence,defendants renewed their rule a motion.the court again denied the motion,stating t here are factual issues that have to be determined by a jury.id.at.
during the charging conference,at which the court and the parties discussed the instructions and questions to be given to the jury,defendants requested yet again that the court decide their qualified immunity defense as a matter of law 
leahey defendants counsel your honor,as to the qualified immunity issue,could you let me know what your intentions are with respect to that.
the court because of the factual issues,i can not make a determination until the jury makes a determination.
leahey your honor,i would take an exception to that.
i would state that in the first instance qualified immunity is a question of law for the court to decide 
the court it is if there are no factual issues.if this occurred and the jury finds that it occurred the way that the plaintiff say s it occurred,there is no immunity.
tr.emphases added.defense counsel argued that,for the court not to rule on the qualified immunity defense and not to give the jury a qualified immunity set of instructions,would be prejudicial for the defendants and not the law.id.the court disagreed 
the court it is the law,because there is a factual dispute here,the factual dispute has to be resolved before there can be a finding of whether or not there is qualified immunity.
you ca do it on this record.you would not get summary judgment had you had this record and made this motion,because there are questions of fact.
id.emphasis added.
focusing chiefly on zellner claim of excessive force,defendants asked the court to pose to the jury the question of whether the events surrounding plaintiff arrest,particularly grabbing him,throwing him to the ground,kicking him and twisting his arm occur red substantially as plaintiff testified.id.at.it was agreed that as plaintiff testified would be changed to as plaintiff contends,in order to encompass not just zellner own testimony but the testimony of his witnesses as well.id.the court decided that it would pose these detailed factual questions individually,because if there is a verdict here,i have to make a decision on qualified immunity,it only with as much information about that as i can get.id.at.
comparably detailed questions were not,however,requested as to zellner conduct relating to his claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution.defendants proposed that the jury be asked did the defendants have probable cause to believe that plaintiff was committing disorderly conduct by obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic by blocking the driveway.tr.they argued that this question encapsulates the factual conflict in this case as to false arrest,did he or did he not cause obstruction on the roadway,by blocking the driveway.id.at.the proposed question,however,was a compound question,and the court elected to ask the jury simply whether defendants had probable cause to believe that zellner had committed the offense of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest.defendants did not propose any simple fact questions,such as whether zellner had blocked the driveway,or sat down,or yelled everybody down.
the court instructions to the jury with respect to zellner claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution described the parties positions,in part,as follows 
the plaintiff contends that his constitutional right s were violated when he was unlawfully arrested by the defendants for the violation of disorderly conduct and the misdemeanor crime of resisting arrest a nd when he was maliciously prosecuted by the defendants for the violation and the misdemeanor 
the defendants contend that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff on both charges a nd there was probable cause to prosecute the plaintiff on both charges and this was done without malice.
t he defendants contend that the plaintiff initiated a confrontation with major weber,dropped to the driveway,where he sat to obstruct entrance to the driveway by a construction truck and he incited others to block the driveway.when he was told he was under arrest,he resisted arrest by causing his body to become limp and flailing his arms and placing his arms under his body when troopers attempted to handcuff him.
tr.emphases added.
with respect to zellner claim of false arrest,the court told the jury that the critical question for you to decide is whether the arrest of the plaintiff was lawful,and that whether the arrest was lawful centers on whether the arrest was made by the defendants acting on probable cause to believe that zellner had committed the offense of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest.id.at.the court explained,inter alia,that p robable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police officers at the time the arrest was made were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable prudence to believe that a violation or a crime had been committed by the person arrested.id.at.
the court read the provisions of the new york disorderly conduct and resisting arrest statutes under which zellner had been charged.as to,the court stated 
a person is guilty of disorderly conduct when with intent to cause public inconvenience,annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof,he obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic.to be guilty of disorderly conduct,the perpetrator must act with intent to cause public inconvenience,annoyance or alarm or recklessly creating a risk thereof.
inconvenience means tampering with the legitimate transaction of public business.annoyance means discomfort or vexation.alarm means sudden fear.
tr.as to resisting arrest,the court stated that 
s ection of the new york penal law,insofar as it is applicable to this case,reads as follows a person is guilty of resisting arrest when he intentionally prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer or a peace officer from effecting an authorized arrest.
the arrest at issue must have been made in accordance with the law.namely,that it was based on probable cause.also,resisting arrest does not require that the person being arrested use force or violence.it is enough if he engages in his conduct with the intent of preventing the officer from effecting the authorized arrest of himself.
accordingly,on the issue of the alleged constitutional violation,making an unlawful arrest for disorderly conduct or resisting arrest,if you determine that there was no probable cause to arrest plaintiff on either of those charges and that defendants actions were a proximate cause of injury to zellner,your verdict will be in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants,as to the federal section false arrest cause of action.
however,if you determine that there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff for either disorderly conduct or resisting arrest,then the arrest would be lawful and your verdict must be in favor of the defendants with regard to the charge of false arrest.
also,as i instructed you,the fact that both charges against the plaintiff resulted in a dismissal is not evidence that the defendants lacked probable cause at the time of the arrest.
in instructing the jury with respect to the claim of malicious prosecution,the court described the four elements of such a claim,initiation of a proceeding,termination of the proceeding in the plaintiff favor,lack of probable cause for commencement or continuation of the proceeding,and actual malice on the part of the defendants in commencing or continuing the proceeding.see tr.the court instructed,inter alia,that 
i f probable cause existed for the police officer to commence a criminal prosecution against the plaintiff,then the plaintiff can not recover against the defendant who initiated the criminal proceeding.
id.at.the court added 
i further instruct you that if you find that the defendants did not act maliciously,your verdict must be in favor of the defendants on the malicious prosecution claim even though you find that they did not have probable cause to believe the plaintiff committed either disorderly conduct or the crime of resisting arrest that was charged.only if you find that the plaintiff has proved both 
one,that the defendants did not have probable cause to charge the plaintiff with either the violation or the crime,and 
two,that the defendants acted with malice,will your verdict be in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants.
the court gave instructions on compensatory damages and reminded the jury that throughout the case you are considering each defendant separately and your verdict will be reported separately as to each defendant.tr.the court also informed the jury that if it found that zellner was entitled to recover and further found that a defendant had caused him injury maliciously or wantonly or oppressively and deserved to be punished,it had discretion to award zellner punitive damages.see tr.the court explained that 
a n act or failure to act is maliciously done if prompted or accompanied by ill will or spite or grudge toward the injured person individually.an act or failure to act is w anton ly done if done in reckless or callous disregard of or indifferent to the rights of the injured person.an act or a failure to act is oppressively done if done in a way or manner which injur es or damages or otherwise violates the rights of another person with unnecessary harshness or severity or by misuse or abuse of authority or power or by taking advantage of some weaknesses or misfortune of another person.
id.at.the court stated,however,that the jury should initially make a finding only as to whether punitive damages were warranted,without attempting to determine an amount.see id.
c.the jury verdict 
the jury was given a special verdict sheet posing questions,most with subparts,to be answered with respect to a the merits of zellner claims against each defendant,b the amount of compensatory damages,if any,that zellner should receive from each defendant,and c whether or not he should receive punitive damages.as detailed below,the jury found in favor of zellner on his claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution,awarding him compensatory damages in the amount of against each defendant,and found that zellner was entitled to punitive damages as well the jury found against zellner on his claim of excessive force,although it credited his evidence that defendants had grabbed him and twisted his arm.
the precise questions posed on the special verdict sheet,and the jury findings in response,were as follows 
do you find by a preponderance of the evidence 
instructions as to damages 
if your verdict is in favor of both defendants on all causes of action,do not answer the damages questions below,cease deliberations,and the foreperson should sign and date the verdict sheet and advise the court by note that you are ready to return to the courtroom to announce your verdict.
on the other hand,if you have found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on any of the causes of action,please answer the appropriate damages questions that follow.
compensatory damages 
punitive damages 
you are to consider the subject of punitive damages only with regard to a defendant or defendants you have found liable on any of the causes of action.
november,verdict sheet special verdict.
in connection with the jury finding that zellner should receive punitive damages,the trial continued for an additional of testimony with respect to each defendant financial condition.following further deliberations,the jury assessed punitive damages of against weber and against summerlin.see november,verdict.
judgment was eventually entered reflecting the jury verdicts.
d.the posttrial motions 
following the jury verdicts,defendants renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to.b,arguing principally a that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury findings in favor of zellner on his claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution and its award of punitive damages,and b that the officers were protected by qualified immunity.defendants also moved in the alternative for a new trial on the ground,inter alia,that the court should have allowed them to present evidence at trial as to facts that would have given them probable cause to arrest zellner on other charges.
zellner opposed defendants motions and moved pursuant to.a for a new trial on his excessive force claim.in support of his motion,zellner argued principally that the jury should have been instructed that if it found in his favor on the false arrest claim it must also find that the force used to effect the arrest was excessive.
in an opinion dated september,reported at d,the district court granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law dismissing zellner false arrest and malicious prosecution claims only on the ground of qualified immunity and it denied zellner motion for a new trial on his excessive force claim.in rejecting defendants challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the issue of probable cause,the court stated as follows 
defendants argue that they had probable cause to arrest plaintiff based on the fact that he intentionally blocked the truck as it was attempting to enter the construction site,which defendants argue is incontrovertibly shown by the videotape,and initiated a confrontation with weber during this tense standoff by urging weber to hold off on taking any action until the protective order arrived in a manner that was obstructive and distracting,in view of the imminent crisis posed by the truck.however,the video itself was not conclusive as to what happened when the truck attempted to turn into the site,and the testimony at trial was contradictory,with plaintiff and members of the shinnecock tribe testifying that plaintiff did not obstruct the path of the truck but merely engaged weber in conversation in an attempt to maintain the status quo until the restraining order arrived.the jury was free to consider all of the evidence and to weigh the credibility of the witnesses.in deciding in plaintiff favor on the false arrest claim,the jury found plaintiff account of the events worthy of more credence.this court can not now the conflicting evidence or draw its own conclusions as to the credibility of the witnesses at trial,for to do so would be to substitute the court judgment for that of the jury,which is not permitted.smith lightning bolt,cir.thus,the court finds that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the jury finding that plaintiff arrest was not based on probable cause.
d at emphases added.
in denying defendants challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on zellner malicious prosecution claim,the court stated as follows 
defendants argue that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the officers lacked probable cause to initiate the prosecution and that they harbored malice towards plaintiff.as discussed above,there was evidence adduced at trial to support the jury verdict that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest plaintiff and there was no suggestion that defendants thereafter obtained further evidence giving them probable cause to believe plaintiff was guilty of the crimes charged against him with respect to malice,the second circuit has held that where a jury could find that probable cause for the charges against the plaintiff was lacking that finding alone would support an inference of malice.ricciuti new york city transit,cir.thus,the court will not disturb the jury finding that defendants acted without probable cause and with malice in prosecuting plaintiff.
d at.in addition,the court also ruled,inter alia,that defendants challenge to the jury award of punitive damages was without merit,noting that p unitive damages are available in section cases where the defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.id.at quoting smith wade,d.the court found that the award of punitive damages here was supported by the jury findings and the evidence,and that the amounts awarded were within the range found reasonable in similar cases.see d at.
as to defendants entitlement to qualified immunity,the court,after noting that it was required,on defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law,to view the evidence in the light most favorable to zellner,stated as follows 
the evidence presented at trial established the following events leading up to plaintiff arrest there was a large crowd of demonstrators at the construction site who had been there for several hours the demonstrators were instructed by the police to stay off of the road and the driveway allowing ingress to and egress from the site a construction truck arrived on the scene and the driver indicated his intention to enter the site through the driveway by turning on his blinker the truck remained immobile in the road for nearly five minutes,blocking traffic completely from at least one direction while the truck was stopped in the road,demonstrators,including children,walked and ran around it plaintiff walked into the driveway and turned to face the road where the truck was waiting plaintiff engaged weber in conversation and urged weber not to take any action until a restraining order,which was expected,arrived,to which weber responded that the road needed to remain clear and at some point plaintiff made a crouching or squatting motion towards the ground.
id.at emphasis added.c onsider ing all of these events in context in deciding whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that there was no probable cause to arrest plaintiff for disorderly conduct,the court concluded as follows 
it is apparent from the record that defendants were faced with a tense situation for the several minutes when the construction truck was attempting to enter a construction site flanked on all sides by protestors and their children.it is further clear that plaintiff actions in engaging major weber in conversation at that point,thereby distracting his attention from the situation,and in making some sort of movement that could have been interpreted as an attempt to sit down in the path of the truck,only exacerbated the situation.thus,while defendants may have acted without justifiable cause in arresting plaintiff,the court can not say that their judgment was so flawed that no reasonable officer would have made a similar choice.lennon miller,cir see also hunter bryant,d the qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.quoting malley briggs,d.thus,the court finds that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest and malicious prosecution charges.
d at emphases added.
zellner,in his rule a motion for a new trial,argued principally that the jury should have been instructed that if it found in his favor on the false arrest claim,it must also find in his favor on the claim,because if the arrest was unlawful no force whatever could be justified.for that proposition,zellner relied on atkins new york city,cir.the district court denied this motion for three reasons.first,zellner had not requested such an instruction.second,the court concluded that atkins was not intended to be so read.third,the court stated that defendants would in any event be entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive force claim as well.see d at.
a new final judgment was entered dismissing all of zellner claims against weber and summerlin.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,zellner contends principally that,in ruling that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of qualified immunity with respect to his false arrest and malicious prosecution claims,the district court impermissibly made findings of fact and ignored facts found by the jury.he also contends that the court should have granted his motion for a new trial with respect to his excessive force claim,on the theory that the jury should have been instructed that if his arrest was unauthorized,the use of any force by the officers was excessive as a matter of law.
defendants contend,inter alia,that the entry of judgment as a matter of law in their favor should be upheld on the ground that they had either actual or arguable probable cause to arrest zellner for disorderly conduct in violation of of the new york penal law as charged,or to arrest him under subsections and of that section or under penal law mckinney see defendants brief on appeal at.they state that the question here is whether the evidence establishes that,despite the jury conclusion that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest zellner for disorderly conduct or resisting arrest,it was nonetheless reasonable for defendants to believe they had probable cause to arrest zellner for any charge.defendants brief on appeal at emphasis in original.
as to the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims,we conclude that,in light of the jury findings and the principles a that factual disputes are to be resolved by the jury,and b that on a motion for judgment as a matter of law the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,the granting of judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants was error.as to the excessive force claim,we see no error in the district court denial of zellner motion for a new trial.
judgment as a matter of law on the basis of qualified immunity 
qualified immunity 
qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d see,mitchell forsyth,d coons casabella,cir coons cerrone brown,cir cerrone.where the right at issue in the circumstances confronting police,the right not to be subjected to a warrantless arrest without probable clearly established but was violated,the officers will nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity if it was objectively reasonable for them to believe their acts did not violate those rights.oliveira mayer,cir oliveira,cert.denied,d see,anderson creighton,d.the qualified immunity test is an objective one.i f officers of reasonable competence could disagree as to whether probable cause existed,immunity should be recognized.malley briggs,d.but if,on an objective basis,it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that probable cause existed,d efendants will not be immune id.
whether a defendant officer conduct was objectively reasonable is a mixed question of law and fact.see,kerman city of new york,cir kerman lennon miller,cir lennon oliveira,at warren dwyer,cir.warren,cert.denied,d.the ultimate question of whether it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that his conduct did not violate a clearly established right,whether officers of reasonable competence could disagree as to the lawfulness of such conduct,is to be decided by the court.however,a contention a clear delineation of the rights and duties of the respective parties at the time of the acts complained was objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his acts did not violate those rights has its principal focus on the particular facts of the case.kerman,at quoting hurlman rice,cir see,oliveira,at.
if there is no dispute as to the material historical facts,the matter of whether the officer conduct was objectively reasonable is an issue of law to be determined by the court.see,lennon,at robison via,cir.i f there is such a dispute,however,the factual questions must be resolved by the factfinder.kerman,at see,oliveira,at calamia city of new york,cir.
once the jury has resolved any disputed facts that are material to the qualified immunity issue,the ultimate determination of whether the officer conduct was objectively reasonable is to be made by the court.see,stephenson doe,cir after the district court receives the jury deci sion as to what the facts were that the officer faced or perceived,the court then may make the ultimate legal determination of whether qualified immunity attaches on those facts internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added lennon,at the ultimate question of entitlement to qualified immunity is one of law for the court to decide o nce disputed factual issues are resolved internal quotation marks omitted warren,at if there are unresolved factual issues which prevent an early disposition of the defense,the jury should decide these issues the ultimate legal determination whether a reasonable police officer should have known he acted unlawfully should be made by the court on the facts found by the jury.accord id.at,winter,dissenting although the ultimate decision regarding the qualified immunity defense is for the court,the court that is ruling on the qualified immunity issue must know what the facts were that the officer faced or perceived,and the finding of those facts appears to be a matter for the jury.
qualified immunity is an affirmative defense.see gomez toledo,d.
b ecause qualified immunity is an affirmative defense,it is incumbent upon the defendant to plead,and adequately develop,a qualified immunity defense during pretrial proceedings so that the trial court can determine which facts material to the qualified immunity defense must be presented to the jury to determine its applicability once the case has gone to trial.
blissett coughlin,cir emphasis added.to the extent that a particular finding of fact is essential to a determination by the court that the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity,it is the responsibility of the defendant to request that the jury be asked the pertinent question.see,id.if the defendant does not make such a request,he is not entitled to have the court,in lieu of the jury,make the needed factual finding.see,kerman,at see also warren,at the jury should decide these issues on special interrogatories.
probable cause and arguable probable cause 
probable cause to arrest exists when the officers have knowledge of,or reasonably trustworthy information as to,facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.see,dunaway new york,d wong sun united states,d brinegar united states.carroll united states.lee sandberg,cir.probable cause is to be assessed on an objective basis.whether probable cause exists depends upon the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the facts known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.devenpeck alford,d.a n arresting officer state of mind except for the facts that he knows is irrelevant to the existence of probable cause.see whren united states,d reviewing cases arkansas sullivan,d per curiam.devenpeck,at.emphasis added.thus,an officer subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause,an arrest is not unlawful so long as the officer has knowledge of,or reasonably trustworthy information as to,facts and circumstances sufficient to provide probable cause to believe that the person arrested has committed any crime,see,id.at.jaegly couch,cir a plaintiff is not entitled to damages under for false arrest so long as the arrest itself was supported by probable cause,regardless of whether probable cause supported any individual charge identified by the arresting officer at the time of arrest.
the existence of probable cause need not be assessed on the basis of the knowledge of a single officer.
a n arrest is permissible where the actual arresting or searching officer lacks the specific information to form the basis for probable cause or reasonable suspicion but sufficient information to justify the arrest or search was known by other law enforcement officials initiating or involved with the investigation.
united states colon,cir see,united states hensley,d.this principle,known as the collective or imputed knowledge doctrine,recognizes that,in light of the complexity of modern police work,the arresting officer can not always be aware of every aspect of an investigation sometimes his authority to arrest a suspect is based on facts known only to his superiors or associates.united states valez,cir,cert.denied,d see,united states colon,at.
where it has been conceded or established that the officers arrested the plaintiff without a warrant and without probable cause,the question raised by the qualified immunity defense is whether it was objectively reasonable for the officers to believe they did have probable cause.referring to this standard as arguable probable cause,we have stated that 
a rguable probable cause exists when a reasonable police officer in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the officer in question could have reasonably believed that probable cause existed in the light of well established law.lee sandberg,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
cerrone,at emphasis in original see also escalera lunn,cir arguable probable cause exists if either a it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed,or b officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.quoting golino city of new haven,cir.
although the tests for probable cause and arguable probable cause are thus not congruent,see,anderson creighton,at,the concept of probable cause is the same in both inquiries.probable cause existed if at the moment the arrest was made the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the suspect had violated the law,hunter bryant,d quoting beck ohio,d emphasis ours and an officer sued under the fourth amendment for false arrest is entitled to immunity if a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed,hunter,at.emphasis added.accordingly,like the probable cause analysis,the analysis of a qualified immunity defense to claims that official actions were taken without probable cause entails an inquiry into the facts known to the officer at the time of the arrest,coons,at.a court must evaluate the objective reasonableness of the appellants conduct in light of the information the officers possessed.cerrone,at quoting anderson creighton,at.
arguable probable cause must not be misunderstood to mean almost probable cause.jenkins city of new york,cir.
the essential inquiry in determining whether qualified immunity is available to an officer accused of false arrest is whether it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that probable cause existed.see anderson creighton,at there should be no doubt that probable cause remains the relevant standard.if officers of reasonable competence would have to agree that the information possessed by the officer at the time of arrest did not add up to probable cause,the fact that it came close does not immunize the officer.

the standard for judgment as a matter of law 
in considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court 
must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.thus,although the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.
reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting anderson liberty lobby,d emphases ours.thus,a court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law only if it can conclude that,with credibility assessments made against the moving party and all inferences drawn against the moving party,a reasonable juror wouldhave been compelled to accept the view of the moving party.piesco koch,cir emphasis added.in ruling on such a motion,the court must bear in mind that the jury is free to believe part and disbelieve part of any witness testimony.see,fiacco city of rensselaer,cir,cert.denied,d see also haywood koehler,cir jurors are free to accept bits of testimony from several witnesses and to make reasonable inferences from whatever testimony they credit.
incontrovertible evidence relied on by the moving party,such as a relevant videotape whose accuracy is unchallenged,should be credited by the court on such a motion if it so utterly discredits the opposing party version that no reasonable juror could fail to believe the version advanced by the moving party.see scott harris,d so holding with respect to proceedings on summary judgment see generally reeves,at.the standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the standard for judgment as a matter of law,such that the inquiry under each is the same quoting anderson liberty lobby,at.

the record in the present case 
in the present case,defendants seek to defend the district court decision granting them qualified immunity as a matter of law by asserting that they had actual or arguable probable cause to arrest zellner a for disorderly conduct in violation of penal law,as charged,and b for other violations not charged,to wit,disorderly conduct in violation of subsections and of and obstructing the troopers functioning in violation of penal law.we conclude,applying the above principles,that the record does not support qualified immunity on any of these bases.
disorderly conduct as charged,
in support of probable cause or arguable probable cause for zellner arrest on the actual charge of violating,which involves obstruction of traffic,defendants state principally that after the truck arrived,zellner walked into the crowd that was in the direct path of the truck defendants brief on appeal at that zellner deliberately started to sit down and shouted for everybody else to do so id.at and that during his conversation with major weber,zellner crouched,squatted,or made some other movement toward the ground see id.at,that reasonably could have been interpreted as an attempt to sit down in the path of the truck id.at.these contentions impermissibly disregard the evidence and the jury verdict.
first,defendants assertion that zellner walked into the crowd that was in the direct path of the truck defendants brief on appeal at is unaccompanied by any supporting citation.moreover,if we draw all inferences in zellner favor,as we must,the record does not support the contention that zellner was actually and immediately blocking the truck.reverend davis testified that zellner was not with the group that was standing in front of the truck but rather was away from the road.see tr.and although the videotape shows that zellner walked into a group of people standing in and around the driveway,it is impossible to tell whether he was in the truck direct path at any time.
second,although major weber and the troopers who testified at trial stated that zellner had sat down on the ground,and some of the troopers testified that zellner had yelled for everyone else to sit as well,the jury rejection of that testimony is implicit in its finding that defendants failed to show that they had probable cause for zellner arrest for disorderly conduct.the evidence taken in the light most favorable to we are required to view it,and the jury was at liberty to view that zellner introduced himself to major weber,and the two shook hands that,in a quiet and respectful manner,zellner said that he understood that a restraining order requiring cessation of the construction work was on the way that he requested of major weber that the troopers not take any further action until the restraining order arrived and that zellner said he hoped that there would be evenhanded treatment of everyone.some seconds into this conversation,while literally still speaking to major weber,zellner was grabbed from behind,pulled backwards away from weber,and pulled and pushed to the ground.
zellner and his witnesses testified that zellner did not sit down and that he did not attempt to sit down.zellner did not yell everybody down to the crowd even once,much less two or three times as major weber testified.zellner did not yell anything.the protestors who testified at trial,some of whom were close enough to touch zellner before he was grabbed by the troopers,did not hear him yell anything.even trooper parker,standing right behind zellner and slightly to his right,did not hear him yell anything.plainly the jury was not required to accept the defense version that zellner sat down on the ground or that he yelled for anyone else to sit down.
nor is there merit in defendants assertion,invoking the district court findings,that d uring his conversation with major weber defendants brief on appeal at,zellner made a crouching or squatting motion towards the ground or otherwise made some sort of movement that could have been interpreted as an attempt to sit down in the path of the truck id.at quoting district court opinion,d at emphasis ours.the contention that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this basis is flawed for a number of reasons.
first,no trooper could make the interpret ation hypothesized above,unless zellner actually made a crouching,squatting,or other downward movement.absent such a movement,there was nothing for the troopers to interpret.whether or not zellner made any such movement,however,was a question of fact.the court found that some motion was made defendants brief on appeal at,which obviously was a factual finding.but making findings of fact and drawing factual inferences are jury functions,not those of a judge.reeves,at.quoting anderson liberty lobby,at.
second,as to any act that defendants contended zellner performed,and which they wished to argue provided either probable cause or arguable probable cause for his arrest,it was incumbent on defendants to have the jury decide whether zellner in fact performed that act.defendants did not request that the court include in the special verdict sheet any question as to the conduct in which zellner engaged,including whether he sat down on the ground,or made a crouching or squatting motion,or made any movement toward the ground.no such question having been put to the jury and answered favorably to defendants,no movement by zellner such as crouching or squatting was established as a fact.the court was not entitled to provide the missing factual finding unless the inference the court drew was one that the jury would have been compelled to draw.
no inference that zellner made such a movement was compelled in this case.defendants argue that the court finding that zellner made a crouching or squatting motion or some other such movement towards the ground was appropriate because the jury rejected zellner assertion that he was thrown to the ground.defendants brief on appeal at quoting district court opinion,d at.this contention disregards the record,the verdict,and the principles discussed in part.above.although the jury found that zellner did not establish that he was throw n to the ground special verdict answer emphasis added,zellner had testified that he was with major weber when he was grabbed from behind,pulled backwards and down tr.and that he was grabbed from behind and pushed down id.at.reverend davis testified to her observation that zellner was taken to the ground by troopers touching him.id.at.the photograph introduced as px,in which zellner body is at a angle to the ground,shows four troopers touching zellner summerlin and parker having hold of his arms,with most of their body mass behind zellner drew with his hand on zellner back see tr.and major weber with his left arm fully extended,leaning toward zellner with his hand on zellner right shoulder.zellner and reverend davis testified that px shows the precise point at which zellner had been grabbed and was being taken to the ground,and the positions and postures of all the persons shown in that picture are entirely consistent with the testimony that zellner was grabbed from behind and was pulled and pushed to the ground.the jury found t hat the events surrounding plaintiff arrest,particularly grabbing him,occurred substantially as plaintiff contends special verdict answer emphasis added.zellner being grabbed from behind and pushed and pulled down is not inconsistent with the finding that he had not been subjected to the more violent action of being throw n down.
further,the evidence contradicts the proposition that zellner crouched,squatted,or otherwise moved downward in a way that could reasonably have been interpreted as an attempt to sit down.all of the troopers who testified at trial testified that zellner dropped to the ground and actually sat.major weber,who was standing inches from zellner,testified that zellner dropped to the ground tr.in a split second id.at.no trooper testified that zellner,instead of actually sitting,had made a crouching,squatting,or other motion that could have been interpreted as an attempt to sit.having discredited the troopers actual testimony that zellner in fact sat,the jury was not required to infer that zellner had instead made some lesser movement that no trooper described.
moreover,consistent with the absence of any testimony by the troopers that zellner had crouched,squatted,or made any other such movement,zellner witnesses testified that zellner was simply standing there when he was grabbed by the troopers.wright testified that zellner was standing,doing n othing.tr.reverend davis testified to her observation that,other than drinking coffee,he was doing anything.id.at.and gumbs,when asked what zellner was doing with his body before he was grabbed,testified that zellner was standing there,not sitting or anything else.id.at emphasis added.
the factual proposition that zellner had made some movement that could reasonably have been interpreted as an attempt to sit in the path of the truck is thus inconsistent with the evidence and is a proposition that the jury,even if asked,would not have been required to in light of its conclusions that the version of the facts presented by the troopers was not credible and that defendants treatment of zellner warranted the imposition of punitive damages.
in sum,as the jury was entitled to credit zellner testimony and that of his witnesses that he had done nothing but stand and talk to major we
