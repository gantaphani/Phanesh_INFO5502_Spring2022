appellants john corr and john grigsby brought this putative class action attacking the legality of the toll charged by the metropolitan washington airports authority mwaa for use of the dulles toll road.they contend that this toll is,in reality,an illegal tax.the district court dismissed their complaint on numerous grounds.for the following reasons,we affirm.
in,congress authorized the construction of the airport now known as washington dulles international airport.the federal government also acquired a running from interstate,the capital beltway,to dulles airport,on which it constructed the dulles airport access highway.the access highway runs the length of the,with no exits and no tolls,exclusively to service traffic to and from the airport.the government reserved a strip of land in the median of the access highway for a possible future public transportation project.
in,the virginia department of transportation requested and received an easement on which to construct a toll road within the to serve traffic traveling between washington,and fairfax county,virginia.that road,known as the dulles toll road or,officially,as the omer hirst adelard brault expressway opened in and connects interstate with virginia route.
also in,the united states secretary of transportation proposed the formation of a regional airport authority which would take over control of ronald reagan washington and dulles international airports from the united states.virginia and the district of columbia both adopted legislation to enter into an interstate compact to form this airport authority.congress passed legislation approving the compact in and leased the two airports to the newly formed mwaa.see metropolitan washington airports act of transfer act,title.vi,stat.codified as amended at et.
the mwaa was,on one hand,formed as an entity independent from virginia,the district of columbia,and the united states government.id.a.on the other,it was to possess the powers delegated to it by the district of columbia and virginia.id.a a.congress also explicitly granted mwaa the power to to levy fees or other charges.id.b e.nonetheless,though the mwaa assumed control over the two washington airports,the dulles toll road continued to be operated not by mwaa but by the virginia commonwealth transportation board ctb.
in the ensuing decades,the virginia general assembly repeatedly authorized ctb to use toll revenue to fund mass transit projects within the dulles corridor.in,the virginia general assembly authorized ctb to use surplus revenue from the dulles toll road to fund improvements,including mass transit projects.acts ch.in,the virginia general assembly again authorized ctb to use surplus toll road revenue to fund mass transit improvements and to raise another million by issuing new bonds.acts ch.in,the general assembly approved a ctb resolution providing that ctb would spend of its surplus revenue from the dulles toll road to fund mass transportation initiatives in the dulles corridor.res.finally,in,the virginia general assembly granted ctb authority to issue revenue bonds to fund,among other things,a rail project in the dulles corridor,to be paid with revenues from the dulles toll road.acts ch.ctb then raised the dulles toll road rates,earmarking the additional money raised for extending the washington metrorail system through the dulles corridor.the metrorail expansion is planned to extend through the corridor with stops both before and after the dulles airport.
mwaa,meanwhile,shared virginia goal of extending the metrorail system to dulles airport.moreover,under the transfer act,mwaa was to assume responsibility for the federal aviation administration master plans for the metropolitan washington airports.a.the faa master plans called for an expansion of the metrorail system to dulles airport.see faa record of decision,dulles corridor metrorail project.
therefore,to fulfill this mandate,mwaa proposed to take control of the metrorail expansion project,as well as the dulles toll road which was providing much of the revenue for the expansion.virginia agreed and control transferred from virginia to mwaa in december of.the agreement gave mwaa the power to set tolls on the dulles toll road,but required it to use revenues exclusively for transportation improvements within the dulles corridor.
this arrangement has now been subject to repeated legal challenges.almost immediately after the agreement was executed,two drivers sued in virginia state court seeking a declaration that mwaa use of revenue for the metrorail project was taxation without representation in violation of the virginia constitution.see.const.art.i.the virginia court there determined that the tolls were not taxes.gray.sec y of,no.cl,am.order,j.
a second action was brought in,this time in federal court.among many other counts,the plaintiffs in that suit also contended that mwaa use of toll revenue to fund the metrorail project was an illegal tax under the virginia constitution.that case,however,was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing.parkridge,llc dep t of,app x,cir.
in april of,appellants initiated this action seeking to enjoin mwaa from using revenue to repay bonds issued to fund the metrorail project and seeking refunds of all excess tolls collected.concluding that plaintiffs grievance was too generalized to support standing,the district court dismissed the complaint on prudential grounds.plaintiffs proper recourse,the court concluded,lay in the political process.
the court also deemed it necessary to reach the merits of plaintiffs complaint should a reviewing court,on appeal,disagree with its standing analysis.the court concluded,among other things,that plaintiffs had withdrawn their claim during oral argument,that the toll charged on the dulles toll road was not a tax under virginia law,and that congress approval of the interstate compact preempted any restrictions that virginia law might have placed on mwaa powers.
appellants initially appealed this decision to the federal circuit on the theory that mwaa is a federal instrumentality and that the federal circuit therefore had jurisdiction under the little tucker act.see a a.the federal circuit concluded,to the contrary,that mwaa is not a federal instrumentality.accordingly,it determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal and transferred the case to us.
appellants argument proceeds from the premise that,under the virginia constitution,the state legislature is unable to delegate its taxing authority to an independent body.under article i,of the virginia constitution,taxes must be imposed only by a majority of the elected representatives of a legislative body,with the votes cast by the elected representatives being duly recorded.marshall virginia transp.thus,appellants argue,virginia could not legally have delegated its taxing power to mwaa when virginia agreed to the interstate compact.
appellants argue that the toll paid by users of the dulles toll road is in fact a tax.this is so,they contend,because instead of merely defraying the cost of a driver use of the road,a portion of the toll is used for other purposes,namely the metrorail expansion project.therefore,the argument goes,because mwaa lacks the power to tax,the tolls are illegal,and mwaa exaction and retention of those funds is a violation of due process.
we note at the outset that plaintiffs identify no law that would create a cause of action for this sort of constitutional violation.while it is clear that they allege a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,their argument is far less illuminating on the question of what law authorizes a suit in federal court to redress it.see cale city of covington,cir.rather,appellants due process argument sounds like a state law claim dressed up in due process clothing such suits are rarely favored,for the fourteenth amendment is not meant to be a font of tort law.mora city of gaithersburg,cir quoting cnty.of sacramento lewis,d.we need not grapple with this complicated constitutional issue,however,because we conclude that appellants argument suffers from a more fundamental flaw.
