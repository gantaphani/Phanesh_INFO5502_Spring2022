on september,the charlestown police department responded to a call at the home of thomas carter carter and joy.is the mother of caleb caleb,who was then one year old.when responding to the call,the police found no one at the residence.they observed that the front door was shattered and the rear door was open.later gave conflicting statements about where caleb had been at the time.
the police received a second call the next day,september.when officers responded to the second call,carter and told the police that had attempted to swallow a large amount of pills in a suicide attempt and that carter had threatened suicide.the police arrested carter and on charges not specified in the record,but they were apparently released the same day or shortly thereafter.
on the same day,dcyf received a report from the charlestown police department concerning the safety of caleb.a dcyf agent was assigned to investigate,and learned of the suicide attempt and threats.the agent also learned from dcyf records that carter had a criminal history that included a conviction for assault with intent to commit sexual assault,as well as convictions for domestic violence and violating a no contact order against his former wife so far as the record reveals,the officers were not aware of the particular circumstances of these convictions,nor the dates of the convictions other than the date of the assault conviction.
on september,the charlestown police department again contacted dcyf to report that caleb was almost dropped two days earlier during an argument between carter and his,while was in the hospital.the dcyf officers were advised that carter had grabbed his eleven daughter samantha,who was carrying caleb at the time.carter was attempting to prevent samantha from following her mother carter out of the room.at that point,samantha almost fell down with caleb.a physician who later examined caleb reported a suggestion of near dropping and found no evidence of injury to caleb.
based on these facts,dcyf determined that caleb should be removed from the custody of caleb was removed on september,and brought to westerly hospital.there,a physician examined caleb and placed him on a hold pursuant to laws a dcyf petitioned the family court for temporary custody,stating that caleb was neglected and that he was without proper parental care and supervision.the court granted temporary custody of caleb to dcyf on september.
on october,dcyf assigned an agent to investigate allegations that carter had sexually molested another son from a previous marriage.these allegations had previously had been investigated and found meritless,but dcyf reopened the case when carter then son was found by a juvenile court to have sexually abused a boy.the dcyf investigation led to a criminal investigation,and carter was indicted on may,for first and second degree child molestation.a trial was scheduled for february.
on january,gave birth to cassidy,daughter of carter.based in large part on the pending sexual molestation charges against carter,dcyf removed cassidy from her home on january.the dcyf agent stated that cassidy was healthy and that there was no evidence of neglect or abuse.the family court granted dcyf temporary custody on january.
carter was found not guilty of the charges of sexual molestation on march.on or about june,the family court ordered reunification of carter and with both caleb and cassidy,subject to continued monitoring,unannounced visits,and counseling.
plaintiffs filed this action on january,alleging three counts.first,plaintiffs alleged that defendants were liable for damages pursuant to for infringing on their constitutional right to familial integrity.in the second count plaintiffs sought damages for violations of their rights under the rhode island constitution.a third count sought injunctive relief 
defendants filed for summary judgment on the theory that the defense of qualified immunity protected their actions,based on affidavits and transcripts of depositions of dcyf officers and their answers to interrogatories.plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment,relying on an affidavit of thomas carter,the family court decision ordering reunification of the children,and a guardian report stating that cassidy had in no way been neglected while in the custody of carter and.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to all of these claims.the district court refused to consider the affidavit of thomas carter,reasoning that it did not comply with the requirement of.that affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,and shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.
plaintiffs timely filed this appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the district court judgment without deference,drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in plaintiffs favor.iverson city of boston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
on appeal the dispute centers on whether the defense of qualified immunity shields the dcyf officers from liability for their actions.under,persons acting under color of state law may be liable if their actions create a deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.nonetheless,the defense of qualified immunity shields government officers from liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.anderson creighton,d.
in evaluating claims of qualified immunity,this court employs a framework.suboh dist.attorney office of the suffolk,cir hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir see also wilson layne,d.first,we ask whether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a constitutional right.hatch,at.if so,we then ask whether the right was clearly established at the time of the violation.suboh,at.finally,if violation of a clearly established constitutional right has been alleged,we turn to the facts of the case and ask whether an objectively reasonable officer would have believed that the action taken violated that right.hatch,at.we need not address the latter two aspects of the hatch test because we conclude that plaintiffs have not established a constitutional violation.
in hatch,this court held that the right to familial integrity is plainly of constitutional dimension,and t he interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children is among the most venerable of the liberty interests embedded in the constitution.at citing troxel granville,d reviewing supreme court cases that have recognized the right and stating that the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.this court has recognized that the deprivation of this right would constitute a violation of due process,in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.tower,cir see also troxel,at.i t can not now be doubted that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.
as also recognized in hatch,however,the right of the parents is not absolute.the right to familial integrity must be balanced against the right of the state to investigate allegations that the child is in danger,and in appropriate circumstances to terminate the
