plaintiff pro se stephen mitchell,who was formerly certified to serve as counsel for indigent defendants accused of felonies in new york state first judicial department first department,appeals from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,john koeltl,judge,as dismissed his second amended complaint asserting claims under and alleging that,who were responsible for such certifications,terminated his certification and refused to recertify him because of his race and in retaliation for his complaints of racial discrimination.the district court dismissed those claims pursuant to.b on the grounds that the appointment of counsel is a judicial act and that the individual defendants were thus performing a function closely associated with the judicial process and hence were entitled to absolute immunity from mitchell claims for monetary relief,that mitchell failed to meet the requirements for injunctive relief under,and that his claims for declaratory relief were inextricably intertwined with the merits of a judgment and hence,pursuant to the doctrine,were beyond a federal district court subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,mitchell contends principally that the district court erred in viewing the individual defendants functions as integrally related to the judicial process and in holding the doctrine applicable.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
to the extent that mitchell second amended complaint complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted,we accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in his favor.to the extent that the complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we consider in addition matters outside the complaint of which defendants asked the district court to take judicial notice,as well as other matters of law and public record governing the certification of attorneys who may be appointed to represent indigent defendants.
a.the parties and the plan 
mitchell is an attorney licensed to practice law in new york state the state.he has previously served as assigned counsel for indigent persons accused of felonies,in accordance with an assignment plan required by new york law.
state law,see county law art.article,requires 
t he governing body of each county and the governing body of the city in which a county is wholly contained to place in operation throughout the county a plan for providing counsel to persons charged with a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized who are financially unable to obtain counsel.
county law see id.the municipality is required,inter alia,to compensate,at statutorily capped rates,attorneys assigned pursuant to such a plan.see id.
the city of new york the city,which encompasses the first department and part of the state second judicial department second department,has a plan that was adopted in by executive order of the city mayor,in cooperation with the association of the bar of the city of new york and five county bar associations the bar associations,and was approved by the judicial conference of the state.under the city plan,its principal provider of legal services to indigent defendants is the legal aid society additional services are furnished by individual assigned attorneys who have been recommended pursuant to a joint undertaking by the bar associations the assigned counsel plan or the plan.the plan required each of the bar associations to prepare and certify a list of attorneys 
who are admitted to practice in the state of new york and who,in the opinion of the bar association,which shall consider their experience in criminal practice,are competent to give adequate representation to defendants under article of the county law.
assigned counsel plan art.ii.the composite list of attorneys designated by the bar association s as available for service in either the supreme court or the criminal court or both,id.art.ii,is generally referred to as an panel.
the plan also authorizes the appellate division of the new york supreme court,first and second departments,to promulgate such rules with respect to this plan as they may deem necessary.id.art.viii.rules and standards adopted by the appellate division first department the rules or appellate division rules regulate,inter alia,the selection,performance,and professional conduct of individual panel attorneys.see regs.tit,et adopted july.at the times pertinent to this action,an attorney seeking certification to the panel for service in the new york supreme has jurisdiction over felony required to have tried at least three felony matters.see complaint.the plan allows the appropriate appellate division to add an attorney to,or remove a previously certified attorney from,its panel at any time.assigned counsel plan art.ii.it also allows the bar associations to make additions to and deletions from their respective lists of approved attorneys periodically.see id.the rules provide that the appointment of an attorney to an panel is for an indefinite term subject to recertification as directed by the justices of the appellate division,first department.regs.tit,as amended,april.
in addition to adopting the above rules,the appellate division first department created a central screening committee the screening committee or committee to screen all applications for panel membership.see id.a as amended,april.the rules provide that the members of the committee may be chosen for terms either by the presidents of the bar a ssociations or by the justices of the appellate division,first department,id.as amended,april,members terms may be extended by the appellate division,see id.the committee bylaws,as approved by the appellate division,provide that,with respect to decisions on certification to the panel,t he action of the committee is final and.screening committee bylaw.neither the bylaws nor the appellate division rules make any provision for judicial review of a committee decision.

mitchell complaint 
the complaint alleges the following events.mitchell began the practice of criminal law in approximately.between and,he was an assistant district attorney in new york county.for nearly four years between and,he was a member of the kings county second department supreme court panel.see complaint.he was appointed to the new york county first department supreme court panel or the panel in.see id.by the spring of,mitchell had tried more than felony matters to verdict,including three murder trials.see id.he had also negotiated pleas in dozens of felony matters as lead counsel for indigent defendants.see id.in addition,he had briefed and argued at least two appeals,one state and the other federal.id.during the period,mitchell was never reprimanded for poor performance or misconduct with respect to his representation of an indigent client.see id.his record of winning acquittals was outstanding,and both his peers and the judges before whom he tried cases had high regard for his trial skills and experience.id.
mitchell applied for recertification to the first department supreme court panel in or.see id.in addition to his professional activities,mitchell had exhibited a deep commitment to the of the community see id,and in attachments to his application for recertification,and again in an interview with a screening committee member,mitchell complained that the plan administration was infected with racism see,id.he contended that many white assigned counsel attorneys were not providing zealous advocacy for their and latin o clients id.and were more interested in churning cases in order to increase their fees than in putting forth a serious effort to represent their clients effectively id.that the assigned counsel plan deliberately suppressed the number of attorneys who were eligible to try homicide cases id.and that the committee deliberately declined to a disproportionate number of attorneys to the first department indigent defense panel as a means of reducing the overall numbers of attorneys on the panel id.
by letter dated march,the committee notified mitchell that it was denying his application for recertification and terminating his appointment to the first department panel.see id.the committee gave no reasons for its decision.see,id.the text of the letter read as follows 
we regret to inform you that following a thorough and careful review of your recertification application,a decision has been made by the central screening committee to terminate your appointment to the assigned counsel plan felony and misdemeanor panels.that decision is final.
on behalf of the central screening committee,we want to express our appreciation to you for your years of service to the indigent accused.
you are expected to continue to handle to conclusion any assigned cases you now have and to submit a voucher for your work.
letter from committee chair norman reimer to stephen mitchell dated march,committee letter to mitchell.
mitchell commenced the present action in march under and and state law,alleging that the state defendants had terminated his appointment to the first department panel on the basis of his race and in retaliation for his complaints of racial discrimination.see,complaint.the relief requested included a awards of compensatory and punitive damages from the state defendants in their personal capacities b a judgment declaring that the committee refusal to recertify mitchell to the panel violated his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and c an injunction requiring his reappointment to the panel.see id,id.at.mitchell sought declaratory and injunctive relief so that he can earn compensation as an indigent defense lawyer and so that he will not be prejudiced with the stigma of being prohibited from membership in an association of attorneys.id.at.
mitchell also asserted claims against the city and two city employees,alleging that they had unjustifiably withheld payments due him for his past representation of indigent defendants.see id.those claims were subsequently settled,are not at issue on this appeal,and will not be discussed further.
district court decision 
the state defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,respectively.they contended principally a that,because the courts have the obligation under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to see that indigent persons accused of crimes are not denied the right to be represented by counsel,and because the appellate division first department had delegated to the committee the responsibility for certifying attorneys who were willing and qualified to provide such representation,the face of the complaint showed that the state defendants were performing essentially judicial functions and were thus entitled to immunity against mitchell claims and b that mitchell claims challenging the denial of recertification constituted challenges to state judicial decisions,and that,under the doctrine,the district court thus lacked jurisdiction over those claims.
mitchell opposed the motion,arguing,inter alia,that the state defendants were not entitled to judicial immunity because their decision to deny him recertification to the panel was not a judicial act but rather was an administrative act in the nature of an employment decision,for which even judges would not be entitled to absolute immunity.see plaintiff memorandum of law in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss at.he argued that the doctrine was inapplicable because there had been no judicial proceeding relating to the committee evaluation of his application for recertification hence his action did not seek review of any proceeding.see id.at.rather,mitchell was asserting previously unadjudicated claims that state and city officials discriminated against him because of his race and in violation of his rights to free speech.id.
in an opinion and order dated august,reported at d,the district court granted the state defendants motion to dismiss.the court ruled that those defendants were entitled to absolute immunity from any claims for money damages with regard to the denial of mitchell application for recertification because,i n deciding whether to the plaintiff to the panel,they were performing a function closely associated with the judicial process.d at.the district court reasoned that,in evaluating mitchell application,the committee acted under rules adopted by,and issued under the authority of,the justices of the new york state supreme court,appellate division,first department,id.citing regs.tit,and that the function the committee performed forms an integral part of the process of appointing counsel for indigent defendants,which is itself a judicial act,d at.
the district court also held that mitchell failed to state a claim under for an injunction ordering the committee to reappoint him to the panel.the court noted that injunctive relief is not to be granted in a action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer judicial capacity,unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable,and that mitchell had alleged neither the violation of a declaratory decree nor the unavailability of declaratory relief.d at quoting.
the district court ruled that the doctrine barred the court from entertaining mitchell claims for declaratory relief and provided an alternative basis for the dismissal of his claims for other relief for the denial of recertification.the court noted that o rdinarily,the doctrine does not apply to a case in which the decision being directly or indirectly contested is a decision of a state administrative agency that has never been reviewed by a state court,even if the agency proceedings were in form,for i n such cases,no state court decision exists for the federal court to defer to.id.at.in this case,however,the court concluded that the doctrine barred mitchell challenge to the committee unreviewed determination because 
where the administrative body issuing the judgment is an agent of the state court system it can be said that the federal courts are sitting in review of a state court judgment,thereby triggering rookerfeldman comity and federalism concerns s ee thomas kadish,cir district court lacked jurisdiction to hear claim that state board of bar examiners denied bar application for constitutionally impermissible reasons.
t he plan and committee function under the authority of the new york courts and the rules adopted thereby.therefore,this court has no jurisdiction to reverse or modify their decisions,whether by declaratory or injunctive relief,and must dismiss the plaintiff claims to the extent that he seeks orders declaring either that the decision denying his certification was wrongful or that he should be to the panel or that the panel is required to him.
d at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at the doctrine can also bar any claims for damages that are inextricably intertwined with the committee decision not to the plaintiff.
other claims by mitchell for orders requiring the committee to state its reasons for the denial of recertification and for disclosure of committee records were dismissed without prejudice,but were not further pursued.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mitchell contends principally that the district court erred in ruling that the state defendants have absolute immunity on his claims for damages for the denial of recertification,and that the doctrine deprived the district court of jurisdiction over his claims.the state defendants contend that mitchell waived the latter argument by first making it at oral argument of this appeal,without having addressed it in his appellate brief,and they invite us to affirm the ruling based on that waiver.in the circumstances of this case,we decline that invitation.
although we ordinarily will not consider arguments that an appellant has failed to make in his opening brief,see thomas roach,cir,this principle is designed to promote the orderly briefing,argument,and consideration of appeals,see,booking general star management,cir if an appellant raises a new argument in a reply brief an appellee may not have an adequate opportunity to respond to it,and does not affect appellate jurisdiction,see,united states barnes,cir.this court has ample discretion to excuse an appellant failure to argue an issue in his opening brief and to give the parties a further opportunity to address the issue.we are especially inclined to exercise that discretion here,where the question belatedly raised by the appellant is the correctness of the district court conclusion that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a category of claims,and that question has been the subject of both analysis by the district court,see d at,the appellant initial silence on the on appeal by the appellees see brief on appeal at.on this appeal,we requested additional briefing,and we have received letter briefs from mitchell addressing the issue and a responding letter brief from the state defendants.the matter has now been fully briefed,and we decline to resolve the jurisdictional issue on the basis of waiver.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the doctrine is not applicable to mitchell claims and that the state defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity.because the doctrine affects the threshold issue of the district court subject matter jurisdiction,we address that doctrine before proceeding to the question of the state defendants absolute immunity defense.
applicability of the doctrine 
the doctrine recognizes that congress grant to federal district courts of jurisdiction to entertain suits raising federal questions,see,is a grant of original jurisdiction,and does not authorize district courts to exercise appellate jurisdiction over judgments,which congress has reserved to th e united states supreme court,see a.verizon maryland public service commission,d verizon maryland emphasis added.thus,federal district courts do not have jurisdiction over claims that have already been decided,or that are inextricably intertwined with issues that have already been decided,by a state court.bridgewater operating feldstein,cir per curiam emphasis added.see generally district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d feldman rooker fidelity trust.
while the doctrine recognizes that the federal district courts may not review decisions by a state courts,it does not preclude federal district court review of executive action,including determinations made by a state administrative agency.verizon maryland,at.this principle holds true even where the administrative agency acted in an adjudicative capacity,see id.doctrine did not deprive district court of jurisdiction to entertain challenge to state public service commission order resolving a contract dispute between competing providers of telecommunications services,or where the plaintiff could have sought,but did not seek,review of the agency determination in a state court,see,hachamovitch debuono,cir.see generally wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.t he bar may be applied if a state court has reviewed an administrative order.but federal jurisdiction is not ousted by the involvement of an unreviewed administrative order footnotes omitted.
the verizon maryland principle,that does not preclude district court review of executive determinations made by a state administrative agency,at,may not extend to agencies that are appropriately characterized as arms of the state judiciary qua judiciary,either because they exercise powers that are inherent to the judiciary,or because the state has provided mechanisms for judicial review of their determinations that distinguish those determinations from other types of state administrative action.in thomas kadish,cir,cert.denied,d,for example,the fifth circuit dealt with a decision of the texas board of law examiners board,a body composed of attorneys appointed by the state supreme court,denying the plaintiff application for admission to the texas bar.see id.at.the fifth circuit ruled that the doctrine barred federal district court review of the board decision,reasoning that the state supreme court had inherent power over attorneys admission to practice law in the state and that it had delegated that power to the board.see thomas kadish,at.further noting that the state supreme court itself had provided for a method of judicial review of the board denial of fitness,the fifth circuit concluded that the board proceeding may be analogized to the function of a special master in taking actions of an essentially judicial nature.id.quoting middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d.that type of decision is no more subject to review by a federal district court than would be the final decision of the state supreme court.see thomas kadish,at.
along similar lines,the fourth circuit in allstate insurance west virginia state bar,cir allstate,ruled that the doctrine barred district court review of the determination by a state bar committee that an insurance company had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.see id.at.that committee was an arm of west virginia judicial branch,as it was,by state law,
an agency of the s upreme c ourt of a ppeals of west virginia,whose purpose is to give effect to pertinent rules of the s upreme c ourt of a ppeals.see.state bar constitution,arts.i,ii.the state bar is a part of the judicial department of the state government created for the purpose of enforcing such rules as may be prescribed,adopted and promulgated by the court.d.see also daily gazette comm.on legal ethics,deciding that the west virginia state bar is an agency of the supreme court of appeals,and not an independent agency.
allstate,at.the fourth circuit noted that the west virginia supreme court of appeals had exclusive authority to regulate and control the practice of law and inherent power to supplement rules of practice,including those that defined the unauthorized practice of law,id.at,and that the committee proceedings in question were of a judicial character,in that the committee had,inter alia,received a complaint that the respondent insurance company,in distributing a certain pamphlet,was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law investigated that complaint appointed a subcommittee composed of two practicing attorneys and a judge of a court of general jurisdiction to convene a hearing to receive arguments and examine exhibits analyzed the facts underlying the complaint in light of the definition of unlawful practice of law and various precedents involving conduct alleged to constitute such practice and rendered a written opinion concluding that the respondent actions constituted the unlawful practice of law as defined by the west virginia supreme court of appeals,id.at.no state court had reviewed the committee decision,but the west virginia regulatory scheme required judicial review before any coercive action could be taken.accordingly,the fourth circuit reasoned that the committee decision and review were each steps in a unitary judicial proceeding and concluded that the committee decision was akin to an interlocutory decision that could not,consistent with the doctrine,be reviewed by a federal district court.id.at.
the mere fact that agency officials were appointed by a state court,as in thomas kadish,does not mean that the agency acts as a court.in roudebush hartke,d,for example,the supreme court ruled that,with respect to an election for the united states senate,a federal district court had jurisdiction to enjoin action by a commission that had been appointed by a state court to conduct a vote recount.see id.at.the roudebush court concluded that,which generally prohibits a federal court from grant ing an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court,was inapplicable because,inter alia,the state court appointment of the commission,which was required if that court found that the recount petition was in proper form,was not performed in a proceeding that was judicial.at.
in feldman,the court likewise observed that,even where the challenged decision is one by a state entity that could properly be characterized as a court,what determines reviewability by a federal district court is not the character of the body but rather the character of the proceedings.at.quoting prentis atlantic coast line,and citing,inter alia,roudebush,at.the doctrine bars federal district court review only of decisions that are judicial in nature and effect.feldman,at.internal quotation marks omitted.it does not bar such review of an agency or committee decision that is in effect legislative or administrative.a decision is judicial when it declares rights as they stand a decision is of a legislative character when it makes a declaration instead on rights which may arise in the future,id.internal quotation marks omitted,making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis ours.for a decision to be judicial,there must be a ruling on an actual controversy over an issue,not an abstract declaration of the law.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in the present case,we conclude that the doctrine is inapplicable both because the screening committee,in compiling a list of qualified attorneys,acts as an administrative body,rather than conducting proceedings that are judicial,and because its denial of mitchell application for recertification to the panel was a decision that was not judicial but legislative.
the role of the screening committee 
we conclude that the committee does not act as a judicial arm of the appellate division for several reasons.first,although the state defendants have argued that the actions of the screening committee are essential to permitting judges to appoint counsel hearing transcript,january,at,the power of a new york court to appoint counsel to represent an indigent defendant is not dependent even on the existence of an panel,much less on the committee certification of attorneys to that panel.the court has inherent,it has a constitutional obligation in a criminal appoint an attorney for an indigent defendant.see,in re smiley,no similar obligation in a matrimonial case stream beisheim,dep t per curiam there has been no time in the governmental history of this state when the court lacked the power to assign counsel for the defense of indigent persons charged with crime.thus,the court is free to appoint an attorney who has not been certified to the panel 
under no circumstances can section of the county law be deemed to inhibit or override the trial court exercise of its inherent power or the performance of its constitutional or statutory duty to furnish proper counsel to an indigent defendant 
it should be emphasized that article of the county law is merely cumulative.it is designed to facilitate and implement the court exercise of its inherent power.it serve s to provide a constant,ready source of available counsel to define the amount and source of their compensation,and the manner of payment.but it do es not and can not entrench upon the court inherent power and fundamental duty to provide counsel to an indigent defendant.
stream beisheim,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.the committee decisions,therefore,neither are essential to nor in any way circumscribe the court exercise of its inherent authority.
second,the committee does not determine which attorney will be appointed in any given case.the courts inherent power of appointment has not been delegated to the committee.
third,the new york courts do not have inherent authority to provide that an attorney so appointed will be compensated.rather,an attorney admitted to practice law in new york has a duty to provide uncompensated services for the indigent.in re smiley,at,at,emphasis added.
t he cases establishing the right to assigned counsel in criminal matters c an not be used to mandate compensation by public funding.even in expanding the criminal right to assigned counsel the courts,federal and state,never presumed to direct the appropriation and expenditure of public funds.
the appropriation and provision of authority for the expenditure of public funds is a legislative and not a judicial function,both in the nation and in the state.it is correlated,of course,with the taxing power see,art xvi,us,art i,cl.
in re smiley,at,at,emphasis added.because the state legislature anticipated that the private bar would not be able to carry the burden of uncompensated representation for the large numbers of indigent defendants facing criminal charges,the article legislation was enacted to provide systematic representation of defendants by assigned counsel and for their compensation.id.at,at,emphasis added.thus,as described in part above,the legislature required municipalities to devise plans for the assignment and compensation of counsel for indigent defendants and the city,with the approval of the state judicial conference,adopted the assigned counsel plan.the plan delegates rulemaking authority,for the administration of the plan,to the appellate division,first and second departments.and pursuant to this rulemaking grant,the appellate division first department established the committee to improve the efficiency of the assigned counsel plan administered by the court under county law,article.op.att y at.the mere presence of the appellate division in this chain does not transmute the obligation imposed by the legislature on the city into an inherent power of the judiciary.in accordance with the plan,the committee assembles panels of attorneys who,if appointed by the court to represent an indigent defendant charged with a crime,will be entitled to compensation for their services.a qualified attorney may or may not be on an panel.for an attorney appointed to represent an indigent defendant,the difference between being on an panel and not being on such a panel is simply the difference between being entitled to publicly funded compensation and not being entitled to such compensation.see,people burns,dep t mem.denying application for attorney fee on the ground that claimant was not assigned pursuant to the provisions of article of the county law.given that the source of the entitlement to compensation for panel members is the legislature,not the courts,and that assignments of or not from the made by the courts,not the committee,we can not conclude either that the power exercised by the committee is judicial or that the committee is a judicial,rather than an administrative,body.
we note further that,although the state defendants seem to suggest that they have been appointed by the court see brief on appeal at,arguing that thomas kadish discussion of a state board that was appointed by the state supreme court is instructive quoting thomas kadish,at,the screening committee member appointments here in fact need not have been made by the court.while the appellate division has the exclusive power to extend the term of a member by,the appellate division rules provide that a committee member initial appointment may be made by either the appellate division or the president of the bar association.regs.tit.
nor can the present case be analogized to thomas kadish or allstate on the theory that the committee determinations are the equivalent of a special master recommendations or of a state court interlocutory decisions that are to be further reviewed by the state courts.although judicial review of the screening committee determinations is to a limited extent available in a article proceeding,see et.mckinney,we are unpersuaded,for two reasons,that the availability of such review provides a basis for deeming the committee decisions to be essentially those of a court.
first,we note that the appellate division rules contain no provision for review of a committee decision and that the committee bylaws provide that t he action of the committee is final and,screening committee bylaw.to be sure,that bylaw provision and the silence of the rules can not entirely foreclose an article proceeding,for e ven where judicial review is proscribed by s
