in september,petitioner luluengisa chantal vumi vumi,a native and citizen of the democratic republic of congo drc,applied for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina,and for relief under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc.she alleged that she had been twice arrested,interrogated,and mistreated by the drc military,which suspected her of involvement in the january assassination of president laurent kabila.on december,an immigration judge ij granted vumi claim for cat relief but denied her applications for asylum and withholding,finding that petitioner had failed to demonstrate that the harm she suffered was on account of a protected ground under the ina.the board of immigration appeals bia or the board affirmed this determination on the same basis.petitioner subsequently sought our review of the bia decision.
before us,petitioner challenges the agency determination that she did not suffer persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group or due to political opinion imputed to her.we conclude that the ij and bia erred in evaluating vumi claim,and we remand to give the board the opportunity to determine properly,in the first instance,the scope of these protected grounds for asylum and withholding relief.
background 
petitioner fled her native country for the united states and arrived in july.in september,vumi filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.following an interview with an asylum officer in january,vumi case was referred to an ij.after hearing her testify and reviewing her documentary submissions,the ij accepted vumi testimony as true.
vumi testified that she married charles kayitaba,a rwandan citizen and ethnic tutsi,in.though the couple separated in,they both remained in kinshasa in the drc and stayed in contact because they had a child together.in,kayitaba began work as a chauffeur and bodyguard for laurent kabila.because he was on duty on the day kabila was assassinated,january,kayitaba was suspected of involvement in the assassination.he fled to rwanda and called vumi to inform her of his location.in february,a group of military soldiers entered vumi house to search for kayitaba,demanded that she reveal information about him and about the assassination,and looted the house.in,the military soldiers returned to vumi home.when vumi refused to reveal kayitaba location,they arrested her.
vumi was detained for one week in a dark cell in which soldiers tied her hands behind her back,cut her hair,shined bright lights in her eyes,and hit her whenever she provided unsatisfactory answers to their repeated demands for information about kayitaba location.eventually,a human rights organization of which vumi was a member,la voix des sans voix,was able to secure her release.vumi subsequently related the news of her detention to kayitaba,who advised her to leave the drc.she received assistance in obtaining a passport and visa from a friend in the department of social services and scheduled a flight out of the drc.
in june,however,when she was returning from work,vumi was again captured by soldiers who forced her into a military truck and brought her to a military camp called kokolo.for two weeks,vumi was kept in a dirty,cell with no furniture or toilets,fed minimally,and beaten with whips.the soldiers subjected her to repeated,long interrogations to determine kayitaba destination,and they also wanted her to tell them something about laurent kabila assassination.vumi refused to reveal that kayitaba was in rwanda because she feared that they would keep on asking her some questions for which she did have an answer.vumi also did not reveal that kayitaba was a rwandan citizen,instead stating that he was from the kivu province of the drc.
after vumi refused to perform sexual favors for a soldier in return for her release from prison,the soldier fondled her,struggled with her as she resisted,and urinated on her.his attempt to rape her was unsuccessful,but he returned another day,repeated his offer,and on her refusal,did,in fact,rape her.when she developed a fever and nosebleeds,vumi was transferred from her cell to the military camp hospital where one of the nurses recognized vumi from church and helped her to escape.vumi then went into hiding with an aunt.vumi friend in the department of social services again secured her a false passport and visa,and vumi left the drc at the end of july.when vumi spoke with her family by telephone,they informed her that the military continued to look for her at her house.
the ij found that vumi brutal treatment by the military unquestionably amounted to persecution,but that she failed to demonstrate that the harm she suffered was on account of a protected ground.first,the ij concluded that the harm was not inflicted due to membership in a particular social group because relatives of assassination suspects do not necessarily comprise a group of persons with similar backgrounds,habits,or social status the families of assassination suspects do not have any relation to each other and this group is not sufficiently recognizable and discreet sic as viewed by society in general.second,the ij did not find that the harm was inflicted,in whole or in part,on account of imputed political opinion.instead,the ij held that 
f rankly the government interrogation of vumi would be quite reasonable in light of the fact that her husband was a bodyguard of kabila,was a rwandan,and a tutsi,and had fled the area.clearly,the government had a very rational reason to interview or interrogate her.also,the government may well have been annoyed at vumi because she was not telling them the truth.
finally,the ij also concluded that any persecution that vumi might face in the future would not be on account of a protected ground.as a result,on each of these bases,the ij denied vumi application for asylum and withholding of removal.
finding,however,a significant likelihood that vumi would be arrested and tortured in light of her past mistreatment and the drc current human rights record,the ij granted vumi application for cat relief,because such relief does not require a nexus to a protected ground.in january,the ij denied vumi motion for reconsideration of her asylum and withholding claims.
the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision denying asylum and withholding relief.it stated that vumi alleged social group,defined as family member s of a person who served as a kabila bodyguard at the time of the assassination,did not qualify as a particular social group.the board noted that vumi made no claim of family relationship with the relatives of other assassination suspects,and that the general characteristic of the purported group was insufficient to constitute a particular social group.in addition,noting the absence of evidence that vumi was ever questioned about her political activities or views,or about her affiliation with her former employer la voix des sans voix,the bia found insufficient direct or circumstantial evidence that her persecution was motivated,at least in part,by an actual or imputed political opinion.
we vacate the decision of the bia and remand the case for further proceedings.
ii.discussion 
we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.see yu yin yang gonzales,cir.questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are examined de novo.see ins,cir.where a question of interpretation of an ambiguous statutory term is involved,however,we give deference to the bia reasonable interpretation.see ins,d.we review the agency factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.b b see also ins,d.
to be eligible for asylum relief,an applicant must show that she has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that she has a fear of future persecution on account of one of these grounds.see a.an alien fear may be even if there is only a slight,though discernible,chance of persecution.diallo ins,cir citing ins,d.an applicant who satisfies the higher burden of demonstrating a clear probability of future persecution on account of one of the five grounds is automatically entitled to withholding of removal under b.diallo,at.
we have no reason to doubt that the ij and bia held that vumi treatment constituted persecution.accordingly,the key issue on appeal is whether vumi persecution was on account of either of two grounds for asylum and withholding relief her membership in a particular social group or her political opinion.
membership in a particular social group 
the bia seminal decision in matter of acosta defines the standard for what constitutes a particular social group,bia,overruled in part on other grounds by matter of mogharrabi,bia.holding that salvadoran taxi drivers are not cognizable as a particular social group because they can change professions,the bia in matter of acosta set forth the following standard 
w e interpret the phrase persecution on account of membership in a particular social group to mean persecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.the shared characteristic might be an innate one such as kinship ties,or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.the particular kind of group characteristic that will qualify remains to be determined on a basis.however,whatever the common characteristic that defines the group,it must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.
id.emphasis added.our court endorsed this standard in hong ying gao gonzales,cir.we conclude in the instant case that the ij and bia erred,both in their incomplete characterization of vumi proposed particular social group and in their failure to evaluate this claim according to the acosta standard as we have applied it in gao.
we begin with the bia failure to evaluate fully vumi social group claim.she originally claimed before the agency that she was persecuted on account of her membership in two particular social groups.both these groups derive from her marital relationship to charles kayitaba,but in fact they are quite distinct.the first group is her husband particular family.the second group consists of the family members of the presidential bodyguards and security and military officers who had been serving at the time of the kabila assassination.it is the first of these that she presses on appeal.
the ij expressly noted petitioner contention that her nuclear family forms one basis of her group claim because her familiar sic relationship to her husband is something that she does not have the power in which to change.and in her brief to the bia,the petitioner clearly stated the particular social group that vumi is relying on is membership in the family of a person suspected of participating in the laurent kabila assassination.
despite vumi uncontested assertion of this claim,and its seeming recognition by the ij,neither the ij nor the bia considered whether vumi membership in kayitaba nuclear family implicated the particular social group ground of protection under the ina.the ij addressed,and summarily rejected,only the second of vumi claims,stating i t appears that there is not one specific family involved in this proposed group,but a number of families that really do not have any relationship to each other except for the fact that their family members have been assassination suspects.emphasis added.on this basis the ij concluded that vumi proposed group is not sufficiently recognizable and discreet sic as viewed by society in general to be a particular social group.
the bia also addressed only vumi relationship to the families of other assassination suspects in examining her particular social group membership.it too completely ignored her individual family relationship to kayitaba.remarkably,the board concluded that vumi claimed status as the family member of a person who served as a kabila bodyguard at the time of the assassination failed to allege any indicat ion that she shares a familial or clan relationship with the other members of her defined group,thus there is no claim of family membership.emphasis added.in light of the board own observation that,under its precedent,family membership can constitute membership in a particular social group for purposes of asylum,this was clear error.
the bia has long recognized that kinship ties may form a cognizable shared characteristic for a particular social group.see,acosta,at.and more recently,the bia has deemed the family or clan to be a particular social group when its members are recognizable by virtue of shared immutable characteristics inextricably linked to family ties.matter of h,bia.while the bia has stated that it has not ruled categorically that membership in any clan would suffice,in re,bia emphasis added,the board has held unambiguously that membership in a nuclear family may substantiate a basis of persecution.
but if such membership may support a social group grounding of persecution,it must be considered by the agency.and it is beyond cavil that the agency failed to address this part of vumi claim.it follows that the bia misconstruction of vumi appeal was essential to its finding that the general characteristic of the purported group insufficient to constitute a particular social group.citing gomez ins,cir.and that,by itself,would require that we grant the petition and remand the case to the bia.
the ij and bia decisions did consider vumi claim that she was persecuted on account of her membership in a second particular social group that of family members of assassination suspects.since vumi has not pressed that claim on appeal,we do not here review it.
in the interests of judicial economy,however,we note that very since the bia decision in vumi court has examined the general issues involved in that claim.koudriachova gonzales,cir.in koudriachova,the court discussed the proper interpretation of our decision in gomez,at,the relation between gomez and the bia rulings in acosta,at,and in re,at,and the meaning of gomez in light our decision in hong ying gao gonzales,at.on remand,if vumi opts to return to that claim,the bia may wish to review its decision in view of koudriachova.
because the agency failed to consider whether vumi individual family constitutes a particular social group under the ina,we must remand this case to the bia so that it may evaluate the evidence properly and make the initial determination.see ins ventura,d per curiam generally speaking,a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands.see also gonzales thomas,d the agency has not yet considered whether petitioner family presents the kind of kinship ties that constitute a particular social group.the matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.see also,at.
it bears underscoring that the bia must apply the correct standard on remand to vumi nuclear family claim,that is,it must do so in light of koudriachova,at.
imputed political opinion 
vumi also asserts that she was persecuted on account of an political opinion which the drc soldiers imputed to her based on kayitaba suspected involvement in the assassination of laurent kablia.a n imputed political opinion,whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,can constitute a ground of political persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.chun gao gonzales,cir internal alterations and quotations omitted.
it is,moreover,that vumi can not be expected to provide direct proof of a persecutor motives,ins,d,and that the protected ground under the ina need not be the sole motive the plain meaning of the phrase persecution on account of the victim political opinion,does not mean persecution solely on account of the victim political opinion.osorio ins,cir.we find that in rejecting any nexus between vumi persecution and imputed political opinion,the bia and the ij examined neither the political dimension of t
