appellant james hamilton is a convicted felon in virginia who has had his civil rights restored by the governor of virginia and his firearms rights restored by the virginia courts.now,as a resident of maryland,he desires to obtain a permit for a handgun and possess a long gun,both of which he is unable to do in maryland absent a full pardon from the governor of virginia.he brought this second amendment challenge to maryland firearms regulatory scheme,arguing that the scheme is unconstitutional as applied to him.the district court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a claim,and hamilton appealed.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
hamilton pleaded guilty on november,in virginia to three felonies credit card fraud,in violation of.code credit card theft,in violation of.code and credit card forgery,in violation of.code a.he was sentenced to four years imprisonment,which was suspended,a term of four years of probation,and ordered to pay in restitution and an additional in court costs 
on november,the governor of virginia restored hamilton rights to vote,hold public office,sit on a jury,and serve as a notary,but specifically did not restore his right to ship,transport,possess or receive firearms,which must be restored in accordance with.code.see also.his firearms rights were restored pursuant to that code section on april,by the circuit court for spotsylvania county,virginia.hamilton subsequently was registered as an armed security officer with the virginia department of criminal justice services,and is certified in the use of handguns and shotguns.additionally,as of the filing of his reply brief before this court,he is employed through a contractor as a protective security officer with the department of homeland security dhs.see appellant reply br.at.hamilton is married,has three children,serves as the head coach of a junior league wrestling team,and has no history of violent behavior.
hamilton desires to purchase and possess both a handgun and a long gun for within his own home,but asserts that he is unable to do so due to maryland regulatory scheme for firearm ownership.maryland prohibits possession of a handgun,rifle,or shotgun by anyone who has been convicted of a disqualifying crime.see.code,pub.safety b,b.a disqualifying crime includes both a violation classified as a felony in maryland and a violation classified as a misdemeanor in maryland that is punishable by more than two years imprisonment.id.g 
additionally,in order to possess a handgun,a person must first apply for and obtain a permit from the maryland state police msp.see id.r.as part of that application,the applicant must state under penalty of perjury that the applicant has never been convicted of a disqualifying crime,and must certify that the applicant is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a handgun under b.id.b,a i.possession of a handgun without a permit is a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years imprisonment,id,and possession of a rifle or shotgun in violation of the regulatory scheme is a misdemeanor punishable by up to three years imprisonment,id.d.
the crimes for which hamilton was convicted in virginia each have a maryland equivalent receiving property by stolen,counterfeit,or misrepresented credit card,in violation of.code,crim.law,a felony under the facts of hamilton conviction credit card theft,in violation of.code,crim.law,a misdemeanor subject to eighteen months imprisonment and credit card counterfeiting,in violation of.code,crim.law,a felony.thus,on the basis of at least two of his virginia felony convictions,hamilton has two disqualifying convictions in maryland.
hamilton wanted to obtain a permit to carry a handgun from the msp,and although he did not formally apply for such a permit,he made inquiries regarding obtaining a permit and was ultimately informed by an assistant attorney general that he could not possess a firearm in maryland unless he obtained a full pardon from the governor of virginia.fearing arrest,prosecution,incarceration,and fines,hamilton has refrained from attempting to obtain a handgun,rifle,or shotgun.
this suit was brought in july against appellees william pallozzi,superintendent of the msp,and brian frosh,attorney general of maryland collectively,the maryland defendants,both in their official capacities.hamilton seeks a declaration that the regulatory scheme is unconstitutional under the second amendment as applied to him,and further seeks a permanent injunction against the maryland defendants and their employees from enforcing the regulatory scheme against him as it pertains to his virginia convictions.the maryland defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,and hamilton subsequently moved for summary judgment.in their opposition to summary judgment,the maryland defendants raised a concern regarding justiciability.
with both motions fully briefed,the district court proceeded to decide the matter on the maryland defendants motion to dismiss in a published opinion.hamilton pallozzi,supp.the district court first,with a great deal of hesitation,determined that the case was justiciable.id.at.then,the district court found that under our approach to second amendment challenges as announced in united states chester,cir,hamilton failed to state a claim at the first step.specifically,the court held 
b ecause of hamilton criminal past,the state of maryland has acted well within its discretion in choosing to withhold firearms privileges from him at least until he obtains a full pardon under virginia law.hamilton has not shown that his factual circumstances remove his challenge from the realm of ordinary challenges.accordingly,he has not carried and can not carry his burden at chester prong one,and the court will dismiss his claim.
hamilton,supp.at quoting united states moore,cir.the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice,and hamilton timely noticed this appeal.
although the maryland defendants did not notice a of the district court determination that the case was justiciable,the issue was briefed by the parties.see appellant br.at appellee br.at.justiciability is an issue of jurisdiction,and we have an independent obligation to evaluate our ability to hear a case before reaching the merits of an appeal.brickwood contractors,datanet eng g,cir.en banc.once satisfied that we have jurisdiction,we will reach the merits of the appeal.
the district court decided this case on the basis of the maryland defendants motion to dismiss rather than hamilton competing motion for summary judgment.hamilton,supp.at.as to justiciability,we review the factual findings for clear error and the legal conclusions de novo.al shimari caci premier,cir.as to the merits of hamilton claim,we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim,assume as true all factual allegations in hamilton complaint,and draw all reasonable inferences in hamilton favor.kloth microsoft,cir.however,we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,and we need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
hamilton challenges two different statutes that have two different requirements for justiciability.the first challenge,as to the permitting scheme for a handgun,is one in which he argues the injury has already occurred.the second challenge,as to the criminalization of possession of a long gun,is a challenge.
when a party brings a preenforcement challenge to a statute or regulation,it must allege an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with constitutional interest,and there must exist a credible threat of persecution under the statute or regulation.soc y for human life,fed.election comm n,cir.quoting babbitt united farm workers union.there is no dispute that hamilton meets both requirements for the challenge.thus,the focus of our discussion is on the challenge to the permit scheme,and we find the challenge justiciable.
the maryland defendants argue that because hamilton has not yet applied for a permit,and might be denied a permit for reasons other than a disqualifying conviction,the issue of his disqualifying conviction may be irrelevant.thus,they submit his claim is not ripe because of his failure to apply for a permit.hamilton responds that he need not go through the futile exercise of applying for a permit when he has been told already that it will be rejected.we agree with hamilton.
as our sister circuits have recognized in the context of similar second amendment challenges,the government can not so easily avoid suit when it has erected a regulatory scheme that precludes a plaintiff from truthfully completing the application form the government requires for the purchase of a firearm.dearth holder,cir.see horsley trame,cir.refusing to require an plaintiff to go through the process of appealing a denial of a gun possession permit where the plaintiff was challenging the requirement that applicants have a parent or guardian signature on their application united states decastro,cir.explaining that f ailure to apply for a license would not preclude decastro challenge if he made a substantial showing that submitting an application would have been futile,but ultimately finding that the challenger did not make a substantial showing quoting hanslmaier,cir.see also sammon bd.of med.exam rs,cir.litigants are not required to make such futile gestures to establish ripeness.
we have yet to be so clear,but we agree with our sister circuits that plaintiffs are not required to undertake futile exercises in order to establish ripeness,and may demonstrate futility by a substantial showing.here,based on the pleadings and the evidence produced in support of justiciability hamilton has been informed by no less than an assistant attorney general of maryland that the state will not consider his disqualifying conviction removed unless and until hamilton obtains a full pardon from the governor of virginia.thus,any attempt to apply for a permit regardless of any other reason maryland may potentially have to find hamilton ineligible would be futile.as such,we agree with the lower court and find that hamilton claims are ripe.
the district court itself raised a concern in finding this case justiciable that although the application for a permit would have been futile,obtaining a pardon from the governor of virginia may not have been.see hamilton,supp.at the district court nonetheless concluded that this case was justiciable,after considering our decision in doe virginia department of state police,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,cert.denied.
in doe,the plaintiff was registered as a sex offender and was not permitted onto school or church grounds without permission from the school board or church,respectively,in addition to permission from the state court.at.the plaintiff declined to obtain relief using the prescribed methods,and instead brought suit pursuant to.this court held that 
doe does not allege harm merely from being placed on the registry,but rather from the consequences her categorization entails for her ability to access school and church property.however,as of yet,these consequences do not affect her with finality,as she has not taken any of the steps necessary to access those properties.because doe has not attempted to petition a virginia circuit court,the school board,or any church,it is far from clear whether she will ultimately be barred from entering those properties.therefore,any injury to her constitutional rights she would suffer from not being able to enter a school or church remains hypothetical.
id.at.we concluded that requiring doe to seek permission from state entities prior to bringing suit in federal court does not amount to requiring exhaustion of state remedies for her constitutional claims.id.at.we also held that b ecause doe has yet to petition a virginia circuit court for permission to enter school or church property,all of her constitutional claims are dependent on future uncertainties and thus not ripe for judicial decision.id.at.
the dissent in doe feared that this holding amounted to an exhaustion requirement,in contravention of the supreme court holding in patsy board of regents of florida.see id.at king,dissenting.in a concurring opinion responding to this concern,judge keenan explained that the decision turned on the clear distinction between the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted and the requirement that a challenged action be final before it is judicially reviewable.id.at keenan,concurring citing williamson cty.reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city.in elucidating this distinction,judge keenan explained that we were not requiring doe to file suit in state court contesting the legality of her designation as a sex offender,nor appeal a rejection from the school board to state court rather,we required her to obtain that initial decision.id.at.judge keenan concluded that t he virginia legislature expressly has designated the virginia circuit courts and the local school boards as the initial decisionmakers in cases of this nature.manifestly,federal courts do not possess such expertise,and should not serve as vehicles for parties to circumvent state law by considering premature constitutional challenges.id.at.we reaffirm this position today,and find the instant matter distinguishable.
hamilton aptly notes in addressing the doe issue that virginia governor is not an initial decisionmaker,or indeed,any kind of decisionmaker,as to what maryland law forbids or how it applies.appellant br.at.we agree with this.but he then goes on to argue that requiring him to seek a pardon from the governor of virginia,who has already restored all of his civil rights except for firearms ownership,would be an administrative hurdle in violation of patsy.on this point,he is incorrect.
the initial decisionmaker here is the msp who is in charge of determining whether a previous conviction is disqualifying.the governor of virginia is entirely outside the process of determining who is eligible for handgun permits in maryland.hamilton has received his initial decision,albeit somewhat informally,that he is ineligible to obtain a permit on the basis of his disqualifying virginia convictions.he thus is aggrieved from a final,reviewable decision,see doe,at keenan,concurring,and the consequences do affect him with finality,see id.at majority opinion.therefore,we affirm the district court finding that the case is justiciable,and proceed to the merits of hamilton claim.
the supreme court has twice recognized that prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons are presumptively lawful,first in district of columbia heller,and again two years later in mcdonald city of chicago,operating under this presumption of lawfulness,we have recognized the possibility that an challenge to a felon disarmament law could succeed in rebutting the presumption.see,united states moore,cir.the framework under which we review a second amendment challenge has been laid out clearly 
chester established a test for assessing a second amendment challenge.the first prong,reflecting heller observation that the second amendment embodies rights existing at its ratification,requires our historical review to evaluate whether those rights,as understood in,are burdened or regulated by the statute in question.chester,at.if so,under the second prong,the statute must pass constitutional muster in accordance with the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny.id.moore refined and crystallized our approach,however,explaining that the chester analysis is more streamlined when a presumptively lawful regulatory measure is under review.moore,at.
in order for a party to rebut the presumption of lawfulness regarding g as applied to him,he must show that his factual circumstances remove his challenge from the realm of ordinary challenges.moore,at.
united states smoot,cir.our approach in chester derives from the third circuit opinion in united states marzzarella,cir.see chester,at.
using our approach,we have rejected challenges to disarmament laws from domestic violence misdemeanants,united states staten,cir,cert.denied,persons subject to domestic violence protective orders,united states chapman,cir,and undocumented aliens,united states,cir,cert.denied.with respect to felon disarmament provisions,we have rejected challenges from not only felons with violent predicate offenses,smoot,at,but also felons with predicate offenses,united states pruess,cir.
the maryland laws at issue are substantially similar to the federal prohibition on possession of guns by convicted felons found at g.thus,our discussion focuses primarily on case law surrounding g,as the analysis from those cases is equally applicable to the challenged maryland laws 
the district court determined that hamilton did not fall within the category of responsible citizens to whom second amendment protections enure,and so ended its inquiry at step one of the streamlined analysis.hamilton,supp.at.hamilton first argument is that the district court did not actually engage with the streamlined analysis of moore.we disagree,finding that hamilton misreads both our precedent and the district court opinion.
hamilton argues that in a streamlined analysis,we essentially dispense with the second step in challenges,appellant br.at,assume there can be no justification for disarming someone who is a,responsible citizen,and evaluate all the factual circumstances of the challenger at step one of the chester inquiry.this is incorrect,and misreads the holding of moore.
the streamlined portion of the analysis as explained in moore is that for a presumptively lawful regulation,at the first step of the second amendment inquiry,we need not undertake an extensive historical inquiry to determine whether the conduct at issue was understood to be within the scope of the second amendment at the time of ratification.moore,at see pruess,at because the presumption of constitutionality from heller and moore governs,we need not pursue an analysis of the historical scope of the second amendment right.however,as we have recently reaffirmed,we still conduct the traditional second step of applying an appropriate scrutiny even for laws that receive a streamlined analysis.see united states hosford,cir.citing woollard gallagher,cir.
at the first step,we effectively supplant the historical inquiry with the more direct question of whether the challenger conduct is within the protected second amendment right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.heller,at moore,at see also pruess,at explaining that a presumptively lawful regulation could not violate the second amendment unless,as applied,it proscribed conduct fall ing within the category of responsible citizens us ing arms in defense of hearth and home quoting moore,at further internal quotations omitted alterations made by quoting source.
additionally,we have explained that in an challenge to a presumptively lawful firearms regulation,a litigant claiming an otherwise constitutional enactment is invalid as applied to him must show that his factual circumstances remove his challenge from the realm of ordinary challenges.moore,at.indeed,after explaining the streamlined analysis,the court in moore held that moore challenge failed at step one of chester because moore undoubtedly flunks the responsible citizen requirement.id.
if hamilton is able to demonstrate that he is outside the realm of ordinary challenges,such that his conduct is within the protected right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home,we are still then required to proceed to the scrutiny discussed in chester.therefore,the streamlined analysis of moore requires that we determine at step one whether hamilton is a,responsible citizen,there being no dispute between the parties that he intends to own arms in defense of hearth and home.
in arguing for how he is a,responsible citizen,hamilton relies on dicta from the third circuit establishing two categories of felons who might raise successful challenges and argues that he falls within both a felon convicted of a minor,crime who might show that he is no more dangerous than a typical citizen and a felon whose crime of conviction is and who poses no continuing threat to society.united states barton,cir,by binderup att y,cir.en banc.for the reasons that follow,we today hold that a challenger convicted of a state law felony generally can not satisfy step one of the chester inquiry,and accordingly disagree that these are bases on which a challenger may attempt to satisfy step one of the chester inquiry.
as the citation indicates,the dicta on which hamilton relies has been overruled in a recent fractured en banc opinion from the third circuit,that reject s barton claim that the passage of time or evidence of rehabilitation will restore the second amendment rights of people who committed serious crimes.binderup,at in overruling barton,the third circuit explained that a challenger risk of violent recidivism tells us nothing about whether he was convicted of a serious crime,and the seriousness of the purportedly disqualifying offense is our sole focus throughout marzzarella first step.id.at.the court held that only the seriousness of the purportedly disqualifying offense determines the constitutional sweep of statutes like g at step one.id.
the third circuit in binderup also explained that to satisfy step one in the context of an challenge to g,a challenger must prove that he was not previously convicted of a serious crime and evidence of a challenger rehabilitation or his likelihood of recidivism is not relevant to the analysis.id.at.the court relied on the seriousness of an offense as the narrowest basis for its holding,determining that the traditional justification for denying felons the right to bear arms stemmed from the disarmament of unvirtuous citizens who had committed serious criminal offense s.id.at.this comports with our circuit holding in united states,cir,and relies on the same language from united states yancey,cir,on which we relied in 
the court in binderup ultimately upheld the challenges presented,but the court noted that its holding was limited to misdemeanants who nonetheless fall within the sweep of g.at noting in dicta that a felon burden would be extraordinarily high and perhaps insurmountable to show that the crime was not serious 
we find the main opinion in binderup and thoughtful,but decline to adopt it in its entirety.rather than adopting the seriousness test elucidated in binderup at step one of the chester inquiry,we simply hold that conviction of a felony necessarily removes one from the class of,responsible citizens for the purposes of the second amendment,absent the narrow exceptions mentioned below.
where the sovereign has labeled the crime a felony,it represents the sovereign determination that the crime reflects grave misjudgment and maladjustment,as recognized by the district court.a felon can not be returned to the category of,responsible citizens for the purposes of the second amendment and so can not succeed at step one of the chester inquiry,unless the felony conviction is pardoned or the law defining the crime of conviction is found unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful 
by confining the step one analysis to the challenger criminal history,we consider only the conviction or convictions causing the disability to the challenger.as a result,we also hold that evidence of rehabilitation,likelihood of recidivism,and passage of time are not bases for which a challenger might remain in the protected class of,responsible citizen 
we reject rehabilitation,recidivism,and passage of time evidence at step one of chester for the additional greater consequences it has on our criminal justice system.were we to permit this type of evidence on an second amendment challenge,it would invite any criminal defendant charged with a violation of g or a state law analogue to argue what is essentially jury nullification.the criminal defendant would be able to freely admit violation of the law in the past,but request that the jury not convict on the grounds of rehabilitation,unlikeliness of,or the length of time that had passed since conviction.we do not believe that the second amendment so requires in the context of felony convictions.
having clarified the standard applicable to hamilton challenge,we now apply our approach to the circumstances of this case,and find that hamilton fails at step one
