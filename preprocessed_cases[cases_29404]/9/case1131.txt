in this appeal,we consider whether a public college president decision to cancel a student government election because of content published in a school newspaper violates the first amendment rights of the student journalists who produce that publication.we conclude that,in the circumstances presented in this case,the school administrator actions did violate the first amendment.because factual issues exist with respect to the question of whether the college president is entitled to qualified immunity,we hold that it was inappropriate for the district court to grant summary judgment to the defendants.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment with respect to the college president and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
events giving rise to the lawsuita.the school 
the school newspaper at issue was produced by students at the college of staten island csi or the college,which is part of the city university of new york cuny system.under state law,the cuny board of trustees the cuny board may impose mandatory student activity fees to support student activities and regulate the expenditure of those funds.at all times relevant to this lawsuit,csi students,as a condition for registering for classes,were required to pay mandatory student activity fees in an amount set by the cuny board.at csi,a portion of the student activity fees is earmarked for a general fund to be allocated by the csi student government to several extracurricular activities,including student publications.
the cuny board of trustees bylaws cuny bylaws mandate that csi establish a student elections review committee serc,which,among other responsibilities,approves election procedures and certifies election results.cuny bylaw d.during a student government election,the serc meets when needed to consider alleged violations of election rules and other complaints regarding the election process.the student government nominates individuals,who may be students,faculty,or administrative staff,to serve on the serc.from those nominees,the csi president appoints the members of the serc.the intent of bylaw d is to limit the role of college presidents to receiving appeals from the student elections review committee where an individual student has received a negative determination on a request.on appeal,the csi president may uphold,reverse,or modify the serc determination.
each spring,csi holds annual elections for the student senate,as well as for other student government positions.once elected,the csi student senate in turn names a president and eight commissioners from among its members.one of the commissioners chairs a committee on publications that is responsible for regulating student media outlets.in the academic year,the allocation of student activity fees to student publications was made by the student senate based on the recommendation of the committee on publications.
publications funded by student activity fees at csi 
csi allocates student activity fees to fund a number of student publications,including the one at issue in this litigation,the college voice.the college voice is a student newspaper and political journal that is primarily paid for from student activity fees the college voice publishes articles and editorials on a wide range of topics,including pieces on csi,cuny,local,national,and international affairs,reviews,and poetry.the editors of the college voice choose the material that the newspaper publishes without any supervision or prior review by anyone other than the editors and staff of the newspaper.the newspaper has a faculty advisor who does not review or approve articles prior to publication.participation in the college voice is entirely extracurricular,and the editors and staff do not receive any academic credit for working on the newspaper.
in addition to the college voice,csi also funds a college radio station and other student media outlets using the student activity fees.the other outlets include the banner,which the student government designated the official campus newspaper,a literary magazine named the third rail,and various other publications.cuny and csi have not placed any restrictions on the subjects that may be covered in the college voice or the banner these newspapers are not prohibited from publishing articles or editorials expressing opinions or endorsing candidates in student elections.there is no rule or regulation prohibiting or restricting the editors or staff members of the college voice,or other publications,from running for student government positions or from endorsing themselves.
according to the plaintiffs complaint,in the early the college voice was designated the official college newspaper of csi.several years before the spring election,the editors of the college voice began publishing articles that reflected a generally perspective on campus,local,national,and international political issues.many of the articles and editorials were critical of cuny and csi administration officials.these positions prompted some students,who disagreed with the college voice editorial policy,to form a second student newspaper at csi called the banner.the csi student government subsequently revoked college voice designation as the official csi student newspaper and gave that status to the banner.in spring,the banner was the official csi student newspaper.
c.the spring election 
i.the student union slate 
in the fall term,some csi students concerned about various student life issues at csi and cuny began meeting and formed an organization they called the student union.during the student government elections in the spring semester,the student union ran a slate of candidates for a total of positions in the student senate and other governing organizations.several editors and staff members of the college voice,including some of the plaintiffs,were among the candidates running on the student union slate.the only opposing slate was students for students sfs,which was composed mainly of incumbent members of the student senate seeking.almost all of the candidates in the spring election were affiliated with either the student union or sfs slates.
the spring student government election at csi was scheduled to take place between april and may.before the election,csi serc approved eight election rules.two of those rules are at issue in this litigation.rule provided the campus newspaper may not be used as posters on walls,bulletin boards,and may not be used as a means to distribute campaign flyers.rule stated the student government will be glad to make you copies of your stamped and approved poster or flyer.all candidates must remove their election materials from the designated areas after the election is over.
ii.may issue of the college voice 
prior to the spring election,the college voice decided to endorse the student union slate by agreement within the college voice editorial board,the decision about whether or not to endorse candidates,which candidates to endorse if the newspaper decided to do so,and what content to run in the issue was to be made by the members of the board that were not candidates in the spring election.the college voice chose to publish a special election issue that the editors intended to have distributed on april,two days before the beginning of the voting period the timing was a significant aspect of the college voice message.an editor of the college voice explained,an important part of publication is not just the content of the newspaper,but timing and placement.and we felt that the timing a few days before the election would be the most opportune time to influence the election.
the may issue of the college voice consisted of pages.the front page displayed a group photograph of twelve of the candidates running on the student union slate under a bold headline,vote student union the rear cover of the newspaper featured only the student union platform.page two of the issue contained an editorial entitled vote student union.various candidates platform statements were printed on pages six and seven.the issue also included two articles by two of the plaintiffs criticizing the incumbent members of the student government who were running on the sfs slate,and two articles,one by a plaintiff and the other by a,criticizing the cuny chancellor.the remainder of the issue was devoted to articles on a wide variety of other matters,including pieces on international affairs,a new york city mayoral candidate forum,a work requirement for students receiving public assistance,campus security,the history of cuny,the cuny faculty union,and tenants rights.it also included music reviews and poetry.
the banner also published an election issue prior to the may election that included platform statements from candidates running on both the student union and the sfs slates.
iii.the actions of the student government and csi administration 
on april,the editors of the college voice were informed by a representative at their printer that,although the issue had been printed and was ready for delivery,student government publications commissioner juergen schnetzer had directed the printer not to release the issue.schnetzer was running for on the sfs slate.on april,the attorney for the college voice editors faxed a letter to csi president marlene springer informing her that student government officials had directed the printer to impound the issue and requesting that she order the immediate release of the newspaper.the letter was copied to various other individuals,including csi vice president for student affairs carol jackson and student government president joseph canale.president springer consulted with vice president jackson and directed jackson to ensure that the newspaper be released from the printer.jackson spoke with both canale and schnetzer,but schnetzer refused to rescind his order impounding the issue.later that day april,the student senate met in closed session to consider the administration request to override schnetzer decision.the student senate refused to overrule the impound order.
immediately following the student senate meeting,vice president jackson informed canale that president springer was overriding the student senate decision and that the newspaper would be delivered to the csi campus.jackson directed college employees to retrieve the newspapers from the printer and bring them to campus,which they did later that afternoon.
after the college voice was delivered to campus,andre woods,an incumbent member of the student senate running for on the sfs slate,filed a complaint with the serc.his complaint alleged that the may issue of the college voice violated election rule,which provided that t he campus newspaper may not be used as posters on walls,bulletin boards,and may not be used as a means to distribute campaign flyers.woods requested that any candidate found in that aforementioned issue of the college voice by any means such as a platform statement or otherwise be disqualified from the ongoing elections.
the serc considered woods complaint regarding the alleged rule violations at a meeting on april,and declined to sustain it.but the serc passed a resolution declaring that t he college voice used student activity fee funds allocated to promote the election of particular candidates affiliated with the college voice and adjourned until the next day to consider further action on the complaint.on may,the serc met again and passed a motion to postpone the election and to consider those ballots cast null and void as it is the committee decision that the electoral process had been compromised beyond its ability to be fair to all candidates.the polls were closed for approximately hours until president springer ordered that they be reopened after receiving a faxed appeal from plaintiffs attorney and hearing protests from students who arrived at her office.she declared that she would rule on all election appeals after the election had concluded on may.president springer directed vice president jackson to preserve the election results in case she reversed the serc determination on appeal.
springer set a deadline of may,for students to submit appeals from the serc determination.her office received a number of submissions from students,including an appeal from the plaintiffs lawyer and letters from other students in support of and in opposition to the serc determination.
iv.president springer nullification of the election 
on may,president springer issued a memorandum announcing her decision to affirm the serc nullification of the election because of the contents of the may issue of the college voice.the memorandum stated in relevant part 
the college voice inappropriately used student activity fee funds to publish and distribute approximately five thousand copies of a page issue of the college voice with a cover boldly encouraging a vote for a particular slate of candidates,some of whom are also staff members of the college voice.moreover,much of the issue was substantially devoted to supporting the endorsed slate of candidates.i find that this issue amounted to a thinly veiled student activity fee funded piece of campaign literature for the student union slate.as a result,the electoral process was compromised beyond its ability to be fair to all candidates,as argued by other candidates who requested nullification of the election.
the april to may election is therefore declared null and void,and a new election scheduled for the period thursday may,through friday,may.
president springer testified that,in making her decision,the only election rules adopted by the serc that she relied on were rules and.the defendants,however,agree that candidates and slates were allowed,at their own expense,to post and distribute additional materials beyond the thirty posters or flyers paid for by the student government.they further concede that,during the spring campaign,both slates and some individual candidates printed their own literature and that this was not a violation of rule.they also agree that rule was not a restriction on the content of newspapers.
president springer further testified that,in making her decision,she also relied on a rule.this rule,although not part of the eight rules expressly adopted by the serc prior to the election,was printed on the nomination form for candidates in the spring student elections.it stated 
all candidates are required to submit platform statements for each seat they are running for.platform statements should be no less than words and no more than words per statement.statements will be published in the campus newspaper.statements must be typed or submitted on disk and will not be edited,so be sure you represent yourself clearly and concisely.deadline for submission of statements is april.
i am aware of the guidelines regarding platform statements and am aware that failure to submit statements for each seat for which i am running for will result in my disqualification as a candidate.
the rule reference to the publication of candidate platform statements applied only to the banner,as the official campus newspaper,and not to the college voice or other csi student publications.the student government regularly submitted candidate platform statements to the banner but did not submit the statements to the college voice.this practice continued during the spring election campaign,in the course of which the student government submitted the candidates statements to the banner.the banner published the statements in its may,edition.
the day after president springer nullified the election,the votes that had been cast were counted.the student union had won all positions for which the slate ran candidates.the student union candidates also won all positions for which they ran in the second election that was held from may to may.
v.the effect of president springer actions on college voice practices 
after president springer decision,the members of the college voice considered removing every copy of the may issue from campus before the second election in order to avoid angering the administration.in elections held in subsequent years,the college voice reduced its coverage of the elections because,as an editorial board member explained,it recognize d that our endorsement could be a kiss of death for candidates we support because if president springer or the serc disapprove of our election coverage,they may cancel the election or take some other action,such as disqualifying a candidate or a slate who we prominently endorse,or prohibiting the publication or funding of our newspaper.indeed,in spring,candidates from the progressive student alliance psa,many of whom were members of the college voice or worked with the college voice on common political goals,expressed concern about the college voice endorsing them because of the candidates fear that an endorsement could lead the administration to cancel once again the election or disqualify psa candidates.in order to prevent that outcome,the college voice editors decided to give their endorsement of the psa less prominence than the newspaper endorsement of the student union slate had received in spring.
ii.the litigation below 
in their amended complaint,plaintiffs sought relief,pursuant to,for violations of their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments the plaintiffs alleged,inter alia,that the defendants actions represented an imposition of restrictions on the publication of a student newspaper,thereby depriving the college voice editors and staff of their first amendment right to be free from such restrictions in the public forum.the parties named as defendants in the action were president springer various csi employees various cuny employees cuny and its board of trustees csi and csi serc the cuny defendants.csi students who served on the student government during the academic year were also named as defendants the student government defendants.plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,nominal compensatory damages of from each of the defendants,and punitive damages of from each of the student government defendants and from each of the cuny defendants 
preliminary injunction proceedings 
the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the cuny defendants from prohibiting plaintiffs from publishing endorsements of candidates in future student government elections at csi or any other cuny college and from taking reprisals against plaintiffs,including cancellation of any election results,for publishing such endorsements.during a hearing held before a magistrate judge on the motion,cuny associate general counsel michael solomon confirmed that it was likely csi would once again cancel student government elections if the college voice published an edition similar to its may issue.solomon told the magistrate judge,i think if this happened again in spring,the april elections and this identical issue came out,something looking like this and a student appealed,i think the court should have a reasonable expectation the same thing would happen.the election results would be voided.solomon also informed the magistrate judge that one way the college voice could avoid these sanctions would be to submit its content to the serc for review.in light of these comments,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the preliminary injunction.
after the magistrate judge issued her recommendation,defendants informed the district court that election rule,as amended,provided that publications funded by student activity fee can not be used as campaign flyers or posters during the student elections and can not be used as a means to distribute campaign flyers or posters had been repealed and that csi would not reinstate the rule during president springer administration.defendants further represented to the district court that they would not cancel any election in response to endorsements or opinions on elections published in school newspapers during springer administration.accordingly,the district court denied plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction.
b.the district court decision on the merits 
in various early proceedings,the district court dismissed all of the defendants but csi president springer,csi vice president jackson,and a former administrative employee,michael silva in particular,it dismissed the student government defendants on the ground that they were not state actors.it also found that plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were moot.following discovery,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment against defendant springer on the first amendment claim.defendants also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that there was no first amendment violation and if there were,they were entitled to qualified immunity.
ruling on the summary judgment motions,the district court held that the cancellation of the election violated the first amendment rights of the defendants.in doing so,it rejected defendants argument that election rules and justified president springer actions.it also found no merit in defendants contention that the plaintiffs suffered no first amendment injury because the cancellation of the election,as opposed to a denial of funding or an impoundment of the paper,did not prevent the dissemination of the college voice views.judge gershon explained that i t can not be that university action taken as a direct result of the views printed in a student newspaper can escape first amendment scrutiny simply because that action was directed toward the nullification of the goal that the students espoused rather than at the vehicle,the newspaper,in which that goal was promoted.the chill on expressive freedom is the same.judge gershon noted that chill was reflected in the college voice coverage of subsequent student elections,and that such a chill amounted to a first amendment violation.
despite the district court conclusion that springer violated plaintiffs first amendment rights,the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion.it found that defendants jackson and silva could not held liable under for this violation because springer conduct broke the causal connection between their actions and the harm to the plaintiffs and,it concluded that springer was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established in may that her actions violated the first amendment rights of the plaintiffs.
plaintiffs appealed.in their action before this court,they contend that the district court erred when it held that president springer was entitled to qualified immunity and when it dismissed the student government defendants on the ground they were not state actors 
discussion 
president springer violated plaintiffs first amendment rightsa.scope of first amendment rights for student media outlets,and the student journalists who produce them,at public universities 
courts have long recognized that student media outlets at public universities,and the student journalists who produce those outlets,are entitled to strong first amendment protection.these rights stem from courts recognition that such student media outlets generally operate as limited public fora,within which schools may not disfavor speech on the basis of viewpoint.
a limited public forum is is created when the state opens a forum but limits the expressive activity to certain kinds of speakers or to the discussion of certain subjects.in limited public fora,the government may make reasonable,rules governing the content of speech allowed.peck baldwinsville cent.sch,cir emphasis and internal citations omitted.once the state has created a limited public forum,however,it must respect the boundaries that it has set.it may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint.rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the forum itself can take many forms,yet the analysis of the constitutionality of restrictions imposed on speech made in the forum remains the same.see id.at.the student activity fund is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense,but the same principles are applicable.
for over three decades,courts have acknowledged that a public university establishment of a student media outlet typically involves the creation of a limited public forum,which means that the ability of school administrators to interfere with the speech made through such an outlet is generally strictly curtailed the fourth circuit,for instance,recognized the strong first amendment rights of student journalists at public colleges in joyner whiting,cir.there,the president of north carolina central university withdrew the university support for the echo,a student newspaper,because of his objections to the newspaper content.the court held that the college president actions violated the first amendment rights of the students who produced the college newspaper.id.at.it explained that i t may well be that a college need not establish a campus newspaper,or,if a paper has been established,the college may permanently discontinue publication for reasons wholly unrelated to the first amendment.but if a college has a student newspaper,its publication can not be suppressed because college officials dislike its editorial comment.id.at.
the fifth circuit adopted a similar view in bazaar fortune,cir.in bazaar,officials at the university of mississippi attempted to prevent publication and distribution of a student literary magazine because it used language that they considered to be inappropriate and in bad taste.the fifth circuit rejected the university argument that the school had the same powers as a private publisher to restrict whatever content it saw fit.the court stated,once a public school makes an activity available to its students,faculty,or even the general public,it must operate the activity in accord with first amendment principles a state university can not support a campus newspaper and then try to restrict arbitrarily what it may publish,even if only to require that material be submitted to a faculty board to determine whether it complies with responsible freedom of the press.id.at quoting aclu of virginia radford college.
the court further explained that w e are well beyond the belief that any manner of state regulation is permissible simply because it involves an activity which is part of the university structure and is financed with funds controlled by the administration.the state is not necessarily the unrestrained master of what it creates and fosters.id.at citing antonelli hammond.as a result,in cases concerning publications or the use of school facilities,the courts have refused to recognize as permissible any regulations infringing free speech when not shown to be necessarily related to the maintenance of order and discipline within the educational process.id.in light of the first amendment rights enjoyed by student publications,the court found that the university could not restrict the distribution of the student magazine in the absence of special circumstances such as that the speech used was obscene or would prompt a violent disruption.accordingly,the fifth circuit upheld the district court determination that the university interference with the publication and distribution of the student magazine violated the first amendment.
the fifth circuit reaffirmed the strong first amendment protections enjoyed by student media outlets at public colleges in schiff williams,cir.there,the president of atlantic university removed three editors of the student newspaper allegedly because of the newspaper poor quality under their leadership.the university argued that,because the editors were state employees,their free speech rights could be restricted by the university if those rights were outweighed by a more significant government interest,which it identified as the university interest in a publication which maintained high standards of grammar and literary value so as to project a proper view of the university and its student body.id.at.the court resoundingly rejected this argument.it held that the right of free speech embodied in the publication of a college student newspaper can not be controlled except under special circumstances.id.the fifth circuit explained those special circumstances were limited to situations where the restrictions were necessary to maintain order and discipline within the educational process.the circumstances relied on by the grammar,spelling,and language clearly not the sort which could lead to significant disruption on the university campus or within its educational processes.id.at.accordingly,the court affirmed the district court finding that the university actions had violated the student journalists first amendment rights.
relying on these cases,the eighth circuit adopted a similar understanding of the first amendment protections afforded college newspapers in stanley magrath,cir.in stanley,the minnesota daily,the student newspaper of the twin cities campuses of the university of minnesota,published an especially controversial humor issue.in response,the university board of regents changed the method by which it funded the newspaper and other student publications.whereas student publications in the past had been funded by a mandatory student fee,the board voted to allow students to obtain a refund of this fee if they so desired.former editors of the daily,the daily itself,and the board of student publication brought suit.they claimed that the regents instituted the refundable fee system in response to the content of the humor issue and,as a result,violated the first amendment.the eighth circuit agreed.
in support of its holding,the court explained,a public university may not constitutionally take adverse action against a student newspaper,such as withdrawing or reducing the paper funding,because it disapproves of the content of the paper.id.at citing,inter alia,joyner,at.as a result,to prevail on their first amendment claim,the plaintiffs must show that the regents decision was adverse and that the decision was substantially motivated by the content of the newspaper.id.as the plaintiffs demonstrated both that the decision was adverse,in that it created a chilling effect,and that it was substantially motivated by the content of the humor issue,the court held that the regents actions violated the first amendment.id.at.
the fourth,fifth,and eighth circuits,therefore,have adopted the position that the establishment of a student media outlet,in essence,necessarily involves the creation of a limited public forum where the only restraint is on the speakers who can participate,students and where there can be no restrictions on the content of the outlet except with respect to content that threatens the maintenance of order at the university.two other circuits,while also recognizing that student media outlets often enjoy first amendment protection from interference by school administrators,have taken a less expansive view.the sixth and seventh circuits agree that the establishment of a student media outlet can create a limited public forum but have concluded that the scope of that forum can be restricted by the school.in other words,these courts do not consider the creation of a student media outlet as categorically involving the creation of a limited public forum within which students may speak on essentially any subject without fear of reprisal,but rather look to the context of the public university treatment of a student media outlet,including its intent in creating the outlet and practices with respect to the outlet,in order to determine what first amendment protection the outlet,and those that participate in it,receive.see hosty carter,cir en banc kincaid gibson,cir en banc 
nevertheless,although the treatment of forum analysis with respect to student media outlets at public universities has differed in some respects in the various circuits,all the circuits that have considered the issue have determined that,at the very least,when a public university creates or subsidizes a student newspaper and imposes no ex ante restrictions on the content that the newspaper may contain,neither the school nor its officials may interfere with the viewpoints expressed in the publication without running afoul of the first amendment.
we agree that,at a minimum,when a public university establishes a student media outlet and requires no initial restrictions on content,it may not censor,retaliate,or otherwise chill that outlet speech,or the speech of the student journalists who produce it,on the basis of content or viewpoints expressed through that outlet.this holding is fully consistent with and,indeed,substantially follows from,our decisions,and those of the supreme court,in other cases addressing limited public fora.see peck,at hotel emples.rest.emples.union,local city of dep t of parks,cir see also good news club milford cent,d rosenberger,at.
given our conclusion,we need not decide in this case which of the two approaches embraced by other circuits governs evaluations of the first amendment protections afforded student media outlets at public colleges.because cuny had a policy in which it expressly placed no limits on the contents of student publications,under even the less protective contextual approach of the sixth and seventh circuits,it is clear that the college voice was a limited public forum in which there were no restrictions on the subjects that could be addressed 
springer actions violated plaintiffs first amendment rights 
i.the college voice constituted a limited public forum 
under even the less protective approach for evaluating the scope of the first amendment rights afforded student media outlets and the students journalists who work on them,it is clear that the college voice was a limited public forum in which subject always to the existence of a compelling state interest such as the maintenance of public order the only permissible restriction was on the speakers who could participate.csi,through the student government,chartered the college voice and provided the newspaper with most of its funding through the allocation of student activity fees.the defendants agree that neither cuny nor csi had placed any restrictions on the subjects that could be covered in the college voice or other student publications.indeed,in earlier litigation before this court,cuny expressly disclaim ed any right of the institution to control student publications,such as those financed through student activity fees.leeds,at.
accordingly,the policy and practice of csi demonstrate that the school intended to open the pages of the college voice to indiscriminate use by the students who serve as its contributors and editors,and that it thereby created a public forum in which the only limit involved the nature of permissible speakers.see perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.because the college voice operated as such a forum,csi and its officials could not,under the first amendment,take adverse action against the student newspaper,including engaging in conduct designed to chill the speech contained in future editions,on the basis of the views expressed in the publication unless such action served a compelling government interest.see hotel emples.rest.emples.union,at.the defendants have offered no arguments that the nullification of the may election advanced any such interest,and we can conceive of no interest of sufficient import to justify president springer actions given the first amendment concerns involved.see infra note.
ii.president springer canceled the spring election because of the viewpoint expressed in the may issue of the college voice 
in its may issue,the college voice clearly sought to express a viewpoint on the spring election.this viewpoint was reflected both in the content contained in the issue and in the manner in which that content was presented.the substance of the college voice material made clear the newspaper support for the positions taken by the student union and its belief that the candidates on that slate should be elected.in order to emphasize the strength of its view that the student body should elect candidates who supported running csi in the manner advocated by the student union,the college voice devoted almost its entire front cover and its complete back cover to promoting the election of candidates running on that slate,and included in the may issue the slate platform statement as well as various exhortations urging the slate election.
remarks and testimony made by president springer reveal that it was the college voice viewpoint on the in both the substance of its content and in the manner in which that content was led her to nullify the election.first,in announcing her decision,springer noted the aspects of the may issue of the college voice that caused her to nullify the initial spring election included its cover that boldly encourage ed a vote for a particular slate of candidates and her assessment that much of the issue was devoted to supporting an endorsed slate of candidates.
president springer testimony also shows that she nullified the election because of the viewpoint expressed by the college voice.the following exchange occurred during president springer deposition 
q is it your opinion that the college voice has an obligation to present both sides of an issue 
a not any issue.certainly they have a right to their opinion on issues,but as far as student elections is concerned,yes.
q could you be very specific i do want to mischaracterize your testimony.are you saying that the college voice is required to have a balanced coverage of student elections 
q okay.could you describe what is your understanding of balanced 
a presenting both slates.
q when you say presenting both slates,could the college voice favor one slate over the other and say so in writing could they publish that 
a it depends on whether it was a small statement in an editorial or whether it was part of their whole issue.
q so,is it your testimony then that the college voice could appropriately endorse candidates if it was done in appropriate context 
a yes.if the candidates were fairly presented on both sides of the slate.if it were a campaign literature,then no.
q so,you saying one of your requirements for fairness in coverage is to present both sides is that correct 
a,and honestly.
q y ou also said there would be some differences as to how prominently the college voice voiced its opinion.is that a fair characterization of your testimony 
a it could well be,yes.
q is the decision to publish an opinion on the front page with a big headline as opposed to on a page with a small headline,is that decision fundamentally reflecting an opinion about how important the story is 
a i think in journalist practices it would be in that sense.but is it the editor right to do that under these particular situations where we have regulations governing the campaign literature,no.
this exchange shows that president springer nullification of the election due to the may issue of the college voice was premised on two types of viewpoint discrimination relating to the subject of student elections.first,springer action was driven by her belief that only one perspective was acceptable for speech on student elections in a student viewpoint that reflected a balanced view of the that contrary that certain candidates should be inappropriate.second,springer testimony reveals that her nullification of the initial election was premised on her belief that the college voice view as to the importance of electing the student union slate,as reflected in the presentation of the content promoting those candidates,was improper and should be excluded from the limited public forum of the student newspaper.
that the views on the student election,expressed through the substance and presentation of the content in the may issue,led to springer conduct is further supported by comments made by a cuny associate general counsel during the preliminary injunction hearing before the magistrate judge.there,the cuny attorney stated,i think if this happened again in the april elections and this identical issue came out,something looking like this and a student appealed,i think the court should have a reasonable expectation the same thing would happen.the election results would be voided.the cuny attorney further told the magistrate judge that one way the college voice could avoid such retaliation against its speech in the future would be to submit its content to the serc for review.
such viewpoint discrimination is clearly impermissible in a limited public forum open to unrestricted speech on campaigns,candidates,and issues affecting cuny.indeed,as the supreme court and this court have repeatedly emphasized,once a state institution opens a limited forum to speech on a particular topic,it may not act against a speaker in that forum on the basis of views they express on that topic.see rosenberger,at.finding that the state may not exercis e viewpoint discrimination,even when the limited public forum is one of its own creation and noting that viewpoint discrimination is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum limitations see also good news club,at.peck,at hotel emples.rest.emples.union,at.yet,that is exactly what happened here the college voice was a limited public forum open to speech related to the spring election and to which candidates should be elected,the college voice expressed views on those subjects in its may issue,and springer,by canceling the election,engaged in adverse action because of the views the newspaper offered 
iii.the defendants arguments for why president springer actions did not violate the first amendment are unavailing 
a.the nullification of the election created a chilling effect and thus violated the first amendment 
defendants assert that any harm the plaintiffs may have suffered as a result of the nullification of the election does not rise to the level of cognizable constitutional injury.this argument is entirely without merit.when a state university official takes retaliatory action against a newspaper for publishing certain content in an effort to force the newspaper to refrain from publishing that or similar content in the future,the official action creates a chilling effect which gives rise to a first amendment injury.see stanley,at.here,the record establishes that springer nullification of the election created just such a chilling effect.
as the district court explained,there was a concrete action taken in nullifying a student election because of a publication supportive of a particular slate of candidates which won the election.the threat or chill that plaintiffs assert they felt regarding future issues of the newspapers is not merely subjective,but has already been experienced.in the wake of president springer actions in spring,the college voice scaled back its coverage of elections and reduced the prominence and extent of its candidate endorsements in an effort to avoid provoking another election nullification.accordingly,although springer actions did not entail impoundment of the may issue,the denial of funding,or the express prohibition of election coverage,her conduct nevertheless violated the plaintiffs first amendment rights as a result of the chill on student speech that it created.see zieper metzinger,cir it is that first amendment rights may be violated by the chilling effect of governmental action that falls short of a direct prohibition against speech.internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the may issue did not constitute candidate speech nor did its content violate applicable election rules 
the defendants contend,however,that the front and back covers of the may issue of the college voice,as well as the candidate position statements included in the inside of the issue,did not constitute the newspaper speech,but rather was the speech of the candidates themselves.the defendants argue that president springer nullified the election because of this method of candidate speech,which,they assert,violated the governing election rules by essentially creating flyers for the student union candidates.this claim is unconvincing.
first,as the defendants concede,the college voice was entitled to endorse candidates in the may student government elections.they further concede that there were no prohibitions against candidates also serving as editors or staffers on the college voice or against such candidates endorsing themselves.as a result,it can not be that the newspaper endorsement of candidates who were also members of its staff converted those endorsements from newspaper speech to candidate speech.furthermore,the record in this case reflects that the college voice editors who chose what content to include in the may issue,which,if any,candidates to endorse,and how to lay out the content in that issue were not running in the election.in other words,the choice to speak in the way challenged by the defendants was not made by any of the candidates.
alternatively,in making this argument,the defendants may be asserting that content such as platform statements,slogans,and exhortations to vote for candidates is necessarily candidate speech,even if technically selected for inclusion in a publication by.this position seems premised on an improperly narrow light of the nature of the forum at what speech is encompassed in media coverage of an election.moreover,it appears to stem from an impoverished understanding of the different types of media outlets that cover an election or politics,and the nature of content inherent in those outlets in addition to outlets that offer balanced coverage,there are those that adopt a specific point of view and the publication,not just on the editorial page provide content urging readers to embrace that view.to take national media outlets as examples,in addition to usa today,which describes itself as offering the type of balanced views of an election that president springer evidently favors,there are partisan media organizations,such as the nation and the weekly standard,which regularly aggressively endorse their chosen candidates,parties,and ideas,and demonstrate their endorsements by,inter alia,reprinting that party platform or putting a candidate picture on the cover and urging readers to vote for him or her.these various news organizations all offer different perspectives,or views,on an election,but the latter coverage is no more candidate speech than the former.
in other words,the fact that a news outlet adopts and zealously promotes the views of the candidates or party it supports and aggressively urges the election of those candidates,or the fact that such speech,unsurprisingly,would tend to benefit those candidates,does not transform the media outlet speech into candidate speech.
in any event,the college voice publication of the content in the may issue did not violate any germane election rules.the two rules that the defendants assert justified president springer actions are elections rules and.rule provided the campus newspaper may not be used as posters on walls,bulletin boards,and may not be used as a means to distribute campaign flyers.rule stated the student government will be glad to make you copies of your stamped and approved poster or flyer.all candidates must remove their election materials from the designated areas after the election is over.as the district court clearly and correctly explained,neither of these rules precluded the college voice from publishing the content in its may issue.we can not do better than to restate that court discussion 
the only rules that president springer relied on and that defendants say are relevant,election rules and,define the responsibility of the individual student candidates,not the scope of the content of the college newspapers the rules do not,explicitly or even implicitly,preclude campus newspapers from endorsing candidates or running platform statements.there is nothing in the rules concerning balanced coverage,the context of editorials,or the placement of headlines or platform statements.indeed,implicit in rule requirement that candidates should not use the newspapers as posters is the acknowledgment that the papers may contain favorable opinions and support for a candidate that he or she would want to post on a bulletin board.that rule provides that the student government will print and pay for posters or flyers imposes no restriction on the number of issues of the school newspaper which may contain an endorsement.there are simply no written guidelines to establish that what was printed in the may issue of the college voice was prohibited.
second emphasis added.
we agree entirely with the district court reading of the rules and therefore reject defendants arguments that springer actions were no more than the enforcement of the election regulations adopted by the serc.
president springer actions can not be justified as necessary to ensure viewpoint neutrality in the administration csi student activity fees fund 
the defendants further argue that president springer actions were justified by her duty to address the potential first amendment violation arising from the use of the mandatory student activity fee to favor the viewpoint of the candidate plaintiffs over that of other candidates.this argument misapprehends how viewpoint neutrality requirements apply to mandatory student activity fees.the defendants are correct that when a state college implements a mandatory student activity fee,its procedure for allocating the funds that fee generates must be viewpoint neutral.this is totally different from,and in no way means,that the college has a duty to ensure that the positions expressed by the recipients of the fees reflect a balance of viewpoints.far from it as long as the availability of the funds to student groups is not restricted based on their viewpoint,the college administration of a mandatory student activity fee complies with the neutrality requirement demanded by the first amendment.see board of regents southworth,d citing rosenberger,at.
here,the fact that the college voice expressed a particular viewpoint did not create a first amendment concern relating to viewpoint neutrality with respect to csi administration of the student activity fee funds.no one disputes that the csi student activity fee funds were distributed based on criteria.nor does any party dispute that the candidates on the rival slate,sfs,could have founded a newspaper that promoted their views and received student activity fee funds for it.indeed,the other campus newspaper at csi,which also received student activity fee funds,was created by students who objected to the viewpoints espoused by the college voice.the fact that the supporters or candidates of the rival slate did not seek a media outlet of their own in no way means that the college voice use of the student activity fee funds to express its views gave rise to a viewpoint neutrality issue regarding csi administration of the student activity fee fund.no one has here suggested any violations of the requirement that the student activity fee fund be administered in a viewpoint neutral manner.as a result,there was no abuse for president springer to correct.rather,far from remedying a viewpoint neutrality problem,president springer actions created a very real one.
we conclude that president springer nullification of the spring election violated the plaintiffs first amendment rights.
ii.the qualified immunity question can not be resolved at summary judgment 
defendants argue that even if president springer violated plaintiffs first amendment rights,she is nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity.the district court agreed and granted the defendants summary judgment on this ground.we,however,find that the district court otherwise admirable opinion erred in this respect because material factual issues relevant to the qualified immunity question are in dispute.
a government official sued in his official capacity is entitled to qualified immunity in any of three circumstances if the conduct attributed to him is not prohibited by federal law where that conduct is so prohibited,if the plaintiff right not to be subjected to such conduct by the defendant was not clearly established at the time of the conduct or if the defendant action was objectively legally reasonable in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.see sadallah city of utica,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.summary judgment should not be granted on the basis of a qualified immunity defense premised on an assertion of objective reasonableness unless the defendant shows that no reasonable jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,could conclude that the defendant actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.vargo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
neither of the first two grounds for qualified immunity apply in this case.as explained in the previous section,president springer nullification of the election in response to the content published in the college voice was prohibited federal law.and the plaintiffs right not to be subjected to her actions was clearly established in the spring of.this court has explained that,in determining whether a right is clearly established for qualified immunity purposes,the right need not be limited to the specific factual situation in which that right was articulated.papineau parmley,cir.this is because the supreme court has declined to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,and has,instead,chosen a standard that excludes such immunity if in the light of law the unlawfulness is apparent.id.citing back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the state of the law in spring was such that,when president springer nullified the election in response to the content published in the college voice,it was clear that her actions violated the first amendment rights of the student journalists.there can be no question that a reasonable official in president springer position should have been aware that the college voice was a public forum,limited only with respect to the speakers who could participate and not with regard to the subject matters on which the newspaper could discuss,and thereby entitled to protection under supreme court law governing such fora.cuny general counsel office had distributed a memorandum to the presidents of colleges in the cuny system in,including president springer,that expressly identified students newspapers and other publications as limited public fora.and,in a separate case that involved the status of student publications at cuny schools and that predated springer election nullification,our court recognized that cuny expressly disclaim ed any right of the institution to control student publications,such as those financed through student activity fees.leeds,at.
and,the law governing impermissible restrictions on speech in a limited public forum such as the college voice was also plainly apparent at the time of president springer actions.the supreme court had directly addressed the first amendment rights to which speakers in such a forum were entitled in.thus,in rosenberger the supreme court made clear that when a state creates a limited public forum related to student media outlets,such as the college voice,it is not permitted to discriminate against speech made in that forum including speech made by a student media outlet with a particular perspective on subjects open for discussion in the forum based on viewpoint.at.in explaining its decision,the supreme court stated that the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination was rooted in longstanding v ital first amendment speech principles,including the need to protect against the danger of chilling student speech.it added that for a public college to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the nation intellectual life,its college and university campuses.id.at.citing healy james,d keyishian bd.of regents of of state of,d.
in the spring of,therefore,it was evident that the college voice was a limited public forum open to speech on any topic.it also was plain that the first amendment prohibited a public college official from engaging in viewpoint discrimination within such a forum,and that actions taken by a college official that chilled protected speech within that forum violated the first amendment.accordingly,although no court had specifically held at the time that the nullification of an election on the basis of views expressed by a student newspaper violated the first amendment where such nullification chilled future speech,the unlawfulness of springer actions was apparent in the light of law.see back,at.and the contours of the right were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d see also hope pelzer,d o fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances although earlier cases involving fundamentally similar facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding.
because president springer conduct violated clearly established law,she is entitled to qualified immunity only if it was objectively reasonable for her to believe that her actions were lawful at the time she nullified the election.see lennon miller,cir.defendants assert that president springer decided to nullify the election because she believed doing so was necessary to vindicate election rules and.
although we,like the district court,conclude that those rules did not justify springer conduct,it is possible that a jury might find that it was objectively reasonable for springer,at the time she acted,to believe that her nullification was the lawful implementation of these election rules.but,while such a conclusion by a jury may be permissible,it nonetheless is inappropriate for a court,at the summary judgment stage,to find that springer is entitled to qualified immunity on this basis.
first,we have noted that s ummary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is not appropriate when there are facts in dispute that are material to a determination of reasonableness.thomas roach,cir.here,there is a dispute as to whether and to what extent president springer relied on any of the rules cited when she made her decision to cancel the election.the nature of this dispute is ably described in the magistrate judge second report and recommendation,where that judge examined the defendants claim that president springer had relied on election rule.
the magistrate judge noted that the defendants i nitially relied solely on an argument that the decision was well within president springer inherent authority to regulate student government elections and ensure a fair election process and that they failed to even make reference to rule or to any regulation specifically prohibiting student funded newspapers from being used as campaign literature until they raised the claim before the district court after the magistrate judge had recommended that plaintiffs be granted a preliminary injunction.the magistrate judge also pointed out that the defendants had offered shifting explanations before the magistrate and the district court of how much president springer relied on rule,which,the magistrate judge concluded,raises serious questions of material fact as to what extent,if any,president springer relied on rule in reaching her determination to cancel the election.as a result,the magistrate judge found that it is clear that there is a disputed issue of fact that would preclude summary judgment on the issue of whether president springer relied on rule in making her decision.
the concerns the magistrate judge expressed with respect to whether president springer did in fact rely on rule apply equally to her asserted reliance on rule.defendants did not assert that president springer relied on rule when deciding to nullify the election until well after the litigation was underway.and they have offered shifting explanations for the role that rule played in her decision over the course of this action.
in light of the disputed issues of material fact regarding president springer reliance on the election rules,summary judgment on the defendants qualified immunity claim can not be granted.see green city of new york,cir citing kerman city of new york,cir if there is a material question of fact as to the relevant surrounding circumstances,the question of objective reasonableness is for the jury.
second,even if there were no factual dispute regarding president springer reliance on the election rules,it would still be inappropriate to resolve the qualified immunity question on summary judgment.we noted that a jury might find that it was objectively reasonable for springer to believe that a nullification of the election on the basis of the election rules was lawful,because such nullification involved only the enforcement of regulations.but a reasonable jury could equally well conclude the opposite,that any reliance on the rules was not an objectively reasonable basis for nullification of the election.and we have held that s ummary judgment should not be granted on the basis of a qualified immunity defense premised on an assertion of objective reasonableness unless the defendant shows that no reasonable jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,could conclude that the defendant actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in other words,we can not say,at the summary judgment stage,that springer did in fact rely on rules and in deciding to nullify the election.nor can we say that even if she did so rely,a reasonable jury would be compelled to find such reliance objectively reasonable.given these considerations,we conclude that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to president springer on the ground that she was entitled to qualified immunity.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment.
iii.the district court properly dismissed the student government defendants 
finally,plaintiffs challenge the district court decision to grant the motion of the student government defendants to dismiss the claims against them because they were not state actors.we affirm the district court dismissal of these defendants.
a private individual may be treated as a state actor for purposes of a constitutional challenge to his conduct only if his actions are fairly attributable to the state.leeds,at quoting kohn,d.extensive regulation and public funding,either alone or taken together,will not transform a private actor into a state actor instead,the state must have exerted its coercive power over,or provided significant encouragement to,the defendant before the latter will be deemed a state actor.see also san francisco arts ath.united states olympic,d.a private entity does not become a state actor merely because its conduct is authorized by a state law,where its conduct is not compelled by the state.loce time warner entertainment,cir emphasis added.
here,plaintiffs have made no allegations that would permit the inference that the school authorities coerced or encouraged student government publications commissioner schnetzer to impound the may issue,or coerced or encouraged the other student government defendants to support his decision.in fact,according to the plaintiffs,when the school administrators learned of schnetzer actions,they urged him and the rest of the members of the student senate to rescind the impoundment.when the student government defendants refused to do so,president springer overruled their decision accordingly,it can not be said that the school officials even acquiesced to the student government defendants actions,keeping in mind that such acquiescence would still be insufficient to demonstrate that the student government defendants were state actors.see san francisco arts,at.
despite these facts,the plaintiffs insist that the student government defendants were state actors because the student senate existence and its power to regulate student organizations,including the college voice,derive from the cuny bylaws and csi governance plan.but,assuming that state law or regulations gave the student government defendants the power to act as they did,these laws and regulations certainly did not require the defendants to do so.as a result,the state authorization was insufficient to establish that the student government defendants were state actors in the circumstances presented here.see loce,at.
we therefore find that the district court correctly concluded that,in the circumstances presented in this case,the student government defendants were not state actors and properly dismissed them as defendants.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to president springer based on her qualified immunity and remand for further proceedings.we affirm the district court dismissal of the student government defendants 
i concur in the majority result insofar as it affirms the dismissal of some claims,but i dissent insofar as it reverses the grant of qualified immunity.
i concede that this short opinion of mine does not consider or take into account the majority opinion.so i should disclose at the outset that i have not read it.i suppose this is unusual,so i explain why.
the majority has fulfilled its responsibility to explain at some length its vacatur of a part of the district court judgment.but this is not a case that should occupy the mind of a person who has anything consequential to do.in a nutshell,the editors of the college voice student newspaper used it as a campaign flyer to promote the radicals of the student union party in a student election,and the college president,finding that the partisan use of funds made a mockery of the election rules,directed that the election be.the gist of the complaint is that the editors speech was chilled,which is deemed to be a bad thing.
this is a case about nothing.injunctive relief from the school election rules is now moot if it was ever viable and plaintiffs counsel conceded at oral argument that the only relief sought in this litigation is nominal damages.now,after years of litigation over two dollars,the majority will impose on a busy judge to conduct a trial on this silly thing,and require a panel of jurors to set aside their more important duties of family and business in order to decide it.see amato city of saratoga springs,cir jacobs,concurring noting that a trial over one dollar is a wasteful imposition on the trial judge and on the taxpayers and veniremen.
with due respect to my colleagues in the majority,and to whatever compulsion they feel to expend substantial energies on this case,i fear that the majority opinion pages of typescript will only feed the plaintiffs fantasy of oppression that plutocrats are trying to stifle an upsurge of on staten island.contrary to the impression created by the majority lengthy formal opinion,this case is not a cause célèbre it is a tantrum by children spending their graduate years trying to humiliate the school that conferred on them a costly education from which they evidently derived small benefit.a selection from the illiterate piffle in the disputed issue of the college voice is set out in the margin for the reader fun 
on the merits,i would affirm for the reasons given in judge gershon careful and thorough opinion which i have read.
president springer decision to the election was to apply the governing standard not unreasonable in light of clearly established law.the school adopted election rules intended to level the playing field and limit the use of funds for purposes.president springer decision was based on her view that the may issue of the college voice was a thinly veiled student activity fee funded piece of campaign literature for the student union slate.the majority remands for a trial on whether the college president acted on an impermissible belief that a school newspaper funded by compelled fees should be balanced.
i think that the first amendment protects the freedom of the press and that this protection should be strongest when a newspaper prints content at election time.but this area of the law is unfortunately far from clear.
in,six years after the election at issue,the supreme court upheld numerous limitations on speech during election an opinion that could open the way to direct regulation of a newspaper if its election coverage becomes too slanted or biased.see mcconnell fed.election comm n,d thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part.in,this court upheld a state election law that provided for the regulation of news stories about candidates based on the discretionary rulings of the law administrators.see landell sorrell,cir winter,dissenting,rev sub nom.randall sorrell,d.that discretion to ensure a fair election is the same kind of discretion that president springer exercised here.
in this light,it can not be said that in there was a clear line between i a reprisal against a campus newspaper and ii the implementation of neutral and constitutional election standards.in any event,a school administrator should not have to become a professor in order to save herself from personal liability when giving a needed lesson in fair play.
this prolonged litigation has already cost the school a lot of money that could better have been spent to enrich course offerings or expand student.if this case ends with a verdict for plaintiffs anything is possible with a jury,the district court will have the opportunity to consider whether the exercise merits an award of attorneys fees in excess of of two dollars.
the may issue of the college voice,which is at the heart of this litigation,was funded entirely by student activity fees.
in,cuny vice chancellor for legal affairs robert diaz sent the cuny council of presidents a memorandum entitled,regulation of speech by an institution of higher education.that memorandum stated,in part the first amendment protection of freedom of speech and of the press apply to student newspapers and other publications.therefore,a public university may not impose any prohibition on such publications except to serve a compelling state interest similarly,a public university may not take adverse action against a student newspaper or against a particular student because it disagrees with the content of a student newspaper.while a college may not interfere with the content of student publications,it may,consistent with the law described earlier,promulgate time,place and manner restrictions regarding the distribution of student publications.while college or university property may not fall into the quintessential public forum category,the supreme court has held that property that the government has made available for expressive activity by the public also constitutes a public forum this category often called a limited public forum has been broadened to include not just physical sites but channels of communication opened for public speech.once a public institution creates such a public forum,even if it was not required to create it in the first place,the institution can not regulate expressive activity in that forum based on its content.internal citations omitted.in another case involving a student publication at cuny,this court found that,in this memorandum,cuny expressly disclaim ed any right of the institution to control student publications,such as those financed through student activity fees.leeds meltz,cir.
previous issues of the college voice had contained editorials and articles supporting the demands of the student union and encouraging students to join the new organization,as well as articles critical of the incumbent student government.
although the issue was scheduled to be distributed on campus on april,the date on the edition was may.
the plaintiffs included members of the editorial board of the college voice who were also candidates on the student union slate in the spring election sarah husain,william wharton,and neil schuldiner,members of the editorial board of the college voice who were not candidates in the spring election manjula wijerama and kasadore ramkisson,contributors to the college voice who were candidates on the student union slate in the spring election devon blinth and kathleen mchugh,candidates on the student union slate who were not editorial board members of,staffers of,or contributors to the college voice colleen mcgraham and jeff mcgraham,and a student unaffiliated with the college voice who voted in the spring election but did not run for office marc peseau.
they also sought relief for violations of the new york state open meeting laws.that claim is not pursued on appeal.
the district court subsequently approved a stipulation limiting any award for punitive damages to per cuny defendant and permitting plaintiffs to seek compensatory damages from the cuny defendants up to an aggregate of.
another administrative employee was dismissed pursuant to a stipulation by the parties.
the district court finding as to jackson was not appealed.plaintiffs challenge to the finding with respect to silva was waived.see infra note.
in their statement of questions presented and in the conclusion of their opening brief,plaintiffs assert they are also challenging the district court holding that their requests for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot.but,in the text of the opening brief,plaintiffs make no arguments in support of this claim,nor do they do so in the reply brief.similarly,at the end of their opening brief,the plaintiffs request their claims be reinstated against various defendants other than springer,including silva,but they do not discuss the issues relating to this ground for relief in the body of their briefs.accordingly,we conclude that these claim are waived.see tolbert queens college,cir it is a settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs expressly state that they do not appeal the dismissal of claims against jackson.
these decisions appear to be rooted in the supreme court repeated admonitions that colleges play a critical role in exposing students to the marketplace of ideas and,as a result,first amendment protections must be applied with particular vigilance in that context.see,healy james,d w e note that state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the first amendment t he precedents of this court leave no room for the view that,because of the acknowledged need for order,first amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large.see also rosenberger,at.the danger to speech from the chilling of individual thought and expression is especially real in the university setting,where the state acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition for the university,by regulation,to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the nation intellectual life,its college and university campuses.
the sixth circuit analysis,however,likely was limited to the circumstances presented in that case.that court expressly stated o ur decision to apply the forum doctrine to the student yearbook at issue in this case has no bearing on the question of whether and the extent to which a public university may alter the content of a student newspaper.kincaid,at.in doing so,the court cited to many of the cases described above that reflect the categorical approach embraced by other circuits,including stanley,schiff,and joyner.
we note that although we do not resolve precisely what type of forum analysis applies here,we have no doubt that the college voice constituted a limited public forum and thus reject the arguments proffered by plaintiffs and amicus student press law center to the contrary.drawing on the supreme court reference to private speakers and private speech in rosenberger,plaintiffs and the student press law center contend that the college voice is not a public forum of any type.rather,they assert the college voice is an entirely private entity and any restrictions or retaliation taken against it should be evaluated as though the student newspaper were the new york times or other similar private news organizations.this is not an accurate reading of rosenberger.rosenberger references to private speakers and private speech were employed to draw a distinction between the first amendment restrictions that are imposed on the state when it provides funds for others to transmit its own message,where the speech involved is the government message and when it provides funds for others to promote their own views,where the speech involved is the message of the speakers.rosenberger,at.see also christian legal soc y walker,cir recognizing the rosenberger discussion of private speech refers to the speaker not spreading messages.accordingly,while it is unquestioned that the student journalist plaintiffs in rosenberger were private speakers in the sense that the student activity fee money they received would be used to transmit a message of their choosing,that does not mean the vehicle through which those students sought to send their student itself private.moreover,nothing in rosenberger suggests that the court conceived of the student publication there at issue as private.
under the strict scrutiny applicable to government actions that impose such viewpoint discrimination,these actions would be permissible only if they served a compelling government interest and were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.see hotel emples.rest.emples.union,at.as mentioned above,however,and as the district court correctly noted,the defendants have made no effort to show that springer actions were supported by a compelling state interest,or that there were no less intrusive alternatives to her decision to the nullify the election results.
the district court only basis for finding that springer was entitled to qualified view that a court must have specifically held prior to springer actions that nullifying a student election on the basis of views expressed by a student newspaper violated the first amendment for it to be clearly established that plaintiffs had a constitutional right not to be subject to such,therefore,in error.significantly,the defendants do not address this basis for qualified immunity,whether the contours of the first amendment right springer violated were clearly established in.instead,the only argument the defendants make on appeal with respect to qualified immunity is that president springer took no action against a student publication,much less an action in response to a viewpoint espoused by a student publication and,as a result,she is entitled to qualified immunity.the argument that springer did not take action against the college voice based on its viewpoint is unconvincing for the reasons described in the previous section.
plaintiffs also argue that the student government defendants were state actors because they exercised a power traditionally within the exclusive prerogative of the state,jackson metro.edison,d see also blum yaretsky,d,or because their actions were inextricably interwoven with the actions of csi administrators,amidon student ass of the state of at albany,d,finding that student government clearly acts in concert with the state to create a forum for the exercise of first amendment rights.the sa determines the amount of the fee.the state collects it,enforces its payment,and turns it over to the sa.the sa distributes the money pursuant to state regulation and approval.these arguments,however,are belied in this case given present springer unilateral decision to overrule the serc order impounding the college voice.
we note that at oral argument,counsel for plaintiffs conceded that the only relief sought in this litigation is nominal damages.we do not decide at this time the significance of that concession with respect to the determination of attorney fees in light of arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,cir,and related cases.see,farrar hobby,d amato city of saratoga springs,cir.
