in this case,we are called upon to decide whether a municipal flow control regulation that does not place firms at a competitive disadvantage,regulate extraterritorially,or conflict with the regulatory requirements of any other jurisdiction nonetheless violates the dormant commerce clause.the municipal scheme at issue requires that the garbage generated by local households and businesses be delivered to facilities which are owned and operated by a public corporation,thereby preventing this trash from being processed at facilities.after processing,the trash is then delivered by a private contractor to a designated landfill site,or is reused or recycled.we decline to decide today whether these flow control ordinances impose a cognizable burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting the export of a locally generated article of commerce because we hold that any such burden would not be clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits of the flow control scheme.we conclude,therefore,that the challenged local ordinances do not violate the commerce clause.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,united haulers association,transfer systems,bliss enterprises,ken wittman sanitation,bristol trash removal,levitt commercial containers,and ingersoll pickup,plaintiffs filed this action pursuant to in the northern district of new york.they claim that ordinances regulating the collection,processing,transfer and disposal of solid waste enacted by the counties of oneida and herkimer violate the dormant aspect of the commerce clause and seek injunctive relief barring the enforcement of these ordinances,along with damages and attorneys fees.plaintiff united haulers association,is a new york corporation comprised of solid waste management companies.each of the remaining plaintiffs is a new york business entity that was a member of the united haulers association operating in oneida and herkimer counties at the time this suit was filed.
county of oneida and county of herkimer collectively,the counties enacted the challenged ordinances in.these flow control regulations collectively require all solid wastes and recyclables generated within these adjoining upstate new york counties to be delivered to one of several waste processing facilities owned by solid waste management authority the authority,a municipal corporation see oneida county local law of oneida law herkimer county local law of herkimer law.the authority charges a tipping fee for receiving this waste that is significantly higher than the fees charged on the open market elsewhere in new york state.
the counties have not excluded private commercial entities from other segments of the local market for waste disposal services.on the contrary,the flow control ordinances expressly allow any licensed private entity,whether local or,to collect solid wastes from area businesses and households for delivery to the authority processing facilities.oneida law herkimer law.private commercial entities also are involved in removing wastes from the authority facilities after processing.pursuant to its statutory powers,see pub.auth,the authority periodically selects a private hauler through an open bidding process to transport processed wastes and recyclables from the authority facilities for delivery elsewhere.the authority awards this delivery contract to the entity deemed to be the most responsive and responsible respondent demonstrating the requisite experience and skill in the necessary technologies,and proposing a plan that provides the most method of disposing of solid waste with maximum protection of human health and the environment.expert report of robert stavins.plaintiffs do not contend that firms have any unfair advantage in this bidding process.however,they do note that the authority most recent contract has resulted in the shipment of the counties waste to a landfill in new york state,and that the authority is currently in the process of constructing a landfill site to which all of the counties processed wastes will be delivered beginning in.see solid waste management authority,http last visited.plaintiffs assert that both of these developments further burden interstate commerce.
plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that the counties could create a public monopoly encompassing the entire waste management process,thereby displacing private firms altogether,without violating the commerce clause.see,usa recycling,town of babylon,cir.they nonetheless assert that,as long as private entities are permitted to collect garbage from customers,they may not be required to deliver that garbage to an facility,whether publicly or privately owned,as this restriction necessarily prevents them from using processing facilities outside the counties and thus diminishes the interstate trade in waste and waste disposal services 
the counties flow control regime already has been the subject of one appeal to this court.in the first installment,united haulers association solid waste management authority,cir united haulers i,we reviewed the district court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.the district court had found that the counties flow control ordinances,like those struck down by the supreme court in c a carbone town of clarkstown,d,discriminate in favor of a single,favored provider,and therefore had examined the ordinances under the heightened standard applied to discriminatory economic regulation.we reversed,holding that because the counties flow control ordinances direct solid waste exclusively to facilities owned by the authority,a public corporation,they do not favor local business interests and therefore are not discriminatory.united haulers i,at.we then remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the ordinances validity under the more permissive pike balancing test.see pike bruce church,d stating that w here a statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.in doing so,we expressed skepticism about the ultimate merits of plaintiffs challenge,noting that another panel had stated in dicta that the local interests that are served by consolidating garbage service in the hands of the,sanitation,reliable garbage service,cheaper service to in any event outweigh any arguable burdens placed on interstate commerce.united haulers i,at quoting usa recycling,at.
on remand,the parties conducted extensive discovery and then for summary judgment.the district court,aided by the thorough report and recommendation of magistrate judge david peebles,found that the counties flow control ordinances are constitutionally permissible.the district court observed that the challenged laws do not treat similarly situated and business interests differently,and found that they therefore do not impose any cognizable burden on interstate commerce.having reached this conclusion,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment jointly filed by the counties and the authority without attempting to assess the local benefits that the ordinances create or to weigh these benefits against the burden placed on interstate commerce.
on appeal,plaintiffs concede,as they did below,that the ordinances afford equal treatment to all commercial entities without regard to their location.however,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in focusing solely on whether the ordinances inflict disparate harm on businesses.they contend that the district court also should have considered whether the ordinances burden interstate commerce by accomplishing directly what the regulatory burdens found suspect by courts in other contexts do,prevent goods and services from flowing across internal political boundaries.
in response,the counties,the authority,and the state of new york,appearing as amicus curiae,reject plaintiffs contention that the flow control ordinances burden interstate commerce in any cognizable respect,given plaintiffs concessions that the ordinances do not disparately impact businesses or interfere with the regulatory regimes of other localities or states.in the alternative,they suggest that the environmental and public health benefits attributable to the ordinances far outweigh any incidental burden on interstate commerce that the ordinances might be found to impose.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.ford mcginnis,cir.in doing so,we focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law,drawing all necessary factual inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.id.
iii.discussion 
plaintiffs claim fails because even assuming,arguendo,that a burden on interstate commerce exists,it is far exceeded by the ordinances local benefits.that is,even if we were to agree with plaintiffs that the counties flow control ordinances impose a cognizable burden on interstate commerce by preventing the waste generated within the counties from being exported for processing,given the counties undoubted power to monopolize the local marketplace in waste disposal services,as well as the counties substantial interest in regulating waste disposal,we also would conclude that the commerce clause does not require us to invalidate these ordinances.
where a challenged state or local regulation does not entail patent discrimination against interstate commerce,we assess its validity under the pike standard.city of philadelphia new jersey,d.under pike,a challenged regulation will be upheld unless it places a burden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.usa recycling,at internal quotation marks omitted.as we have repeatedly emphasized,f or a state statute to run afoul of the pike standard,the statute,at a minimum,must impose a burden on interstate commerce that is qualitatively or quantitatively different from that imposed on intrastate commerce.mfrs.ass sorrell,cir nema citing,inter alia,automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir gary peake excavating town bd.of hancock,cir state trawlers ass jorling,cir usa recycling,at.to this point,we have recognized three instances in which a state or local regulation may impose a differential burden on interstate commerce when the regulation has a disparate impact on any commercial entity when the statute regulates commercial activity that takes place wholly beyond the state borders and when the challenged statute imposes a regulatory requirement inconsistent with those of other states.see id.at.
as noted above,plaintiffs concede that the challenged ordinances do not confer any economic advantage on any private entity.they likewise have not argued that the apply only to waste generated in oneida and herkimer in any respect with the regulatory requirements imposed by any other jurisdiction,or that they regulate conduct occurring outside the counties.plaintiffs thus,by their own admission,have failed to allege that the counties regulations have any effect that we have previously recognized as imposing a differential burden on interstate commerce.if we limited ourselves to this inquiry,as the district court did,and as the and new york state would have us do,we could swiftly affirm the decision of the district court that the flow control ordinances do not burden interstate commerce in any cognizable way.
undaunted,plaintiffs correctly note we have never held that the above list of recognized differential burdens is a closed set.see nema,at stating that several types of burdens would qualify as disparate to trigger pike balancing,and identifying regulatory conflicts and extraterritorial effect as two of them internal quotation marks omitted.see also pac.venison prods.smitch,cir noting the set of cognizable burdens on interstate commerce include s a lack of uniformity in state laws,extraterritorial regulation,and disparate impact on interests.they therefore propose two novel ways in which the counties ordinances might be seen to burden interstate commerce.first,they contend that interstate commerce is differentially burdened when the authority arranges for the delivery of the counties processed wastes to an disposal site.second,they suggest that the ordinances burden interstate commerce by creating a public monopoly in the processing of locally generated solid waste,thereby prohibiting private entities from exporting unprocessed trash and recyclables to other states.we address these arguments in turn.
the authority delivery contracts 
we easily dispose of plaintiffs claim that the counties exclusive contracts with private commercial entities for the removal and disposal of waste processed at the authority facilities impose a burden on interstate commerce because w hen the authority selects an disposal site for its waste,ipso facto interstate transportation of that waste stream ceases during the term of the contract.br.of.this argument fails because it ignores the distinction between a state actions in regulating commercial activity,which are limited by the dormant commerce clause,and its actions as a participant in the marketplace,which are not.see hughes alexandria scrap,d nothing in the purposes animating the commerce clause prohibits a state,in the absence of congressional action,from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.footnote omitted.
a governmental entity acts as a market regulator when it employs tools in pursuit of compliance that no private actor could wield,such as the threat of civil fines,criminal fines and incarceration.ssc town of smithtown,cir.if,on the other hand,the state is buying or selling goods as any private economic actor might,then it is engaging in market participation that by definition falls outside the scope of activity governed by the dormant commerce clause.usa recycling,at quotation marks omitted.moreover,it is well settled that a state may act as a market participant with respect to one portion of a program while operating as a market regulator in implementing another.accordingly,c ourts must evaluate separately each challenged activity of the state to determine whether it constitutes participation or regulation.id.at.
it is plain that the authority participates in the marketplace as any other economic actor would when,after having employed its regulatory powers to compel delivery of the waste generated within the counties to its processing facilities,it contracts with private parties to deliver its processed wastes to landfill sites that meet its requirements.indeed,plaintiffs very complaint is that the counties ordinances prevent them from doing business with firms that would process and dispose of the waste they collect in much the same way that the authority does.because the authority in entering into such contracts does not employ any uniquely governmental power or regulate any part of the market in which it is not a participant,the outcome of its bidding process simply is not a concern of the commerce clause.smithtown,at holding that a municipality may require a hauler with which it contracts to deliver waste to a particular disposal site.
we likewise reject plaintiffs claim that interstate commerce will be burdened when,upon the completion of a landfill site operated by the authority,the authority directs the counties wastes to this local site.unquestionably,a governmental entity may refrain from selling into the marketplace articles of commerce that lawfully have come into its possession.in doing so,it does not regulate commerce,and thus is not limited by the commerce clause.moreover,even if the authority ultimately hires private haulers to move the waste from one facility to another,it would still enter the market as a participant,not a regulator,and therefore would be free to operate in this vein free of limitations imposed by the commerce clause.see id.
this distinction between market participation and market regulation also brings into sharp relief the real issue raised by this appeal.since the commerce clause does not restrict the authority choices about how to dispose of the tras
