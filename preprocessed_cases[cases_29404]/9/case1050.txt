bliven commenced the present action in,alleging principally that,beginning in march,the individual defendants conspired to deny him the compensation to which he was entitled,in retaliation for his having made disfavored motions in approximately child protective and foster care cases in to compel the disclosure of the entire caserecord sic complaint maintained by the administration for children services acs see,id.he alleged that between march and september,nearly every voucher he submitted for public defender least regarding an acs or foster care agency judges hunt or salinitro were sic reduced by,all with no oral or written explanation as to why the voucher was reduced id,and that foreman and stanton told bliven that his vouchers were reduced because of his filing of the motions to compel disclosure of complete acs files see id.other vouchers submitted by bliven were reduced by substantially greater amounts see,id,the total by which bliven alleged he was underpaid was see id.
bliven also alleged that as a result of his complaining about the reductions of his vouchers,he was threatened that the judges would file a grievance against him.he alleged that he was thus forced to withdraw from the public defender panel,thereby losing of his usual income.see id.
the complaint sought from the city on a theory of breach of contract.see id.in addition,it sought,inter alia,million in compensatory damages from all of the defendants on each of seven causes of action on various theories,including hostile work environment see id,conspiracy to deprive bliven of the compensation to which he was entitled see id,conspiracy to deprive him of equal protection and to deprive persons charged with child neglect child abuse of effective assistance of counsel see id,denial of substantive and procedural due process see id,and failure of the city to train,investigate,and discipline the individual defendants see id.the complaint also sought million on a to counsel theory id,and sought injunctive relief a prohibiting the state and the city from requiring judicial approval of public defender vouchers,and b ordering that any such fee disputes instead be submitted to arbitration see,wherefore d.
b.the decisions of the district court 
in an opinion and order dated december,reported at d,the district court dismissed the complaint against the individual defendants sua sponte.as to bliven claims for monetary relief,the court concluded that those defendants were absolutely immune from liability for judicial acts because bliven does not allege that the judges were acting beyond their judicial capacity or in the clear absence of jurisdiction.id.at.
the court also dismissed bliven claims for injunctive relief against the individual defendants.it concluded that any such relief was unavailable because in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer judicial capacity,injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable,and bliven had failed to allege that a declaratory decree was violated or that declaratory relief was unavailable.id.at quoting federal courts improvement act of,c,stat,amending.
in a subsequent unpublished opinion and order dated june,the district court denied a motion by bliven to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the individual defendants,at the relevant times,were acting not in their judicial capacities but instead in their administrative ministerial capacities.accepting and adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge to whom the motion had been referred,which reasoned that all of the actions complained of by bliven and all of his contacts with the individual defendants had been in their judicial capacities,the district court concluded that bliven proposed amendment would be futile.
finally,in an opinion and order dated february,reported at d,the district court granted a motion to dismiss the federal claims against the city for failure to state a claim.the court ruled that the individual defendants were not municipal policymakers because a they were employees of the state,not the city,see id.at,and b their d eterminations of attorney compensation do not establish municipal policy,but only effectuate the statutory policy established by the state legislature to compensate appointed counsel,id.at.the court ruled that the complaint failed to state a claim for failure to train or supervise,because the city was not responsible for training or supervising the individual defendants as they are employees of the state.see id.at.having dismissed all of bliven federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claim against the city for breach of contract.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,bliven contends that the district court erred when it ruled that the individual defendants are entitled to judicial immunity,arguing that the individual defendants determinations of compensation for attorneys are,administrative decisions for which judicial defendants are not afforded absolute immunity.se
