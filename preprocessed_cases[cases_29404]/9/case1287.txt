this is yet another in a long line of cases evaluating when the procedural protections of the due process clause attach to disciplinary hearings in new york state prisons.because the plaintiff put forward sufficient evidence in resisting the defendants motion for summary judgment that would allow a reasonable jury to find that the punishment imposed as a result of his disciplinary hearing violated his liberty interests,and because the defendant failed to show that those liberty interests were not clearly established,we conclude that the district court baer,properly denied the defendant motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.
background 
this case arises from a dispute between a new york state prisoner,anthony palmer,and a corrections officer,defendant ronald goss.following a physical altercation between palmer and goss at the sing sing correctional substance of which is not before us,but the conflicting accounts of which can be found in the opinion and order of the district court,palmer goss,civ.hb,wl,dist.lexis,goss charged palmer with various infractions including harassment,refusing a direct order,and violent conduct.the,deputy superintendent paul richards,presided over a disciplinary hearing on those charges and found palmer guilty.as a penalty,richards sentenced palmer to days of confinement in keeplock and denied him access to packages,the commissary,and the telephone for days.thereafter,palmer served days in the special housing unit shu of a different prison,where he was not permitted any personal property including his personal food,clothing,and grooming and hygiene products,and he was placed in restraints whenever he was escorted outside his cell.also as an apparent consequence of his confinement in shu,the prison terminated palmer participation in the family reunion program,through which he had enjoyed extended visits with his wife and children in a trailer outside the prison cellblocks.
in the process of appealing richards decision,palmer realized that a portion of the tape of the the purportedly exculpatory testimony of a corrections officer named inaudible,although the testimony immediately before and after wyllie is clear.from this,palmer inferred that richards,realizing that palmer could not be convicted in light of wyllie testimony,intentionally erased wyllie testimony so that his verdict would sustain review.ultimately,because of the defective hearing tape,the state reversed richards findings and expunged the hearing outcome from palmer record.palmer,proceeding pro se,then brought suit in the district court pursuant to against goss,richards,and other defendants alleging,inter alia,that richards violated his due process rights by intentionally erasing the tape of the hearing.
the defendants moved for summary judgment.richards argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity because palmer confinement in shu for days was too brief to implicate a liberty interest protected by the due process clause and could not,therefore,trigger concomitant due process rights,and that in any event,palmer received all the process he was due.the district court denied richards motion,finding that the length of palmer sentence,when combined with his expulsion from the family reunion program,could amount to an atypical and significant hardship within the meaning of sandin conner,d,and that palmer should be given a further opportunity to develop the record of the conditions in shu relative to those in the general prison population.palmer,wl,at.the district court also found that a reasonable jury could conclude that richards intentionally erased the hearing tape,an act,the court stated,that would foreclose qualified immunity.id.at.the district court then appointed counsel to represent palmer,and richards appealed the district court decision.although the district court denied richards requests to stay proceedings pending his appeal,relying on the factual question of whether richards intentionally erased the hearing tape,see palmer goss,civ.hb,wl,dist.lexis,a panel of this court granted richards motion for a stay of proceedings in the district court and expedited richards appeal.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to the collateral order doctrine,under which a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment,and we review the district court decision de novo.savino city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for these purposes,we accept palmer version of the facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.see behrens pelletier,d johnson jones,d tellier fields,cir salim proulx,cir.therefore,notwithstanding the defendant argument that certain of palmer allegations were too speculative to create jury questions that survive summary judgment,we will not evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence marshaled in support of palmer specific factual allegations,see johnson,at.salim,at,including palmer contention that richards intentionally erased part of the tape of his disciplinary hearing 
the initial inquiry of our qualified immunity analysis is to determine whether any right of palmer was violated at all.saucier katz,d.palmer had no right to due process at his hearing unless a liberty interest was infringed as a result.scott albury,cir per curiam.a prisoner liberty interest is implicated by prison discipline,such as shu confinement,only if the discipline imposes an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,sandin conner,d see frazier coughlin,cir per curiam and we read sandin to require that we look to actual punishment in making this determination,scott,at.factors relevant to determining whether the plaintiff endured an atypical and significant hardship include the extent to which the conditions of the disciplinary segregation differ from other routine prison conditions and the duration of the disciplinary segregation imposed compared to discretionary confinement.wright coughlin,cir.
our cases make clear that duration is not the only relevant factor.the conditions of confinement are a distinct and equally important consideration in determining whether a confinement in shu rises to the level of atypical and severe hardship ortiz mcbride,cir per curiam.both the conditions and their duration must be considered,since especially harsh conditions endured for a brief interval and somewhat harsh conditions endured for a prolonged interval might both be atypical.sealey giltner,cir citation omitted.accordingly,and contrary to richards argument at summary judgment,we have explicitly avoided a bright line rule that a certain period of shu confinement automatically fails to implicate due process rights.see sims artuz,cir colon howard,cir.instead,our cases establish the following guidelines for use by district courts in determining whether a prisoner liberty interest was infringed.where the plaintiff was confined for an intermediate and days development of a detailed record of the conditions of the confinement relative to ordinary prison conditions is required.colon,at accord sims,at w e have characterized segregative sentences of days as relatively long,and thus necessitating specific articulation of factual findings before the district court could properly term the confinement atypical or insignificant.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in those situations,a district court must make a inquiry,sims,at,examining the actual circumstances of shu confinement in the case before it without relying on its familiarity with shu conditions in previous cases,kalwasinski morse,cir per curiam.disputes about conditions may not be resolved on summary judgment,wright,at,but where the conditions are undisputed,the sandin issue should be resolved by the court as a matter of law,colon,at sealey,at.
a confinement longer than an intermediate one,and under normal shu conditions,is a sufficient departure from the ordinary incidents of prison life to require procedural due process protections under sandin.colon,at finding that a prisoner
