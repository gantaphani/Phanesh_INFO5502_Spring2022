in this case,a disabled child was subject to discipline by his school district that entitled him to several administrative remedies under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,but the exhaustion of which would likely have prohibited him from graduating with his class and,incidently,kept him from participating in extracurricular activities.the principal question we are presented with,simply stated,is whether,under the circumstances of this case,he should have been excused from exhausting his administrative remedies under the idea and allowed to go directly into federal court so that,if successful,he could enjoin the school district disciplinary action without missing graduation.
plaintiff elzie deshawn coleman,a child with a disability,filed an action alleging that newburgh enlarged city school district,peter copeletti,individually and as principal of newburgh free academy high school nfa,and the board of education of the city of newburgh school district collectively,defendants violated his rights under the idea.in particular,coleman challenged the disciplinary process that led to his suspension from nfa and moved for a preliminary injunction ordering defendants to reinstate him immediately for the pendency of his administrative appeals.defendants,in opposing the motion,argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because coleman had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him under the idea.the district court for the southern district of new york stephen robinson,judge rejected defendants argument on the basis that exhaustion would be futile because coleman was scheduled to graduate less than two months following the disciplinary hearing and granted coleman motion in an opinion and order dated may.see coleman newburgh enlarged city sch,d.soon thereafter,the district court awarded coleman in attorneys fees as a prevailing party under the idea provision,i b.
on appeal,defendants contend,inter alia,that the district court award of attorneys fees was improper because its determination in coleman underlying action that exhaustion would be futile was error.we agree.the district court should have dismissed coleman complaint.we therefore reverse its award of attorneys fees.
coleman attended nfa as a disabled student pursuant to an individualized education program iep implemented under the idea.see d.on april,coleman,an accomplished high school track athlete,was involved in an altercation with another student at nfa.he was removed from the school,arrested by the newburgh police department and promptly suspended for five days pending a disciplinary hearing.
upon prior notice,the disciplinary hearing was held on april,before a designated hearing officer,edmund caplicki.caplicki found that a coleman had engaged in a physical altercation with another student on school grounds b a crowd grew as a result of that altercation c a series of subsequent altercations broke out in the school between other students and d intervention by the newburgh police department was required.based upon caplicki findings,annette saturnelli,the acting superintendent of schools,extended coleman suspension for five more days pending the committee on special education cse hearing as to whether coleman conduct was a manifestation of his disability and the penalty phase of the disciplinary hearing before caplicki.
on may,the cse held its manifestation hearing and determined that coleman conduct was not attributable to his disability.from this determination,coleman had a right to a series of administrative to a due process hearing,see k a,before an impartial hearing officer iho appointed by the local board of education,see j,and then to a second hearing before a state review officer sro of the new york education department,see k see also g.moreover,coleman enjoyed the right to have the due process hearing conducted on an expedited basis.k b t he state or local educational agency shall arrange for an expedited hearing,which shall occur within school days of the date the hearing is requested and shall result in a determination within school days after the hearing.c an expedited due process hearing shall be completed within business days of receipt of the request for a hearing,except in the event the iho grants a specific extension of time at the request of a party,and a decision shall be rendered within five business days after the last hearing date,but in no event later than calendar days after receipt of the request for a hearing,without exceptions or extensions.but these administrative reviews,as it turns out,were never pursued.
caplicki then heard the penalty phase of the disciplinary hearing and,on may,issued a written report and recommendation the report and recommendation that coleman be a suspended for the balance of the school year with the opportunity to receive home tutoring and instruction b allowed to attend summer school and return to school for the school year if additional credits were needed to earn his high school diploma and c placed on probationary status if he attended the summer program or returned to school during the school year.the same day,saturnelli wrote a letter to coleman in which she adopted the report and recommendation in full and ordered that coleman be suspended from school for the remainder of the school year and receive his iep in an interim alternative education setting iaes 
coleman sued defendants in new york state supreme court on april.his complaint sought a temporary restraining order to allow him to return to classes at nfa and participate in extracurricular activities.defendants removed coleman action to federal court.on may,coleman renewed his request for a temporary restraining order preliminary injunction,and the district court heard argument.
also on may,coleman appealed saturnelli guilt and penalty decisions to the board of education.the board upheld the actions of saturnelli and rejected coleman appeal to that body in its entirety.coleman counsel reported this development to the district court on may.
defendants moved to dismiss coleman complaint on the basis that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because coleman had failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies including,for instance,appealing further to an iho and then to an sro.the district court found that it had jurisdiction over the litigation because exhaustion would be futile under the,that before coleman could fully exhaust,he would miss graduating with his class and,incidentally,participating in extracurricular activities.the district court then granted coleman motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered that he immediately be reinstated at nfa and that he be allowed to attend classes and to participate in extracurricular activities.coleman,d at.defendants appealed to this court and sought an emergency stay.on june,a panel of this court denied the stay,finding that defendants failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.within a few weeks of that decision,on june,coleman graduated from nfa.it followed that defendants,by stipulation and agreement with coleman,withdrew their appeal as moot on july.
on july,days after defendants decision to withdraw their appeal,coleman moved in the district court pursuant to i b for attorneys fees in the amount of.defendants opposed the application through a.b and to dismiss the complaint.the district court awarded coleman in attorneys fees.this appeal followed.
discussion 
defendants argue that the district court erred in awarding attorneys fees to coleman because the complaint should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see,mcginty new york,cir it follows that where we lack subject matter jurisdiction,we also lack jurisdiction to award attorney fees.
i.the jurisdictional label 
before turning to the merits,we pause to consider whether this appeal should be characterized as one involving jurisdictional limitations.
the idea exhaustion requirement is grounded in i a,which provides a cause of action to those parties who are aggrieved by a final decision of either an impartial due process hearing officer,if the state does not have an appeals process,or the state educational agency,if it does.we have routinely stated that the idea exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional.see,polera bd.of educ.of newburgh enlarged city sch,cir a plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the idea deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction.murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir the plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedies ordinarily deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction over any idea claims.
recently,however,the supreme court has admonished lower courts to more carefully distinguish between jurisdictional rules and mandatory rules,see eberhart united states,d per curiam clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.quoting kontrick ryan,d,the latter being subject to waiver and forfeiture,see id.at.these rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them,but do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.after kontrick and eberhart,we have been equivocal in our discussion of the idea exhaustion requirement,acknowledging our statement in polera that the failure to exhaust idea administrative remedies deprive s a court of subject matter jurisdiction but also referring to the idea exhaustion requirements as the defendants defense,in a case where we contemplated,but did not decide,whether those requirements are subject to waiver.handberry thompson,cir citing polera,at see also paese hartford life accident ins,cir stating that we have yet to reach a clear conclusion on whether the failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the idea is an affirmative defense,not a jurisdictional bar citing handberry,at 
but we are not forced to decide whether our precedent,which labels the idea exhaustion requirement as a rule affecting subject matter jurisdiction rather than an inflexible rule that may be waived or forfeited,remains good law after kontrick and eberhart because there can be no claim of waiver or forfeiture here.defendants have consistently challenged the district court exhaustion ruling throughout this litigation.we took a similar position in united states,cir per curiam,where we noted that kontrick and eberhart cast doubt on our precedent that considers the time limits of fed.b as jurisdictional,but declined to revisit the question because the government had properly raised the untimely nature of defendant notice of appeal in its motion to dismiss in zhong united states dep t of justice,cir,however,we observed that eberhart provided reason for us to treat as not jurisdictional,though mandatory and hence waivable the requirement of issue exhaustion provided in d and decided to so hold because the question was determinative of the asylum case before us.
that defendants are challenging the district court exhaustion determination by way of an appeal from an award of attorneys fees does not impede our review of the issue.the idea provision limits judicial discretion to award attorney fees to any action or proceeding brought under this subsection.senatore,cir quoting e b,the predecessor to i b.the phrase brought under this subsection encompasses the administrative procedures and civil actions provided in i and requires an independent examination of whether the underlying action was properly brought,which in turn requires an assessment of whether the district court exhaustion determination was proper.we now turn to that question.
ii.exhaustion 
it is well settled that the idea requires an aggrieved party to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a civil action in federal or state court attica cent,cir.however,the exhaustion requirement does not apply in situations in which exhaustion would be futile.polera,at internal quotation omitted.to show futility,a plaintiff must demonstrate that adequate remedies are not reasonably available or that the wrongs alleged could not or would not have been corrected by resort to the administrative hearing process.bd.of educ.of rochester city sch,cir heldman sobol,cir.for relief to be adequate,it must give realistic protection to the claimed right.murphy,at internal quotation marks omitted.the burden of demonstrating futility rests with the party seeking to avoid the exhaustion requirement.polera,at.
the district court found that coleman had established that exhaustion would be futile.the district court reasoned that coleman would not have been able to exhaust the full administrative processes of the cse adverse manifestation determination by an iho and an the school year ended.as a result,coleman would have missed his graduation and been unable to participate in extracurricular activities,including track and field events.the district court believed that these circumstances meant that there were no adequate administrative remedies available.
we do not agree that the administrative processes available to coleman left him without an adequate remedy.the district court erred by focusing on the detriment coleman would have suffered on account of being removed from nfa and placed in an iaes until he graduated.the sole question was whether he had a right,under the idea,to be reinstated at nfa while the allegedly erroneous manifestation determination was reviewed.he did not.
to be sure,k f iii establishes a disabled child right to be returned to the school from which he or she was removed if the behavior that gave rise to the child violation of the school code of conduct is determined to be a manifestation of the child disability.and the procedural safeguards provided in the idea entitle t he parent of a child who disagrees with the manifestation determination to a hearing,k a see a,conducted on an expedited basis,k b c.however,an aggrieved child does not have the right to return to the school from which he or she has been removed while the administrative and judicial review process is underway.murphy,at section j the a student right to a stable learning environment during administrative and judicial review and,thus,if that right is threatened,an immediate appeal is necessary to give realistic protection to it internal quotation marks omitted.congress specifically spoke to this issue in k a,stating when an appeal of a manifestation determination has been requested the child shall remain in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer emphasis added.congress could have chosen,but did not,to permit the child to remain in his original school.in sum,while coleman had a right not to be removed from nfa based on an erroneous determination of no manifestation,he had no right to reinstatement while that determination was being reviewed.
as a broader matter,we are not persuaded that a disabled child has a right,under the idea,to graduate on a date certain or from a particular educational,the child original school rather than an iaes.the idea mandate is that all disabled children be given a free appropriate public education.a a see bd.of educ.rowley,d interpreting the predecessor statute to the idea.in fulfilling this mandate,there are no general time and manner requirements placed on the states other than those provided in the idea and created by the states.the state of new york has administrative processes consistent with these requirements.see coleman,d at describing administrative processes available to coleman see also walczak florida union free sch,cir describing the system new york has developed to meet its obligations under the idea and to implement its own policies regarding the education of disabled children.that the carrying out of these administrative processes may take some time,and in certain circumstances result in the child graduating in an iaes after his anticipated graduation date,does not equate to an inadequate remedy.polera,at r elief available mean s relief for the events,condition,or consequences of which the person complains,even if not necessarily relief of the kind the person prefers.internal quotation marks omitted.
coleman argues that because he was set to graduate in a few weeks,his case presented an emergency situation such that exhaustion would be futile.coleman reference to the term emergency situation finds its origins in the idea legislative history.the house report to the idea predecessor defined the parameters of the futility exception to include complaints that an emergency situation exists,the failure to take immediate action will adversely affect a child mental or physical health,sess.emphasis added.
coleman emergency situation argument is unpersuasive here.in the first place,it fails to address that the relief coleman with his not necessary to prevent the deprivation of a right protected under the idea.in any event,there was no showing that the delay that would have occurred in exhausting the administrative processes,which may have entailed his missing graduation on june and participation in certain school activities,would have affected coleman mental or physical health he does not even suggest as much.acceptance of coleman argument could lead district courts,following the suspension of a disabled student after an adverse manifestation determination,to bypass the idea exhaustion requirement altogether because any administrative remedy,while the student was attending the iaes,would be insufficient to correct the harm inflicted by missing out on such things as normal classroom time and extracurricular activities at the disabled student regular school.such a sweeping exception would undermine the idea statutory mandate for exhaustion.see polera,at.this is why other circuits have stated that the emergency situation exception is to be sparingly invoked.rose yeaw,cir quoting komninos upper saddle river bd.of,cir see also komninos,at m ere allegations by plaintiffs of irreversible harm will not be enough to excuse the completion of administrative proceedings.plaintiffs must provide a sufficient preliminary showing that the child will suffer serious and irreversible mental or physical damage,irremediable intellectual regression before the administrative process may be circumvented.that coleman was a superior athlete who was on the verge of graduating does not make his claim of an emergency situation more compelling.
accordingly,we conclude that,because the district court should have dismissed coleman complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies and erred in not doing so,it was also error for the district court to award coleman attorneys fees.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court award of attorneys fees.
i agree fully with the court opinion.i write separately to emphasize that i do not believe either kontrick ryan,d,or eberhart united states,d per curiam,raises any doubt as to our precedent that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over idea claims that are unexhausted and that do not meet one of the limited exceptions to the statute exhaustion requirement.
as the court notes,supra at,we have long treated the idea exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional.see,polera bd.of educ.of newburgh enlarged city sch,cir murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir taylor vermont dep t of,cir senatore,cir.the vast majority of other circuits to have considered the issue have done so as well.see,ellenberg new mexico military,cir fliess washoe county sch,cir unpublished decision babicz sch.bd.of broward county,cir per curiam christopher portsmouth sch,cir but see mosely bd.of educ.of city of chicago,cir.this is for good reason as explained more fully below,the idea,with few exceptions,does not provide prospective plaintiffs with a federal cause of action until the state review process has been completed.see i i.
neither kontrick nor eberhart calls this considerable body of case law into question.in kontrick,the supreme court held that in bankruptcy proceedings,the time limit pursuant to bankruptcy rule a for a creditor to file a complaint objecting to the debtor discharge is not jurisdictional,but rather is a rule that is subject to waiver and forfeiture.see at.the court reasoned that under the bankruptcy laws,congress provided that objections to discharges are c ore proceedings that are clearly within the jurisdiction of the federal courts,and that no statute curtails that jurisdiction by specifying a time limit for filing a complaint objecting to discharge.id.at.quoting b j.thus,rule a time limit does not affect the classes of cases falling within a court adjudicatory authority,subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
in eberhart,the supreme court followed kontrick in holding that the time limit for a defendant to file a motion for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure was not jurisdictional.see at.the court explained that rule,like bankruptcy rule a,is nothing more than an emphatic time prescription in a rule of court that regulates motion practice in an federal criminal district courts already possess subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate.id.at.quoting kontrick,at.in reaching its conclusion,the court stressed that c larity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases subject matter jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.id.at.quoting kontrick,at.
kontrick and eberhart thus counsel that where congress has provided courts with jurisdiction over the claim at issue,judicial rules can not be relied upon to abdicate that jurisdiction.see kontrick,at.only congress may determine a lower federal court jurisdiction i t is axiomatic that rules do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.quoting owen equip.erection kroger,d.in both cases,congress had clearly provided jurisdiction over the underlying objection to discharge and a federal criminal the time limitations that affected the processing of those actions were not dictated by statute in a way that could affect the existence of the underlying claims,but rather were a product of judicial rulemaking.this,then,is the critical distinction between a rule and a jurisdictional bar a rule does not affect the existence of the underlying claim.see also paese hartford life accident ins,cir noting that an exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional unless the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is essential to the existence of the claim,or to ripeness,and therefore to the presence of an article iii case or controversy internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
we have applied this principle in the exhaustion context in several recent cases.in richardson goord,cir per curiam,we held that the exhaustion requirement in the prison litigation reform act plra is a rule because the requirement affects a prisoner preexisting under different statutes such as thus exhaustion is not essential to the existence of the claim.id.at.similarly,in paese hartford life accident insurance,we found that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the employee retirement income security act erisa does not deprive courts of subject matter jurisdiction despite language in prior cases in this circuit suggesting otherwise because,inter alia,erisa contains no statutory exhaustion requirement rather,the requirement is purely a concept that ha s little or no bearing on the existence of a claim.at.in zhong united states department of justice,cir,we noted that the converse was true for exhaustion of administrative remedies in the immigration context.we explained that the immigration laws specify that courts of appeal may review only a final order of removal,d,which is a clearly jurisdictional requirement requiring that asylum cases be brought to the executive office for immigration review,an ij and the bia before they can be considered by courts of appeal.zhong,at.we went on to hold that exhaustion of issues in the immigration context is not a jurisdictional requirement because issue exhaustion,unlike exhaustion of remedies,is merely a rule not expressly mandated by the immigration laws.id.at.
applied here,these principles leave no doubt that the idea exhaust
