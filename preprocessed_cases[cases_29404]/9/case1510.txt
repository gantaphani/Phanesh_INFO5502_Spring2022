background 
sharp is serving a life term of imprisonment following his conviction for first degree murder.he was incarcerated at sci pittsburgh from september,to may.sharp was transferred to sci greene and was incarcerated there from may,to june,when he was transferred to sci dallas.
sci pittsburgh 
religious services offered and policies for requesting religious accommodations 
sci pittsburgh recognizes and accommodates several different religions and religious groups,namely christians,jews,and muslims.with respect to christianity,sci pittsburgh offers catholic,protestant,and jehovah witnesses services.as to islam,sci pittsburgh offers nation of islam,moorish science temple,and sunni muslim services.
an inmate practicing a religion not covered by the aforementioned groups may request an accommodation.dc administrative dc adm sets forth the doc policy for requesting recognition of a religion and obtaining services for that group.the version of dc adm that was in effect from march,until july,stated,in pertinent part,that 
requests to engage in religious practices which are not being accommodated by the doc,must be initiated by the inmate via an inmate religious accommodation request form the form shall be completed by the requesting inmate and submitted to the facility chaplaincy program director for review by appropriate staff.
the inmate religious accommodation request form,also known as dc,stated that i f more than one inmate is filing a request,each inmate must submit a form.if this is a group request,information must be submitted to the facility chaplaincy program director,who will compile information about the group request.after the inmate submits this form,the prison chaplain director must obtain publications from the faith group regarding the goals,beliefs and practices of that group.the chaplain then circulates a recommendation form to certain prison officials,each of whom makes a written recommendation as to whether the request should be granted or denied.the chaplain then forwards the prisoner request,the compiled religious information,and the staff recommendations to the administrator of religion and family services at the doc central office,who ultimately determines whether to approve or deny the request.
sharp incarceration and accommodation request at sci pittsburgh 
sharp is a member of the faith group known as ahlus sunnati wal,whose members are frequently referred to as sunni muslims.there are different subsets within the broader sunni muslim group.sharp identifies himself as a member of the habashi 
the islamic chaplains testified that muslims at the prison typically take part in jumah and taleem.jumah is a group prayer service held on fridays that every muslim is obligated to attend if possible.taleem is a religious study period that is generally held on a weekly basis though there is no religious obligation to attend.defendant tanko ibrahiym,the islamic chaplain at sci pittsburgh from to and a sunni muslim,led jumah services and taleem classes for sunni muslims at the prison.sharp regularly attended these services and classes.
at some point,sharp informed imam ibrahiym that he believed there were ideological differences between sharp habashi sect and the recognized sunni group at sci pittsburgh.sharp believed that the habashi could not be accommodated within the sunni muslim community at sci pittsburgh.imam ibrahiym disagreed with sharp assertion that the habashi were not being accommodated and advised that if sharp was a sunni muslim,as he claimed to be,then there was no reason why sharp could not attend the services and programs that were offered to the sunni muslims at sci pittsburgh.
on october,sharp,on behalf of a purported group of habashi members,submitted a typed document titled religious accommodation request for ahlus sunnati wal,requesting recognition and accommodation of the habashi sect.in particular,sharp sought space for separate jumah services and taleem classes on behalf of his purported group of inmates.although the document submitted was not the dc form required by dc adm,it contained similar substantive information.
imam ibrahiym discussed this group request with defendant father william terza,who was the facility chaplain program director and was responsible for overseeing the chaplaincy program at sci pittsburgh.father terza informed sharp that his request was improperly submitted because it did not include an individual request on the proper dc form,as required by dc adm.father terza told sharp that once he submitted the proper form,father terza would circulate it to the appropriate sci pittsburgh staff members for their recommendation and then forward it to the doc central office for a decision.the district court found that sharp never submitted the proper individual request form to father terza.
on november,a meeting was held between defendant mark krysevig,who was the deputy superintendent at sci pittsburgh,defendant rhoda winstead,who was the corrections classification program manager the ccpm at sci pittsburgh,imam ibrahiym,father terza and several inmates,including sharp,to discuss sci pittsburgh ramadan services.specifically,discussions were held to determine how ramadan,a muslim observance,would be accommodated among the various muslim groups and inmates who wished to participate.at this meeting,sharp again this time orally raised his request for a group accommodation of his habashi sect.
on november,sharp was placed in administrative custody,the restrictive housing unit because,according to defendants,sharp efforts to organize a separate religious group were creating a threat to institutional security.in particular,the prison officials found that sharp was a danger to others,that he was attempting to establish himself as the leader of a group of inmates,and that he threatened disruption and violence if his religious group was not recognized.defendants krysevig and william stickman,who was the deputy superintendent for facility management at sci pittsburgh,believed that sharp was more interested in placing himself in a leadership position over a group of inmates than obtaining a genuine religious accommodation.several inmates complained to krysevig that sharp was being disrespectful of their beliefs,and krysevig was concerned that these other inmates might retaliate against sharp.in sum,sharp was placed in administrative custody for fomenting unrest in group activity.
on december,sharp filed grievance no.pit the pittsburgh grievance questioning why no determination had been issued with respect to his group request for accommodation.on december,winstead denied the pittsburgh grievance in writing,stating,in pertinent part 
at the meeting you mention on november,it was verified that all staff mentioned received a copy of your proposal,sharp request for an accommodation.
in accordance with dc adm for religious accommodations,you were to submit the proper form requesting such an accommodation for you as an individual.any other inmates requesting an accommodation must be filed individually.your form should be forwarded to the chaplaincy coordinator.your form was improperly filed.
the sci pittsburgh defendants testified that sharp never submitted a form requesting religious accommodations for himself as an individual.sharp claims that he and other habashi members submitted handwritten,individual requests for accommodation to imam ibrahiym.imam ibrahiym trial testimony on this issue was,at best,unclear.imam ibrahiym testified that he never received a dc form from sharp or any other of the inmates that practice habashi.later,imam ibrahiym testified that he received written requests for accommodation from sharp,though the nature of these purported requests was unclear 
sharp appealed the denial of the pittsburgh grievance to defendant philip johnson,who was superintendent of sci pittsburgh.on january,johnson dismissed sharp appeal as untimely.
sharp further claims that,while he was in administrative custody,defendants proposed that he sign a behavioral modification contract that included a condition that he agree not to practice his religion in exchange for release into the general population.sci pittsburgh had a program review committee prc that would periodically meet with inmates confined to administrative custody and review their restricted status.defendants krysevig and joel dickson,who was the deputy superintendent at sci pittsburgh,were on sharp prc because the prc had serious reservations about releasing sharp into the general population absent modification of his behavior,the prc offered him the opportunity to agree to a behavioral modification contract.behavioral modification contracts were informal agreements between the institution and the inmate setting the terms of the inmate release from administrative custody.if the inmate fails to comply with the terms of the contract,he can be returned to administrative custody.the prc proposed a behavioral modification contract to sharp,the general terms of which were to include promises by sharp to cease fomenting unrest and to refrain from showing disrespect for the religious beliefs and practices of others,in exchange for release from administrative custody.sharp was to draft the specific language of the contract.both krysevig and dickson testified that the prc never made restrictions on sharp practice of his religion a condition of his release from administrative custody.sharp never submitted a draft to nor reached an agreement with the prc 
on may,the doc transferred sharp from sci pittsburgh to sci greene.
sci greene 
religious services offered and policies for requesting religious accommodations 
sci greene recognizes and accommodates several different religions and religious groups,namely christians,jews,native americans and muslims.with respect to christianity,sci greene offers catholic,protestant,jehovah witness and yoke fellowship services.as to islam,sci greene offers nation of islam and sunni services.effective july,the doc issued a revised dc adm.this revised policy stated,in pertinent part,that requests for religious accommodation were to be made as follows 
each inmate must use a dc,inmate religious accommodation request form to submit request for accommodation to the fcpd facility chaplaincy program director.
c.the inmate shall obtain written information from outside faith group,including any publications that describe the goals,beliefs,and practices of the group and supply this information to the fcpd for review.
d.the religious accommodation review committee shall review each inmate request for a religious accommodation within days of receipt and forward a recommendation to the affected regional deputy secretary.
e.the regional deputy secretary shall,within days of receiving the recommendation from the director of the bureau of inmate,the request and notify the director of the bureau of inmate services of the decision.
f.the director,bureau of inmate services shall,within days,inform the facility manager and the fcpd of the requesting facility of the determination and ensure copies of all final determinations are provided to all deputy secretaries and facility managers.the fcpd shall be responsible for informing the affected inmate of the outcome of request no later than working days from the date that the determination of is received.
g.if an inmate is informed by the fcpd that the request will not be accommodated,the inmate may then file a grievance in accordance with department policy dc,inmate grievances.grievances may only be submitted after the inmate has received notification of the decision on the requested accommodation.
emphasis in original.the doc did not make any substantive changes to the dc inmate religious accommodation request form.
defendant imam abu bakr muhammad,who was the muslim chaplain at sci greene,testified that he is a sunni muslim.imam muhammad provided taleem and led the weekly jumah prayer services for muslim inmates.
sharp incarceration and accommodation requests at sci greene 
on september,more than a year after being transferred to sci greene,sharp submitted a dc form requesting an individual religious accommodation of his habashi sect pursuant to dc adm sharp request sought,among other things,jumah services and taleem study,library space with books teaching his beliefs,prayer time at sunset during ramadan with others who shared his beliefs,an outside coordinator on a weekly basis,and a community bank account.
defendant father george moneck,who was the director of chaplaincy at sci greene,reviewed sharp request and recommended that the doc central office deny it.father moneck further commented on the form that sharp can practice his religion privately.sci greene can not accommodate another muslim sect.sharp is most welcome to join the sunni or the nation of islam communities.
father moneck circulated the vote form to the other staff members,who all recommended that sharp request be denied.defendant jean mears,who was sci greene ccpm,generally reviewed inmates requests for religious accommodation.mears,however,was unavailable when sharp request was circulated.michael bruno,who was sci greene acting ccpm at the time,reviewed and recommended that the doc central office deny sharp request.bruno is not a defendant in this action.stickman,who was promoted to superintendent at sci greene in generally participated in reviewing inmates requests for religious accommodation.stickman,however,was unavailable and did not participate in the review of sharp request.defendant paul stowitzky,who was sci greene acting superintendent at the time,reviewed and recommended that the doc central office deny sharp request 
father moneck submitted sharp request and the staff recommendations to the doc central office for a final determination.on december,the central office denied sharp request.father moneck informed sharp that his request was denied because he was able to attend existing islamic services or practice his religion privately in his cell.
on december,sharp submitted grievance the greene grievance,challenging the denial of his request for an accommodation.mears conducted the initial review and denied sharp grievance because,in her estimation,sharp was not denied the right to practice his faith or prohibited from maintaining his beliefs and praying in his cell.sharp appealed the denial of his grievance to stickman.this appeal was dismissed as untimely.sharp did not submit any other requests for religious accommodation at sci greene.
sharp complained to defendant brian coleman,who was the security captain at sci greene,about the content of certain sermons given by imam muhammad.sharp specifically complained that imam muhammad made derisive comments about the habashi sect and sharp in particular.coleman informed mears of sharp complaint.mears and father moneck reviewed the videotape of imam muhammad sermons and found nothing inflammatory.
sharp claimed that coleman ordered his cell to be searched in order to confiscate sharp religious materials.coleman denied this and testified that he had never ordered a search of an inmate cell specifically to retrieve religious materials.
sharp also claimed that imam muhammad would not allow him to participate in ramadan services unless sharp signed an agreement that he would not practice his habashi faith.imam muhammad denied this and testified that,although he did develop an agreement form for inmates wishing to participate in ramadan,this form did not require the inmates to profess or practice a specified religion 
on june,the doc transferred sharp from sci greene to sci dallas.
procedural background 
on november,sharp filed his complaint the case underwent years of motions practice and several of sharp claims were dismissed prior to trial sharp first amendment and rluipa actions proceeded to a bench trial before the magistrate judge.
on april,the magistrate judge entered judgment in favor of defendants and set forth her findings of fact and conclusions of law in a comprehensive memorandum.the magistrate judge found against sharp on the first amendment action because,among other things sharp failed to comply with the doc regulations regarding individualized submissions sci pittsburgh sharp failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that denial of his request had no rational connection to any legitimate penological interest sci greene the defendants did not have any personal involvement in the denial of sharp requests to support a action sci pittsburgh and greene and defendants were entitled to qualified immunity sci pittsburgh and greene.the magistrate judge found against sharp on the rluipa action because,among other things sharp was not entitled to any relief under the statute defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and in any event,sharp claim failed on the merits.
sharp appealed 
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
we apply a clearly erroneous standard when reviewing the findings of fact from a bench trial and a plenary standard to the conclusions of law.trustees of elevator indus.pension,health benefit educ.funds lutyk,cir.
a.the rluipa action 
sharp rluipa action sought injunctive relief and money damages against defendants in both their official and individual capacities.the magistrate judge held that sharp claims for injunctive relief were mooted by his transfer from sci pittsburgh and sci greene to sci dallas,and that rluipa does not permit recovery against defendants in their official or individual capacities.on appeal,sharp is challenging only the magistrate judge denial of his rluipa claim against defendants in their individual capacities.the issue of whether rluipa permits actions against state officials in their individual capacities is one of first impression for this court.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that rluipa does not permit such actions.
rluipa permits plaintiffs to obtain appropriate relief against a government.g overnment,in pertinent part,is defined as 
i a state,county,municipality,or other governmental entity created under the authority of a state 
ii any branch,department,agency,instrumentality,or official of an entity listed in clause i and 
ii any other person acting under color of state law.
a emphasis added.
sharp argues that the express language of rluipa,in particular the separate references to an official and any other person acting under color of state law,supports his position that congress intended the statute to permit relief against government employees in their individual capacities.in particular,sharp asserts that,by the any other person acting under color of state law language,congress purposefully tracked its language.sharp concludes that because permits recovery against a government employee in her individual capacity,so too must rluipa.sharp,however,overlooks the constitutional underpinnings of rluipa.in fact,the courts of appeals for the fourth,fifth,seventh and eleventh circuits the only circuits we are aware of that have addressed this issue in precedential opinions have rejected arguments similar to sharp and held that rluipa does not permit actions against government employees in their individual capacities.see,nelson miller,cir rendelman rouse,cir sossamon lone star state of texas,cir smith allen,cir,abrogated on other grounds,sossamon texas,abrogating smith as to the claim against government employees in their official capacities.
congress enacted rluipa pursuant to its spending power under article i of the constitution when congress enacts legislation pursuant to its spending power,it may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds and essentially create a contract between the federal government and the state recipient.smith,at see also nelson,at citing pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman.as a result,the statute may,as a condition of the funding,subject the grant recipient to liability in a private cause of action,but the spending power can not be used to subject individual defendants,such as state employees,to individual liability in a private cause of action.smith,at see also sossamon,at.
thus,of the funds,including individuals who are state officials,generally can not be subject to private liability for monetary damages.see,nelson,at stating that permitting suits against government officials in their individual capacity would raise serious questions regarding whether congress had exceeded its authority under the spending clause rendelman,at concluding that the rluipa definition of government did not clearly convey congress intent to impose a condition of individual liability pursuant to the spending clause sossamon,at congressional enactments pursuant to the spending clause do not themselves impose direct liability on a to the contract between the state and the federal government.smith,at drawing an analogy to the court title ix jurisprudence,which does not permit suits against individuals because title ix was enacted pursuant to the spending clause.
moreover,when congress desires to impose a condition under the spending clause,it is congress burden to affirmatively impose the condition in clear and unmistakable statutory terms.see,pennhurst state sch,at.in pennhurst state school hospital,the supreme court stated that 
t he legitimacy of congress power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the state voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the contract.there can,of course,be no knowing acceptance if a state is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.accordingly,if congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys,it must do so unambiguously.
id.internal citations omitted.
here,the magistrate judge correctly concluded that rluipa does not permit an action against defendants in their individual capacities.pennsylvania,not defendants,was the direct recipient of any federal funds.thus,rluipa can not impose direct liability on defendants,who were not parties to the contract created between pennsylvania and the federal government 
further,rluipa does not unambiguously signal congress intent to impose a condition of individual liability.the supreme court recent decision in sossamon texas which reviewed the related issue of whether states,by accepting federal funds,waived sovereign immunity under rluipa is particularly instructive.in sossamon,the court held that states did not consent to waive their sovereign immunity with respect to rluipa suits for damages against state employees in their official capacities.see.at.the court reasoned that rluipa authorization of appropriate relief against a government,a,was not an unequivocal expression of state consent to waive sovereign immunity to suits for money damages.id.at.rather,the court found rluipa appropriate relief language to be and ambiguous about what types of relief it includes,thereby precluding any finding that the states consented to waive sovereign immunity.id.at.similarly here,it can not be said that rluipa appropriate relief language unambiguously signaled congress intent to impose a condition of individual liability.
accordingly,the magistrate judge did not err when she entered judgment against sharp and for defendants on the rluipa action.
b.the first amendment action 
we will affirm the judgment for defendants on the first amendment action because the magistrate judge did not err in concluding that defendants were protected by qualified immunity discussed in greater detail infra section.the magistrate judge,however,did err in placing the burden on sharp to demonstrate that the denial of his request had no rational connection to any legitimate penological interest.although this error ultimately does not affect our holding,we discuss it next to provide clarity and avoid future confusion.
the magistrate judge erred in placing the burden of proof regarding the penological interest factor on sharp 
inmates do not completely forego their constitutional rights because of their incarcerated status,but those rights are necessarily limited.waterman farmer,cir citing jones prisoners labor union.an inmate retains his first amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.pell procunier,see also turner safley.
in turner,the supreme court recognized that subjecting the judgments of prison officials to a strict scrutiny analysis would impede the officials ability to anticipate and solve security and administrative problems.at.instead,the court found that when a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.id.the court listed four factors that are relevant in determining the reasonableness of a particular prison regulation there must be a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate,neutral governmental interest put forward to justify it the first turner factor whether the inmate has alternative means of exercising the right at issue the burden that the accommodation would impose on prison resources and whether any ready alternatives to the regulation exist that would fully accommodate the inmate rights at de minimis cost to valid penological objectives turner factors are the other turner factors.id.at quoting block rutherford,turner does not expressly state which party,the inmate or the prison,bears the burden of proving these factors.
after turner,we developed a analysis for determining whether a prison regulation is reasonably related to a penological interest.first,the prison has the burden of demonstrating the first turner factor.see waterman,at wolf ashcroft,cir.this burden is slight,and in certain instances,the connection may be a matter of common sense.wolf,at.second,if the prison meets its burden under the first turner factor,then we consider the other turner factors.see waterman,at wolf,at see also jones brown,cir.
after our decisions in waterman and wolf,the supreme court,in overton bazzetta,stated that where an inmate challenges regulations,the burden is not on the state to prove the validity of prison regulations but on the prisoner to disprove it.notably,overton did not expressly state that the burden for the first turner factor is on the inmate.
in jones brown,we interpreted overton as placing the ultimate burden of persuasion with regard to the reasonableness of a regulation on the inmate but continued to require that the prison put forward the legitimate governmental interest alleged to justify the regulation and demonstrate that the policy drafters could rationally have seen a connection between the policy and that interest.jones,at citations and quotation marks omitted alteration in original.other third circuit decisions have followed jones.see,fontroy beard,cir although the inmates bear the ultimate burden of showing that the doc new mail policy is unconstitutional,it is the doc officials burden to demonstrate that a rational connection exists between the policy and a legitimate penological interest.monroe beard,cir stating that the party challenging the regulation bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable,but that the prison must come forward with a legitimate interest justifying the regulation.
here,the magistrate judge erred in concluding that overton overruled,sub silentio,our jones line of cases that placed the burden for the first turner factor on the prison.see sharp johnson,civ,wl,at,placing the burden on sharp to negative every conceivable legitimate penological interest which might support defendants denial of the accommodation.first,overton burden language does not support the magistrate judge conclusion that the burdens of production and persuasion for all turner factors fall on those challenging the regulations.see,overton,at.in other words,overton did not tie its burden language to the turner factors rather,it made a statement about the general burden of persuasion where a prisoner is challenging a regulation.
second,jones is binding third circuit precedent,and it interpreted overton burden language to mean that the ultimate burden of persuasion not the burden to prove the first turner factor is on the inmate.jones,at.in fact,the supreme court plurality opinion in beard banks,banks supports jones interpretation of overton.in banks,an inmate challenged the prison policy of restricting certain periodicals and photographs.banks,citing overton,stated that the prisoner bears the burden of persuasion when he is challenging a regulation,at,and that turner requires prison authorities to show more than a formalistic logical connection between a regulation and a penological objective.at 
third,contrary to defendants assertion,we see no internal inconsistency in our jurisprudence on the placement of the burden for the first turner factor.in newman beard,a case cited by defendants,we upheld the dismissal of the inmate first amendment claim on a b motion because the inmate did not allege that the regulation at issue served no legitimate penological objectives or was not reasonably related to rehabilitation,cir.newman involved a pleading deficiency,not a determination as to the burden of proof at trial.
in williams morton,the other case cited by defendants for the proposition that our jurisprudence is inconsistent,we granted summary judgment for the prison officials and stated that the inmates have the burden of disproving the validity of the regulation,cir.this is essentially the same burden statement set forth in overton,which we interpreted in jones to mean the general burden of persuasion.in fact,the prison administrators in williams set forth a number of legitimate penological interests to support their regulation.see,at listing simplified food service,prison security,and budgetary constraints as legitimate penological interests supporting the prison refusal to serve halal meat.neither newman nor williams stated that they were deviating from the established third circuit precedent set forth in jones and its progeny.we are satisfied that our jurisprudence on this issue is consistent.
finally,policy concerns favor placing the burden of the first turner factor on prison officials.according to the magistrate judge,for sharp to meet his burden of proving the first turner factor,he would have to accomplish the herculean task of negating every conceivable legitimate penological interest which might support the denial of his accommodation.defendants argue that a prisoner seeking a religious accommodation would merely have to show no impact on security,orderly administration of the prison,or expenditures.defendants,however,ignore the fact that within these three broad categories are numerous subcategories of potential penological interests that an inmate would also have to negate,the interests within expenditures would include additional guard,purchase of religious books,space concerns within the library and prayer areas,additional chaplain expenses,and potential speaker fees.placing this burden on prisoners unnecessarily creates inefficiencies and would invite speculation into the often subjective motivations of prison officials.consequently,policy implications favor placing the burden on the prison officials.
accordingly,the magistrate judge erred in placing the burden for the first turner factor on sharp.this error,however,was not fatal to the judgment on the first amendment action because defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.
qualified immunity 
as an initial matter,the magistrate judge did not err in determining that defendants did not waive their qualified immunity defense.we review a lower court decision regarding the waiver of an affirmative defense f
