are union representatives of police officers employed by the new york city police department nypd or department.they brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge challenging the constitutionality of an nypd policy that requires that a breathalyzer measures the amount of alcohol in the administered to an nypd officer immediately after he or she causes injury or death as a result of firing his or her gun.plaintiffs moved in the district court to preliminarily enjoin the enforcement of the breathalyzer policy,and the district court denied the motion.plaintiffs now appeal the denial of the preliminary injunction.we affirm.
background 
in november,undercover nypd officers in queens,new york,shot and killed a man named sean bell,prompting intense and widespread criticism from the public.in the wake of the bell shooting,the commissioner of the nypd appointed a committee to review the department undercover operations and to make recommendations for improvements.the committee was chaired by chief charles campisi campisi,the head of the internal affairs bureau of the nypd,which is charged with investigating police misconduct.
the committee recommended,among other things,that a breathalyzer test be administered to any officer who fires his or her weapon and causes death or injury.the police commissioner accepted this suggestion and,in september,promulgated interim order,which established the breathalyzer policy at issue in this action.
the breathalyzer policy applies when any nypd officer on or off duty,is involved in a firearms discharge within new york city which results in injury to or death of a person.interim order.the policy first requires that senior nypd officials be notified of a shooting,including officials from the internal affairs bureau.the policy then requires that a portable breathalyzer test be administered in a private setting to the uniformed member s of the service who discharged a firearm.id.at.if the portable breathalyzer test yields a reading of level of or legal limit for driving an automobile in new york officer in question must be transported to an internal affairs bureau testing facility where he or she will be given a second test on a more accurate intoxilyzer machine.id.
plaintiffs brought this action against the city of new york,the nypd,and police commissioner raymond kelly collectively,defendants,claiming that the breathalyzer policy violates the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the enforcement of the breathalyzer policy,and the district court denied the motion.plaintiffs could not,the district court concluded,demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because the breathalyzer policy withstood fourth amendment scrutiny under the special needs doctrine.see palladino city of,civ,wl.
plaintiffs brought this timely interlocutory appeal challenging the district court denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction see a t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from i nterlocutory orders of the district courts refusing injunctions.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in evaluating plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction under a standard,rather than the less rigorous standard.plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction because,in plaintiffs view,the breathalyzer program is not reasonable under the special needs doctrine.
i.the district court correctly applied the standard 
we have recognized two separate standards for whether a district court may grant a preliminary injunction 
in general,the district court may grant a preliminary injunction if the moving party establishes irreparable harm and either a a likelihood of success on the merits,or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them fair ground for litigation,plus a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party.
plaza health,perales,cir citation omitted.nevertheless,we have held that 
where the moving party seeks to stay governmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,the district court should not apply the less rigorous standard and should not grant the injunction unless the moving party establishes,along with irreparable injury,a likelihood that he will succeed on the merits of his claim.
id.emphasis added accord,alleyne state educ.dep t,cir.here,plaintiffs argue that the less rigorous standard should apply to their motion for a preliminary injunction,whereas defendants argue that the more rigorous standard should apply.the district court applied the standard,and we agree that that was the correct standard to apply in the circumstances presented here.
first,as discussed in more detail below,the breathalyzer program qualifies as governmental action taken in the public interest,plaza health,at,because it was designed,among other things,to discourage officers from using their firearms while is plainly a matter of public concern.second,the breathalyzer program constitutes government action taken pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,because the nypd commissioner promulgated interim order under his statutory authority to regulate the police force.see city charter providing that the commissioner is the chief executive officer of the police force and shall have cognizance and control of the government,administration,disposition and discipline of the department,and of the police force of the department and shall be chargeable with and responsible for the execution of all laws and the rules and regulations of the department see also city admin.code providing that the commissioner has broad discretion over the discipline of the police force.accordingly,the district court correctly held that plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits in order to secure a preliminary injunction in this action.plaza health,at.
ii.the district court denial of the preliminary injunction was not an abuse of discretion 
we review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see,alleyne,at.a district court has abused its discretion if it has based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir internal quotation marks omitted united states hasan,cir explaining abuse of discretion.
the parties do not dispute that,assuming the breathalyzer program violates the fourth amendment,plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm.see,covino patrissi,cir concluding that a possible deprivation of constitutional rights sufficiently demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm.it is also uncontested that the breathalyzer tests at issue here constitute searches and are therefore subject to the strictures of the fourth amendment.see,skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d.
the principal question,therefore,is whether plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.plaza health,at.that question,in turn,depends on whether,on this record,the breathalyzer program is not reasonable under the fourth amendment.
the fourth amendment requires that searches and seizures be reasonable,and a search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.city of indianapolis edmond,d.nevertheless,the supreme court has upheld certain regimes of suspicionless searches where the program was designed to serve special needs,beyond the normal need for law enforcement.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states amerson,cir summarizing the recent case law of the supreme court and this circuit addressing the special needs doctrine.
a program or general scheme of searches qualifies for treatment under the special needs doctrine only if the program primary purpose is not a general interest in crime control.edmond,at.accord ferguson city of charleston,d holding that the special needs doctrine does not apply to searches whose immediate objective is to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes nicholas goord,cir clarifying that the special needs doctrine applies only when the searches serve as their immediate purpose an objective distinct from the ordinary evidence gathering associated with crime investigation.
thus,in order to determine whether the special needs doctrine applies,a court must conduct an inquiry into purpose at the programmatic level.edmond,at.in ordinary,probable cause fourth amendment analysis,a court does not investigate the purpose behind a search,as an individual officer subjective intentions are irrelevant to the search fourth amendment validity.id.at.quoting whren united states,d.but in the context of the special needs doctrine,a court must consider the programmatic purpose of the searches at issue,applying the special needs doctrine only if the primary programmatic purpose of the searches is unrelated to the government general interest in crime control.id.at.
if the court makes such a is,if the court finds that the primary purpose of a program of searches is a special need and not a general interest in crime court must then conduct a inquiry into the reasonableness of the program,weighing the special need against the privacy interest advanced.amerson,at quoting cassidy chertoff,cir.that task is accomplished by means of a balancing test that is based on an examination of three factors the nature of the privacy interest involved the character and degree of the governmental intrusion and the nature and immediacy of the government needs,and the efficacy of its policy in addressing those needs.id.at quoting cassidy,at see also illinois lidster,d.the program of searches passes constitutional muster if it is reasonable under that balancing test.amerson,at.
a.the district court properly applied the special needs doctrine 
plaintiffs argue that the special needs doctrine should not apply to the breathalyzer policy at issue here because the policy primary purpose is furthering the nypd general interest in crime control.edmond,at.defendants dispute that claim and argue that the primary purpose of the breathalyzer policy is unrelated to crime control.
the record shows that the breathalyzer policy has multiple purposes.some of the policy purposes are related to special needs apart from the nypd general interest in crime control,but one of its purposes is directly related to the nypd role as an investigator of crimes 
in opposition to plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,defendants submitted notably an affidavit of campisi,the chair of the committee that recommended the breathalyzer that the breathalyzer policy was designed to address several issues unrelated to crime control.first,the nypd conducts a detailed administrative review every time an officer fires his or her gun,and the breathalyzer program facilitates that review.to that end,it ensures that an officer who fires his or her gun while clear violation of nypd be quickly disciplined or removed from duty.that aim is not related to crime control it is related to personnel management.the point is not to prosecute the offending officers but to remove them from duty or to impose on them internal,sanctions.
the breathalyzer program also operates as a deterrent to officers who may consider carrying their firearms while under the influence of alcohol.the nypd acknowledges that some of its officers have alcohol problems,and the nypd requires its officers to take precautions to avoid carrying their firearms into situations in which they may become intoxicated.thus,the breathalyzer policy is designed to convey to nypd officers the message that firearms incidents are likely to be discovered,providing an extra incentive to the officers to follow the nypd regulations regarding firearms and alcohol.here again,the nypd interest is not in crime control but in personnel management the breathalyzer program,in this respect,is more concerned with encouraging officers to follow the nypd internal safety policies than with prosecuting nypd officers who violate the law.in this sense,this case very much resembles skinner railway labor executives association,d upholding drug tests of railway employees immediately following serious train accidents in order to discipline those employees involved in the accident who had tested positive for drug use.
another purpose of the breathalyzer from crime promoting the nypd reputation among new york city residents.there is no dispute that the breathalyzer program was put in place in response to the shooting of sean bell,a widely publicized incident that generated criticism of the nypd by some members of the public.in this context,the breathalyzer program is an effort to promote public confidence in the nypd by showing the public that the nypd takes seriously its policies regarding alcohol and firearms.moreover,when an officer fires his or her gun while not under the influence of alcohol,a breathalyzer test assures the public that the officer was fit for duty when he or she chose to fire.here,the nypd interest is in maintaining strong community relations,not in crime control.
nevertheless,even though the record shows that several of the purposes of the breathalyzer program are unrelated to crime control,the record also shows that one of the program purposes is directly related to crime control.the nypd acknowledges that it treats every shooting involving an officer as a potential crime and that the breathalyzer results could be used as evidence in a criminal investigation of the officer who was tested.in other words,to the extent that a police officer commits a crime by firing his or her gun,the nypd is charged with investigating that crime,and the breathalyzer program is meant to be one investigatory tool at the nypd disposal.
there are,therefore,multiple purposes of the breathalyzer unrelated to crime control and one directly related to crime the critical question in determining whether the special needs doctrine applies is whether the nypd general interest in crime control is the policy primary purpose.edmond,at.emphasis added.
the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to show a likelihood that they could prove that the nypd general interest in crime control is the primary purpose of the breathalyzer policy.in the district court words,plaintiffs have proffered no evidence that interim order is a regulation primarily concerned with law enforcement,nor have plaintiffs shown that a primary purpose of the regulation is to generate evidence for prosecution.palladino,wl,at.we hold that the district court did not err in reaching that conclusion.
we also hold that,having found that the primary purpose of the breathalyzer policy was not crime control,the district court correctly applied the special needs doctrine to evaluate the policy.here we must clarify one aspect of law surrounding the special needs doctrine the special needs doctrine applies to any program of searches whose primary purpose is a government interest other than crime control,edmond,at,and the mere fact that crime control is one not the primary a program of searches does not bar the application of the special needs doctrine.
that conclusion,we think,derives naturally from prior case law.for example,in michigan department of state police sitz,d,the supreme court upheld highway sobriety checkpoints whose primary purpose was reducing the immediate hazard posed by the presence of drunk drivers on the highways,edmond,at.we have no doubt,however,that aiding criminal prosecutions of drunk drivers was another purpose of the checkpoints.it was simply not the checkpoints primary purpose.likewise,in united states,d,the supreme court upheld border patrol checkpoints whose primary purpose was intercept ing illegal aliens and promoting the government interests in policing the nation borders,edmond,at.nonetheless,aiding criminal prosecutions of smugglers of illegal immigrants was,we think,one purpose of the boarder patrol checkpoints.it was simply not the checkpoints primary purpose.and in cassidy,this circuit upheld baggage screening procedures whose primary purpose was to detect and deter a potential
