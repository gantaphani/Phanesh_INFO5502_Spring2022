plaintiffs are several hundred pilots who were employed by the pan american world airways,pan am.they were hired by delta air lines,delta pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the two airlines.the pilots filed an age discrimination action in new york state supreme court challenging three specific terms of their employment with delta.delta removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,and eventually filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted delta motion,finding that plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,and dismissed plaintiffs complaint.plaintiffs now appeal.
we hold that,while the district court erroneously concluded that plaintiffs had not met their prima facie burden,summary judgment for delta was nevertheless appropriate because plaintiffs adduced no evidence that delta legitimate explanations for each of the challenged employment terms were false.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
this age discrimination action against delta has an unlikely origin,rising,as it does,from the ashes of the bankruptcy of pan am.in january,pan am finally succumbed to two years of crushing financial pressures caused by the bombing of pan am flight over lockerbie,scotland,and the dismal economic conditions that followed.seeking protection from its creditors,pan am filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
in its attempt to hammer out a reorganization plan,pan am contemplated the sale of some or all of its assets.by the early spring of,pan am was actively shopping its assets to its competitors.pan am representatives met with several senior officers of delta to pitch pan am assets.included in pan am written presentation was a chart demonstrating that pan am expected half of its pilot force to retire within five years,compared to only about at delta.presumably,this was viewed as a selling point because it anticipated a reduced cost structure down the road for whoever purchased pan am assets.shortly after that meeting,delta began a due diligence campaign to evaluate the pan am assets.
the due diligence operation was headed up by delta vice president of flight operations,harry alger.alger quickly concluded that pan am pilot retirement projections were too rosy,due,at least in part,to the bid down system that pan am employed.a commercial airline cockpit crew includes a captain,a first officer also known as a,and,usually,a flight engineer also known as a second officer.the federal aviation administration faa requires that captains and first officers retire from those positions upon reaching the age of.a bid down system allows captains who have reached the mandatory retirement age to bid down and continue to fly as flight engineers,a cockpit position that has no retirement age.in,delta,by comparison,did not permit captains and first officers over the age of to bid down for flight engineer positions,although it did permit them to hold ground positions with the airline.it was true that pan am employed many pilots approaching the age of,but alger believed that few of them would,in fact,retire,surmising most would simply bid down for flight engineer positions and stay on the payroll.
in may,alger reported his conclusion to his supervisor,rex mcclelland.mcclelland notes of the conversation state that pan am is burdened with a bid down system and has several aged flight engineers,some in their and one in particular,age plus born in.in other undated notes,alger denigrated the pan am personnel as a contaminated workforce especially since.he further noted that pilots were over age and four were over age.alger concluded that of the pan am workforce would not retire until as pan am had advertised.in another set of undated handwritten notes,alger,ruminating over the potential labor conflicts that could emerge out of the integration of pan am personnel,wrote,long term potential for labor strife put here after the bad apples have long since retired.
despite this apparent unhappiness with the age of pan am cockpit personnel,delta continued to pursue the acquisition of pan am assets.by july,delta had agreed in principle to pay million for pan am profitable transatlantic routes,the pan am shuttle,which offered hourly service between boston,new york and washington,and the aircraft which flew those routes.delta competitor airlines quickly launched a bidding war that escalated the price of the pan am assets dramatically.on july,delta entered into an asset purchase agreement apa with pan am whereby delta would pay million in cash and would assume certain pan am liabilities including million in aircraft mortgages and up to million of previously issued pan am passenger tickets on the purchased routes.the apa also provided that delta would offer permanent employment to at least pan am employees,including at least of pan am approximately pilots.however,the apa specifically stated that,buyer delta will determine in its sole discretion the terms and conditions of the pan am employees employment.on august,the deal was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.see pan am delta air lines.
the apa set up a procedure whereby delta would first close on the shuttle assets,and then on the pan am transatlantic operations shortly thereafter.delta targeted september,for the closing of the shuttle acquisition and november,for all remaining aspects of the apa.
additionally,delta management decided that it wanted the acquisition to be a turnkey operation,ownership of the assets would be transferred from pan am to delta without any disruption in service.thus,the shuttle,which would,on august,be a pan am operation,would become,on september,a fully functioning delta operation.this turnkey feature would eliminate the necessity for ticket refunds and minimize passenger alienation.delta,however,needed to overcome several obstacles before it could meet these objectives.the most formidable was the integration of pan am pilots into the delta pilot seniority list.
seniority integration methodology 
the apa required delta to hire at least pan am pilots.as a practical quite apart from the needed to hire pan am pilots to fly the newly acquired transatlantic routes.this was because pan am transatlantic routes were flown primarily with airbus aircraft,a widebody jet.since the makes voyages with only two engines,the faa mandates that pilots of that aircraft receive special training addressing the particular safety concerns presented.delta had not owned any,and thus none of its pilots were qualified to fly that aircraft.therefore,in order to meet its turnkey objectives,delta needed to hire pan am pilots who were qualified on the.
delta had purchased,in the transatlantic routes,the cream of the pan am crop and the pilots who flew those routes were among the most senior at pan am.for commercial airline pilots,seniority is everything.airlines maintain seniority lists ranking each of their pilots by their length of service for the particular airline.each month,to obtain work assignments,pilots bid for particular positions captain,first officer,second officer,on particular aircraft,flying particular routes out of particular airports,some more desirable than others.assignments are by seniority.
the seniority status of delta pilots was protected in the collective bargaining agreement delta had with the pilots labor union,the air line pilots association alpa as is the custom in the airline industry,that agreement required delta to place newly hired pilots at the bottom of delta seniority list,regardless of the length of cockpit experience the newly hired pilot may have had with other airlines.for this reason,pilots typically spend their entire careers with a single airline the switching costs for senior pilots are too high.however,the senior pan am pilots that delta needed made it clear that they would not leave pan am,even if it was in bankruptcy,if they were to be cast down to the bottom of the delta pilot seniority list.thus,to close the apa and meet its turnkey objectives,delta had to negotiate a concession from alpa that would amend the collective bargaining agreement to let delta integrate the pan am pilots into the delta seniority list.
the existing delta pilots had to protect their own turf.they were understandably concerned that the apa and the integration of pan am pilots would dilute their own status on the delta seniority list.after extensive analysis of the impact of various integration methodologies,delta and alpa eventually agreed on a modified status ratio methodology that would spread pan am pilots equitably throughout delta seniority list.
the starting point for the integration was the position held by the most senior delta pilot of whatever aircraft was deemed to be most nearly equivalent to the.delta deemed its boeing to be most equivalent to the because both were aircraft,although the was not cleared for voyages.delta most senior pilot occupied spot.thereafter,the methodology separately integrated the pan am captains,first officers and flight engineers,according to a ratio based on the number of comparable positions expected to exist at delta,in the absence of the apa,as of the end of thus,the formula called for dividing the number of delta captain positions at captain level and below anticipated to exist as of the end of is,the number of pan am captains eventually hired by.this resulted in a ratio of approximately twelve to one.thus,one pan am captain was integrated after every twelve spots beneath,and so on.after all the pan am captains had been integrated,the delta first officers and flight engineers were then ratioed with their acquired pan am counterparts,resulting in one pan am position being created after each ten or eleven delta positions throughout the remainder of the seniority list.
while the modified status ratio methodology gave the acquired pan am pilots enhanced bidding seniority new hires,it also resulted in placing many former pan am pilots in spots below delta pilots with less cockpit experience.thus,once they moved over to delta,several pan am pilots were relegated to cockpit positions,aircraft,and routes less desirable than those they had flown at pan am.for example,some pan am pilots found themselves flying in positions junior to pilots who had been with delta their entire career.however,the pan am pilots were integrated in seniority is,within the integrated seniority list,and thus,pan am pilots maintained their seniority relative to other pan am pilots.
on august,delta and alpa entered into a supplemental collective bargaining agreement authorizing delta to implement the modified status ratio methodology to integrate the pan am pilots into the delta seniority list on november,the same day that the final aspects of the acquisition were scheduled to close.
immediately after the execution of the supplemental collective bargaining agreement,delta began to offer employment to qualified pan am pilots according to their relative seniority on the pan am seniority list,ultimately hiring pan am cockpit personnel.in addition to the integration methodology,delta set two other terms of employment for the pan am pilots that are at issue in this case a service requirement for fully paid medical benefits and a pay scale that increased pay rates from pan am levels to delta levels gradually over three years.
medical benefits 
years ago,delta management had instituted a service requirement before delta would pay the full cost of a employee medical insurance premiums.the service requirement was eventually applied to delta pilots when delta and alpa entered into a collective bargaining agreement in october.however,in august,the service requirement was waived to exempt all pilots who were on the delta seniority list as of august,and had reached age on or before january.
because the pan am pilots were not integrated into the seniority list until november,none of them qualified for this grandfather clause.as discussed above,at the time of the apa,delta did not permit its captains and first officers to bid down for flight engineer positions after they had reached the retirement age of.thus,any pan am pilots who were over at the time of the apa would not be able to qualify for fully paid medical benefits unless they were willing to accept employment in a ground position after they turned.
pay scale disparity 
due to pan am extreme financial distress when the apa deal was struck most pan am employees were earning significantly less than their delta counterparts,and the pilots were no exception.when delta offered employment to the pan am pilots,it did so at their pan am pay rates with scheduled incremental increases to parity with delta pay scale spread out over three years.delta pilot pension benefits were calculated based upon the pilot final average earnings defined as the average of the best months earnings over the final ten years of employment.thus,by not immediately jumping all pan am employees up to the delta pay scale,the pan am pilots who retired within six years of the closure of the transaction would receive a reduced pension benefit a similarly situated delta pilot.
eventually,pan am pilots accepted delta offer of employment.because delta offered positions according to pan am seniority list,delta ended up hiring a very senior group of pilots.approximately of the pan am pilots hired by delta were age or older and were age or older.the acquisition of the shuttle assets closed on september,the remainder of the apa closed on november,and delta accomplished its turnkey objectives.pan am,on the other hand,ceased all operations in december,and one of the most venerable names in american aviation was liquidated shortly thereafter,leaving thousands of pan am pilots and employees not hired by delta jobless.
procedural history 
in,plaintiffs,former pan am pilots and flight engineers who were hired by delta,filed this suit in new york state supreme court alleging violations of the new york state human rights law,exec.law state hrl and the new york city human rights law,city admin.code a,c,city hrl.they alleged that delta had discriminated against them based upon their age by implementing the seniority list integration methodology,the service requirement for full medical benefits and the period of pay disparity.more specifically,plaintiffs alleged that delta knew it was hiring a group of pan am pilots that was,by and large,very senior,and that delta crafted the terms of employment with the specific intent of prejudicing them their largely younger delta counterparts.
delta removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,on the ground that plaintiffs claims arose under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,insofar as the remedies sought by the plaintiffs required the modification of a medical benefits plan.once in federal court,delta quickly moved for dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the claims therein were preempted by erisa and the airline deregulation act,ada,or alternatively,for summary judgment.
in may,judge baer granted delta motion to dismiss,finding that plaintiffs state law claims were preempted by the ada.see delta air lines.the district court did not at that time reach delta other preemption arguments or the motion for summary judgment.the plaintiffs timely appealed to this court.on that appeal,delta argued that,as a jurisdictional matter,plaintiffs claims were preempted by the railway labor act,et rla.we reversed judge baer decision based on the ada,declining to rule on delta new rla argument.we remanded to the district court for consideration of the additional preemption arguments and delta motion for summary judgment.see delta air lines,cir.
on remand,judge baer,rejecting delta remaining preemption arguments,denied its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see delta air lines,civ.hb,wl.
finally,in october,judge baer granted delta motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims on the merits.see delta air lines,civ.hb,wl.judge baer ruled that plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination as to any of the three challenged terms of employment.see id.at.plaintiffs now appeal that order.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see weinstock columbia,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.a motion for summary judgment must be rejected if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.when making this determination,the court must view the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see weinstock,at.
it is now beyond cavil that summary judgment may be appropriate even in the context of discrimination cases.this court has stated that the salutary purposes of summary protracted,expensive and harassing no less to discrimination cases than to other areas of litigation.meiri dacon,cir.much more recently,the supreme court reiterated that trial courts should not treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.reeves sanderson plumbing,d quoting mary honor ctr.hicks,d.
further,it is axiomatic that an appellate court may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground fairly supported by the record.see shumway united parcel service,cir citations omitted.thus,we may affirm a grant of summary judgment for different reasons than those relied upon by the district court.see id.
delta motion for summary judgment 
the state hrl makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual in promotion,compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.exec.law.the city hrl prohibits the same conduct.city admin.code a.although there are differences between the state hrl,the city hrl and the federal age discrimination in employment act adea,et,age discrimination suits brought under the state hrl and city hrl are subject to the same analysis as claims brought under the adea.see lightfoot union carbide,cir.we,in turn,analyze adea claims under the same burden shifting framework as claims brought pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.see schnabel abramson,cir.thus,we analyze an age discrimination claim brought under the state hrl and city hrl as we would any other title vii claim.
under this framework,first set out in mcdonnell douglas green,d,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.see id.once the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case,the employer is required to offer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory business rationale for its actions.see id.if the employer articulates such a reason,the presumption of age discrimination dissolves,and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the employer stated reasons are merely pretextual and that age discrimination was the true reason for the adverse employment action.see id.
the prima facie case 
to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,a plaintiff must show four things he is a member of the protected class he is qualified for his position he has suffered an adverse employment action and the circumstances surrounding that action give rise to an inference of age discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas,at.weinstock,at.a plaintiff burden of establishing a prima facie case is de minimis.see cronin aetna life ins,cir.the requirement is neither onerous,fisher vassar college,cir en banc quoting texas dep t of community affairs burdine,d,nor intended to be rigid,mechanized or ritualistic.meiri,at quoting furnco constr.waters,d.the district court concluded that plaintiffs here had failed to meet the fourth component of their prima facie burden.specifically,judge baer held that,because plaintiffs were not similarly situated to the delta pilots in all material respects,the differences in treatment did not prove any animus.see,wl,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that judge baer erred when he embraced the notion that the only way a plaintiff can make out an inference of discrimination is to demonstrate that he was treated differently from other similarly situated employees.plaintiffs concede that,while such a showing of disparate treatment is probably the most common way to create an inference of discrimination,it is not the only method.they contend that delta management singular,focus on the age and retirement schedule of the pan am pilots,most graphically represented by harry alger several written derogatory comments,sufficiently evinces the discriminatory intent needed to make out the prima facie case.this argument is not without appeal.
at the outset,we concede that the case law on this particular a discrimination plaintiff may or must show disparate confusing.courts,including ours,have struggled with this fourth element of the prima facie case,as the language of the element itself has gone through various iterations in the years since mcdonnell douglas was decided.denny chin jody golinsky,moving beyond mcdonnell douglas a simplified method for assessing evidence in discrimination cases,brook.l.indeed,this court decisions have occasionally adopted apparently inconsistent within a single case.compare shumway,at this last element of a prima facie case may be proven by showing that a man similarly situated was treated differently.emphasis added with id.at to establish the fourth element of a prima facie case,shumway must show that she was treated differently from similarly situated males.emphasis added see also chambers trm copy centers,cir noting the many types of circumstances that could create a permissible inference of discriminatory intent.
in the run of the mill discrimination cases,this controversy is of little consequence because a plaintiff can make a showing of disparate treatment simply by pointing to the adverse employment action and the many employees who suffered no such fate.this is not in any way surprising,for disparate treatment is the essence of discrimination.however,cases occasionally arise where a plaintiff can not show disparate treatment only because there are no employees similarly situated to the plaintiff.a simple example of such a case is where an employer has only one employee.if that employee were fired for a discriminatory reason,and no one was hired to replace him,he could never demonstrate disparate treatment because there is no point of comparison.bearing in mind the flexible spirit of a plaintiff prima facie requirement,see meiri,at,it stands to reason that,in such a case,the plaintiff should be able to create an inference of discrimination by some other means.
while delta is a long way from the days when it had only a single employee,the plaintiffs in this case find themselves in a similar conundrum they are in a class all by themselves.because all the pan am pilots hired by delta were subjected to the same three employment terms challenged in this action,and because the pan am pilots differed materially from the delta pilots in terms of their airline of origin and career expectations,there are no delta employees similarly situated to plaintiffs who did not suffer the adverse employment actions.under the must construction of the fourth prima facie element,it would be impossible for plaintiffs to meet their prima facie burden,because,like the lone employee in the example,they have no appropriate point of comparison with which to show disparate treatment.this presents the grotesque scenario where an employer can effectively immunize itself from suit if it is so thorough in its discrimination that all similarly situated employees are victimized.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that a showing of disparate treatment,while a common and especially effective method of establishing the inference of discriminatory intent necessary to complete the prima facie case,is only one way to discharge that burden.this position is consistent with our prior decision in chambers,where we wrote that the inference of discriminatory intent could be drawn in several circumstances including,but not limited to 
the employer continuing,after discharging the plaintiff,to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiff qualifications
