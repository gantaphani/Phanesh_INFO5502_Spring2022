petitioners here,however,are subject to the transitional rule of iirira because deportation proceedings against them commenced prior to april,and a final deportation order was entered after october,c,stat.two changes made applicable by the transitional rules are relevant here.
in place of those deleted sentences,we insert the following

we delete the following sentences of the opinion found at iouri ashcroft,cir 
such stays are particularly important in cases governed by iirira transitional rules because removal of an alien strips this court of jurisdiction to hear their petition for review.see elian,at.thus,if we deny a stay of deportation,we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to review a claim,and as a result,we may end up returning an alien to the very persecution he or she was fleeing in the first place.
we modify footnote,at,to read as follows 
under iirira transitional rules,the relief sought by stays of deportation was particularly significant because removal of an alien under those rules stripped this court of jurisdiction to hear their petition for review.see elian,at.during the course of this appeal,congress repealed the iirira transitional rules,reestablishing our jurisdiction to hear the appeals of aliens in spite of their departure.see obale att y,cir congress enacted b b in order to permit judicial review of a removal order even if the alien has departed the united states.this enactment did not,however,render a stay of deportation and a stay of voluntary departure functionally the same.notwithstanding the repeal of the iirira transitional rules,these two forms of relief continue to differ in both their practical and equitable respects.consequently,the government deserves prompt notice of precisely what relief a petitioner seeks.indeed,providing such notice is a petitioner responsibility.under federal rule of appellate procedure,which governs stays pending review of an agency decision,a motion for a stay must include the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on.fed.a b i.in this case,petitioners styled their motion as a stay of deportation and,in support,noted that because stays are no longer automatically issued they are subject to being physically deported from the united states at any time and that a denial of a stay of deportation will allow the ins to act to deport them and render the petition for review moot.it is clear,then,that the reasons offered by petitioners for granting their stay were aimed at halting their deportation rather than extending their period for voluntary departure.petitioners thus failed to give appropriate notice that they sought relief in the form of a stay of voluntary departure.as a result,they are now not entitled to that relief.see thapa,at stating that the equities relevant to a stay of a voluntary departure order and a stay of an order of removal may balance differently and concluding that granting thapa motion for a stay of the voluntary departure order did not necessitate granting his motion for a stay of the order of removal.
we delete the following sentence of the opinion found at at whereas a stay of deportation is aimed at preserving the court jurisdiction,a stay of the voluntary departure period is a way for the alien to extend the benefits of the privilege of voluntary departure beyond the date the alien was initially afforded.in its place,we insert whereas a stay of deportation is aimed at preventing forcible removal,a stay of the voluntary departure period is a way for the alien to extend the benefits of the privilege of voluntary departure beyond the date the alien was initially afforded.
finally,we delete footnote,found at at.
the petition for rehearing is denied.
vladimir iouri and vera yuriy petitioners,natives of the former soviet union and citizens of the now independent ukraine,petition for review from a november,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirming an immigration judge ij order finding petitioners incredible and denying their application for asylum,withholding of return,and relief under the convention against torture cat.petitioners also seek review of a may,order of the bia denying their motion to reopen immigration proceedings.the purpose of the motion to reopen was to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent residents on the basis of approved immediate relative petitions filed on petitioners behalf by their daughter,a united states citizen.the bia denied the motion because by the time it was filed,petitioners had remained in the united states beyond the period granted for voluntary departure and were,therefore,statutorily barred from seeking adjustment of status.
on petition for review,petitioners raise two issues.first,whether the bia erred by failing to take into account their advanced age in assessing their credibility.second,whether their voluntary departure period should be deemed stayed,tolled,or otherwise extended by their having timely filed for a petition for review and moved for a stay of deportation in their underlying asylum case.
background 
and natives of the former soviet union and citizens of the now independent ukraine.iouri entered the united states on or about april,as a visitor.yuriy followed on or about august,also as a visitor.soon after his wife arrival,iouri sought asylum claiming that as a member of the ukraine orthodox church,he was persecuted and has a fear of future persecution due to his religious beliefs and affiliation 
in his asylum application,iouri claims that he has long been mistreated due to his religious beliefs.in particular,he asserts that under communist rule,his family was unable to practice their religion openly,and as a child,he was punished in school for attending easter services.his application also recounts alleged mistreatment while he served in the army.in hungary,for example,iouri asserts he refused to shoot protestors due to his moral and religious convictions,and as a result,he was mistreated and threatened with punishment.iouri claims his commanding officer arrested him while he was praying beyond that,iouri contends he was generally mocked,threatened,and forced to serve in an atmosphere of general hostility.
according to petitioners,conditions did not improve with perestroika and independence.they report receiving threatening letters and phone calls letters they sent were opened and inspected and the russian orthodox and ukranian catholic churches,backed by the government,did their best to declare petitioner religion.
iouri asylum application,however,made no mention of any specific incidents of abuse or violence against him or his wife.indeed,iouri mentioned specific incidents for the first time during an asylum interview and in an addendum to his application submitted to the ij in june.in the addendum,iouri claimed that he was attacked in december of and threatened with death if he did not stop attending religious services his apartment was vandalized in march of and in february of,his apartment was again broken into and vandalized,and he was beaten and admitted to the hospital with a ruptured kidney.
a hearing was held on july,at which both petitioners testified.with regard to the incident,iouri claimed for the first time that he was knocked unconscious,suffered injuries to his head and chest,and was hospitalized for seven days.as to the vandalism incident,he testified that graffiti with death threats was painted on the wall,and when he attempted to report the incident,police informed him the case was closed and advised him to stop practicing his religion.when yuriy testified,she could not remember the date of the third incident,stating that it occurred either in december of or february of.she also testified that her husband was attacked on the street,not in the apartment.when brought to her attention that submitted documents indicated the attack occurred in her home,she changed her testimony and stated that a fourth incident in which her husband was beaten occurred sometime in december of.her husband,however,did not testify to that effect,and there is no mention in any of the documents of a december attack.
the ij denied petitioners application finding that iouri testimony was not credible.specifically,the ij found his testimony to be generally halting and vague with regards to some significant events.as to the incident,the ij noted that this had not been mentioned anywhere else and there were no documents corroborating that he had been hospitalized.the ij also noted inconsistencies in the testimony between iouri and his,she claimed he was attacked in on the street,not in the apartment,and she testified to a fourth incident never once mentioned by iouri.finally,the ij explained that iouri was vague in describing the tenets of his faith 
although the ij denied petitioners application for asylum,he granted their request to voluntarily depart pursuant to former immigration and nationality act ina e,e repealed.petitioners were warned that if they failed to depart voluntarily,the order granting voluntary departure would be withdrawn and they would be ordered deported to the ukraine.they were also warned,by written order,of the statutory consequences of failing to depart specifically,they would be ineligible for certain immigration relief,including adjustment of status,for a term of five years.id.e.petitioners filed a timely appeal which tolled the first thirty days of their voluntary departure period.on november,the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision and granted petitioners a new period of voluntary departure lasting until december.
petitioners filed their petitions for review with this court on december,and december.along with the petitions for review,petitioners also requested that we grant them a stay of deportation.they did not,however,specifically request a stay of their voluntary departure period or seek an extension of the departure period from the immigration and naturalization service ins district director.nor did they depart.instead,they filed a motion before the bia to reopen proceedings in order to apply for adjustment of status on the basis of approved immediate relative petitions filed on their behalf by their daughter,now a united states citizen.the bia denied their motion because they had overstayed their departure period and were,therefore,statutorily barred from applying for adjustment of status.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
asylum application 
because the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision to deny petitioners application for asylum,we review the ij decision directly.twum ins,cir.in turn,our scope of review is exceedingly narrow.wu biao chen ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing a denial of an application for asylum,we defer to the immigration court factual findings as long as they are supported by substantial evidence,and we will not disturb a factual finding if it is supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.id.quoting diallo ins,cir.factual findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
when it comes to credibility determinations,we afford particular deference to the ij in applying the substantial evidence test.zhou yun zhang ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we look to see whether the ij has provided specific,cogent reasons for her findings and whether those findings bear a legitimate nexus to the credibility determinations.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.where a credibility determination is based on specific examples of inconsistent statements or contradictory evidence,a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the ij clearly set forth specific and cogent reasons for his adverse credibility finding,stating 
again,for all the reasons the internal discrepancies,the external inconsistencies with information on documents and the addendum to the request for asylum,the general vagueness of the testimony,the lack of key details and specifics with regard to the most critical portions of the claim,and the significant discrepancies between the testimony of the two respondents for all these reasons,i find that the testimony does not rise to the level of believability and consistency in detail to provide us with a plausible and coherent account of the basis for the fear,and for that reason a negative credibility finding is made for each respondent.
these findings are supported by substantial evidence.as noted above,there were significant discrepancies between iouri initial asylum application,the addendum,and his testimony.for example,the addendum did not note his hospitalization following the first incident and nowhere in the initial asylum application did he mention any of these incidents.more telling are the discrepancies between the testimony of the two petitioners.not only did yuriy testify that the february incident occurred while her husband was on the street,whereas he testified that it occurred in the couple home,a fact his spouse would be unlikely to mistake,but she also testified to a fourth incident occurring in december of which is mentioned nowhere in her husband testimony,the supporting asylum application,or even the addendum.these inconsistencies are sufficient to support the ij adverse credibility findings.see gao,cir holding adverse credibility supported by substantial evidence where numerous discrepancies as to dates and surrounding details and petitioner testimony at his asylum hearing differed substantially from his initial written asylum application and first asylum interview.
nevertheless,petitioners argue that the ij and bia should have considered the passage of time and their advanced age in assessing their credibility.as the government correctly points out and as petitioners acknowledge,however,this particular argument was not raised before the bia and petitioners therefore failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.accordingly,this argument has been waived.see foster ins,cir to preserve a claim,we require p etitioner to raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review.quoting ins,cir we therefore deny the petitions for review of the underlying asylum application and petition for withholding of return 
voluntary departure 
as noted,petitioners were by the ij and the relief of voluntary departure in lieu of deportation pursuant to former ina e if adhered to,voluntary departure produces a situation.bocova gonzales,cir.for aliens,voluntary departure is desirable because it allows them to choose their own destination points,to put their affairs in order without fear of being taken into custody at any time,to avoid stigma and various penalties associated with forced removals and it facilitates the possibility of return to the united states ashcroft,cir.for the government,it expedites departures and reduces the costs that are typically associated with deporting individuals from the united states.see thapa gonzales,cir azarte ashcroft,cir.
following the bia decision to affirm the ij,petitioners were required to depart the united states by december.they did not.instead,on january,they moved before the bia to have their proceedings reopened in order to adjust their status based on immediate relative petitions filed on petitioners behalf by their daughter and approved by the ins on november.because they had overstayed their time for voluntary departure,however,the bia denied the motion.see e a repealed aliens who fail to depart within the period for voluntary departure,other than because of exceptional circumstances,shall not be eligible for adjustment or change of status under section for a period of years after the scheduled date of departure.
the bia conclusions of law are reviewed de novo but where the bia has applied the correct law,we review its decision to deny reopening for abuse of discretion.guan bia,cir.to get around the otherwise clear statutory bar to their seeking adjustment of status,petitioners contend that either their period for voluntary departure does not commence until this court issues the mandate in the underlying asylum case or because they sought a stay of deportation,we should enter a nunc pro tunc order staying their voluntary departure period.either way,petitioners argue the bia erred in not granting their motion to reopen.
i.when does petitioners time to depart voluntarily begin to run 
citing the ninth circuit decision in ins,cir,petitioners first argue that their period for voluntary departure does not begin to run until we issue a mandate denying their petition for review in their underlying asylum case,however,is an old law case.at the time of,the ina provided for automatic stays of deportation upon the filing of a petition for review.a repealed.the court reasoned that it was inconceivable that congress made such provision but intended to require aliens granted voluntary departure to seek repeated extensions of the voluntary departure period from the district director,in order to preserve the award of voluntary departure until our final determination at.thus,the court concluded that the right of voluntary departure should remain in effect throughout the period of appellate review and for whatever additional time the bia afforded the petitioner in its decision.id.in adopting this rule,the court rejected an alternative rule which would have preserved voluntary departure only where the alien petitions for review within the period specified for voluntary departure.such a rule was unacceptable because,in the court view,it would shorten the statutory six month period provided for under old law for filing a petition for review.id.at citing c repealed.
petitioners here,however,are subject to the rule of iirira,as amended by the real id act of,because a final deportation order was entered after october,c,stat,real id act of,d,stat.two changes made applicable by iirira are relevant here.first,automatic stays are no longer granted an alien must petition the court for a stay of deportation.id.c f.second,petitions for review must be filed within days of the final order of deportation.id.c c.
these changes have so undercut the rationale of that petitioners reliance on that decision is misplaced.indeed,these very same changes prompted the ninth circuit several years later in ashcroft,cir,to reconsider and hold that the period for voluntary departure begins to run from the time the bia enters its order id.at see also rife ashcroft,cir.petitioners period for voluntary departure,therefore,began to run upon issuance of the bia order denying their application for asylum and withholding of return.they are therefore barred from adjusting their status unless the period for voluntary departure was stayed,tolled,or otherwise extended by their having filed for a stay of deportation.we now turn to that issue.
ii.whether the period for voluntary departure may be stayed,tolled,or otherwise extended 
in thapa,following the position adopted by the majority of the circuits,compare bocova,at holding that iirira does not limit a court authority to issue a stay of departure suspending the running of a voluntary departure period and el himri ashcroft,cir the district director authority to extend voluntary departure time periods does not limit this court equitable authority to grant a stay of the voluntary departure period and rife,at holding that since iirira permits stays of removal,voluntary departure can also be stayed and,at concluding that under the permanent iirira rules,a stay tolling the time for voluntary departure may be entered and nwakanma ashcroft,cir with ngarurih ashcroft,cir holding that voluntary departure may not be stayed,we recently held that we have the authority to stay an agency order of voluntary departure pending consideration of a petition for review on the merits.thapa,at.we did not address,however,our power to issue such a stay where,as here,the petitioners moved only for a stay of removal and failed to make a motion expressly requesting a stay of voluntary departure,and have now sought such relief well after the time for voluntary departure has expired.
iii.whether petitioners must have expressly requested a stay of the voluntary departure order 
in thapa,and most cases where other courts have held the period for voluntary departure may be stayed,the petitioner expressly moved for a stay of voluntary departure.see id.at see,nwakanma,at,at.in contrast,petitioners here sought a stay of deportation,but not a stay of voluntary departure.that said,two ninth circuit in desta ashcroft,cir,and the eighth circuit in rife,at held that where an alien files a motion to stay removal before the period for voluntary departure expires,such a motion should be construed as including a motion to stay the voluntary departure period.according to both courts,this is so because,a motion seeking a stay of voluntary departure is ancillary,desta,at,or complementary,rife,at,to a stay of deportation.we disagree.for the reasons that follow,we join the first and seventh circuits,both of which have held that an alien who wishes to stay the period for voluntary departure must explicitly ask for such a stay.bocova,at alimi ashcroft,cir 
when an alien is ordered deported,a warrant by the ins district director is issued authorizing the officer to take the alien into custody and deport him or her.gordon,mailman,immigration law and procedure a ed.when this court grants a stay of deportation,we are preventing the forced removal of an alien from the country.such stays are particularly important in cases governed by iirira transitional rules because removal of an alien strips this court of jurisdiction to hear their petition for review.see elian,at.thus,if we deny a stay of deportation,we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to review a claim,and as a result,we may end up returning an alien to the very persecution he or she was fleeing in the first place.
voluntary departure,in contrast,is a privilege granted an alien in lieu of deportation.see ins,cir.although it carries with it significant restrictions barring an alien readmission to the united states,see thapa,at,voluntary departure affords an alien certain benefits i t allows him to choose his own destination points,to put his affairs in order without fear of being taken into custody at any time,to avoid the stigma and various penalties associated with forced removals including extended detention while the government procures the necessary travel documents and ineligibility for readmission for a period of five or ten years,see a a,and it facilitates the possibility of return to the united states,for example,by adjustment of status.id.an immigration judge order granting voluntary departure usually withholds the entry of a deportation order,permitting the respondent to depart within a specified period,and directs that the deportation order shall become effective automatically if respondent does not depart.gordon,mailman and,supra,at c.where an alien departs within the specified time period,the alien is not regarded as having been deported and thus obtains the benefits of departure without deportation.id.
in contrast to a stay of deportation,which stops the physical removal of an alien from the country,a stay of voluntary departure stops the clock on the period within which an alien is required to depart and,if granted,effectively extends the time during which an alien is allowed to leave voluntarily.an alien does not lose something when offered the additional opportunity to depart voluntarily.on the contrary,he retains precisely the same right to judicial review he would otherwise have had it is only that his alternative to continued litigation has been made more attracti
