ugurhan akturk kosereis kosereis,brought a discrimination claim in the district court against his employer,the state of rhode island department for children,youth and families,rhode island training school the training school,and the director of the training school in his official capacity.kosereis alleged that the defendants discriminated against him based on his religion and national origin in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,and various state laws.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment because kosereis failed to produce sufficient evidence that he suffered from discrimination.although the district court decision contained legal errors,we affirm.
background 
when reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.see sands ridefilm,cir.kosereis is a muslim who works as a vocational teacher at the training school.the training school is a juvenile correction facility that contains both classrooms and residences.kosereis has worked for the training school since.during his tenure,he has taught woodworking,autobody,and at the times relevant to this appeal,welding and auto mechanics.
kosereis has experienced difficulties with tardiness and absenteeism.in,the training school issued kosereis a reminder about taking excessive sick leave without proper documentation.the problem became worse in the when arlene chorney chorney was hired as principal of the training school.according to kosereis,his discriminatory treatment started the day chorney became principal.
chorney instituted a new work schedule that,in kosereis words,was very complicated.kosereis claims that the complexity of the work schedule caused him to become confused about when he was required to report for work.in,for example,disciplinary proceedings were initiated against kosereis because he missed work without notifying the proper personnel.in,kosereis was verbally disciplined for being late to a class.in,kosereis was given a written reprimand for failing to report to his first period class.in,kosereis received a disciplinary letter for falsifying his time records.this reprimand,however,was later expunged from his record.in,kosereis was verbally reprimanded after he failed to report for work in the morning.
it is clear that chorney made efforts to clarify the work schedule.as part of the verbal reprimand in,chorney explained the schedule to kosereis in the presence of his union representative.in kosereis letter,chorney again offered kosereis help 
as a professional,you are expected to arrive to school and classes on time.you are also expected to follow your schedule.if you are unable to understand your schedule,i will assist you further.
in addition to the alleged complicated work schedule,kosereis claims that chorney was responsible for a host of other problems.he says that chorney did not give him sufficient funding,adequate supplies or proper facilities to teach auto mechanics.kosereis was required to work in a particular building that he says lacked ventilation and was dirty.chorney denied kosereis request for a sabbatical to travel to turkey and study that country juvenile justice system.instead,kosereis was granted a sabbatical to take courses in rhode island.kosereis also says that chorney did not do enough to stop students from calling him turkey and teachers teasing him about his turkish food in the lunchroom.
in,kosereis was laid off and soon after initiated an administrative appeal with the rhode island commissioner of education the commissioner.while the appeal was pending,kosereis filed a claim with the rhode island commission for human rights richr and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging that his job was terminated because of discrimination.the eeoc ultimately issued kosereis a right to sue letter,but the richr did not.
in,kosereis administrative appeal of his was decided.the commissioner determined that kosereis was laid off for good and just cause,but nevertheless reinstated him with backpay because he did not receive a timely notice of his.
two years after kosereis returned to work,he filed another set of claims with the richr and the eeoc.this time,he alleged that chorney disciplinary actions stemming from his absenteeism constituted discrimination.kosereis claimed he was disciplined in retaliation for filing his earlier claims of discrimination.both the richr and the eeoc issued right to sue letters.
having properly navigated the administrative waters of the richr and the eeoc,kosereis filed a complaint in the district court.he alleged that the defendants violated title vii by creating a hostile work environment and denying him equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin.kosereis then amended his complaint and added the allegation of retaliation.kosereis also raised claims under the rhode island civil rights act,laws,and the rhode island fair employment practices act,laws.
after discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge who recommended that the defendants motion be granted.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the federal and state law claims.kosereis filed a timely appeal,but challenged only the district court rulings regarding the federal law claims.it is to these rulings we now turn.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see muniz cortes intermedics,cir.summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate when the evidence is so that no reasonable person could find in favor of the plaintiff.see kearney town of wareham,cir.there are four issues we must address in this appeal whether kosereis was precluded from litigating issues pertaining to his whether kosereis was treated differently than other because of his religion and national origin whether kosereis suffered from a hostile work environment and whether kosereis was subjected to discriminatory retaliation.
preclusion 
our initial inquiry is whether kosereis can,as part of this case,delve into matters related to his.the is important to kosereis in this litigation because he believes it helps establish that he was subjected to disparate treatment,a topic which we will discuss later.
the district court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred kosereis from litigating any issues related to his.under federal law,the doctrine of res judicata dictates that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.perez volvo car,cir quoting allen mccurry,d.the district court reasoned that kosereis administrative appeal of the,and the commissioner subsequent ruling that he was laid off for good and just cause,amounted to a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.this ruling was incorrect.
the critical part of the district court ruling stated that t he doctrine of res judicata applies to a decision of a administrative tribunal,such as the decision by the commissioner in the present case.to support this statement,the district court cited to department of corrections of state of rhode island tucker,in which the rhode island supreme court held that rhode island state courts give preclusive effect to administrative tribunals.
the district court was correct in looking to state law for answers to questions regarding the preclusive effect of state administrative decisions.federal common law generally requires that federal courts accord the decisions of state administrative agencies acting in a judicial capacity the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the state courts.of elliott,d.but that is not the end of the matter.even if state courts apply res judicata to state administrative decisions,federal courts will only follow suit if doing so is consistent with congress intent in enacting the federal statute at issue.see astoria fed.sav.and loan ass solimino,d citing elliott,at.this means that when the preclusive effect of a state administrative decision is in question,the central inquiry is one of federal statutory interpretation.see thomas contoocook valley sch,cir.in this case,the district court erred by looking no further than the predilections of the state court the district court failed to consider the vital question of congressional intent.
that said,we need not canvass the congressional intent underlying title vii.the supreme court has already considered the matter,and held that congress did not intend that unreviewed state administrative decisions would prohibit plaintiffs from bringing subsequent title vii actions in federal courts.see elliott,at.we will,of course,follow the supreme court ruling in elliott.the administrative decision issued by the commissioner regarding kosereis was not reviewed by a court.it therefore does not have a preclusive effect on kosereis title vii claims.see thomas,at it is now settled,however,that state agency findings that are not reviewed by a state court are not entitled to any preclusive effect in a subsequent action under title vii emphasis in original.kosereis is free to use the facts related to his as evidence of disparate treatment.the district court holding to the contrary is overruled.
disparate treatment 
kosereis claims that he was denied equal terms and conditions of employment because of his religion and national origin.kosereis concedes,however,that he lacks direct evidence of discrimination.this means that the case turns on whether kosereis has presented sufficient circumstantial evidence of discrimination.see cooley dickinson,cir.to make this determination,we use the analysis from mcdonnell douglas green,d.see straughn delta air lines,cir.
under the mcdonnell douglas analysis,a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case,which in turn gives rise to an inference of discrimination.see dichner liberty travel,cir.the employer then must state a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.see reckitt colman,cir.if the employer can state such a reason,the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff is required to show that the employer stated reason is a pretext for discrimination.see id.at.
generally,a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that he is a member of a protected class he was qualified for the job the employer took an adverse employment action against him and the position remained open or was filled by a person with similar qualifications.see mary honor ctr.hicks,d centennial wireless,cir.the district court assumed,arguendo,that kosereis made out a prima facie case.in doing so,it quoted language in frito lay snacks caribbean,cir,and described the fourth prong as requiring plaintiff to show that other similarly situated employees who were not members of the protected class were treated more favorably.id.at.this language was dicta,however the plaintiff prima facie case was not contested as part of that appeal.nor did the case that cited,ponte,cir,involve the prima facie showing required for disparate treatment claims.dicta,of course,is not binding on future panels.see municipality of san juan rullan,cir.
in conward cambridge school committee,cir,in contrast,we explicitly rejected the notion that plaintiffs in disparate treatment cases are required to demonstrate that they were treated differently as part of their prima facie case rather,we held that 
t he time to consider comparative evidence in a disparate treatment case is at the third step of the ritual,when the need arises to test the pretextuality vel non of the employer articulated reason for having acted adversely to the plaintiff interests.
id.at.we have since repeated our conward ruling.see fernandes,at a plaintiff need not show as part of his prima facie case that the employer either recalled similarly situated employees or otherwise treated employees of different ethnic backgrounds more favorably.
our holding in conward makes sense and is attuned to the applicable law.we have described the prima facie case as a small showing,reed lepage bakeries.cir,that is not onerous,at,and is easily made,gillen fallon ambulance,cir.the pretext analysis,on the other hand,is more demanding.see texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d stating that the pretext analysis moves the inquiry to a new level of specificity.thus,conward presents the applicable rule in disparate treatment cases,comparative evidence is to be treated as part of the pretext analysis,and not as part of the plaintiff prima facie case.at.
as in conward,the district court here went on to grant summary judgment because there was insufficient evidence of pretext.we agree that kosereis failed to present adequate evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment,and affirm on that basis.
the ultimate touchstone of the mcdonnell douglas analysis is whether the employer actions were improperly motivated by discrimination.fite digital equip,cir.evidence that the employer stated reasons for its actions are pretextual can be sufficient to show improper motive,and hence,allow the plaintiff to survive summary judgment.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d fite,at feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.
plaintiffs can show that an employer stated reasons are pretextual in any number of ways.see,at.one method is to produce evidence that the plaintiff was treated differently than other similarly situated employees.see straughn,at fernandes,at.to show disparate treatment,kosereis relies heavily on the claim that only he was disciplined for failing to come to work on time.he says that other tardy employees were never disciplined.
the record,however,does not support kosereis claims.there is simply no evidence that other teachers who failed to report to work were not disciplined.in fact,the evidence is just the opposite.chorney testified at her deposition that she had issued written or verbal reprimands to employees other than kosereis for being late to work.
kosereis raises a number of other instances of disparate treatment.all of these are insufficient to show pretext because they do not involve facts or circumstances similar to those kosereis faced.to successfully allege disparate treatment,a plaintiff must show that others similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.conward,at see also rosado radio shack,cir stating that to have a plausible differential treatment claim,plaintiffs must show that others similarly situated were treated differently.the examples of disparate treatment need not be perfect replicas,but they must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts and circumstances.conward,at.
kosereis claims that a secretary and some teachers were not disciplined after they returned late to work after going out to lunch for secretary day.kosereis admitted at his deposition,however,that he did not know whether the secretary and the teachers violated any rules.kosereis did not know,for example,whether they had permission to return late or whether they used personal time for the lunch.he also did not say whether the teachers late arrival caused them to miss classes,as was the case in his situation.
in the same vein,kosereis claims that other teachers who behaved inappropriately were never disciplined.he cites an instance where a student fingers were cut by a machine in a carpentry class.chorney testified in her deposition that the teacher in charge of the carpentry class was not punished because the student had been told not to touch the machine,but disobeyed the teacher order.kosereis cites an instance where a staff member urinated outside the school.chorney explained that the staff member was not punished because the incident did not take place on school property or on school time.chorney also lacked personal knowledge of the incident.kosereis says that a staff member once used profane language in kosereis classroom.chorney explained that she did not discipline the staff member because she was not the staff member supervisor,but she did forward a report of the incident to the appropriate person.in short,the long lunch for secreta
