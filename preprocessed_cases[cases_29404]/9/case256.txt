background 
méndez aponte was the assistant secretary of state for protocol affairs at the puerto rico state department from june,until march.méndez aponte alleges that,in,in the course of his official duties and during official meetings where the economic situation of the government of puerto rico and of the puerto rico state department were discussed,he suggested to marisara pont marchese,the interim puerto rico secretary of state,that investing in iraqi dinars would be a good investment for puerto rico.
méndez aponte alleges that on august,a journalist from el nuevo día,a puerto rican newspaper,called him to inquire about rumors that employees at the puerto rico state department were selling iraqi dinars during office hours.méndez aponte contacted bonilla to inform him about the journalist inquiry and they set up a meeting to discuss the matter the next day.the next day,before this discussion could take place,méndez aponte found out from the press that bonilla had fired him and had also asked the director of the government ethics office to investigate the rumors that dinars were sold at the puerto rico state department.according to méndez aponte,that same day,the subsecretary of state asked méndez aponte to meet with an investigator who was conducting an inquiry regarding the allegations.on august,méndez aponte received a written notification,dated august,informing him that he had been removed from his position due to illegal conduct.specifically,the letter stated that méndez aponte was suspended because he engaged in conduct that is clearly detrimental to the moral and good name of the department.
on june,méndez aponte,his wife,and their conjugal partnership filed a complaint against,inter alios the commonwealth of puerto rico,fernando bonilla,in his official and personal capacities,bonilla wife,and their conjugal partnership,in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.the plaintiffs filed their complaint pursuant to the civil rights act of,and,alleging violations of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.they asked the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their puerto rico law claims.
on april,the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint including bonilla,in his personal and official capacity as secretary of state of the puerto rico state department,as the only defendant.bonilla filed an answer to the amended complaint on october.on august,the plaintiffs filed a notice of partial voluntary dismissal of their claims alleging fourteenth amendment due process violations.on august,the district court entered partial judgment dismissing with prejudice plaintiffs claims alleging violations of méndez aponte rights under the fourteenth amendment.
on april,the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that the district court dismiss the plaintiffs section political discrimination claim because plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination or,in the alternative,because bonilla was entitled to qualified immunity.the plaintiffs filed a timely opposition to the motion for summary judgment and a statement of contested material facts on april.on september,the district court entered an order granting bonilla motion for summary judgment and dismissing méndez aponte section political discrimination claims with prejudice and dismissing the supplemental state law claims without prejudice.see méndez aponte puerto rico,d.the district court found that the plaintiffs failed to properly dispute the defendant statement of uncontested material facts because their denials and qualifications of the defendant fact statements were mostly irrelevant to the matter at hand and consist of mere speculation,generalities,conclusory assertions,improbable inferences and,for lack of a better phrase,a lot of hot air.id.at quoting domínguez eli lilly and.the court therefore took its factual findings mainly from bonilla statement of uncontested material facts id.
the district court concluded that méndez aponte could be terminated without cause because he held a trust position for which party affiliation was an appropriate qualification for continued employment.id.at.the court therefore dismissed méndez aponte political discrimination claim.id.at.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the court also imposed a sanction of each on attorneys nicolás nogueras cartagena and patricia ramírez gelpí.id.at.the court found that the attorneys failed to properly dispute bonilla statement of uncontroverted facts,that their memorandum of law failed to specify the documents in the record that supported their contentions and left blank the number of the exhibit to which they were referring the court,and that their long and generally incomprehensible opposition was frivolous and totally devoid of any semblance of colorable merit.id.at.ii.discussion 
motion for summary judgment 
our review of the district court entry of summary judgment is de novo.del toro pacheco pereira,cir.we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.lopera town of coventry,cir del toro pacheco,at.we ignore any conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.del toro pacheco,at quoting sutliffe epping sch,cir.the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a we may affirm summary judgment on any ground manifest in the record.klaucke daly,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the first amendment protects public employees from adverse action due to their political affiliation,unless political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position.see branti finkel,ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.a plaintiff seeking to establish a political discrimination claim under must establish four elements that the plaintiff and defendant have opposing political affiliations,that the defendant is aware of the plaintiff affiliation,that an adverse employment action occurred,and that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.ocasio hernández,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,bonilla argues that political affiliation is a proper requirement for méndez aponte position and that,therefore,bonilla could properly fire méndez aponte for his political affiliation.
the question of whether political affiliation is an appropriate basis for dismissal is a legal one for the court.uphoff figueroa alejandro,cir hadfield mcdonough,cir.this circuit has typically conducted a analysis to make this determination.see hadfield,at duriex gauthier lópez nieves,cir.we ask whether the governmental unit decides issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation,ruiz casillas camacho morales,cir quoting jiménez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir en banc,and whether the specific responsibilities of the position resemble those of a policymaker or other officeholder whose functions are such that party affiliation is an appropriate criterion for holding the post,hadfield,at.we have upheld political dismissals of mid or employees where the employee merely represented the agency policy positions to other entities or to the public or where important personnel functions were part of the portfolio.flynn city of boston,cir.
turning to the first inquiry,we agree with the district court that the puerto rico state department handles matters where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.see méndez aponte,d at holding that the first prong of the inquiry was satisfied.the governor of puerto rico,who is elected by direct vote in each general election,const.art.iv,appoints the secretary of state,id.the secretary of state is charged with promulgat ing all proclamations and orders of the governor and all laws enacted by the legislative assembly.laws ann.tit.further,the puerto rico state department is in charge of arranging the visits of personages from foreign countries who can come and observe puerto rican life and who can in some way make known outside of puerto rico the facts concerning puerto rico.id.this is certainly a politically sensitive task.given that the puerto rico state department and the governor of puerto rico have a close working relationship,the state department represents puerto rico to governments of other countries,and the policy goals of the state department may change with different administrations,we hold that the state department is an agency that involve s decision making on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.olmeda ortiz quiñonez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we now look to the specific responsibilities of the position to determine whether party affiliation is an appropriate requirement.ruiz casillas camacho morales,cir.in applying the second prong of the analysis,this court has looked at a variety of factors which include 
the relative compensation level for the position,the technical expertise if any required to do the job,the extent to which the position involves supervision and control over others,the degree to which the position confers authority to speak in the name of who themselves are policymakers,the influence of the position over programs and policy initiatives,and the public perception of what the position entails.
galloza foy,cir citing jiménez fuentes,at.we also consider the relationship of the position to elected officials,party leaders,and partisan politics.id.at.we focus only on the inherent duties of the position under review and do not consider the actual tasks performed by a present or past officeholder.roldán plumey cerezo suárez,cir accord jiménez fuentes,at.the official job description is a presumptively reliable basis for determining the actual functions of the position.uphoff figueroa,at roldán plumey,at.
because we have an official job description available,we begin with this document see galloza,at i f a formal job description exists,it is important for an inquiring court to look to the specifics of that document.the job description for the position of assistant secretary of state for protocol affairs lists the following relevant duties 
advise the secretary of state on the formulation of public policy that will rule his work area,or to sic the management of staff of the department and the representatives of public and private organizations as to the mission and goals of the different activities and services provided.

answer inquiries,prepare memoranda and communications of a confidential nature for the signing of the secretary and to represent him in meetings,public hearings and conferences,among other activities 
these duties strongly suggest that political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position.many of these duties are not purely ministerial and are.see galloza,at noting that job description duties generally allow the employee to exercise discretion and,thus,tend to indicate that a position is policymaking in nature.for example,the position can involve formulating recommendations regarding matters under the jurisdiction of the secretary for protocol affairs,and counseling the secretary of state and the governor of puerto rico regarding international,local,military and civil protocol affairs.these duties indicate a level of discretion that indicates that the position involves policymaking.
méndez aponte position also involves supervision and control over others.galloza,at.it is uncontested that the position of secretary for protocol affairs involves supervising employees four employees report directly to the person in this position.lópez quiñones guard,cir considering that the terminated employee supervised other employees as a factor indicating that the position involves discretionary judgments and policymaking.in addition,the secretary for protocol affairs reports directly to the secretary of state and the sub secretary of state and we have previously considered that report ing to those in the upper echelons of an agency is indicative of a policymaking position.see hadfield,at.
the position may also involve acting as a liaison to other government agencies,represent ing the secretary of state or the governor and the under secretary in official acts,representing the secretary of state in meetings,public hearings and conferences,among other activities,and supervising and executing the visits of important dignitaries from foreign governments.these functions involve representing the puerto rico governor or the secretary of state views to other agencies,the public,and other governments.we consider these functions to be exemplary of the position capacities,which we have previously considered to be indicative of a policymaking position.uphoff figueroa,at i t is enough that the official is involved in policy,even if only as an adviser,implementer,or spokesperson.emphasis and second alteration in original quoting flynn,at internal quotation marks omitted.
looking at the inherent duties of the position of assistant secretary of state for protocol affairs,we hold that political affiliation is an appropriate qualification for the position and that,therefore,it is one that is not federally protected against political discrimination.the district court properly granted bonilla motion for summary judgment on the ground that méndez aponte held a trust position that was not protected under the first amendment.
