background 
factual background 
according to the complaint,shomo was in the custody of the new york city department of corrections doc from september,to january.on september,the day that shomo entered doc custody,he was diagnosed with right arm paralysis and limited use of his left arm.shomo alleges that several doctors ordered that he receive assistance with activities of daily living adls,be transferred to specialized infirmary housing,and receive various treatments.shomo further alleges that,despite the prior treatment recommendations,doc medical personnel and security staff repeatedly refused to offer assistance with adls,to transfer him to specialized infirmary housing,or to provide the recommended treatments.
ii.procedural background 
on september,shomo filed a pro se section lawsuit against thirteen named defendants and several unnamed defendants.shomo brought claims for eighth amendment medical indifference,violations of the ada and rehabilitation acts,municipal liability,assault,and destruction of property.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss shomo complaint.while shomo did not explicitly allege any acts of deliberate indifference within the statute of limitations applicable to section claims,the district court held that the continuing violation doctrine applied to shomo eighth amendment claims.therefore,the district court dismissed shomo deliberate indifference claims as untimely,but granted shomo leave to replead as to myers,seegobin,and nawaz based upon the continuing violation doctrine.the district court granted the motion with prejudice as to the other named and unnamed defendants,concluding that shomo failed to state a claim against those defendants.with regard to shomo claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act,the district court expressly declined to consider whether those claims were.instead,it ruled that shomo clearly lacks a cause of action under either statute,and dismissed the claims as to all defendants.
on june,shomo filed an amended complaint against myers,seegobin,and nawaz,who answered on august.on october,those defendants moved for summary judgment.on january,the district court found that the claims against nawaz and seegobin were.the court also found that the claims against myers should be dismissed because no facts in the record showed deliberate indifference to shomo serious medical needs.
on january,shomo timely appealed.a motions panel appointed counsel to address the district court partial grant of defendants motion to dismiss without leave to amend,and to address any other relevant issues.the motions panel dismissed shomo appeal of the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of myers,seegobin,and nawaz.shomo filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the district court denied or discouraged him from obtaining discovery and,therefore,prevented him from adequately opposing defendants motion for summary judgment.the motions panel also denied the motion for reconsideration.
in his counseled brief on appeal,shomo argues that the district court erred in failing to provide a pro se litigant with the opportunity to amend his complaint the district court improperly dismissed the ada and rehabilitation act claims and the district court discovery orders prevented shomo from obtaining information necessary to meaningfully oppose summary judgment.with respect to the last argument,shomo claims as he must that the motions panel dismissal of the appeal of the summary judgment order should be revisited.
discussion 
eighth amendment medical indifference claimsa.the statute of limitations and continuing violation doctrine 
the statute of limitations for claims brought under section is governed by state law,and in this case is the period for personal injury actions under new york state law.see ormiston nelson,cir.a section claim ordinarily accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the harm.eagleston guido,cir quotation marks omitted.the continuing violation doctrine is an exception to the normal accrual date.harris city of new york,cir.when the plaintiff brings a section claim challenging a discriminatory policy,the commencement of the statute of limitations period may be delayed until the last discriminatory act in furtherance of it.cornwell robinson,cir quotation marks omitted see also passenger morgan,d stating the same of hostile work environment claims under title vii.to trigger the continuing violation doctrine when challenging discrimination,the plaintiff must allege both the existence of an ongoing policy of discrimination and some acts taken in furtherance of that policy.harris,at.
we have not before explicitly held that the continuing violation doctrine can delay accrual of an eighth amendment claim alleging a policy of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.pino ryan,cir finding that a prisoner eighth amendment claims were untimely,among other reasons,because the complaint alleged no facts indicating a continuous or ongoing violation of his constitutional rights.shomo complaint presents the question of whether the continuing violation doctrine is applicable to such claims.shomo complaint was filed on september,and did not allege any specific acts of deliberate indifference occurring after september.the district court observed that shomo eighth amendment claims would be unless the continuing violation doctrine were applicable,and held that it was.
in morgan,the united states supreme court held that a hostile work environment claim under title vii is timely,and can challenge acts occurring outside the statute of limitations period,as long as any act that is part of the hostile work environment occurs within the statutory time period.at.the court applied the continuing violation doctrine because a hostile work environment claim challenges repeated conduct that occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and,in direct contrast to discrete acts,a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.id.at.thus,under morgan,the continuing violation doctrine can be applied when the plaintiff claim seeks redress for injuries resulting from a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful act,but the doctrine can not be applied when the plaintiff challenges conduct that is a discrete unlawful act.id.at.see also washington county of rockland,cir.
