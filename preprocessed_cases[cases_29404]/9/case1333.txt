willie smith smith appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,judge,denying his motion for a new trial following a jury verdict in favor of the defendant prison officials,colleen carpenter carpenter and james wilkinson wilkinson.smith filed suit under alleging that the defendants violated the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by depriving him of hiv medication while he was incarcerated at the camp pharsalia correctional facility camp pharsalia.at trial,smith presented evidence that he had been deprived of hiv medication on two separate occasions for several days at a time.the jury returned with a verdict for the defendants after determining that smith had not proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he suffered from an objectively serious medical need.the district court denied smith motion for a new trial,noting that the jury verdict was supported by medical testimony indicating that smith suffered no adverse medical effects from the missed medication.on appeal,smith argues that the district court misapplied the relevant eighth amendment standard in denying his request for a new trial by concluding that the jury was entitled to consider evidence regarding the absence of actual medical injury.we hold that such evidence may be considered as a relevant factor in assessing whether an alleged denial of medical care is sufficiently serious to establish a claim under the eighth amendment and therefore affirm.
background 
in april,smith filed suit against the defendants seeking damages under.smith contends that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment by depriving him of essential hiv medication on two separate occasions while he was incarcerated at camp pharsalia,despite his repeated requests for the medication.
in october,a jury trial was held on smith denial of medical care claim.at trial,smith testified that physicians with the new york state department of correctional services docs had prescribed a regimen to treat his hiv which included a combination of three drugs,saquinavir mesylate saquinavir,combivir,and bactrim smith also testified that the defendants failed to provide him with these prescription drugs on two different occasions during his incarceration at camp pharsalia.the first episode occurred in october due to a delay in refilling smith prescriptions after his existing medication ran out.as a result,smith missed taking his scheduled doses of saquinavir and bactrim for seven days.the second episode occurred in january after smith hiv medication was confiscated during a random search of his living quarters.smith testified that he was only provided with replacement medication five days later after he was transferred to the oneida correctional facility.
smith also explained that it is important to maintain strict compliance with his drug regimin in order to prevent deterioration of his immune system and to slow the progression of his hiv infection,a condition that can ultimately lead to death although smith testified that he suffered temporary itching,severe headaches,as well as stress due to the missed medication,he did not introduce evidence that his hiv infection or overall health worsened as a result of the two isolated episodes of missed medication.
at trial,the defendants conceded that it is important for hiv patients to follow a regular drug regimen.defendants sought to demonstrate,however,that the alleged episodes of missed medication did not subject smith to a serious risk of harm and presented evidence to counter smith allegations of medical injury.defendants medical expert,marshall trabout,a regional medical director for the docs,testified that smith reported symptoms of itching and headaches were likely side effects of the medications themselves and would not have been caused by the lack of hiv medication.trabout agreed that missing hiv medication can be potentially harmful in some circumstances,possibly leading to viral mutation and drug resistance.however,based on a review of smith medical records,trabout concluded that smith had not developed any drug resistance because of the alleged interruptions in drug treatment and that smith viral load had actually improved during his incarceration trabout also testified that,in his opinion,smith had received very good hiv care at camp pharsalia and that smith had suffered no adverse effects to his health as a result of missing his hiv medication for the brief periods of time at issue.
jury verdict 
after the close of evidence,the district court instructed the jury that smith had to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from a serious medical need in order to prevail on his eighth amendment claim.tracking smith proposed jury instructions,the district court charged the jury as follows 
the term serious medical need means a condition of urgency,one that might produce extreme pain,degeneration or death.in other words,it is a condition presenting a substantial risk of harm.it is not disputed in this case that plaintiff suffers from the hiv virus.if you find that plaintiff condition did not amount to a serious medical need,then you must find for the defendants conversely,if you find that plaintiff condition constituted a serious medical need,you must then consider whether he has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that defendants knew of that condition and disregarded it 
the special verdict sheet that was jointly prepared by the parties mirrored the jury charge.the first question on the verdict sheet asked has plaintiff proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from a serious medical need,yes or no if your answer is no,stop,have the foreperson sign and date the verdict sheet and inform the marshal that you have reached a verdict.the jury returned with a verdict for the defendants,answering no to this critical threshold question.
motion for a new trial 
following the jury verdict,smith moved for a new trial on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict,the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,the jury ignored the district court instructions,and the verdict could not stand as a matter of law.the district court denied the motion for a new trial,rejecting smith argument that his status automatically constituted a serious medical need for eighth amendment purposes.the district court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict based on trabout testimony that although plaintiff was,he suffered no adverse effects from missing his prescriptions for the short periods of time in question.the district court further explained that the jury could have concluded,consistent with the evidence presented at trial,that smith had failed to demonstrate that his health had been placed in substantial jeopardy due to the brief interruptions in his hiv medication.
smith now appeals,arguing that the district court applied the wrong eighth amendment standard in denying his motion for a new trial smith contends that the district court erroneously considered evidence of actual harm in assessing the jury finding of no serious medical need when he was only required to establish a potential for serious future injury in order to state an eighth amendment denial of medical care claim.smith also argues that evidence pointing to an absence of adverse medical effects is only potentially relevant in analyzing questions of deliberate indifference or as part of the initial serious medical need inquiry.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to.for abuse of discretion.see new england ins.healthcare underwriters mut.ins,cir.generally,a motion for a new trial should not be granted unless the trial court is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.atkins new york city,cir quoting lightfoot union carbide,cir.in this case,we need only determine whether the district court abused its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard in evaluating the jury verdict.see gasperini center for humanities,cir a district court abuses its discretion when its decision to deny a motion for a new trial results from an erroneous view of the law.
eighth amendment standard 
in order to establish an eighth amendment claim arising out of inadequate medical care,a prisoner must prove deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.chance armstrong,cir quoting estelle gamble,d.this standard incorporates both objective and subjective elements.the objective medical need element measures the severity of the alleged deprivation,while the subjective deliberate indifference element ensures that the defendant prison official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.see hathaway coughlin,cir.
because the eighth amendment is not a vehicle for bringing medical malpractice claims,nor a substitute for state tort law,not every lapse in prison medical care will rise to the level of a constitutional violation.see estelle,at.snipes detella,cir,cert.denied,d.in estelle gamble,the supreme court explained that the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments encompasses the deliberate failure to treat a prisoner serious illness or injury resulting in the infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering.estelle,at.emphasis added.because society does not expect that prisoners will have unqualified access to health care,a prisoner must first make this threshold showing of serious illness or injury in order to state an eighth amendment claim for denial of medical care.hudson mcmillian,d see also chance,at not all claims of inadequate medical care are constitutionally cognizable.similarly,a prisoner must demonstrate more than an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care by prison officials to successfully establish eighth amendment liability.see,estelle,at.noting that mere negligence in diagnosis or treatment is insufficient to state a valid eighth amendment claim and emphasizing that m edical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.an official acts with the requisite deliberate indifference when that official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,chance,at quoting farmer brennan,d,a state of mind equivalent to the familiar standard of recklessness as used in criminal law.phelps kapnolas,cir per curiam.
in this case,the jury rejected smith eighth amendment claim for failure to show an objectively serious medical need,and did not reach the question of the defendants state of mind.because only the severity of the alleged denial of care is at issue,we therefore need not address whether the evidence also establishes deliberate indifference on the part of the defendants.although the relevant serious medical need standard is well established by our prior decisions,we find it worthwhile to clarify this standard in light of the unique facts and procedural posture of this case.
in a typical eighth amendment denial of medical care case,the prisoner is challenging the defendants failure to provide adequate medical care to treat the prisoner medical condition in this case,however,smith does not complain about the general level of hiv treatment that he received while incarcerated at camp pharsalia.instead,smith eighth amendment claim is based solely on interruptions in the provision of hiv medication prescribed by docs doctors as part of his overall hiv treatment.this case is also procedurally unique,as the serious medical need question was submitted to the jury for factual determination.in several prior decisions,we have examined the relevant record to determine whether a prisoner presented a viable jury question on the issue of serious medical need.see,brock,at motion for summary judgment chance,at motion to dismiss hathaway coughlin,cir motion for directed verdict.we have never had occasion,however,to consider what factors the jury may consider when asked to actually determine whether the prisoner asserted medical need is sufficiently serious to trigger eighth amendment concerns.we therefore address smith adverse effects argument with these considerations in mind.
serious medical need 
smith urges the court to focus on his status as the serious medical need at issue,arguing that he has demonstrated a serious medical need,because it is undisputed that the failure to treat hiv can result in fatal injury.see,montgomery pinchak,cir prisoner diagnosed with hiv has demonstrated a serious medical need for eighth amendment purposes.we do not argue with the proposition that hiv is a serious medical condition that requires medical treatment.however,smith does not contend that the defendants ignored his hiv infection by generally failing to provide appropriate treatment,conduct which may well violate the eighth amendment.rather,it is undisputed that smith was receiving hiv medication and other necessary medical care for his condition.his lawsuit only challenges the defendants failure to provide him with prescription hiv medication during a period in october and a period in january.accordingly,this case is conceptually different from the ordinary denial of medical care case,because smith claim is based on interruptions in the otherwise adequate treatment which he was receiving for his underlying medical condition.
because t he objective component of an eighth amendment claim is necessarily contextual and,hudson,at,the serious medical need inquiry must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each case.when the basis for a prisoner eighth amendment claim is a temporary delay or interruption in the provision of otherwise adequate medical treatment,it is appropriate to focus on the challenged delay or interruption in treatment rather than the prisoner underlying medical condition alone in analyzing whether the alleged deprivation is,in objective terms,sufficiently serious,to support an eighth amendment claim.chance,at.there is no need to distinguish between a prisoner underlying serious medical condition and the circumstances of his serious medical need when the prisoner alleges that prison officials have failed to provide general treatment for his medical condition in a case like this,however,where the prisoner is receiving appropriate treatment for his condition,but,instead brings a narrower denial of medical care claim based on a temporary delay or interruption in treatment,the serious medical need inquiry can properly take into account the severity of the temporary deprivation alleged by the prisoner see estelle,at.in order to state a cognizable claim,a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.montgomery,at to establish an eighth amendment claim based on the denial of medical care,f irst,the plaintiff must make an objective showing that the deprivation was sufficiently serious,or that the result of defendant denial was sufficiently serious emphasis added hudson,at.in evaluating an eighth amendment claim,courts should consider if the alleged wrongdoing was objectively harmful enough to establish a constitutional violation.
as we noted in chance,it the particular risk of harm faced by a prisoner due to the challenged deprivation of care,rather than the severity of the prisoner underlying medical condition,considered in the abstract,that is relevant for eighth amendment purposes.chance,at hill dekalb reg l youth,cir explaining that the seriousness of a delay in medical treatment may be decided by reference to the effect of delay in treatment c onsequently,delay in medical treatment must be interpreted in the context of the seriousness of the medical need,deciding whether the delay worsened the medical condition,and considering the reason for delay emphasis in original.for example,the failure to provide treatment for an otherwise insignificant wound may violate the eighth amendment if the wound develops signs of infection,creating a substantial risk of injury in the absence of appropriate medical treatment.see chance,at.such risks may be absent,however,although an inmate suffers fro
