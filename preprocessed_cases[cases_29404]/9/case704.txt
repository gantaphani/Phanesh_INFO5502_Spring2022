in this appeal we review the grant of a protective order in favor of julio cesar in his official capacity as mayor of the municipality of humacao,puerto rico.nilda et the plaintiffs sought discovery from in order to bolster their claim that humacao was obliged to satisfy a judgment for punitive damages awarded them in a action against predecessor,ramon,and others.obtained the protective order on the ground that no purpose could be served by the proposed discovery because humacao enjoyed immunity from punitive damages liability.the plaintiffs appealed.we vacate and remand.
in the general election of,ramon was elected mayor of humacao,puerto rico,after defeating the incumbent mayor,juan higgins,in a primary challenge.during first year in office,he dismissed a number of municipal employees hired by the former administration,ostensibly as part of an effort to cut costs.those terminated included many who had been political supporters of the defeated incumbent.
in,in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,seventeen of the terminated employees commenced a civil rights action under against,his personnel director,raul ferrer collectively,with,the defendants,and others their complaint alleged that they had been terminated because of their earlier support for higgins and that the terminations violated their rights under the first,fifth and fourteenth amendments.the plaintiffs sought reinstatement,back pay,front pay,compensatory and punitive damages,and attorneys fees.
the suit named and ferrer as defendants in both their personal and official capacities.soon after the suit was filed,invoked the protection of laws ann.tit,commonly known as law,a statute providing defense and indemnification benefits to certain categories of public mayors and they are sued in their personal capacities request for a defense was granted by the puerto rico department of justice in june,and he was thereafter defended,in his personal capacity,by the department of justice.it is not clear from the record whether defense in the suit,which we treat,as a matter of law,as a suit against humacao itself,municipio de san juan,cir,was handled by the same or different counsel.
proceedings before the district court 
the case was tried before a jury in october.after an trial,the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,awarding them a total of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages the district court subsequently ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to reinstatement and granted plaintiffs request for attorneys fees,but denied their request for back pay and declined to rule on the request for front pay until it was determined whether all the plaintiffs actually wished to be reinstated and whether their reinstatement was practicable.
nothing in either the jury verdict or the district court judgment distinguished between the suits against the defendants in their personal and official capacities.such a distinction,had it been made,would have been significant in determining the extent of humacao responsibility for the judgment.because the municipality is the real party in interest in an official capacity suit,a judgment against the defendants in their official capacities would run against humacao directly,at.by contrast,a judgment against the defendants solely in their personal capacities would make humacao liable only indirectly through the workings of the law indemnification provisions 
for nearly two years after the judgment issued,the plaintiffs and defendants negotiated over its requirements,including the amount of fees and interest to be paid and the terms of plaintiffs reinstatement.eventually humacao and its new mayor,reached an agreement with the plaintiffs regarding the compensatory damages and attorneys fees that would be paid and the mechanism by which the plaintiffs would be reinstated.the damages amounts were subsequently paid to the plaintiffs and the reinstatements took place.the municipality refused,however,to pay the punitive damages portion of the award,arguing that the supreme court decision in city of newport fact concerts,d,rendered humacao immune from liability for punitive damages awarded in a action.
humacao refusal to pay the punitive damages award precipitated an additional two years of district court proceedings.this phase of the case began in july,when the district court issued an order directing the plaintiffs,within sixty days,either to submit briefs establishing humacao obligation to pay the punitive damages judgment or to acknowledge that no such liability existed the plaintiffs failed to meet the deadline.instead,more than two months after the deadline passed,the plaintiffs moved for an extension of time,a request which was denied in january.
given the framework established by the court,this denial might have concluded the matter,but it did not.in february,the plaintiffs noticed a deposition of attorney in connection with the punitive damages issue.the defendants sought,and were granted,a protective order preventing the discovery.nothing in the order made clear whether the court considered the plaintiffs punitive damages judgment still viable as a general matter the status of the issue was further muddied when,in april,the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the withdrawal at this time of consideration of the issue who is responsible for the payment of punitive damages emphasis added,suggesting that they reserved the right to revisit the issue.the district court approved the request by margin order,without explanation.
understandably confused,the defendants almost immediately filed a motion requesting clarification of the status of the punitive damages issue.in their motion,the defendants argued that,notwithstanding the permissive language of the plaintiffs motion,the withdrawal should be treated as concluding the district court consideration of the plaintiffs request for punitive damages.this result was dictated,the defendants contended,by the plaintiffs failure to demonstrate humacao liability within the original window established by the court or to obtain an extension of time for making their case.the district court responded with another margin order,this one stating simply the plaintiffs withdrew any claim to punitive damages by motion dated march,granted by this court by margin order dated april.the plaintiffs did not appeal or otherwise respond to this order.
more than nine months later,in march,the plaintiffs noticed the deposition of.in addition to testimony,the plaintiffs sought a variety of documents relating to the grant of defense and indemnification benefits to.moved for a protective order,arguing that,because humacao was immune from any liability for punitive damages,and no other issues were outstanding,the proposed discovery would serve no purpose.the plaintiffs opposed the motion,contending that the discovery would show that humacao had,in fact,waived any immunity it might have had under city of newport.
on april,the district court issued an order granting motion without elaboration.on april,the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of that order.four days later,the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with respect to the april order.on july,the district court entered an order denying reconsideration accompanied by a written opinion.in its opinion,the district court agreed with that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs had no right to recover the punitive damages from humacao and,therefore,that the discovery could serve no purpose.on september,the plaintiffs filed a second notice of appeal concerning the july denial of reconsideration.ultimately,that second notice of appeal was dismissed 
proceedings on appeal 
oral argument for this appeal took place on april.during the hearing,it became clear that the plaintiffs contention that humacao was liable for punitive damages rested heavily on the contents of a small number of documents relating to the law benefits provided to.these plaintiffs counsel claimed to have alleged to contain a clear waiver of humacao immunity.defendants counsel countered that they had reviewed the same documents,and had found no such waiver of immunity.
perceiving an opportunity to expedite the resolution of an issue that had lingered before the district court for some time,we directed the defendants to produce the requested documents to both plaintiffs counsel and this court within ten days.we further directed that the plaintiffs to inform us,once they had reviewed the documents,whether they continued to maintain that humacao had waived its immunity.we retained jurisdiction over the matter pending compliance with our order.
the documents having been produced,and the plaintiffs continuing to assert that they demonstrate a waiver of humacao immunity,we now consider the plaintiffs appeal.
although the discovery issue before us is quite narrow,the context in which it arises is complicated and touches upon a number of difficult and unresolved questions of law.few of these questions receive more than cursory treatment in the parties briefs,and we do not consider them ripe for our attention.however,in the interest of providing guidance to the district court on remand,we include some discussion of these issues where we find it appropriate.
jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits,we address an argument offered by as a challenge to our jurisdiction over the subject matter of this appeal.although confusingly presented,the thrust of contention is that the plaintiffs lost their right to have this court review the punitive damages issue,in any form,by failing to respond to the district court ruling on the defendants motion for clarification.asserts that the district court may order,stating that the plaintiffs had withdrawn any claim of punitive damages,constituted a conclusive determination by the district court that its consideration of the punitive damages issue was at an end.when the plaintiffs did not appeal the order within the thirty days allowed by fed.a a,argues,the order became final,and that deprived this court of jurisdiction on any matter related to the municipality liability for payment of punitive damages.
argument is without merit.to begin with,the record does not support premise that the district court ruling on the motion for clarification was meant to,or effectively did,signal an end to the court consideration of the punitive damages issue.it is true that the ambiguous language of the margin order could be read as a statement that the court considered the issue to have been permanently withdrawn.however,the district court subsequent actions belie such an interpretation.if the court understood its clarification ruling to have finally disposed of the punitive damages issue,we think it only logical that the protective order would have been granted on that basis.yet the court written opinion offers a different explanation,grounding the protective order in humacao supposed immunity from punitive damages merits issue that,by reasoning,was no longer even before the court.has advanced no compelling reason why we should accord the district court earlier order a preclusive effect that the district court itself did not observe or even acknowledge,and we decline to do so.
furthermore,even if the district court grant of a protective order had been premised on its earlier,unappealed determination that the punitive damages issue had been withdrawn,we still would have jurisdiction over this appeal of the protective order the defendants do not dispute that the notice of appeal was timely filed with respect to this order.we also think it evident that this order was,under the circumstances,a final decision of the district court and thus within the jurisdictional grant conferred by as a result,our jurisdiction over the subject matter of this appeal stands on solid ground,and we proceed to its merits.
protective order in favor of 
our precedent makes clear that the plaintiffs face a heavy burden in seeking to overturn the district court protective order.under the abuse of discretion standard applied in discovery matters,we may reverse a district court only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,that is,where the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.ameristar jet charter,signal composites,cir quoting mack great atl.pac.tea,cir.however,it is also that an order denying or limiting discovery may not be upheld if it rests on an incorrect legal standard or a misapplication of the law to the relevant facts.see reed baxter,cir vacating a protective order premised on a mistaken application of the law of privilege springer seaman,cir vacating an order denying discovery based upon an incorrect conclusion regarding the relevance of the information sought trevino celanese,cir vacating a protective order limiting discovery where district court gave no explanation for its actions and appeals court could find no sound reason for granting the protective order see also pye ex rel.nlrb excel case ready,cir a court abuses its discretion if it applies an improper legal standard or erroneously applies the law to particular facts.finding the district court protective order in favor of to be unsupportable on the grounds given,and discerning no alternative ground adequate to sustain it,we conclude that vacatur of the protective order is required.
district court justification 
in its written opinion,the district court found a protective order in favor of to be justified because,as a matter of law,humacao can not be liable for the punitive damages judgment.the district court reasoning appears to rest on two grounds first,that recovery is barred by the commonwealth of puerto rico sovereign immunity,and,second,that recovery of punitive damages is prohibited by the scope of law.we address these issues in turn.
the district court discussion of sovereign immunity focuses entirely on language in law stating that the statute is not to be construed as a waiver of the commonwealth sovereign is,the immunity afforded it under the eleventh amendment.see,t he commonwealth is protected by the eleventh amendment to the same extent as any state citing metcalf eddy,aqueduct sewer,cir.nothing in the district court opinion explains why it believed the commonwealth eleventh amendment immunity was implicated by this case,and we see no reason why it would be.the commonwealth is not a named defendant in this action.nor is there any indication that the commonwealth would be called upon to pay the damages plaintiffs seek.although,in many applications,law requires the commonwealth to pay the judgment of an indemnified official,see laws ann.tit,stating that,in general,t he secretary of the treasury shall pay the judgments,costs and attorney fees imposed on the defendants from the available funds in the treasury of puerto rico,the provisions of the statute relating to indemnification of mayors and indicate that judgments in these cases are paid by the municipalities themselves,see id.explaining that,when law benefits are provided to mayors and,the resulting judgments,costs and attorney fees shall be defrayed from available funds in the corresponding municipality 
indeed,it appears undisputed that the portions of the judgment in this case that have been compensatory damages and attorneys paid by humacao.in light of these facts,this case is clearly distinguishable from those in which we have found the eleventh amendment to present a bar to recovery under law.see at affirming a district court denial,on eleventh amendment grounds,of plaintiffs request for an order directing the commonwealth to accord law benefits to the defendants and pay the judgment fernandez chardon,cir,aff sub nom.chardon fumero soto,d holding that the eleventh amendment precluded a district court from issuing an order requiring the commonwealth to pay a damages award entered against officials of the puerto rico department of education.
in addition,the district court analysis appears to rest on the assumption that the plaintiffs only have a judgment against in his personal capacity,and thus may only reach humacao through law.we find nothing in the record before us to support this assumption and think that it may well be incorrect this is significant because,if there is a judgment against in his official capacity,it runs against humacao itself and the commonwealth immunity is irrelevant with respect to that judgment.see monell dep t of soc,d noting that state sovereign immunity is no bar to municipal liability under.
the district court reliance on law as a basis for the protective order is also inapposite.to begin with,we question whether the issue of law scope was open to the district court to interpret,in light of this court precedent on the subject.in gonzalez torres toledo,cir,we specifically considered the scope of indemnification available under puerto rico law,in order to determine whether an individual capacity defendant,once afforded law benefits,retained an interest in the judgment sufficient to maintain an appeal.see id.at.the defendant in question had been the target of a suit and had a damages a significant punitive damages against him.id.the commonwealth,acting pursuant to law,moved to indemnify him against the judgment,but the defendant nonetheless sought to appeal the verdict.id.in connection with this issue,the secretary of justice of puerto rico filed a certification with this court stating that the commonwealth had assumed full payment of any judgment that might be entered.id.emphasis added.thereafter,this court held that the superintendent was under no personal obligation as a result of the judgment,and thus not a real party in interest,id.at implying that the commonwealth had assumed payment of all the damages,including the punitive damages.
furthermore,even if the issue was properly considered by the district court,the conclusion the court reaches could not be supported on the grounds given.in reasoning that law must be interpreted to preclude indemnification of punitive damages,the court relied not on the language of law itself but on two unrelated statutory provisions describing the recovery available in suits brought against the commonwealth or its municipalities under various puerto rico causes of action the district court offers no explanation as to why the scope of liability described in these statutes should influence our understanding of law indemnification provisions and we find its approach to interpreting the statute unconvincing.
finally,we reiterate that the district court reasoning ignores the plaintiffs claim that they have a judgment directly against humacao deriving from the official capacity suit.because law is only implicated where there is a personal capacity judgment against an official,the district court second rationale would be no bar to recovery against humacao on an official capacity judgment.
city of newport 
although we find that the district court failed to articulate a valid basis for its conclusion that humacao could not be liable for the punitive damages judgment,we may still uphold the protective order if the court decision to grant it can be justified on another ground having record support,hodgens dynamics,cir.on appeal,the defendants press the argument,offered in their motion for a protective order but not reached by the district court,that the court decision may be justified as an application of the principles outlined by the supreme court in city of newport.we now turn to this contention.
in city of newport,the court held that,as a general rule,municipalities are immune from punitive damages judgments when sued under.at.in reaching this result,the court employed a framework it has used on a number of occasions to determine whether immunities available at common law should be allowed as affirmative defenses in actions.id.at discussing court approach to incorporating immunities and citing cases.under this approach,the court considered,first,whether incorporation of the immunity was consistent with the history of,and,second,whether the policies served by the immunity were compatible with the purposes of.id.the court concluded that incorporation of the common law immunity from punitive damages was justified under both prongs of the analysis.after an extensive review of contemporary cases and the available legislative history,the court found that municipal immunity from punitive damages was not open to serious question when the statute was enacted,id.at,and that there was no evidence that congress intended to disturb the settled immunity,id.at.in addition,the court concluded that such immunity was not inconsistent with the purposes of,reasoning that the imposition of punitive damages awards was likely to provide a windfall to taxpayers significantly advancing the compensation or deterrence aims of the statute.id.at.
it is undisputed that humacao is a municipality that would,as an initial matter,be entitled to the immunity defense recognized by city of newport.the question for us,then,is whether the defendants are correct that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs can not show a waiver of humacao city of newport immunity,and,therefore,can not establish humacao liability for the punitive damages.this question can not be answered with certainty on the present record.however,we find that the plaintiffs have articulated plausible grounds supporting a possible waiver of immunity,and therefore conclude that the district court order can not be justified on the basis of city of newport 
the plaintiffs principal contention,both below and on appeal,is that certain documents relating to the extension of law benefits to and acceptance of those benefits operate as a waiver of humacao immunity.the plaintiffs provide limited detail concerning the contents of these documents however,they suggest that,among other things,the requested discovery will reveal one or more resolutions of humacao municipal council indicating a consent to pay the full judgment,including punitive damages.in response,the defendants offer a variety of arguments that,in their view,establish that the plaintiffs can not succeed in proving waiver,no matter what the documents may say.we need consider only two of these arguments the first focuses on whether had authority to waive humacao immunity the second challenges the plaintiffs ability to make any waiver argument at this point in the proceedings,given the plaintiffs failure to do so at trial.
the defendants first argument is easily rejected.although the plaintiffs do imply in their briefs that may be responsible for waiving humacao immunity,this is not their only theory for waiver.see pl.br.alleging the existence of a resolution by which,in accepting legal representation by the justice department pursuant to law,the municipality accepted also to pay any judgment entered in the case emphasis added.the defendants do not appear to dispute that humacao municipal legislature could have executed a waiver of its city of newport immunity,and precedent supports the view that such a waiver is possible.see,krzeminski,cir holding that municipality indemnification agreement with defendant constituted a waiver of its city of newport immunity cornwell city of riverside,cir holding that city of newport did not bar municipality from deciding to pay a punitive damages judgment for an official pursuant to a state statute that allowed,but did not require,municipalities to pay such damages see also bell,at holding that state indemnification statute waived municipality immunity from punitive damages with respect to indemnified judgments.as a result,the defendants argument,even if correct,would not preclude the possibility that the plaintiffs might prove a waiver of immunity.
the defendants second contention fares no better,at least on the present record.in arguing that the plaintiffs were required to make their arguments at trial,the defendants take it as a given that the immunity defense itself was properly raised below.this is far from clear.our review of the record indicates that the defendants made only one bare,unexplained reference to nonliability for punitive damages in their answer and never said anything else that could be construed as raising the issue until long after the judgment became final.furthermore,the language that appeared in the answer failed to mention either the word immunity or the city of newport case,nor did it attempt to distinguish between the personal capacity suit and the official capacity suit.as a result,it was
