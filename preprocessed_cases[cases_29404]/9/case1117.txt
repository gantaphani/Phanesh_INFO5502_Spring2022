background 
gao is a native and citizen of china.he entered the united states on march,as a visitor.on december,gao filed an affirmative application for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis that he had been persecuted in china on account of his political opinion.gao was subsequently interviewed by an asylum officer,who determined that gao was barred by statute from a grant of asylum because evidence indicated that he had ordered,incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of others the matter was therefore referred to an immigration judge.
on november,the government filed a motion to pretermit gao asylum application on the basis that he was a persecutor under section b a i of the immigration and nationality act ina,b a i.on february,gao had a hearing before the ij in which he testified as follows.from february to october,gao was the chief officer of the quingdao city culture management bureau.gao supervised approximately inspectors who were assigned to different districts.gao bureau was responsible for inspecting bookstores to determine if they were selling any prohibited materials.prohibited materials were items that were banned by the chinese government cultural laws,such as works that violated copyright laws,works containing sexual content,and works of a politically sensitive nature.every year,gao and his inspectors would receive a list from the quingdao city culture management administrative office that contained the titles of each prohibited item.if prohibited materials were found,the inspectors would confiscate the items and issue a violation certificate.gao bureau did not have authority to impose any sanction beyond confiscating the prohibited materials and issuing citations.when they encountered a serious case,which occurred when either the seller was a repeat offender or had more than prohibited items,gao would report the matter to the vice president of his bureau,who would then determine whether the matter should be referred to the industrial and commercial management bureau.the industrial and commercial bureau would then decide whether to impose a sanction such as levying a fine or canceling the seller business license.gao stated that based on his knowledge of chinese law,he was aware that the most serious sanction that a violator could receive was a sentence of years in prison,but during his time with the bureau,he did not know of anyone who had been arrested or jailed.the most severe penalty that occurred during his tenure with the bureau was the revocation of an owner business license.however,the possibility existed that a serious matter could be referred to the public security bureau,which did have the authority to make arrests and pursue criminal charges against a violator.gao did not have any input in such decisions,and his authority ceased once the matter had been referred to the vice president of his bureau.
as part of his job,gao would on occasion personally conduct inspections of bookstores.this occurred at least once a month.during these inspections,bookstore owners would sometimes give books to gao to have him assess whether they were prohibited.gao started reading some of these books,including books about democracy,western culture,and works that were critical of the chinese government.in these cases,gao would not report the violations and would not confiscate the books.he also began giving these books to his friends to read.gao testified that although he was concerned that he himself was violating the regulations,he believed these were important books and the chinese people should be told about what their government was doing.
generally,when gao conducted inspections,he went by himself.on one occasion,however,on october,he conducted an inspection with two other inspectors.during this inspection,he found a book entitled the prince party of china,which was a prohibited book that he had previously read.gao told the owner to get rid of the book,but he did not confiscate it because he had changed his attitude toward these types of books and now believed that they should be sold.although gao thought his actions went unnoticed by the two inspectors who had accompanied him,a few days later,his supervisor came to him and told him that he had violated the rules by failing to detect and confiscate a prohibited item.gao was temporarily suspended from his duties by his supervisor.then,on october,two police officers came and took gao to the public security bureau for questioning.gao testified that they confronted him about his failure to confiscate the book on october,which he denied.the police officers then began beating him with their batons in order to force him to admit that he was working with the book sellers to sell prohibited materials.gao was ultimately detained fifteen days before he was released.the officers released him so that he could obtain medical treatment for the injuries caused by the beating,but told him he would have to report to the police station every week.soon after he was released,gao received notice that he had been fired from his job because he had violated the rules and assisted book sellers in distributing prohibited materials.
gao reported to the police station as instructed twice,but then learned that the police planned to bring criminal charges against him.he therefore fled china and came to the united states.while in the united states,gao has learned from his wife that police have repeatedly come to his house looking for him because had failed to report to the police station as required.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij rendered his oral decision.the ij first made an overall positive credibility finding with regard to gao testimony.the ij further found that gao possesses a fear of persecution should he be compelled to return to china and has also demonstrated by a clear probability of the evidence that he would be subjected to persecution should he be compelled to return to china.nevertheless,the ij denied gao applications for asylum and withholding of removal because he concluded that gao was a persecutor within the meaning of the refugee statute due to his prior work with the culture management bureau.the ij determined that any arrests or penalties imposed upon individuals violating the precepts of the communist party in china had to be effected with the activity and acquiescence of the respondent and the management bureau of which he was the administrator.therefore,the ij found that gao activities were the direct link between the dissemination of materials deemed prohibited by the chinese government and the enforcement or the application of sanctions by the various organs of the chinese government.the ij further cited the state department country report on china,which indicated that the chinese government was responsible for rampant human rights abuses and maintains tight restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press.in particular,the country report showed that china has cracked down on printing houses and the publishing of books which the government considers to be politically sensitive.from this,the ij concluded that gao role in the pattern and practice of persecution of publishers,journalists,and book sellers is integral to the ability of the chinese government to persecute those individuals.on june,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision without further explanation 
on july,gao timely filed a petition for review in this court.while the petition was pending,gao was taken into custody by immigration officials and placed in a detention center.on june,this court granted gao motion to expedite review based on his attorney affidavit stating that gao physical and mental health had severely deteriorated while in immigration custody such that he had become suicidal.the case was placed on the court calendar for july,and in light of the expedited nature of the proceedings,we issued an order on july,indicating our disposition of the matter.we now explain the basis of our decision.
discussion 
asylum is available to an individual who establishes that he or she is a refugee under section a of the ina,a.see b a.refugees are persons who are unable or unwilling to return to their native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.similarly,withholding of removal is available to any person whose life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a.both forms of relief,however,specifically exclude individuals who ordered,incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a i see also b b i.the definition of refugee also explicitly exempts any person who ordered,incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.these provisions are known as the persecutor bar,and render an applicant statutorily ineligible for either asylum or withholding of removal even if the applicant can otherwise satisfy the requirements for obtaining those forms of relief.
in this case,the ij found that gao had satisfied his burden of demonstrating a fear of persecution on account of political opinion as required under the asylum statute,as well as a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened if returned to china as required for withholding of removal.both forms of relief were denied solely on the basis of the persecutor bar.because the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision without adding any further explanation,we review the ij decision directly.see ming xia chen bia,cir.we review de novo the ij legal conclusion that the tasks performed by gao rendered him a persecutor under the statute.see khouzam ashcroft,cir the bia application of law to undisputed facts is reviewed de novo.mirzoyan gonzales,cir per curiam determination of whether the facts meet the legal definition of persecution is a mixed question of law and fact,which we review de novo.we review the underlying factual findings supporting this conclusion under the substantial evidence standard,upholding them if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also b b.an applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she has satisfied the requirements for asylum or withholding of removal.see b b b c.if the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.d.
in this case,there is no evidence that gao ordered,incited,or participated in any act of persecution.thus,the question before this court is whether the ij correctly concluded that gao,through his actions as an inspector with the culture management bureau,assisted in the persecution of others.we hold that the record does not support this conclusion.
in evaluating a persecutor bar claim,it must be remembered that this provision authorizes the deportation of individuals who have established that they would likely be persecuted if sent back to their native country.thus,courts must be cautious before permitting generalities or attenuated links to constitute assistance.in this case,the ij properly focused his analysis on the fact that the chinese cultural laws that gao bureau enforced permitted the arrest and imprisonment of book store owners who distributed politically sensitive materials.as the ij recognized,the arrest and detention of individuals for selling books containing politically disfavored views can constitute persecution on account of political opinion.see chen ins,cir noting that the term persecution includes more than threats to life or freedom quoting begzatowski ins,cir noting that types of actions that might constitute persecution include detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,and imprisonment internal quotation marks omitted manzur dep t of homeland,cir ij erred in failing to adequately explain why petitioners confinement for their political views did not amount to persecution.
however,the mere fact that gao may be associated with an enterprise that engages in persecution is insufficient by itself to trigger the effects of the persecutor bar.as the supreme court dicta in fedorenko united states,d,illustrates,a guilt by association approach to the persecutor bar is improper 
a n individual who did no more than cut the hair of female inmates in concentration camps before they were executed can not be found to have assisted in the persecution of civilians.on the other hand,there can be no question that a guard who was issued a uniform and armed with a rifle and a pistol,who was paid a stipend and was regularly allowed to leave the concentration camp to visit a nearby village,and who admitted to shooting at escaping inmates on orders from the commandant of the camp,fits within the statutory language about persons who assisted in the persecution of civilians.other cases may present more difficult problems but we need decide only this case.
id.at.see also maikovskis ins,cir we do not mean to suggest that an alien inactive membership in an organization bent on persecution or that his tangential provision of services to such an organization would suffice to show that the alien assisted or otherwise participated in such persecution in re,m ere membership in an organization,even one which engages in persecution,is not sufficient to bar one from relief,but only if one action or inaction furthers that persecution in some way.
we have used this dicta from fedorenko as a guide in evaluating whether an individual had assisted in acts of persecution.see zhang jian xie ins,cir united states reimer,cir maikovskis,at united states sprogis,cir see also miranda alvarado gonzales,cir noting that the supreme court somewhat cryptic footnote in fedorenko has since become the principal guide to interpreting persecutor exceptions generally.in xie,this court most recent and detailed discussion of the persecutor bar,we observed that when determining whether an individual actions constituted assistance in persecution,our prior cases looked not to the voluntariness of the person actions,but to his behavior as a whole.where the conduct was active and had direct consequences for the victims,we concluded that it was assistance in persecution.where the conduct was tangential to the acts of oppression and passive in nature,however,we declined to hold that it amounted to such assistance.at.applying these principles,we then examined whether xie,who had worked as a driver for the changle county department of health in china fujian province,had assisted in persecution within the meaning of the ina.although most of xie tasks were mundane,he had on occasion transported pregnant women to hospitals in the locked back of a van,against their will,so that county officials could perform forced abortions on them pursuant to china mandatory family planning policies.id.at.we found that xie action contributed directly to the persecution because b y driving the van in which the women were locked,xie ensured that
