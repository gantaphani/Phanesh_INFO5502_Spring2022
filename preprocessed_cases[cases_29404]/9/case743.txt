plaintiff appellant audra lynn harris is a former inmate of bedford hills correctional facility.she testified at her deposition that,while incarcerated at bedford hills,a male officer and three female officers entered her room to take down cotton that she had removed from her mattress and pasted to her room windows.the male officer then demanded to know if harris had any more cotton.according to harris testimony,which was not disputed under oath,after she said no,the three female officers grabbed her,threw her to the ground,lifted her smock,and forcibly opened her legs to allow the male officer to visually inspect her genitalia for any additional cotton.
harris later brought a claim against the officers,defendants appellees michael miller,ella anderson,valerie bryant,and robin trotter collectively,the appellees,for violations of her constitutional rights based on this search.after the appellees moved for summary judgment,the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon,determined that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that the appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.because we respectfully conclude that the district court analysis of this claim rested on an incomplete assessment of the law,particularly the fourth amendment protection of an inmate right to bodily privacy,and because we conclude that there are genuine disputes of material fact,we vacate so much of the district court order as dismissed the claim concerning the search for cotton,and we remand for further proceedings.
background 
the following facts are either uncontroverted or construed in the light most favorable to harris,the nonmovant.harris was incarcerated at bedford hills correctional facility in bedford hills,new york,from september,to february,for burglary and criminal contempt.catherine mcdermott coffin,the forensic unit chief of the new york state central new york psychiatric center satellite unit at bedford hills,explained that harris received a level designation for treatment level at the time of her admission.a level designation is the highest level designation and is assigned to individuals displaying symptoms of mental illness,with active symptoms requiring care and treatment patients who require frequent support and interventions by the mental health staff.id.
during her incarceration at bedford hills,harris filed at least grievances against prison staff,at least of them prior to the events at issue in this appeal.harris alleges that throughout her incarceration,her civil rights were violated by bedford hills correction officers and security staff due to their pattern of ongoing abuse of authority,fabricated misbehavior reports,malicious and calculated cell searches,harassment,retaliation,deliberate indifference,intentional misconduct,as well as verbal and physical abuse and beatings.she further alleges that she was constantly harassed and retaliated against by officers because she wrote grievances when they violated her rights and the rules.
following a series of incidents that are outside the scope of this appeal,officers transferred harris to a observation room to monitor her more closely.in the observation room,officers directed harris to change into a smock.harris,who had been in an observation room before,acknowledged that changing into a smock was standard procedure.at her deposition,harris explained that she attempted to put the smock on over her clothing while getting undressed,but the officers told her she could not undress in that manner.she stated that the officers proceeded to knock her down and pull off her clothing,injuring her in the process,before throwing the smock at her.it is unclear from the record which officers were involved in this incident.harris contends that she then requested medical assistance from nearby nurses,but the officers who had changed her clothing refused to allow the nurses to tend to her.
at that point,harris attempted to use her mattress to block the observation room windows.she explained at her deposition i put up my mattress again so i could be seen,because i felt humiliated.i felt like i had been raped,and nobody would help me.harris then ripped open her mattress,which may have been torn already,and started using water to put the mattress cotton stuffing on the windows so that she could be seen.
what occurred after harris began pasting the cotton to the windows is the focus of this appeal.at her deposition,harris testified that a male officer,miller,and three female identified as anderson,bryant,and trotterentered her room and started taking down the cotton while harris stood in the shower.at her deposition,harris recounted the events that followed 
and miller,said you have any more cotton and i said no.he told me to lift up my smock.and i said,i do have anything.i said,you ca do that.you are a man.and then he nodded to the three officers,and they snatched me on the ground,threw me on the ground,and they started like i tried to keep my legs closed,and they pulled my legs apart,lift up my smock.and they opened my legs and he at my legs between my legs.and then they threw my legs down,and then i started screaming.i started screaming.i realized i had a cut.
shortly after this incident,miller,with the assistance of others,caused harris to be injected with antipsychotic medication.
several weeks later,harris filed a grievance complaining about the april,search.the description she provided in that grievance is consistent with her initial complaint filed in the district court on september,her amended complaint filed on november,her deposition testimony on november,and,finally,her declaration in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment filed on november.
harris description is also the only evidence in the record detailing the april,search the appellees did not offer any evidence contradicting harris description of the incident,such as an affidavit from miller stating that the search never happened or explaining that it did not happen as harris describes.instead,the appellees only denial that the search occurred was in their briefs filed in the district court.moreover,the evidence that the appellees submitted to the district court relating to the incident corroborates much of harris description,although it is silent on the officers conduct.for example,the appellees submitted an inmate misbehavior report dated april,which states that,on april,
while conducting an on watch with inmate harris,after discovering she was moving her mattress to the shower,anderson gave her several direct orders to move it.inmate harris proceeded to rip a hole in the mattress place it contents on the floor and the glass she used water as a paste blocking anderson view.
they also submitted the following entry from harris medical file,also dated april,
inmate has been on infirmary for several days,but today,became combative irrational,prompting a phone call to omh inmate therapist,spatarella,attended pt.on the infirmary requested observation in the infirmary.upon nurse attempted assessment,inmate verbally abusive,demanding some cream for her arm but had been pulling apart her mattress,trying to flood her cell,laying in the shower refusing to come out.at one point,pt.very angry,blocking her window with her robe,and plastering her window with wet paper towels,blocking co view.inmate refused illegible ordered stat by md,and received illegible zyprexa.
ii.procedural history 
on september,appearing pro se,harris filed suit in the district court for the southern district of new york.as with many pro se litigants,harris pleadings are less than clear,naming a plethora of individuals and asserting at least eight claims.on september,following the close of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.on august,the district court granted that motion in its entirety.see harris fischer,civ.cm jlc,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.harris timely filed a notice of appeal on august.
on december,a motions panel of this court appointed pro bono counsel for harris and directed counsel to brief whether the april,search performed by the appellees violated harris constitutional rights.the motions panel dismissed all of harris remaining claims as to all other defendants as lacking an arguable basis in law and fact.accordingly,the only claim we address in this opinion is harris remaining claim that the april,search performed by the appellees violated her constitutional rights.
iii.discussion 
harris argues that the search violated both her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and her eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.the district court correctly recognized that courts should liberally construe pleadings and briefs submitted by pro se litigants,reading such submissions to raise the strongest arguments they suggest.harris,dist.lexis,at,wl,at quoting bertin united states,cir.in analyzing harris allegations,however,the district court appears to have construed them as raising only an eighth amendment claim,even though the district court drew on case law from both the fourth and eighth amendment contexts in its analysis.see harris,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.whether the district court assumed that the fourth amendment did not protect an inmate right to bodily privacy is unclear.because we respectfully believe that the district court analysis rested on an incomplete assessment of the law,we take this opportunity to state the legal principles that should guide the district court on remand.
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against which summary judgment was granted and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.sec.plans,cuna mut.ins.soc y,cir quoting wachovia bank,vcg special opportunities master fund,cir.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.but a motion for summary judgment must be rejected if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.abdu brisson delta air lines,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby.
and i t is well established that a court is ordinarily obligated to afford a special solicitude to pro se litigants,tracy freshwater,cir,particularly where motions for summary judgment are concerned,jackson fed.express,cir 
b.the fourth amendment 
while acknowledging that the fourth amendment proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the prison cell,hudson palmer,we held more than twenty years ago that maintenance of prison security is not burdened unduly by the recognition that inmates do retain a limited right to bodily privacy,covino patrissi,cir.we are aware of no intervening supreme court decision calling that holding into doubt,and we reiterate today that inmates retain a limited right to bodily privacy under the fourth amendment.
the prison context does affect,however,the way that courts must analyze alleged violations of this fourth amendment right.courts assessing an inmate claim that officers infringed his or her right to bodily privacy must undertake a inquiry first,the court must determine whether the inmate has exhibit ed an actual,subjective expectation of bodily privacy and second,the court must determine whether the prison officials had sufficient justification to intrude on the inmate fourth amendment rights.id.at.
in considering the second question,courts apply one of two separate but overlapping frameworks.if the inmate fourth amendment claim challenges a prison regulation or policy,courts typically analyze the claim under turner safley.under turner,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.id.at.courts make this determination with reference to four factors discussed in turner.see covino,at discussing the turner factors.
but if the inmate fourth amendment claim challenges an isolated search,courts typically apply the standard set forth in bell wolfish,see,byrd maricopa cty.sheriff dep t,cir en banc because byrd did not challenge the constitutionality of the contraband policy,and because the district court focused on the facts of the actual search conducted rather than on the provisions of the contraband policy,we apply the bell factors rather than those articulated in turner,which addresses inmate challenges to regulations.as the bell court observed,t he test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.at.instead,
i n each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion,the manner in which it is conducted,the justification for initiating it,and the place in which it is conducted.
id.because harris challenges an isolated search rather than a policy indeed,neither party identifies what the relevant policy is at bedford hills,bell test governs the present analysis.
the scope of the intrusion 
we begin by noting that the first bell factor the scope of the intrusion varies with the type of search.there are at least three types of searches that implicate an inmate right to bodily privacy 
a strip search,though an umbrella term,generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual,without any scrutiny of the subject body cavities.a visual body cavity search extends to visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.a manual body cavity search includes some degree of touching or probing of body cavities.
cookish,at quoting blackburn snow,cir.the scope of the intrusion also varies depending on who searches whom,whether the search involved an officer of the same gender as the inmate.each of these factors the type of search and the person conducting the search is independently relevant to bell reasonableness inquiry.
a.the type of search 
regardless of who performs the search,a visual body cavity search,such as the one conducted here,is invasive a strip search that involves a stranger peering without consent at a naked individual,and in particular at the most private portions of that person body,is a serious invasion of privacy.florence bd.of chosen freeholders,breyer,dissenting see also canedy boardman,cir o ne of the clearest forms of degradation in western society is to strip a person of his clothes.the right to be free from strip searches and degrading body inspections is thus basic to the concept of privacy.quoting george trubow,privacy law and practice,cookish,at a severe if not gross interference with a person privacy occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.quoting arruda fair,cir.
b.who performs the search 
w hile all forced observations or inspections of the naked body implicate a privacy concern,it is generally considered a greater invasion to have one naked body viewed by a member of the opposite sex.canedy,at see also byrd,f d at we approach this issue by reiterating our longstanding recognition that t he desire to shield one unclothed figure from the view of strangers,and particularly strangers of the opposite sex,is impelled by elementary and personal dignity.quoting york story,cir.for this reason,c ourts throughout the country have universally frowned upon strip searches in the absence of an emergency or exigent circumstances.byrd,at see also lee downs,cir most people,however,have a special sense of privacy in their genitals,and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be especially demeaning and humiliating.when not reasonably necessary,that sort of degradation is not to be visited upon those confined in our prisons.fortner thomas,cir citing lee and join ing other circuits in recognizing a prisoner constitutional right to bodily privacy.
indeed,standards in prison management typically discourage strip searches.for example,the national prison rape elimination commission report commission report determined that,t o prevent abuse,the commission recommended standard on this subject strictly prohibits staff from conducting strip and visual body cavity in the case of an of their extraordinarily intrusive nature.byrd,at quoting the commission report at.likewise,the american correctional association recommended standard for strip searches provide s that,except in emergency situations,visual inspections of inmate body cavities are conducted by officers of the same sex,in private.id.quoting standards for adult correctional institutions.
here,a male officer visually inspected harris genitalia,and both the type of search a visual body cavity search and the person performing the search a man are independently relevant to considering the scope of that intrusion under bell.
the manner in which the search was conducted 
a strip search conducted in a professional manner is more reasonable than one that is not.grummett rushen,cir emphasizing that t he record indicates that the searches are performed by the female guards in a professional manner and with respect for the inmates.but see byrd,at w e have consistently recognized the frightening and humiliating invasion occasioned by a strip search,even when conducted with all due courtesy.quoting way cty.of ventura,cir.
as the supreme court stated in bell o n occasion a security guard may conduct the search in an abusive fashion.such abuse can not be condoned.the searches must be conducted in a reasonable manner.bell,at citations omitted.here,it is unclear from the record,viewed in the light most favorable to harris,why the visual body cavity search was conducted in such a violent and forceful manner,much less why it was conducted by a man when female officers were readily available to do the search.see,lee,at i t was wholly unnecessary for the male guards to remain in the room and to restrain the plaintiff while her underclothing was forcefully removed.
the justification for initiating the search 
it is difficult to assess the appellees justification for the search here because they provided no evidence controverting harris description of events instead,they provided in their briefs a blanket denial that the search ever occurred and,in the alternative,a vague justification,assuming the search occurred as harris describes.for courts to be able to assess the reasonableness of an intrusion on an inmate constitutional rights,supreme court precedent suggests that officers must provide a justification that is supported by record evidence.florence.at d eference must be given to the officials in charge of the jail unless there is substantial evidence demonstrating their response to the situation is exaggerated.petitioner has not met this standard,and the record provides full justifications for the procedures used.citation and quotation marks omitted turner,at w ith respect to the security concern emphasized in petitioners brief the creation of love triangles petitioners have pointed to nothing in the record suggesting that the marriage regulation was viewed as preventing such entanglements.
circuit courts have similarly required a justification for inmate searches that is supported by record evidence.see,byrd,at noting that officer trial testimony d id not specifically address the availability of the male officers to conduct the search of the male plaintiff id.at a lthough valid reasons to search the inmates existed generally,there was no justification given for conducting a strip search.id.at reversing district court decision that the strip search did not violate the plaintiff fourth amendment rights,and ruling that the strip search of byrd was unreasonable as a matter of law hayes marriott,cir vacating summary judgment that was based on unsworn statements by prison officials as to the circumstances of the challenged search bono saxbe,cir bell should not be extended to the facts of this case without a showing that there is some risk that contraband will be smuggled into marion penitentiary during,supervised visits,or that some other risk within the prison will be presented.
requiring record evidence to support an officer justification for a visual body cavity search is sensible we would,for example,almost certainly find a constitutional violation for a search that objectively appears to have been conducted solely to gratify the sexual desires of the officer.crawford cuomo,cir recognizing under the eighth amendment that a search may not be undertaken maliciously or for the purposes of sexually abusing an inmate.without record evidence supporting the officer justification,courts will have difficulty assessing whether the officer had an objectively reasonable basis for conducting the search.
the circumstances here demonstrate the point.because the defendants supplied only a vague justification for the search in their motion papers and did not provide evidence supporting any justification,the district court resorted to supplying its own hypothetical justification 
plaintiff was creating a security risk by tearing apart her mattress and trying to use its contents to shield herself from the view of corrections officers who had a legitimate right to observe her.ascertaining that plaintiff did not have the means to obstruct their view is a legitimate penological goal,which fully justifies the brief visual inspection of plaintiff genitalia.
harris,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.on appeal,appellees concede that additional facts which were not before the district court render this justification questionable because it would have been difficult for harris to conceal enough cotton to effectively obstruct the entirety of the windows,which reach from the floor to the ceiling,and span the width of both the front and back sides of the cell.appellees br.had the district court known these facts,we believe it likely would have concluded that the search of harris genitalia for cotton was an exaggerated,see florence.at,or even unnecessary,see hodges stanley,cir,response to the situation.
appellees advance an alternative theory that the alleged visual search would have been justified by the legitimate penological interest of ensuring that a potentially suicidal inmate not possess any object by which she might harm herself or others.appellees br.at.appellees have not cited any record evidence,however,that harris,who was restrained by three female officers at the time of the search,was in such imminent danger of harming herself that the search had to be conducted immediately by the male officer at the scene.at oral argument,defense counsel also candidly admitted that there is no record evidence indicating that the officers ever searched harris most logical place to search if the officers were concerned that harris would attempt to use cotton to choke herself to death.given the current state of the record,a factfinder could find appellees proffered justification unconvincing.
as these inconsistent theories demonstrate,it is difficult,if not impossible,for courts to determine the reasonableness of a visual body cavity search without record evidence supporting the officer justification for initiating the search.byrd,at smith,concurring in part,dissenting in part it is appropriate to begin the analysis by looking at the justification for initiating the search,because,in the absence of a proper justification,even the most unintrusive search is unreasonable.and,as the above discussion indicates,there are at least disputes of fact concerning whether the search occurred and the appellees justification that should have precluded summary judgment in their favor.
before turning to the final bell factor,we briefly address the appellees argument that prison officers are privileged to search inmates for contraband.whether an officer is searching for contraband is highly relevant to the reasonableness inquiry.see,lee,at finding female nurse manual body cavity search of female inmate for matches while male officers restrained the inmate reasonable because plaintiff had set her paper dress afire and there was a reasonable necessity for a search of sufficient thoroughness to give assurance that she had no more matches.but we are deeply skeptical that the cotton sought here was in fact contraband,an unauthorized item.see florence.at citing prisons today and tomorrow pollock ed.contraband is any item that is possessed in violation of prison rules.contraband obviously includes drugs or weapons,but it ca
