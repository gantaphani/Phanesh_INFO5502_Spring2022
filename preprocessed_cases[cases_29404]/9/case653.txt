this appeal arises out of an unsuccessful suit by bethzaida cintrón against her former employer,departamento de asuntos del consumidor daco before us,cintrón challenges both the district court order dismissing her case for want of diligent prosecution and its sequential order denying her motion for reconsideration.for the reasons elucidated below,we reject her appeal.
the subsidiary facts are fairly straightforward although the record is ragged and the briefs confuse certain of the dates.daco hired cintrón as an attorney in or around.the working relationship did not go smoothly.as a result,cintrón filed a multifaceted claim of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc during the year.in that document she charged daco with violating the americans with disabilities act ada,by refusing to accommodate her physical disability,and with political discrimination based upon her support of the popular democratic party.in due course,the eeoc issued a letter.
on august,cintrón,armed with the letter,filed a pro se complaint in the federal district court.she again claimed that daco had violated both the ada and her right to free political association under the first amendment.for good measure,she also alleged,inter alia,violations of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and various sections of the puerto rico constitution and a potpourri of local laws.in an amended complaint,filed as a matter of right,see.a,she added a rehabilitation act claim under.
on november,the district court,citing cintrón failure to seek the issuance and service of summonses,ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for lack of diligent prosecution.see.m requiring service within days from the filing of a complaint.the court order was entered on the docket on december,and,shortly thereafter,cintrón served the defendants.she also filed a written rejoinder in which she stated that difficulties in trying to obtain legal representation had led to the delay.she indicated that she would need an additional to sixty days to retain counsel.the court did not respond but,by not pressing the matter,effectively granted her the desired grace period.
on february,cintrón requested a further extension in order to procure legal representation.four days later,daco served the plaintiff with a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on march,daco gave notice that it had served the plaintiff with a supplementary motion to dismiss.cintrón did not respond to either of these filings.
in april of,the further extension sought in cintrón february motion expired without an entry of appearance on her behalf.she remained mute.on june,daco filed yet a third motion to dismiss,but cintrón again neglected to reply.
on june,the district court advised cintrón that it would give her until july,to retain counsel answer the pending motions.in that order,the court noted that it had,in effect,given cintrón extra time and that the extensions she had sought had long elapsed.the court explicitly warned cintrón that t his the grace period lasting through july,is the last extension before considering dismissing the case for lack of diligent prosecution.the court admonition went unheeded cintrón did nothing,and,on july,the district court,true to its word,dismissed the case under.b for lack of prosecution.
on july,an attorney filed an entry of appearance on cintrón behalf,along with a motion for reconsideration the court summarily denied the motion.this appeal followed.
we turn first to the district court dismissal of the case for want of diligent prosecution.cintrón basic argument is that she was suffering from many afflictions physical,psychological,and emotional during the spring of.these culminated in the performance of a biopsy on june,followed by a cancer diagnosis two weeks later.the problem,however,is that she failed to bring any of these travails to the attention of the district court in a timeous fashion.instead,cintrón dawdled for upwards of seven months her only meaningful response during that period was a filing,early on,that attributed her dilatoriness to difficulty in securing the services of outside counsel.in that filing,she asked for an additional sixty days within which to retain counsel.but that the initial period that she had and went without the achievement of any noticeable progress.during and after that interval,she neither secured counsel,nor answered the several pending motions,nor apprised the court of a need for more time,nor revealed that her efforts were hampered by medical problems.
against this backdrop,the order of dismissal can not be faulted a district court,as part of its inherent power to manage its own docket,may dismiss a case sua sponte for any of the reasons prescribed in.b,link wabash,d.lack of diligent prosecution is such a reason.id.at.we review the district court dismissal of a case for want of prosecution only for abuse of discretion.id.at.tower ventures,city of westfield,cir.in undertaking that review,we consider all pertinent circumstances and balance the authority of the court to prevent undue delay against the policy of the law favoring the disposition of cases on the merits.see hmg prop.investors,parque indus.rio canas,cir richman motors,cir.we remain mindful,however,that trial courts must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants.batiz chamorro cars,cir.
here,the court exhibited extraordinary patience.first,it warned cintrón,as early as december of,that she was risking dismissal for lack of prosecution.second,when cintrón requested up to sixty days to put her case back on track,the court gave her that indulgence.third,when she sought a further period within which to regroup,the court again indulged her and,indeed,effectively gave her twice that amount of time.even at that juncture,the court did not dismiss the action outright,but,rather,issued another warning and allowed cintrón a further opportunity to make amends.cintrón rewarded this magnanimity by stonewalling she never communicated with the court in an effort either to explain her personal situation or to shed light on what efforts she was making to obtain legal representation.in the end,the court was faced with cintrón largely with time limits imposed by standing rules and specific orders.this protracted noncompliance,in the teeth of explicit warnings,amply justified a termination of the action.see top entertainment ortega,cir figueroa ruiz alegria,cir tower ventures,at explaining that disobedience of court orders,in and of itself,constitutes extreme misconduct and,thus,warrants dismissal.
we think it is particularly noteworthy that cintrón requested successive extensions of time within which to retain counsel,thus impliedly promising compliance by the end of that aggregate period.as we have said,w hen a litigant seeks an extension of time and proposes a compliance date,the court is entitled to expect that the litigant will meet its deadline.tower ventures,at.cintrón failure to achieve the time line that she herself had suggested weighs heavily against her.see id.holding that,absent excusatory circumstances,a litigant failure to adhere to such a deadline warrants an inference of deliberate manipulation.
cintrón argument that pro se plaintiffs deserve greater leniency strikes us as disingenuous.there are,of course,some settings in which such leniency is appropriate.see,haines kerner,d per curiam instituto de educacion universal united states dep t of,cir.here,however,the district court intentions were plain it issued two explicit warnings.equally as important,cintrón herself is an attorney albeit not a member of the federal bar who should have been well aware of the consequences of a dogged failure to comply with court orders.at the very least,cintrón notified the court both of her inability to comply and of the reasons for that noncompliance.having been warned twice that noncompliance could result in dismissal,she maintained a stoic silence at her peril.
we turn next to cintrón motion for reconsideration.however that
