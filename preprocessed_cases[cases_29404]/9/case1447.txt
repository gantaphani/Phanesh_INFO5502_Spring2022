opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we consider whether a suspension with pay constitutes an adverse employment action under the substantive discrimination provision of title vii.we hold that it typically does not.
michelle jones was fired in by her employer,the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa.septa says it dismissed jones for submitting fraudulent timesheets jones says her termination was the culmination of years of unlawful sexual harassment,gender discrimination,and retaliation.the district court entered judgment for septa,jones septa,wl,and jones filed this appeal.
septa is a public transit agency that serves philadelphia and its environs.in,jones began working as an administrative assistant in septa revenue operations department under the supervision of alfred outlaw.on december,outlaw suspended jones with full pay after he discovered apparent fraud in her timesheets.jones promptly informed septa equal employment opportunity eeo office that she intended to file a complaint against outlaw.at a meeting the following week,jones told the eeo office that he had sexually harassed and retaliated against her.app.
in the meantime,outlaw referred the timesheet matter to septa office of inspector general oig.after an extensive investigation,oig concluded in february that jones collected pay for days she had worked by submitting fraudulent timesheets.septa suspended jones without pay on february,and formally terminated her in april of that year.
jones continued to press her grievances throughout this process.in march,she filed a complaint with the pennsylvania human relations commission alleging that outlaw had sexually harassed her and other female employees,ordered her to do personal work for him during business hours,and retaliated against her for resisting this mistreatment by accusing her of timesheet fraud.septa therefore ended its internal investigation,but not before concluding that outlaw had engaged in inappropriate behavior by once asking jones to step on his back to relieve spinal pain.this lapse in judgment was noted in outlaw annual performance evaluation,and he was required to attend a training session regarding septa sexual harassment policy.app.
jones ultimately filed suit against septa and outlaw in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.her amended complaint alleged gender discrimination and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and the pennsylvania human rights act phra.she also alleged a violation of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,common law wrongful termination,and retaliation in violation of the family and medical leave act.the district court dismissed the wrongful termination claim and subsequently granted summary judgment to septa and outlaw on the remaining claims.jones has appealed only the court summary judgment on the title vii,phra,and constitutional claims.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under,and.we have jurisdiction under,and our review of a summary judgment is plenary.eeoc allstate ins,cir.
the linchpin of the district court opinion was its holding that jones claims fail principally because her initial suspension with pay was not an adverse action within the meaning of the employment discrimination laws.jones,wl,at.this is an issue of first impression in the third circuit.although we need not consider and do not decide whether a paid suspension constitutes an adverse action in the retaliation context,see infra section iv b,we hold that such a suspension generally does not constitute an adverse action in the substantive discrimination context.
title vii forbids employers to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.our analysis of claims arising under this substantive provision is governed by the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,first we ask whether the plaintiff has stated a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation if she has,we ask whether the employer has advanced a legitimate reason for its conduct and finally we give the plaintiff an opportunity to prove that the employer proffered reason is pretextual.see fuentes perskie,cir.
a title vii plaintiff must prove that she suffered an adverse employment action in order to satisfy step one of mcdonnell douglas.see sarullo postal,cir.we have described an adverse employment action as an action by an employer that is serious and tangible enough to alter an employee compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.storey burns int l sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court held that jones suspension with pay did not constitute an adverse employment action under title vii.see jones,wl,at.although the district court noted that we have not addressed this issue,it also noted that other courts of appeals have unanimously concluded that placing an employee on paid administrative leave where there is no presumption of termination is not an adverse employment action under the substantive provision of title vii.see joseph leavitt,cir a dministrative leave with pay during the pendency of an investigation does not,without more,constitute an adverse employment action.singletary.dep t of,cir peltier united states,cir see also von gunten maryland,cir holding that placing an employee on administrative leave with pay for a short time to allow investigation is not an adverse action for retaliation purposes,abrogated on other grounds by burlington santa fe ry.white,breaux city of garland,cir placement on paid administrative leave is not an adverse action for purposes of a first amendment retaliation claim.but dahlia rodriguez,cir en banc placement on paid administrative leave can be an adverse action for purposes of a first amendment retaliation claim.
like the district court,we think this chorus is on pitch.a paid suspension pending an investigation of an employee alleged wrongdoing does not fall under any of the forms of adverse action mentioned by title vii substantive provision.that statute prohibits discrimination in hiring,firing,and compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.a.a paid suspension is neither a refusal to hire nor a termination,and by design it does not change compensation.nor does it effect a serious and tangible alteration of the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,storey,at,because the terms and conditions of employment ordinarily include the possibility that an employee will be subject to an employer disciplinary policies in appropriate circumstances,joseph,at.we therefore agree with our sister courts that a suspension with pay,without more,is not an adverse employment action under the substantive provision of title vii.id.
applying this legal standard to the facts of this appeal,we readily agree with the district court that jones suspension with pay did not constitute an adverse employment action.in her brief,jones summarily declares that her indefinite suspension that began on december,was an adverse employment action without providing any argument for why this is so.jones br.having failed to marshal evidence that her suspension with pay was atypical in any way,jones argument fails for the same reasons stated by our sister courts in the cases we have cited.accordingly,we hold that jones suspension with pay from december to february when septa suspended her without pay was not an adverse employment action under the substantive provision of title vii.
the fact that jones initial suspension with pay was not an adverse employment action eviscerates much of jones appeal but does doom it entirely.therefore,we turn to her specific claims under title vii,the phra,and the constitution.her statutory claims turn on whether summary judgment for septa was appropriate on the title vii claims.t he phra is to be interpreted as identical to federal antidiscrimination laws except where there is something specifically different in its language requiring that it be treated diffe
