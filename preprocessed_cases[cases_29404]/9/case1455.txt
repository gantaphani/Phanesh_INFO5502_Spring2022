opinion of the court 
this appeal presents three issues on which we have not previously ruled in a precedential opinion.first,whether an employee terminated from a local government position may maintain an action for age discrimination under.second,whether the pleading of exhaustion of administrative remedies,a prerequisite to bringing a lawsuit under the age discrimination in employment act adea,must satisfy the standards established in bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal.and third,whether a complainant submission of the equal employment opportunity commission revised intake questionnaire constitutes the filing of a charge of discrimination.
as to the first question,we hold that a state or local government employee may not maintain an age discrimination claim under,but must instead proceed under the adea.as to the second question,we hold that a plaintiff is not obligated to plead exhaustion of administrative remedies with particularity,but may instead allege in general terms that the required administrative process has been completed.and finally,we hold that the eeoc intake questionnaire,revised in the wake of federal express holowecki,when properly completed,constitutes a charge of discrimination.
as a result of our holdings,we will affirm the district court dismissal of appellant anthony hildebrand claims but we will vacate the district court dismissal of hildebrand adea claim against the allegheny county district attorney office as hildebrand submitted a properly completed intake questionnaire to the eeoc within the deadline for filing a charge of discrimination,and hildebrand adequately pled the exhaustion of administrative remedies.finally,we will affirm the dismissal of the adea claims against appellee allegheny county because it was not named on the intake questionnaire,and was not identified as a respondent to an age discrimination charge until after the deadline for filing a charge of discrimination against it had passed.
background 
anthony hildebrand was employed as a detective for the allegheny county district attorney office da office for five years before he was terminated on february.prior to his work at the da office,hildebrand spent fifteen years as an undercover narcotics detective with the pittsburgh police department.
on february,hildebrand received a letter suspending him without pay for five days pending discharge,and announcing his termination effective that day.he filed an internal grievance,but the termination was ultimately upheld.
hildebrand maintains that his termination was part of a and established practice to push out older workers through termination or forced resignation.appellant br.he contends that he became a victim of discrimination beginning in when he was assigned a new supervisor who,he asserts,demoted him because of his age despite his satisfactory work performance.as part of his demotion,hildebrand states that he was insulted on the basis of his age and relocated to an inferior workplace.he further alleges that the discrimination he faced was part of a hostile work environment that transcended the conduct of any one employee.
on december,hildebrand completed an intake questionnaire the intake questionnaire with the eeoc,indicating that he was the victim of discrimination on the basis of his age.he also checked a box on the intake questionnaire authorizing the eeoc to investigate his claim and indicating that he want ed to file a charge of discrimination.eeoc br.subsequently,on january,hildebrand completed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc,naming the allegheny county district attorney as the respondent.the eeoc issued a letter on may,and hildebrand filed suit on august.
hildebrand complaint named allegheny county the county,as well as the da office,as defendants.his complaint asserted violations of the adea,title vii retaliation,asserting violation of the equal protection clause due to discrimination,as well as violation of his first amendment free speech rights,the pennsylvania whistleblower law,and the pennsylvania human relations act.his complaint also alleged 
all conditions precedent to jurisdiction under section of title vii,have occurred or been complied with.plaintiff filed a claim of employment discrimination with the eeoc.the eeoc issued a notice of right to sue.this complaint is filed within days of such notice of right to sue.
the county and the da office collectively,appellees separately filed motions to dismiss.on december,the district court granted the motions to dismiss the title vii retaliation claim.the district court also applied the pleading standards set forth in twombly,and iqbal,to hildebrand assertion that he satisfied all conditions precedent to filing suit under the adea.analyzing hildebrand complaint in light of the standard,the district court stated 
because the complaint fails to provide any facts,specific dates,as to when plaintiff raised his claim with the eeoc and when the eeoc issued its right to sue letter to plaintiff,and because plaintiff failed to attach his right to sue to the complaint,the complaint falls short of providing the facts to establish whether he has adequately exhausted his administrative remedies.
accordingly,the court dismissed the adea claim without prejudice.the district court also dismissed hildebrand section claims without prejudice.
hildebrand filed an amended complaint,alleging with greater particularity that he satisfied all conditions precedent to filing suit under the adea.specifically,he averred that he had filed a timely charge of discrimination,the eeoc had issued a letter,and he had filed the complaint within days of notice of the.he attached his charge of discrimination and the eeoc letter to the amended complaint.
appellees each filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing,inter alia,that hildebrand charge was untimely because it was filed more than days after the last date of discrimination.allegheny county also urged the district court to dismiss hildebrand adea claim against the county on the additional ground that the charge of discrimination named only the da office as a defendant.
hildebrand attached to his responses to the motions his completed eeoc intake questionnaire.he contended that the completed intake questionnaire constitutes a charge and was filed within days of the last date of discrimination.
on january,the district court dismissed hildebrand amended complaint.the district court first dismissed the adea claim,concluding that hildebrand did not file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc within the requisite days of the last date of discrimination.specifically,the district court found that the last date of alleged discrimination was hildebrand february,termination,and that the charge of discrimination filed on january,was therefore untimely.thus,the district court concluded that hildebrand failed to sufficiently plead that he timely filed his claim with the eeoc in light of the standard.finding that further amendment would be futile,the district court dismissed the adea claim with prejudice.
as to his claims,the district court held that hildebrand failed to state a plausible claim against allegheny county under a theory of municipal liability,because he did not plead sufficient facts to support a plausible inference that the county had adopted a custom or practice of age discrimination.the district court also dismissed the claims against the da office based on hildebrand concession that it was not a separate entity from the county for purposes of.finally,having dismissed with prejudice all claims arising under federal law,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims asserted under the pennsylvania whistleblower law and the pennsylvania human relations act.

hildebrand age discrimination claim 
we turn first to hildebrand claim brought under that appellees discriminated against him on the basis of his age,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.allegheny county argues that the district court properly dismissed this cause of action,contending that t he adea is the exclusive remedy for claims of age discrimination in employment.allegheny cnty.br.quoting ahlmeyer.of higher,cir.for the reasons that follow,we agree.

in determining whether a statutory enactment precludes suit under,t he crucial consideration is what congress intended.smith,at.congressional intent to preclude claims may be inferred w hen the remedial devices provided in a particular act are sufficiently comprehensive.middlesex cnty.sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n.in sea clammers,the supreme court held that a plaintiff was precluded from bringing a suit for damages under the federal water pollution control act amendments of,et,and the marine protection,research,and sanctuaries act of,et.at.emphasizing the unusually elaborate enforcement provisions of the statutory framework,id.at,the court concluded that a llowing parallel claims to proceed would have thwarted congress intent in formulating and detailing these provisions.fitzgerald barnstable sch.
the supreme court has also held that suits were precluded by statute in a case where a plaintiff sought vindication of a constitutional rather than a statutory right.see smith.in smith,plaintiffs alleged violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment,asserting a deprivation of the right to a free appropriate public education for their handicapped child.id.at.focusing once again on the comprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set forth in the statute remedial scheme,the court concluded that congress did not intend to leave undisturbed the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to court with an equal protection claim to a free appropriate public education.id.at.permitting such suits,the court observed,would a llow a plaintiff to circumvent congressional intent.id.at.
subsequently,in rancho palos verdes abrams,the court again found that a comprehensive remedial statutory framework precluded suit under.the plaintiff in rancho palos verdes filed suit under the telecommunications act of and for damages under.id.at.applying its prior decisions in sea clammers and smith,the court ruled that the telecommunications act remedial scheme would be distort ed by direct enforcement through.id.at.
most recently,the court considered whether title ix of the education amendments of,a,precludes claims of sex discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.see fitzgerald,at.in fitzgerald,the plaintiffs alleged that their daughter,then an elementary school student,suffered several incidents of sexual harassment by another student while on the school bus,and that the school response to their allegations had been inadequate.id.at.the plaintiffs brought suit,asserting that their daughter had suffered sex discrimination in violation of title ix and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.the court of appeals for the first circuit dismissed plaintiffs constitutional claims,holding that title ix provided the sole remedy for sex discrimination in the education context.id.at.the supreme court reversed.id.reiterating that the crucial consideration is what congress intended,id.citation omitted,the court signaled that its analysis of congressional intent might differ depending upon whether the right asserted under arises from a statute or the constitution 
in those cases in which the claim is based on a statutory right,evidence of such congressional intent may be found directly in the statute creating the right,or inferred from the statute creation of a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.in cases in which the claim alleges a constitutional violation,lack of congressional intent may be inferred from a comparison of the rights and protections of the statute and those existing under the constitution.where the contours of such rights and protections diverge in significant ways,it is not likely that congress intended to displace suits enforcing constitutional rights.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
notwithstanding the distinction between rights and rights,the court emphasized that,i n determining whether a subsequent statute precludes enforcement of a federal right under primary emphasis is placed on the nature and extent of that statute remedial scheme.id.this was true even where plaintiffs,such as those in smith,relied on to assert independent constitutional rights,rather than statutory rights.id.indeed,the court observed that in each of the cases where it found a statute to be the exclusive remedy for an asserted right,the statutes at issue required plaintiffs to comply with particular procedures to exhaust particular administrative remedies prior to filing suit,and a llowing a plaintiff to circumvent the statutes provisions by suing directly under would have been inconsistent with congress carefully tailored scheme.id.at quoting smith,at.
turning to the question of whether title ix precludes suit under for sex discrimination,the court first found that title ix does not provide a comprehensive enforcement scheme,emphasizing that title ix remedies withdrawal of federal funds and an implied cause of action stand in stark contrast to the unusually elaborate,carefully tailored,and restrictive enforcement schemes of the statutes at issue in sea clammers,smith,and rancho palos verdes.id.at.the court observed that title ix does not contain an administrative exhaustion requirement or a notice provision.id.affording particular weight to title ix lack of an express private right of action,the court noted that it has never held that an implied right of action had the effect of precluding suit under.id.given the absence in title ix of a detailed remedial scheme,the court concluded that parallel and concurrent claims will neither circumvent required procedures,nor allow access to new remedies.id.at.the court found further support for its conclusion that gender discrimination covered by title ix could be pursued by way of a suit by analyzing the substantive rights and protections guaranteed under title ix and under the equal protection clause.id.at.the court found that title ix protections are narrower in some respects and broader in others.id.for instance,title ix exempts several activities that can be challenged under the equal protection clause,such as discrimination in admissions decisions of elementary and secondary schools,and all activities of military service schools,as well as traditionally public colleges.id.at.additionally,the court cited incongruous standards for establishing liability under title ix and the equal protection clause,explaining that,while a title ix plaintiff can establish school district liability by showing that a single school administrator with authority to take corrective action responded with deliberate indifference,the same plaintiff would be required to show a municipal policy,custom,or practice under.id.at.because of this disparity in coverage,as well as title ix lack of a comprehensive enforcement framework,the fitzgerald court concluded that,in passing title ix,congress did not intend to preclude sex discrimination claims in the context of education under.id.at.
prior to fitzgerald,a number of our sister courts of appeals had held that the adea precludes claims of age discrimination.see ahlmeyer,at tapia tapia potter,cir migneault peck,cir,vacated on other grounds by bd.of regents of of migneault,lafleur.dep t of health,cir chennareddy bowsher,zombro baltimore city police,cir.the seventh circuit the only court of appeals to consider this question after fitzgerald,however,reached the opposite conclusion.see levin madigan.
the leading case concluding that the adea precludes claims of age discrimination is zombro baltimore city police department.see ahlmeyer,at.in zombro,the fourth circuit held that congress intended the adea to be the exclusive remedy for claims of age discrimination,reasoning that private causes of action brought directly under would severely undermine,if not debilitate,the enforcement mechanism created by congress under the adea.at.zombro focused on the adea comprehensive statutory scheme,which was structured to facilitate and encourage compliance through an informal process of conciliation and mediation.id.at.providing a plaintiff with direct and immediate access to the federal courts via could result in the comprehensive administrative process be ing bypassed,and the goal of compliance through mediation be ing discarded.id.given these concerns,the zombro court reached what it deemed t he inescapable conclusion that the adea precludes suits under for age discrimination.id.at.
after zombro,the courts of appeals for the first,fifth,ninth,tenth,and district of columbia circuits agreed.see tapia tapia,at lafleur,at ahlmeyer,at migneault,at chennareddy,at.in light of the supreme court decision in fitzgerald,however,the seventh circuit diverged from this consensus view,concluding instead that the adea does not preclude constitutional claims of age discrimination asserted under.levin,at.
while recognizing that the adea sets forth a rather comprehensive remedial scheme,id.at,levin interpreted fitzgerald as setting a higher bar for inferring preclusive intent in cases where a plaintiff alleges a constitutional violation.id.to imply congressional intent to preclude constitutional claims,the levin court held that some additional indication of congressional intent is required.id.at.emphasizing that the adea lacks express language evincing congressional intent to preclude suits,levin considered the statute purpose.the court reasoned that the adea does not purport to provide a remedy for violation of constitutional rights,but rather,it provides a mechanism to enforce only the substantive rights created by the adea itself.id.at citing zombro,at murnaghan,concurring in part and dissenting in part internal quotation marks omitted.levin then distinguished the supreme court decision in smith,which found that the individuals with disabilities education act idea,precluded suit under for a constitutional violation,explaining that the idea was passed to address the constitutional requirement to provide a public education for handicapped children.id.at.without express language addressing preclusion,and absent any additional indication from congress,the levin court declined to infer an intent to preclude constitutional claims of discrimination.id.at.the court in levin then compared the rights and protections offered by the adea and the equal protection clause,and found several significant differences first,an adea plaintiff may sue only an employer,employment agency,or labor organization,whereas a plaintiff is free to sue any individual who caused or participated in the alleged deprivation of the plaintiff constitutional rights second,the adea limits claims by certain individuals,such as elected officials,who are not exempted from bringing suit under and third,unlike under,state employees are effectively barred from bringing suit under the adea because their employers are shielded by eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.in light of these differences,and in the absence of express congressional intent to the contrary,the levin court concluded that the adea is not the exclusive remedy for age discrimination claims.id.at.
we agree with the levin court that the issue of whether the adea precludes a cause of action for age discrimination in employment presents a close call.id.at.contrary to levin,however,we conclude that,on balance,the relevant considerations weigh in favor of finding that the adea does indeed bar such claims.
the supreme court has consistently indicated that the comprehensiveness of a statute remedial scheme is the primary factor in determining congressional intent.see fitzgerald,at w e have placed primary emphasis on the nature and extent of a statute remedial scheme.emphasis added.fitzgerald reaffirms the court jurisprudence on this issue as articulated in sea clammers,smith,and rancho palos verdes.id.at observing that,in each of prior cases,o ffering plaintiffs a direct route to court via would have circumvented the relevant statute comprehensive procedures.indeed,fitzgerald cited with approval the court statement in sea clammers that,w hen the remedial devices provided in a particular act are sufficiently comprehensive,they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under.id.at quoting sea clammers,at emphasis added.to be sure,fitzgerald analysis of the different substantive protections afforded by title ix and the equal protection clause provides an additional framework for determining whether a section cause of action is foreclosed.nevertheless,we do not believe it disturbed the basic principle that,absent indications to the contrary,we may infer that congress intended to preclude claims when it provides a sufficiently comprehensive remedial scheme for the vindication of a federal constitutional right.
thus,we can not agree with levin that congress must provide some additional indication of its intent.levin,at.fitzgerald does not suggest the need for a statement of clear or manifest congressional intent in either the language of the statute or the legislative history,as levin requires.see levin,at.rather,fitzgerald reaffirmed the principle that,where a statute imposes procedural requirements or provides for administrative remedies,permitting a plaintiff to proceed directly to court via would be inconsistent with congress carefully tailored scheme.fitzgerald,at quoting smith,at.
here,there can be no debate that the adea provides a comprehensive remedial scheme.under the adea,it is unlawful for an employer to,among other things,fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual because of such individual age.a.the adea expressly provides a private right of action to employees.id.c.before an employee may file suit under the adea,however,a plaintiff is required to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.id.d.the eeoc is then directed to notify all respondents named in the employee charge of discrimination and to promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation,conference,and persuasion.id.d.unless the eeoc elects to file suit to enforce the employee claim,an employee may commence suit sixty days after filing a charge.id.c,d.in light of these requirements,we agree with the majority of our sister courts of appeals that this scheme would be undermined if plaintiffs could sue directly under.see,zombro,at under,the plaintiff would have direct and immediate access to the federal courts,the comprehensive administrative process would be bypassed,and the goal of compliance through mediation would be discarded.
moreover,we do not believe that the rights and protections of the adea and the equal protection clause differ in such significant ways as to demonstrate congressional intent to allow parallel claims alleging age d
