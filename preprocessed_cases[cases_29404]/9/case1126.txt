in this appeal from a may,judgment of the district court of the southern district of new york william pauley iii,judge,the question is whether doreen powell,who now has the legal equivalent of buyer remorse,entered into a binding and enforceable settlement agreement with omnicom and that concluded their litigation.for the following reasons,we hold that the settlement agreement is fully enforceable and that the district court properly denied powell motion to reopen the case.
background 
powell,a african american woman,began working at bbdo,a subsidiary of omnicom,in.after she was promoted to vice president in,she allegedly fell victim to numerous discriminatory acts relating to promotions,performance evaluations,pay,choice of accounts,and assignment of subordinates.despite her complaints to management,powell says nothing was done.
on september,bbdo fired powell,asserting that it was because of her lack of seniority and failure to bill enough business.powell claims that these reasons were pretextual because bbdo did not terminate many white employees who had less seniority and billed less business.she also claims that bbdo retaliated against her by falsely reporting to the department of labor that she had been discharged for misconduct.
on february,powell sued bbdo and omnicom under title vii of the civil rights act of,et the age discrimination in employment act of adea,et and various new york state and new york city law violations.on june,after several hours of negotiation,powell,who was represented by counsel,and omnicom agreed to an settlement before magistrate judge james francis,iv.omnicom counsel recited the terms of the settlement on the record 
neither party would admit any wrongdoing 
bbdo would pay powell,from which no taxes would be withheld 
bbdo would write a mutually agreed upon positive reference regarding powell employment with bbdo detroit 
bbdo would represent in writing to the department of labor that it made an error in stating that powell was terminated for misconduct 
bbdo and omnicom could still sue powell for malfeasance and other intentional conduct 
neither party would disparage the other 
powell would never apply for employment with the defendants 
powell would represent that she had no other claims pending against the defendants other than the federal claims being settled 
the agreement would remain confidential 
the magistrate judge then asked powell if the terms of the agreement were acceptable to her and whether on the basis of agreeing to those terms that this case will be terminated with prejudice and can not be reopened.powell responded affirmatively on the record to both questions.
on june,the district court issued an order stating that it had been informed that this action has been or will be settled.it ordered the action discontinued without prejudice to restore if the application to restore the action is made within thirty days of the date of this order.
the parties attempted to reduce their agreement to writing,but powell refused to sign.on july,the district court received a letter from powell counsel asking that the case be restored to the calendar.counsel also requested that they be relieved from representation due to irreconcilable differences with powell.rather than restore the case to the calendar,the district court ordered the parties to appear at a conference on august.
at the conference,powell accused her counsel of misrepresenting that the settlement would be and pressuring her into accepting.her counsel denied any misconduct.she also claimed that omnicom reference letter was unsatisfactory because it only stated that her performance at bbdo was satisfactory she wanted it to say that her performance was exemplary.powell counsel said that omnicom was really working to try to refine the language to please powell and had offered to state that her performance was fully satisfactory.
finding that powell seemed to be a sophisticated and knowledgeable business woman,the district court concluded that the settlement was enforceable.it gave powell the choice of taking exception to the ruling and proceeding with the case or,alternatively,working out the settlement details.powell chose the first option,and the district court relieved her counsel.
on march,powell submitted affidavits pro se in support of a motion to vacate and set aside the settlement and restore the case to the calendar.the district court construed the affidavits as a motion to reopen under.b and denied the motion,finding that powell knowingly and voluntarily entered into an settlement agreement.powell timely appealed.
discussion 
because powell case had already been closed,the district court did not abuse its discretion in construing her march motion as a rule b motion.see lawrence wink in re lawrence,cir.we review the denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.rodriguez mitchell,cir see also fennell tlb kent,cir feinberg,concurring involving decisions to restore a case to the calendar.we review the district court factual findings,including whether a settlement agreement exists and whether the parties assented to it,for clear error.omega eng g,omega,cir.
a settlement agreement is a contract that is interpreted according to general principles of contract law.id.once entered into,the contract is binding and conclusive.janneh gaf,cir,abrogated on other grounds by digital equip.desktop direct,d.when a party makes a deliberate,strategic choice to settle,a court can not relieve him of that a choice simply because his assessment of the consequences was incorrect.united states bank of,cir.
powell argues,however,that in these particular circumstances,the agreement was not binding because it was never reduced to writing the parties never intended to be bound absent a writing it was made in violation of the older workers benefit protection act owbpa,stat.codified as f and the district court july,order expressly gave her the right to have the case restored to the calendar if she moved for such relief within days of the issuance of the order.we hold that the settlement agreement is binding and enforceable it therefore concluded the litigation.
requirement of a writing 
parties may enter into a binding contract orally,and the intention to commit an agreement to writing,standing alone,will not prevent contract formation.winston mediafare entm t,cir applying new york law consequently,a voluntary,clear,explicit,and unqualified stipulation of dismissal entered into by the parties in court and on the record is enforceable even if the agreement is never reduced to writing,signed,or filed.role eureka lodge,of m,cir per curiam.the settlement remains binding even if a party has a change of heart between the time he agreed to the settlement and the time those terms are reduced to writing.millgard white oak,d.here,powell and omnicom entered into a voluntary,clear,explicit,and unqualified settlement on the record in open court omnicom recited the terms of the agreement on the record,and powell expressly assented on the record to those terms and the dismissal of the case.accordingly,the fact that the settlement was never reduced to writing is insufficient to render the settlement nonbinding.
ii.the parties intentions to be bound absent a writing 
powell contends that the parties did not intend to be bound by the settlement in the absence of a writing.parties who do not intend to be bound until the agreement is reduced to a signed writing are not bound until that time.ciaramella,at.deciding whether the parties intended to be bound in the absence of a writing requires us to consider whether there has been an express reservation of the right not to be bound in the absence of a writing whether there has been partial performance of the contract whether all of the terms of the alleged contract have been agreed upon and whether the agreement at issue is the type of contract that is usually committed to writing.winston,at see also ciaramella,at.no single factor is decisive,but each provides significant guidance.ciaramella,at.after considering these factors,we conclude that the parties in this case intended to be bound notwithstanding the absence of a writing.
