plaintiff sandra morrison appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,dismissing her suit,brought under,alleging torts under the united states constitution and state law.the complaint asserts claims against the elmhurst hospital,and persons associated with it,based on plaintiff detention at the hospital for a period of fourteen days following her remand for psychiatric evaluation by a judge of the family court of the state of new york the district court dismissed the complaint on the basis of the doctrine construing the complaint as a challenge to the lawfulness of the family court remand order.plaintiff contends her suit does not challenge the family court order,but rather challenges the independent determinations made by personnel of the particular the determination that she was a danger to herself or others and should therefore be further detained.we agree that the complaint can be so interpreted and that,to the extent the complaint seeks relief based on discretionary decisions of the hospital that were not mandated by the family court order,it should not have been dismissed under.
background

sandra morrison,a person before the court,has or may have a mental illness which is likely to result in serious harm to herself or others based upon the following evidence presented respondent continued to have an outburst in the waiting area after being told by court officers to calm down

ordered that the proceeding is adjourned to and it is further 
ordered that court release only.
the judge explained that the remand was for evaluation,that the order had provided for court release only,and that she chose november as the date to resume proceedings because elmhurst need s a wednesday for transportation.
plaintiff was then transported to the elmhurst hospital.upon her admission to the hospital,laurence dopkin certified that he had examined her prior to admission and found there is reasonable cause to believe that she has a mental illness for which immediate observation,care and treatment in a mental hospital is appropriate and which is likely to result in serious harm to herself or others.the admission form bears a handwritten note stating that plaintiff was remanded for psychological evaluation secondary to uncooperative and religiously preoccupied behavior.dopkin also certified that plaintiff was furnished a notice of status and rights form.the form stated within hours of the time of your admission,you will be examined by another physician if he or she confirms the first physician findings,you may then be kept in the hospital for a period of up to days during this day period you may be released,converted to involuntary status,or asked to remain as a voluntary or informal patient emphasis added.the next morning,claudia iordache examined plaintiff and confirmed dopkin findings.

plaintiff contends,as she did in the district court,that her challenge is not to the family court order,but to the elmhurst doctors determination that she was dangerous and to the resulting decision to continue her detention.she contends the doctors were not compelled by the family court order either to find her dangerous or to keep her in custody for two weeks.accordingly,she argues,the district court erred in construing her complaint as an attack on the family court order or an action mandated by that order and consequently dismissing her suit under.the defendants contend her challenge to the duration of her detention can be only to the family court order because that order required her detention until the date on which she was in fact released.the defendants argue accordingly that her challenge is one the inferior federal courts have no power to entertain.
the doctrine provides that,in most circumstances,the lower federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review final judgments of state courts.see feldman,at rooker,at.in,the supreme court clarified the scope of the doctrine,explaining that it was confined to cases brought by statecourt losers complaining of injuries caused by state court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus.in hoblock albany county board of elections,we noted that pared back the doctrine to its core.hoblock,at.we interpreted the supreme court opinion to specify four requirements that must be met for to apply
