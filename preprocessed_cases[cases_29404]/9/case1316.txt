the plaintiffs,twelve disabled individuals and a disability rights organization,allege that the defendants paratransit system for disabled persons in the rochester,new york area violated the americans with disabilities act,et.ada or the act.the defendants moved for summary judgment in lieu of answering the complaint,and the plaintiffs for summary judgment on three of their four claims.the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and enjoined the defendants to comply with their obligations under the ada.we affirm the grant of injunctive relief,but on grounds somewhat different from those upon which the district court relied,grounds which may require the district court to modify the injunction on remand.
background 
defendant regional transportation authority rgrta provides transportation services in the rochester,new york area.as a public benefit corporation established by new york statute,rgrta is a public entity subject to the requirements of the ada.see b defining public entity as including any department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or states or local government.through a subsidiary,regional transit service,rts,rgrta operates a fixed route system of bus lines,defined by the ada as a system of providing designated public transportation on which a vehicle is operated along a prescribed route according to a fixed schedule.
through a second subsidiary,defendant lift line,lift line,rgrta operates a complementary paratransit system for disabled persons.this service consists of a fleet of buses that provide transportation along a corridor of a mile wide on each side of rts fixed bus routes.see a.
to be eligible for paratransit service,a disabled rochesterian must submit an application and a or rehabilitation professional certification for approval by lift line.lift line has been liberal in its approval of such applications.from through,the company received applications and granted all but or of them.lift line has not endeavored to recertify its paratransit riders or pare its rolls.when this action was commenced,approximately people were certified for paratransit service,including each individual plaintiff.these individuals depend on lift line for work,worship services,family visits,medical appointments,errands,and other activities.
to schedule a paratransit ride,certified individuals must make a phone reservation the day before or up to days in advance the november rts bus guide map for the rochester area advised lift line users to call between am and pm,seven days a week to schedule a ride.it cautioned that r eservations are made on a,basis.
the parties have presented a largely undisputed series of data about lift line paratransit service from may to june,the sample period.the plaintiffs appear to have selected this period at random to collect data in support of the claims stated in their june,complaint.no party contends that the data collected during this period are unrepresentative.
during the sample period,lift line received ride requests and scheduled or of them.nearly of these requests were made fourteen days in advance and,of those,were scheduled.the scheduling rates declined,however,with the period of advance notice.of the rides requested seven days in advance,were scheduled.of those rides requested two days in advance,only were scheduled.and of the rides requested one day in advance,only were scheduled.thus,by its own admission,lift line denied of the ride requests during the relevant period.when lift line denied these requests,it did so because all spaces on the buses assigned to the area had been reserved.pls.statement of undisputed facts,dated,at.
each individual plaintiff requested a paratransit ride during the sample period.some of those who called the day before were told that lift line could not provide a ride.the others,including those who called several days in advance,were told to call a second time to confirm their rides.when they called the second time,they were told that lift line could not provide a ride.each time,the explanation was a lack of capacity.
according to the defendants,lift line capacity constraints are attributable to some riders abuse of the system.for purposes of this summary judgment motion,it is uncontested that riders who are not truly eligible for paratransit service take space away from those who are truly eligible under the regulations although lift line is authorized to riders and those who are no longer eligible,lift line has not done so and lift line canceled rides of all reservations during the relevant period,though the parties disagree about whether this problem is a cause or a symptom of lift line capacity constraints.
on june,the plaintiffs filed this class action,alleging that a substantial number of eligible riders who called to schedule rides one or more days in advance were not accommodated due to a lack of capacity.specifically,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated the ada by failing to provide service to eligible persons,in violation of a and b requiring riders to call a second time to confirm ride availability and thereby maintaining waiting lists for paratransit service,in violation of f engaging in an operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of paratransit service,in violation of f and failing to provide paratransit service in accordance with the plan defendants submitted to the secretary of transportation,in violation of e.
the defendants moved for summary judgment in lieu of filing an answer and the plaintiffs for summary judgment on their first,third,and fourth claims.on august,the district court denied the defendants motion and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the three claims for which they sought it.see anderson reg l transp,anderson i.as to the first claim,the court held that the defendants failed to meet all ride requests as required by a and b.id.at.as to the third claim,the court held that the defendants engaged in an operational pattern or practice that substantially limited the availability of paratransit service by maintaining a capacity level insufficient to meet demand.id.at.the court held that these rulings also supported summary judgment for plaintiffs on their fourth claim,failure to comply with the plan submitted to the secretary of transportation.id.at.as to the second cause of waiting list claim,on which the plaintiffs did not seek judgment as a matter of court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment and ordered that the parties conduct discovery id.at.
having so ruled,the district court enjoined the defendants to take immediate steps to comply with their obligations under the ada and federal regulations implementing that act,and ordered the parties to attempt to work together to formulate a comprehensive plan to effectuate its ruling.id.at.the court also granted the plaintiffs motion for conditional class certification,defining the class as all persons who are now or in the future will be eligible for ada paratransit services in the geographical area served by defendants.id.at.defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.the injunction has not been stayed and,though the defendants challenge the basis for the injunction,they do not contest its particular terms.
on april,after full briefing in this court,the district court issued an order to supplement and implement its august,order.see anderson reg l transp,d anderson ii.for reasons set forth in the margin,we give consideration to that order in this appeal in it,the court noted that defendants had undertaken various steps to improve their paratransit services,having increased the number of buses during peak ridership times,increased the number of schedulers on staff,and hired additional bus drivers.id.at.as a result of these and other measures,the court noted,defendants report that they have been able to schedule of all rides requested from november,through january,and of all ride requests during that same period.id.
nonetheless,while the parties worked diligently and in good faith to resolve the litigation and adopt a mutually satisfactory plan,they could not reach agreement.id.the court therefore ordered remedial measures 
the company must provide ride service to all ada paratransit eligible individuals who require such service id.at.
t he company shall take whatever steps are necessary to obtain more buses,drivers and schedulers to comply with all of the requirements concerning provision of paratransit service.id.
t he company will phase in modifications to its reservation system to permit advance reservations to be made not more than three days prior to the desired trip.id.
the company shall provide the court with monthly reports on demand rides,subscription rides,and the process.id.at.
the court also endorsed the following permissive measures 
the company may mak e its entire fleet of buses wheelchair accessible,and it should do so with dispatch.id.at.
the company may implement a recertification process through a third party,as long as the process conforms to all applicable regulations and is not used as a vehicle for retaliation.id.
the company may establish an administrative process to suspend paratransit services to individuals who persistently miss scheduled trips or cancel them in an untimely manner,as long as such process is in full compliance with the regulations.id.
the court declined to impose a schedule of stipulated penalties for noncompliance by the company or to rule on any fare increase that lift line might adopt in the future.id.at.the court retained jurisdiction,however,to monitor compliance.id.at.
on july,this court invited the department of transportation dot to submit a detailing its views on the meaning of the relevant paratransit service regulations.the justice department civil rights division responded on the dot behalf in a dated october.the parties submitted responsive on november.we also received amicus curiae briefs from the eastern paralyzed veterans association urging affirmance and the new york city transit authority urging reversal.
discussion 
our consideration of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions for paratransit service leads us to accept portions of the district court reasoning and reject other portions affirm the grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs first and third claims,and reverse on their fourth claim and remand for proceedings on the fourth claim and any of the injunction that may be justified by this opinion or circumstances that have developed during the pendency of the appeal.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see young county of fulton,cir.in doing so,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d maguire citicorp retail,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the meaning of the relevant ada provisions and dot regulations are questions of law that we review de novo.see united states mitchell,cir interpretation of statutes winter storm shipping,tpi,cir interpretation of statutes and rules,cert.denied,d auburn housing auth.martinez,cir interpretation of statutes.
ii.statutory and regulatory framework 
title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.the act expressly bars such discrimination in public transportation 
it shall be considered discrimination for a public entity which operates a fixed route system to fail to provide with respect to the operations of its fixed route system,in accordance with this section,paratransit and other special transportation services to individuals with disabilities that are sufficient to provide to such individuals a level of service which is comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system or in the case of response time,which is comparable,to the extent practicable,to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system.
pursuant to the act,see b c,the secretary of transportation has issued regulations prescribing minimum service criteria for paratransit service.see et.two of the secretary implementing regulations are of particular relevance here.they are in some tension with each other because one seemingly requires service for every user every time without fail,while the other contemplates a lesser level of service so long as the failures are not substantial in number.
first,the secretary has established standards for paratransit service response time.b.under b,a public entity providing transportation services shall schedule and provide paratransit service to any ada paratransit eligible person at any requested time on a particular day in response to a request for service made the previous day.id.reservations may be taken by reservation agents or by mechanical means.id.the regulation provides further 
the entity shall make reservation service available during at least all normal business hours of the entity administrative offices,as well as during times,comparable to normal business hours,on a day when the entity offices are not open before a service day.
the entity may negotiate pickup times with the individual,but the entity shall not require an ada paratransit eligible individual to schedule a trip to begin more than one hour before or after the individual desired departure time.
the entity may use scheduling in providing complementary paratransit service.
the entity may permit advance reservations to be made up to days in advance of an ada paratransit eligible individual desired trips.
second,the secretary has established standards for paratransit service capacity constraints.f.a public entity shall not limit the availability of complementary paratransit service to ada paratransit eligible individuals by r estrictions on the number of trips an individual will be provided w aiting lists for access to the service or a ny operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of service to ada paratransit eligible persons.id.emphasis added.the regulation defines a pattern or practice as including,but not limited to,a s ubstantial numbers of significantly untimely pickups for initial or return trips b s ubstantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips and c s ubstantial numbers of trips with excessive trip lengths.f i.it excludes o perational problems attributable to causes beyond the control of the entity including,but not limited to,weather or traffic conditions affecting all vehicular traffic that were not anticipated at the time a trip was scheduled.f ii.
thus,one regulation requires that paratransit providers shall schedule and provide paratransit service to any ada paratransit eligible person at any requested time on a particular day in response to a request for service made the previous day,b emphasis added,which seems to require providers actually to meet of all ride requests.the other regulation,by expressly prohibiting only the denial of s ubstantial numbers of rides,f i,appears to contemplate some permissible number of ride denials.
in the summary judgment decision under review,the district court construed b literally to require service.anderson i,at.the court did not see any inconsistency between b and f.id.at.the latter,it held,simply provides a prohibition separate and distinct from the requirement contained in b.id.it observed that f does not state that a public entity may deny ride requests as long as the number of denials is not substantial,and it saw no reason to think that either of these subsections modifies or limits the other.id.emphasis in original.
we appear to be the first circuit court to consider and apply these regulations we do not think that the text of the regulations,taken together,supports the district court view that they require unfailing service.we read the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions,in light of agency opinion letters and with the benefit of the government to this court,as follows b requires the formulation and implementation of a plan to meet of the demand for ride requests by eligible riders,while f grants limited leeway for occasional failures of such plans to meet demand.the regulations require a provider to rethink its plan and implement changes whenever a pattern of noncompliance develops.this analysis requires some exposition.
as a threshold matter,the text of the ada itself offers little guidance.section requires that the level of paratransit service be comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities,and that response time be comparable,to the extent practicable,to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities.a.what level of service would make a paratransit system comparable to a public transportation system used by individuals without disabilities comparability seems impossible to achieve because,as one district judge has observed,a constraint on a fixed route system never results in a patron being denied a ride altogether,absent an uncontrollable force.liberty resources,d at.
some guidance is found in the commentary that accompanied the minimum service criteria regulations promulgated by the dot under c.see.the dot discussion of the response time regulation is cast in terms of scheduling systems and their periods of operation.id.at.the dot viewed the scheduling provision as a good balance of minimizing inconvenience to users and allowing providers sufficient time to schedule trips to maximize efficiency,and viewed b as requiring paratransit service providers to implement some form of scheduling system.
objections received during the comment period emphasized that unfailing service for paratransit riders was unrealistic some commenters suggested a performance standard,meeting an average percent of trip requests per day.id.at.the dot nevertheless retained its capacity constraint regulations in their present form.while conceding that there are capacity constraints on fixed route transit,the dot observed that c apacity constraints of this kind are already reflected in the requirements for paratransit,given the service area and hours and days criteria.id.also,while overcrowding may prevent fixed route passengers from boarding particular buses or trains,all the passengers have to do is wait a little longer for the next bus or train to come,whereas there is no next bus or train for paratransit riders.id.in short,paratransit would not be a comparable system if overcrowding prevented paratransit riders from reaching their destinations.id.the capacity constraints provision was designed to provide adequate redress for systemic problems in service delivery.id.thus,while b concerns the system a paratransit service provider must design and implement,the provisions of f gauge whether a provider has fulfilled its obligation to meet demand.
this understanding is confirmed by the government persuasive october,to this court section b,according to the government,imposes an affirmative obligation on transit agencies to design,fund,and implement a service to meet the foreseeable needs of all individuals the regulation accordingly forecloses any planned.letter from jessica dunsay silver,dep t of justice,dated,at emphasis added.the government views b and f as complementary but address ing different aspects of administering a paratransit service,as follows 
section b addresses a transit provider responsibilities from a conceptual perspective and imposes an affirmative obligation on transit authorities to design,fund,and implement a paratransit program that will fully meet the anticipated needs of individuals for paratransit service.section f,by contrast,addresses the transit provider responsibilities from the practical perspective of capacity constraints and specifically imposes a prohibition on a ny operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of service to ada paratransit eligible persons.f.
id.at emphasis added.thus,the government recognizes that e ven a well conceived paratransit service,designed,funded,and implemented to meet of projected need,may occasionally experience trip denials.id.at.under f,however,substantial numbers of trip denials can establish that a paratransit matter how,funded,or implemented in inadequate as a matter of actual operation.id.
dot advice to paratransit service providers,as expressed in opinion letters issued by the federal transit administration fta has been to the same effect,consistently and over a period of years.these letters show that the fta expects paratransit providers to plan,design,and operate their systems to meet their full ride demand,and that f permits an insubstantial number of trip denials,so long as those denials are unplanned and do not result from the provider operational decisions 
this view was articulated persuasively in the only other opinion to consider these regulations in detail.see liberty resources,southeastern.transp,d,vacated.cir unpublished disposition dismissing defendant appeal as moot and vacating judgment after defendant complied with,and district court terminated,an injunction order.the eastern district of pennsylvania held that the regulations,taken together,indicate that dot expected agencies to attempt to provide properly requested rides to all riders,without exception.id.at emphasis in original.it concluded that the substantial number language of f can not be used as a green light to intentionally create a system that denies rides.id.at.
in short,b requires paratransit service providers to plan to meet of the demand for ride requests.section f recognizes that even plans may misfire on occasion and permits the denial of an insubstantial number of trips,so long as those denials were not attributable to the design of the paratransit system.and,as necessary,paratransit service providers must modify their plans with the goal of achieving the service level.
iii.service claim 
the plaintiffs first claim alleges that the defendants violated a and b by failing to provide paratransit rides to all eligible individuals who requested them.as noted above,the district court construed b as requiring paratransit service companies to satisfy of the demand for ride requests,and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs primarily because some eligible persons are being completely denied rides on the days requested.anderson i,at.
under our interpretation of the relevant regulations,however,a paratransit provider may not be held liable for denying ride requests solely on the basis of a lack of capacity unless it denies a substantial number sufficient to constitute a pattern or practice under f.we take up that issue in part iv of this opinion.
the question under b is whether the paratransit company planned,designed,and implemented a system to meet of its ride demand.the record supports the finding that the defendants foresaw a growing inability to meet demand.the defendants ada paratransit plan update recorded that there are now clients making an average of trips per month or a projected trips per year,and that t his projection exceeds the estimated supply of trips by.ada paratransit plan update,at.the update projected that all requests for service by ada eligible clients can not be accommodated within the resources presently available to lift line,even as it anticipated that the number of eligible clients will continue to grow in by perhaps.id.at.
the update proposed measures designed to achieve full compliance,including tests of the eligibility process,closer management of client cancellations,and efforts to increase public funding and private partnerships.id.at.yet the plan update stated that t here were no significant changes made in paratransit service since the submission.ada paratransit plan update,at sec.vii.the update reported that,d uring calendar,lift line continued to operate within existing policies,procedures,fleet,fares and service area.ada paratransit plan update,at.unquestionably,then,the defendants failed to respond adequately to the increasing demand they foresaw in.
in the affidavit submitted in support of the defendants motion for summary judgment,rgrta chief executive officer acknowledged lift line persistent ride denial rate.affidavit of donald riley,dated,at.between may and june,he noted,lift line scheduled over of the rides requested days in advance,but a s the ride day approaches,the percentage of rides that can be scheduled inevitably falls because there is less and less capacity in the system.id.at.he conceded that only of the rides requested with day notice approximately were scheduled because all spaces on the buses assigned to the area had been reserved.id.at.
the defendants attributed their ride denials to capacity constraints that were not unusual 
first,lift line riders that are not truly eligible for paratransit service and who would not be eligible if a rigorous recertification process were employed continue to ride and thus use reservation spaces for those that are truly eligible.second,lift line riders are not required to ride accessible rts bus routes whenever available even though they could be finally,an exorbitant number of lift line riders reserve spaces only to cancel the ride,or not show up at all,at a later date.
id.at.defendants concede that lift line could reduce its denial rate even further,and perhaps eliminate it altogether,if it recertified the eligibility of its riders,required riders to use accessible rts buses whenever possible,or raised fares to the statutory limit.id.at.the record thus establishes that the defendants foresaw increasing demand,recognized that they failed to schedule all ride requests from eligible riders,and declined to institute reforms that would allow them to meet of the eligible ride demand.
we therefore conclude that the defendants violated b by failing to design and implement a system to schedule all ride requests from eligible riders.on this ground,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the first claim.however may have been their efforts to make lift line flexible and available to as many individuals as possible,the defendants failed to comply with the baseline requirement of b service provision.
iv.operational pattern or practice claim 
the third claim alleges that the defendants violated f by engaging in an operational pattern or practice that significantly limited the availability of paratransit service.to repeat f provides that s uch patterns or practices include,but are not limited to,s ubstantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips.f i b.the regulation exempts o perational problems attributable to causes beyond the control of the entity including,but not limited to,weather or traffic conditions affecting all vehicular traffic that were not anticipated at the time a trip was scheduled.f ii.
the district court ruled that,based upon the number of ride denials,particularly for service,defendants have engaged in an operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of service to ada paratransit eligible persons.anderson i,at.even looking at the total number of denials over the course of the reservation period,the of requests that are denied,or out of requests from may to june,can not reasonably be considered insubstantial.id.the court reasoned that rides are regularly denied not because of matters outside the defendants control,but because of a lack of available seats,which in turn is attributable to defendants insufficient capacity and its booking practices.id.
we agree with the district court reasoning and conclusion.section f gives no clue as to how many trip denials is substantial,but the dot has provided some guidance.in its,the government advised that there is no magic number,whether expressed in absolute terms or as a percentage,that can be used to determine whether a transit authority has denied or missed a substantial number of trips.letter from jessica dunsay silver,dep t of justice,dated,at.a factual determination is therefore required,letter from william sears,chief counsel,fed.transit,dated,at,within the context of each agency service profile,letter from jessica dunsay silver,dep t of justice,dated,at.relevant factors may include the time period over which the denials occurred,changes implemented by the provider to address them,the trend and persistence of denials,foreseeability of the denials,causes of the denials,and the reasonableness of the provider demand estimates and plans id.at.
in liberty resources,the court considered whether the number and nature of a paratransit agency trip denials violated the dot capacity constraint regulation.d at.the undisputed evidence revealed that the agency septa denied or of the rides requested over a thirteen month period.id.at.it denied or of the ride requests it received during this period.id.at.this amounted to approximately ride denials each day.id.septa argued that it had met of all ride requests,but the court fairly observed that the proper focus is on the number of rides denied and the reasons for those denials.see id.at.the court concluded that septa had engaged in a pattern and practice in violation of the capacity constraint provision of f.id.
similarly,in martin metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority,d,the defendant transportation company marta was enjoined to improve its paratransit services to a level of service which is comparable to that marta provides to the.id.at.the record showed systemic scheduling and service problems and the initial denial of of ride requests due to a lack of capacity.id.at.the court concluded that operational patterns and practices in marta paratransit service have significantly limited the availability of service to paratransit eligible persons in violation of the ada.id.at.
we conclude that lift line denied a substantial number of paratransit rides in violation of f i b.while lift line scheduled over of all requests received during the sample period,the success rate declined sharply with the number of days of advance notice lift line denied of the rides requested four days in advance,of the rides requested three days in advance,of the rides requested two days in advance,and of the rides requested for the next day.overall,lift line denied of the rides requested in the period tracked by the plaintiffs before they commenced this action.these statistics are unrefuted and comport with the trip denial data included in the defendants dot submissions over the last several years.
as discussed in the previous section,the defendants foresaw increasing ride demand and failed to modify their paratransit service plan to meet it.they acknowledge that they could take steps to improve their ability to meet demand,such as paring their certification rolls to eliminate ineligible riders.the defendants attribute the problem to their indulgence of ineligible riders and frequent rider cancellations,and they argue that these causes bespeak their good faith,and that may be so.but as the government advised in its 
a n excusable cause of operational problems must truly be beyond the control of the transit provider.a transit agency is expected to anticipate recurrent traffic congestion,seasonal variations in weather,and the need to maintain vehicles indeed,once a seemingly unforeseeable pattern develops,the recurring event becomes foreseeable,and the transit authority can no longer claim the matter is beyond its ability to address.
letter from jessica dunsay silver,dep t of justice,dated,at.the defendants must fulfill their obligation to avoid recurring problems by any appropriate measures,possibly including a enforcement of rider eligibility.
we therefore affirm the conclusion that the defendants violated f by maintaining a pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of paratransit service for eligible riders.
claim for noncompliance with plan submitted to the secretary of transportation 
the ada paratransit scheme requires providers to submit service plans to the secretary of transportation.section c provides in pertinent part 
the regulations issued under this section
