background 
ayala employment and alleged harassment 
ayala,a homosexual man,has held various positions with the city.at the start of the time period relevant to this case,ayala was an employee of the municipal office of emergency management omme.ayala alleges that at various times during and,while he was studying for his certification as a rescuer,his at omme ridiculed him for being a homosexual specifically,ayala alleges that his told him that he could not perform physically demanding tasks because of his sexual orientation.ayala did not identify those who allegedly teased him as defendants in his complaint.
on september,ayala commenced a extended vacation from omme.ayala claims that during this vacation,he began a romantic relationship with a male at omme,josé rodríguez vega rodríguez.this relationship allegedly ended when rodríguez became involved with a female at omme.upon returning to work at omme in january of,ayala told his supervisor,nelson cruz malavé cruz,that he was concerned that rodríguez might physically attack him.ayala requested that cruz assign work in such a way that ayala and rodríguez would not have to work together.
ayala alleges that when he returned to omme,his work conditions changed substantially.he claims that he was assigned to graveyard shifts not on his regular schedule,that he went for days without being assigned work,and that he was moved from his regular office into a storage closet.ayala complained about these changes to negrón,who ordered cruz to return ayala to his regular working hours.in the meantime,the situation with rodríguez escalated,culminating in an incident on february.according to ayala,rodríguez threatened him with physical harm,and cruz had to call the puerto rico police to the scene.ayala also alleges that around this time,another omme employee,pablo miranda santana miranda,falsely accused ayala of making unwanted advances and threatened to file a sexual harassment claim against him.
on february,ayala met with the city director of human resources,juan crespo crespo,and with negrón special aide,josé iván torres torres,to discuss the situation at omme.at this meeting,crespo and torres recommended that ayala transfer to an administrative position with the municipal cemetery,since the city needed to replace an absent worker there.ayala refused the transfer.the next day,ayala met directly with negrón,who again suggested that ayala transfer to the cemetery.the following day,ayala met with negrón again however,negrón also invited rodríguez and miranda to the meeting,allegedly without warning ayala.ayala claims that he was so distressed by this that he had to seek medical treatment for anxiety.some time later,ayala mother and sister met with negrón to complain about negrón treatment of ayala.ayala alleges that at this meeting,negrón attempted to out ayala by telling his mother that his sexual definition was the source of his problems however,ayala family already knew about his sexual orientation.
it is not clear whether ayala spent any time working at the cemetery.nevertheless,on may,ayala filed a complaint with the comisión apelativa del sistema de administración de recursos humanos del servicio público casarh,the puerto rico administrative agency in charge of reviewing personnel actions.the next day,negrón sent a letter to ayala informing him that he was being transferred effective immediately to the city finance department.the letter stated that the transfer was part of a reorganization program that had been announced one year earlier under which employees could be transferred between various departments based on personnel needs.the transfer to the finance department did not affect ayala salary or rank,although ayala claims that his duties changed substantially.
one of ayala duties in the finance department was to process the payment of invoices.ayala claims that one of the invoices he was required to process was for payment to the private attorney whom the city hired to represent it in ayala casarh proceeding.ayala claims that having to process this invoice made him so nervous and depressed that he required hospitalization.
procedural history 
on may,ayala filed his complaint in this case against negrón and the city in the district court for the district of puerto rico.ayala claimed that the harassment by his at omme constituted sex discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.title vii.ayala contended that negrón and the city were liable for this discrimination because they did not prevent the harassment.ayala also claimed that negrón and the city were liable for retaliation under title vii because,following the filing of his casarh complaint,the city transferred him to the finance department.ayala additionally brought a claim under,claiming that negrón and the city violated his due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment by failing to stop the harassment at omme and by transferring him to the finance department 
on august,the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings under.c on ayala title vii and due process claims.on september,the district court granted the motion.see ayala sepúlveda municipality of san germán,et,d ayala i.the court dismissed ayala title vii claims on the ground that title vii does not proscribe harassment simply because of sexual orientation.id.at quoting higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court also found that ayala had failed to state a claim for gender stereotyping.id.at.additionally,the court dismissed ayala procedural due process claim under,noting that under puerto rico law,public employees have a property interest in their continued employment,not in the functions they perform.id.at quoting ruiz casillas camacho morales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.since ayala only alleged that he was transferred from one equivalent job to another,the court ruled that he had not suffered a deprivation of a property interest that could sustain a due process claim.id.
on april,the defendants moved for summary judgment on ayala one remaining claim,his equal protection claim under.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the equal protection claim on august.see ayala sepúlveda municipality of san germán,et,d ayala ii.the court held that because of the statute of limitations applicable to claims in puerto rico only the transfer to the finance department and subsequent incidents were actionable.id.at.in so holding,the court rejected ayala argument that the otherwise allegations were actionable under the continuing violation doctrine this doctrine allows a plaintiff to incorporate allegations that would ordinarily be if they are part of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one act falls within the time period.id.at quoting quiles marcucci cooperativa de ahorro y crédito de juana díaz,wl,internal quotation marks omitted.the court then held that because ayala transfer to the finance department did not materially change his working conditions,ayala had suffered no adverse employment action and thus could not sustain a claim for retaliation.id.at.the court then addressed ayala claim that he had been singled out for discriminatory treatment based on his sexual orientation.id.at.the court rejected this claim for two reasons.
first,the court held that there was no basis for holding negrón or the city liable for any of the discriminatory acts alleged in the complaint.in puerto rico,because mayors are the government officials ultimately responsible for employment decisions of the municipality,a municipality can be held liable for employment decisions by its mayor.rodríguez garcía miranda marín,cir.therefore,the district court held that the city could be liable for discrimination against ayala if negrón condoned discrimination or himself acted with discriminatory intent.see ayala ii,d at.the court found that there was no evidence that negrón authorized or condoned the allegedly hostile work environment at omme.see id.as for the transfer,the sole piece of evidence ayala provided to show discriminatory intent was negrón alleged statement to ayala mother that his sexual definition was causing his problems.the court held that this was insufficient to establish negrón discriminatory intent.see id.citing ríos jiménez sec y of veterans affairs,cir,to note in parenthetical that offhand comments are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to amount to discriminatory changes in employment.
second,the court concluded that even if ayala had been singled out for transfer because of his sexual orientation,his transfer to the finance department satisfied rational basis review.the defendants had introduced evidence that ayala was transferred based on service needs and in order to resolve the conflict between ayala and his at omme.see id.at.ayala provided no rebuttal evidence.id.
ayala now appeals only the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the claim under the equal protection clause.he does not appeal the judgment on the pleadings regarding his title vii or due process claims.
ii.discussion 
we first discuss whether the alleged acts of discrimination that occurred before the transfer to the finance department are actionable.we then consider whether ayala suffered any act of retaliation in violation of his equal protection rights finally,we consider whether ayala was singled out for disparate treatment in any way because of his sexual orientation in violation of his equal protection rights.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.kuperman wrenn,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.cortés rivera dep t of corr.rehab.of,cir.w e are not married to the trial court reasoning but,rather,may affirm on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.cahoon shelton,cir.the nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment motion by demonstrating,through submissions of evidentiary quality,that a trialworthy issue persists.iverson city of boston,cir citing celotex catrett.however,a conglomeration of conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation is insufficient to discharge the nonmovant burden.depoutot raffaelly,cir quoting medina muñoz reynolds tobacco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t he party seeking to avoid summary judgment must be able to point to specific,competent evidence to support his claim.soto ocasio fed.exp,cir quoting august offices unlimited,cir.
continuing violation doctrine and hostile work environment 
in puerto rico,claims are subject to a statute of limitations.marrero gutiérrez,at.based on the may,filing date of ayala complaint,the only alleged discriminatory act that occurred within the limitations period was ayala transfer to the finance department ayala argues,however,that the earlier alleged incidents were also actionable under the continuing violation doctrine,which allows a plaintiff to incorporate allegations that would otherwise be if they are part of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one act falls within the time period.passenger morgan amtrak,ayala argues that the unlawful employment practice here was the creation of a hostile work environment.we thus consider whether there is sufficient evidence to support ayala claim that he suffered a hostile work environment.
when determining whether a work environment is hostile,the court considers all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.at quoting harris forklift.none of these factors is individually determinative of the inquiry.bhatti trs.of boston,cir.
looking at all the circumstances,we agree with the district court that the discriminatory acts alleged did not rise to the level of a hostile work environment.while ayala claims that he was ridiculed by his at omme,he cites to no evidence regarding the severity or pervasiveness of the ridicule.ayala mentions the incident on february,in which rodríguez allegedly threatened him,but he also notes that cruz called the puerto rico police to the scene to defuse the situation.finally,ayala has presented almost no evidence to suggest that the alleged harassment at omme unreasonably interfere d with his work performance.amtrak,at.the only factual averment that comes close to such a showing is ayala uncontested claim that he had to seek medical treatment for anxiety after meeting with negrón,rodríguez and miranda.however,there is no evidence on the record that ayala work performance suffered as a result of his anxiety.compare bhatti,at upholding grant of summary judgment against plaintiff in hostile work environment suit where plaintiff sought psychological counseling but pointed to no effect whatsoever on her work performance,with arrieta colón wal mart,cir upholding hostile work environment verdict where there was constant mockery and harassment that led to resignation and marrero goya of,cir upholding hostile work environment verdict where there was repeated sexual harassment that led to decreased performance.
because ayala has not demonstrated that he was subjected to a hostile work environment to which the continuing violation doctrine could apply,his allegations regarding events occurring prior to the statute of limitations period are.thus,only the transfer to the finance department is.retaliatory transfer 
ayala claims that his transfer to the finance department violated his equal protection rights because the transfer was ordered as retaliation for ayala filing of the casarh complaint.in order to succeed on a claim of retaliation,ayala must prove that the employer took a materially adverse employment action against him.blackie maine,cir.an employment action is adverse if it results in a work situation unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position.rodríguez garcía,at quoting agosto de feliciano aponte roque,cir.
here,there is no evidence to suggest that ayala pay,rank,or duties changed after he was transferred to the finance department moreover,ayala has failed to present any evidence or explanation as to how the transfer affected him in any other material way.thus,we find that ayala transfer to the finance department was not an adverse employment action.because ayala did not suffer any adverse employment action,we find that the district court properly granted summary judgment as to ayala fourteenth amendment retaliation claim.
improper classification based on sexual orientation 
in addition to arguing that the defendants transferred him to the finance department to retaliate against him,ayala argues that the defendants singled him out for transfer because of his sexual orientation.ayala argues that this singling out violated his equal protection rights.
in an equal protection case,the court considers whether the plaintiff was treated differently than others similarly situated,and whether such difference was based on an impermissible consideration,such as race.lopera town of coventry,cir quoting macone town of wakefield,cir.some evidence of actual disparate treatment is a threshold requirement of a valid equal protection claim and one ayala fails.estate of bennett wainwright,cir.
ayala points to no evidence that he was treated differently than others similarly situated.plaintiffs claiming an equal protection violation must first identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in
