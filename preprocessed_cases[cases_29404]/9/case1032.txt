for nearly a year beginning in,daniel gross,an octogenarian,had a conservatorship imposed for his estate and person against his will.he was kept in a nursing home for ten months,until a superior court judge in connecticut,citing a terrible miscarriage of justice,granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ordered him released.this lawsuit stems from that unfortunate series of events.
it is alleged that a probate court judge signed a facially impossible order that did not comply with the law the attorney disregarded gross wishes to return to his home in new york the conservator forcibly kept gross in a nursing home,against medical advice and a nursing home housed gross with a violent roommate who attacked him.the complaint further alleges that defendant maggie ewald,connecticut care ombudsman at the time,did not act on complaints about gross treatment at the nursing home because of concerns about adverse publicity.
these allegations,if true,might make out a case against the defendants.however,judge thomas brunnock,conservator kathleen donovan,attorney jonathan newman,and grove manor nursing home,grove manor have asserted absolute immunity to suit brunnock has asserted judicial immunity and the other three have asserted immunity.the district court agreed and dismissed all claims against those defendants.claims against governor jodi rell and ewald,as well as certain of gross statutory and tort claims against grove manor,were dismissed for various procedural reasons.
the federal common law defense of immunity applies to gross federal claims,and the similar but distinct state common law defense of immunity applies to gross state law claims.connecticut state law is unsettled as to immunity.therefore,we certify questions to the connecticut supreme court on the state law claims.
on the federal law claims,we apply the test for immunity set forth by the supreme court.however,in this case,application of those factors involves unsettled questions of connecticut state statutory and common law.therefore,we ask the connecticut supreme court for its guidance as to these factors.upon receiving its response,we will decide the federal claims.
immunity applies only to donovan,newman,and grove manor.we affirm the grant of judicial immunity as to brunnock and affirm the dismissal of the other claims.
background 
in,daniel gross,a new york resident,was discharged from a hospital in new york after treatment for a leg infection shortly thereafter,he went to waterbury,connecticut,where his daughter lived,to convalesce.on august,he was admitted to waterbury hospital because of complications from his previous treatment.nine days later,on august,barbara limauro,a hospital employee,filed an application for appointment of conservator in waterbury probate court.the record does not indicate what prompted limauro to file this application.
the pertinent statute requires the probate court,as a threshold matter,to give the respondent seven days notice in any application for an involuntary conservatorship.ann.a in addition,the notice must be served on the respondent or,if doing so would be detrimental to the health or welfare of the respondent,his attorney.id.a a.the statute makes no provision for giving notice to the respondent other than by personal service or service upon his attorney.
on august,judge thomas brunnock issued an order of notice of a hearing to be held on september,in connection with limauro application.on august,the notice was served on limauro.however,as the connecticut superior court pointed out in the subsequent habeas proceeding,there was no indication that gross himself ever received notice of the september proceeding.the parties do not dispute that gross was entitled to notice of the hearing,he should have been given at least seven days notice,pursuant to section a,and the order dated august,specified that gross should be served by august.
also on august,brunnock appointed jonathan newman to represent gross in the involuntary conservatorship action.newman interviewed gross,who told newman that he opposed the conservatorship.newman described gross as alert and intelligent and stated in a report that gross wanted to live at home and manage his own affairs.nevertheless,newman concluded that he could not find any legal basis in which to object to the appointment of a conservator of daniel gross person and estate.newman also signed the form attorney for ward.the relevant statute defines a ward as a person for whom involuntary representation is granted pursuant to statute.ann.h emphasis added.at the time newman signed the form,no such representation had been granted gross was not a ward but rather a respondent.id.f.
a superior court judge would later say that newman conclusion that there was no legal basis for objecting to the involuntary conservatorship completely blows my mind,that there was n o support for it,and that it just defies imagination this was counsel for gross and it is obvious to me that he grossly under and misrepresented gross at the time.
the respondent also has a right to attend any hearing on the application.ann.b.if he wishes to attend but is unable to do so because of physical incapacity,the court shall schedule the hearing at a place which would facilitate attendance but if not practical,then the judge shall visit the respondent before the hearing,if he is in the state.id.emphasis added.the next section reiterates that a judge could hold the hearing on the application at a place within the state other than its usual courtroom if it would facilitate attendance by the respondent.id.c.the parties do not dispute that judge brunnock never visited gross,the hearing was not held at a location that would facilitate gross attendance,and gross was not personally present at the hearing.
furthermore,connecticut law at the time only permitted a conservatorship for those who were residing or domiciled in connecticut,id.a gross was neither a resident nor a domiciliary.it is undisputed that newman failed to bring this jurisdictional defect to the court attention.as will be explained infra,it was on the basis of this defect that the connecticut superior court eventually granted gross petition for a writ of habeas corpus and held the conservatorship void ab initio.
on september,brunnock appointed kathleen donovan as conservator to manage gross person and estate.connecticut state law provides that the probate court must require a probate bond and,if it deems it necessary for the protection of the respondent,it may require a bond of any conservator as well.ann.g.donovan never posted a bond.
a week or two later,donovan placed gross in the locked ward of grove manor nursing home.gross alleges in his complaint that his roommate was a confessed robber who threatened and assaulted him.gross also claims that grove manor,with the knowledge and consent of donovan,kept him in a room with the violent roommate after it learned of the assault,which was not reported to the police.
in april of,gross was on an authorized day visit to long island.while there,he experienced chest pains and was admitted to a hospital.according to the complaint,donovan came to long island with an ambulance and insisted that gross be returned to connecticut.when the doctor indicated that this was medically unwise,donovan nonetheless removed gross from the hospital against his wishes and returned him to the locked ward at grove manor.
gross alleges in his complaint that there was no reason to put him in the locked ward.he further alleges that ewald,the state ombudsman,and donovan,the conservator,were aware of these problems but failed to take steps to alleviate them.the parties do not dispute that donovan obtained from brunnock ex parte orders limiting gross contact with family and with counsel gross claims that there was no evidence suggesting that such contact was harmful to him.we are very troubled by one such order in particular.according to gross complaint,this order restricted gross daughter ability to visit him the visits were required to be,only once per day,for no longer than one hour.strangely,it also prohibits her from bringing any recording devices visual audio into grove manor nursing home.the restrictive nature of the order,and the prohibition on the use of recording devices,gives credence to gross allegation that there was a conspiracy to deprive him of his potentially,to prevent the exposure of such injustices.
on june,gross filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in connecticut superior court.a hearing was held on july.brunnock moved to dismiss,making the rather remarkable argument that habeas relief was unnecessary because,if the probate court acted without jurisdiction,the conservatorship was void ab initio and gross could leave grove manor at any time.the superior court granted the writ 
o ut of an absolute caution that somebody else may come in and file an appearance in this case,i going to grant the writ of habeas corpus i going to find in accordance with the statute that he and has been,since september,been deprived of his liberty.and at the time of his appointment of the conservator of both his person and his estate,probate court lacked the jurisdiction on the basis that he was not a domiciliary a resident of the s tate of connecticut.the conservatorship is terminated as a result of the decision on the habeas corpus and gross is free to leave here today.
the court also halted all pending transactions involving gross property,saying that nothing is to be done with the sale of gross house in new york,and that any previous orders of the probate court with reference to that real property in new york are also terminated,so there is nothing in new york.the superior court said there had been a terrible miscarriage of justice.
upon returning to new york,gross found that his house had been,in his words,ransacked.the complaint alleges that a chandelier and some furniture were missing.gross lived independently in his home from the time of his release at least until the time of the complaint,and apparently until the time of his death in.
in,plaintiff brought the complaint and the district court dismissed it as to all defendants.the district court found that brunnock was entitled to judicial immunity.the court went on to reason that the conservator,attorney,and nursing home were entitled to immunity because they were serving the judicial process.however,the district court reasoned that the nursing home was not entitled to derivative,immunity for discretionary acts that were not performed specifically for the purpose of complying with a probate court order.thus,the nursing home decision to leave gross in a room with his roommate for several days,after his roommate attacked him,was held to be discretionary and not protected by immunity.this left statutory and tort claims against the nursing home.the district court dismissed the statutory claims on the basis of waiver,leaving only the tort claims,which consisted of claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the district court also dismissed all claims against the governor and most claims against the ombudsman,essentially on failure to prosecute or waiver grounds.however,it initially let stand the claims against the ombudsman for failure to investigate complaints about gross detention in the nursing home.thus,there were two sets of claims remaining intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the nursing home regarding the violent roommate and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the ombudsman for failure to investigate 
then,at the end of a telephone conference about discovery and the course of the lawsuit,the district court announced that it did not think those remaining claims would exceed and said it would dismiss the case.counsel did not object to this dismissal,and those claims were dismissed without prejudice.once these were dismissed,there were no remaining claims.gross timely appeal followed.
discussion 
the main issue in this case pertains to judicial and immunity.for the reasons described below,brunnock is entitled to judicial immunity.however,we certify to the connecticut supreme court certain questions relating to immunity as to the conservator,the attorney,and the nursing home.we affirm the district court dismissal of all other claims as to rell and ewald and the statutory claims against the nursing home we note at the outset that,although we affirm the district court dismissal of many claims,we do not condone the actions of the defendants.
i.an overview of judicial and immunity 
a.in general 
in this case,there are several intersecting issues.the first question is whether defendants brunnock,donovan,newman,and grove manor may assert judicial or immunity as a defense.the second question,assuming immunity applies,pertains to the scope of that immunity.finally,as to each of the defendants and claims pled in this case,there is the question of whether federal or state law on immunity governs.the defendants,to be sure,some of the cases in this blur,or do not recognize,these distinctions.
gross is asserting federal and state law claims against state officials.the doctrine of judicial and immunity is,in the main,a creation of the supreme court with regard to federal claims and thus a federal law doctrine.the cases support employing the federal defense of immunity as against federal claims.however,gross had also pled state law claims against state defendants.connecticut has adopted tests for judicial and immunity that are nearly identical to the federal law tests.however,the state law doctrine is conceptually distinct from the federal law doctrine.
with regard to the state law claims,we recognize the uncertainty regarding the state law doctrine of immunity and certify questions to the connecticut supreme court as to the availability of immunity.normally,we would apply federal law to the federal claims and simply decide them.however,in this case,the federal test involves applying the cleavinger factors.see cleavinger saxner,d.these inquire into the nature of the actor in the judicial system,the existence of safeguards,the role of precedent,and so unsettled questions of state law.therefore,we ask the connecticut supreme court for its guidance as to those factors.after the court responds,we will make the ultimate determination,as a matter of federal law,of whether immunity applies.
applicable legal standards 
defendant brunnock asserts the defense of judicial immunity,while defendants donovan,newman,and grove manor assert the defense of immunity.the first,threshold question is whether these defendants may assert these defenses at all.the cases indicate that the federal common law on judicial immunities applies even to state officials when they are sued in federal court on federal claims.see pierson ray,d action against local police officers and judges tucker outwater,cir,cert.denied,d action against new york town justice.we apply this federal test even when the substantive inquiry involves state law.see tucker,at noting that whether the judge acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction turned on new york law regarding the scope of the judge jurisdiction huminski corsones,cir noting,in a action against state judges,that courts look to state law to determine whether the judges acted within their jurisdiction and as to whether they acted in their judicial capacities,and then applying the federal law test for judicial immunity.as we describe below,we may apply settled federal law to dispose of the question of judicial immunity as to brunnock with regard to federal claims.
in this case,federal jurisdiction over the claims against brunnock were based on diversity jurisdiction.diversity of citizenship cases,though brought pursuant to federal subject matter jurisdiction,are decided on the basis of state substantive law.krauss manhattan life ins.of,cir.therefore,as to those claims,we look to connecticut law to determine if judges enjoy immunity and,if so,under what circumstances.connecticut has a doctrine of judicial immunity,which is,in all respects relevant here,identical to the federal test.see shay rossi,citing stump sparkman,d,overruled on other grounds,miller egan,leseberg,citing mireles waco,d.therefore,because connecticut law is clear as to judicial immunity,we may decide that question as well.
as to the remaining defendants,the issue is closer.donovan,newman,and grove manor are asserting not judicial immunity,but immunity.in this context,the supreme court has set forth a functional test that is binding on this court on matters of federal law.see cleavinger,at.explaining that immunity is determined by a functional approach,in light of several enumerated factors see also butz economou,d describing the functional approach.we clarify now that the federal law on immunity applies to state officials sued in federal court on federal claims.courts have so held in the context of judicial immunity.pierson,d tucker.judicial and immunity are both absolute immunities.see mitchell forsyth,d noting that both are absolute immunities but see kalina fletcher,d scalia,concurring noting that,historically,immunity was more akin to what we now call qualified,rather than absolute,immunity.we discern no reason to treat them differently with regard to choice of law questions.thus,federal law on immunity,and specifically,the functional approach specified in cleavinger,applies to gross federal claims against donovan,newman,and grove manor.
however,again because our jurisdiction over state claims is grounded in diversity of citizenship,state substantive law applies to gross claims against donovan and newman see,bonime avaya,cir.once again,we look to connecticut law to determine if conservators and attorneys for conservatees are entitled to absolute immunity,and,if so,under what circumstances.connecticut law,like federal law,employs a functional approach to immunity.see carrubba moskowitz,employing a test derived from butz,at.carrubba involved state claims emotional distress and malpractice against a counsel for a minor child.id.at.the connecticut supreme court noted that butz involved claims brought under federal law pursuant to.see id.at.however,the carrubba court did not suggest that the test should be any different when state law claims were at issue,as they were in that case.see id.stating that it was adopting the supreme court test for immunity to determine whether attorneys appointed as counsel for minor children should be accorded absolute immunity under connecticut state common law.
thus,in the normal course,to determine whether immunity extends to donovan and newman,we would simply apply cleavinger to test the validity of the immunity defense to the federal law claims and the similar carrubba functional analysis in connection with the state law claims.however,in this particular case and on these facts,both analyses intersect unsettled questions of state law.first,as to the immunity defense regarding state law claims no connecticut case squarely addresses whether conservators and attorneys for conservatees may enjoy immunity.the most analogous case pertains only to attorneys appointed as counsel for minor children,see carrubba,and it is not sufficiently similar to this case for us to determine with confidence what state law on this point is.therefore,we certify questions to the connecticut supreme court so that it may decide whether conservators and attorneys for conservatees may assert immunity as to state claims,and the scope of any such immunity,as a matter of state law.the state court pronouncement as to those questions will be final.
as to the immunity defense to the federal law claims,cleavinger instructs courts to analyze various factors,described infra,in determining whether immunity applies.cleavinger,at.in this case,these factors intersect with the nature and function of the connecticut probate court system.although we could analyze those factors and simply decide the immunity question as a matter of federal law,we deem it the more prudent course to allow the connecticut supreme court to speak to the issue first.
in deciding the federal immunity question,we would apply the cleavinger factors,which we detail infra.we respectfully request that the connecticut supreme court discuss these factors in light of the role played by conservators,attorneys,and nursing homes.we will decide,after receiving the connecticut supreme court guidance,the federal law immunity questions.
in so doing,we do not intend to suggest that judicial immunity always turns on state law.indeed,the common law doctrine predates even our government.see floyd barker,eng.star chamber.the supreme court has recognized judicial immunity for over one hundred years,see bradley fisher,wall,as have federal courts around the country,see,cok cosentino,cir,including our own,see tucker,when addressing federal civil rights claims.nevertheless,application of cleavinger in this case directly implicates the role and function of conservators,attorneys,and nursing homes in the connecticut probate court system and connecticut public policy,matters that the connecticut supreme court is better equipped to speak to.
if,based on the connecticut supreme court guidance as to the cleavinger factors,we conclude that the immunity defense is not available to donovan,newman,or grove manor,as a matter of federal law,then we need not decide the precise outer bounds of immunity.however,if we ultimately conclude that the immunity defense is available to any of the defendants under federal law,we will have to determine the circumstances under which immunity is defeated.even judicial immunity,which provides judges with very broad protection,may be overcome if the judge acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction or if he is not acting in his judicial capacity.see,tucker,at citing cases.it may be the case that immunity may similarly be overcome for example,if the plaintiff alleges that the actions a defendant took were discretionary as opposed to in strict compliance with court orders,undertaken in bad faith,intentional torts.no case in our circuit spells out the circumstances under which immunity may be surmounted.if such immunity exists in this case,we will undertake to decide this question.if it does not,then gross lawsuit may proceed in the normal course.
the nature of this second step can be illustrated with an example from donovan brief.donovan argues that the actions she gross property,maintaining a bank account with him,changing the locks on his house,proper and within the scope of the duties that a conservator typically carries out.however,these arguments do not go to whether a conservator has immunity step one.they go to whether gross complaint,assuming there is immunity,alleges sufficient facts to overcome it.it may,or it may not we do not decide that question now,but it is a distinct question from whether immunity even extends to these kinds of defendants.
of course,it should go without saying that donovan or any defendant can not,at this stage,argue that certain actions such as placing gross in the locked ward of the nursing home,restricting his access to his children,and forcibly returning him to grove manor from a new york hospital were for his own protection.at this stage,we must construe all facts in the light most favorable to gross.a defendant may not bootstrap an argument that she should not be liable on the merits into an argument that she is protected by absolute immunity.we can not resolve factual disputes in the defendants favor at this stage to conclude that they are absolutely immune from suit 
with this background in mind,we analyze the judicial and immunity questions as to brunnock,donovan,newman,and grove manor.
ii.judicial immunity judge thomas brunnock 
plaintiff makes several claims against brunnock,including violation of the americans with disabilities act,conspiracy per,violation of due process rights,abuse of process,and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.it is unnecessary to parse the specifics of each claim because the only issue on appeal is immunity.we affirm the grant of judicial immunity as to the judge.
the problems in this case began when brunnock signed an order on august,indicating that a hearing would occur on september that gross was to be notified of the hearing by august.moreover,there is no indication that gross even learned of the hearing until august,just two days prior.additional diligence on brunnock part could have uncovered the fact that gross was neither a resident nor a domiciliary of connecticut as judge gormley of the superior court noted at the hearing on the habeas petition,there was not a scintilla of evidence that gross was a resident or domiciliary of the state of connecticut.obviously,brunnock to some extent had to rely on the representations of gross appointed counsel,particular,knowing that gross was not served with notice of the hearing until past the statutory deadline,and obviously aware of the fact that gross was not at the hearing would have been advisable to inquire further into the facts.indeed,as judge gormley noted,gross does get to go to the hearing,or get notice of the hearing,and has no ability to say to anybody,i do live here.t his case has disturbed me from day one.i kept looking for some evidence that would support what has taken place in this case but i find none 
nevertheless,brunnock mishandling of the case is insufficient to defeat judicial immunity.a judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error,was done maliciously,or was in excess of his authority rather,he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.stump sparkman,d internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.the critical question is whether he had jurisdiction.id.at.however,there is a difference between exceeding jurisdiction and acting in the absence of jurisdiction 
if a probate judge,with jurisdiction over only wills and estates,should try a criminal case,he would be acting in the clear absence of jurisdiction and would not be immune from liability for his action on the other hand,if a judge of a criminal court should convict a defendant of a nonexistent crime,he would merely be acting in excess of his jurisdiction and would be immune.
id.at.judicial immunity is not defeated even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly.pierson ray,d.
gross suggests that it should be easier to defeat judicial immunity when the judge in question is sitting on a court of limited jurisdiction.however,this is not the law.admittedly,some discussion in stump suggests that the judge was immune because he sat on a court of general jurisdiction.see stump,at.noting that the judge had original exclusive jurisdiction in all cases at law and in equity whatsoever internal quotation marks omitted.the point is not that a judge on a court of general jurisdiction enjoys more immunity than one on a court of limited jurisdiction.rather,the point is that a judge on a court of general jurisdiction is less likely to have acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.
more to the point,the discussion in these in the parties briefs in this an elastic,and therefore imprecise,concept of jurisdiction.united states cotton,d.in this context,a court acts in the absence of all jurisdiction when it does not have any statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,it is undisputed that brunnock had the power to adjudicate conservatorship applications.the defect arose out of the erroneous conclusion that gross was a resident of connecticut.this erroneous legal conclusion is insufficient to strip the judge of immunity.
in maestri jutkofsky,cir,we addressed judicial immunity in the context of a lawsuit against a town justice.in that case,the plaintiffs were arrested,based on an arrest warrant issued by the defendant,in the town of germantown.however,the defendant was a town justice in taghkanic,which is not adjacent to germantown.by statute,town justices have jurisdiction only in the town in which the offense was committed or,in certain circumstances,any adjoining town within the same county.id.at.we explained in maestri that a judge will be denied immunity only where it appears,first,that the judge acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction,and second,that the judge must have known that he or she was acting in the clear absence of jurisdiction.id.at emphasis added.in that case,we held that immunity did not apply,because the offense in question occurred in a town,and n o reasonable town judge would have thought himself to have had jurisdiction over a town.id.
gross seizes on that language here,arguing that no reasonable connecticut probate court judge would have thought he had jurisdiction over a new york resident.this misses the crucial distinction between maestri and this case,that it was undisputed that the judge in maestri knew the plaintiffs were from a town over which he had no jurisdiction.see id.at.here,brunnock had subject matter jurisdiction over cases like gross,and though it was ultimately held that he did not have personal jurisdiction over gross,brunnock did not know it at the time.immunity therefore applies.
plaintiff also argues that brunnock knew or should have known that he did not have jurisdiction as of the september,hearing,because the notice that brunnock signed on august was facially defective,as it did not allow for the seven days notice,see.ann.a the return of service indicated that limauro,and not gross himself or his attorney,was the person served and newman report to the court indicated that gross lived in new york,so that a reasonable judge would have,at a minimum,engaged in further to determine if jurisdiction were proper.these claims find some support in the statute,which provides that the respondent must be given seven days notice of a hearing and that he himself must be served.moreover,if the respondent wishes to attend the hearing,the judge must either hold the hearing in a convenient location or visit the respondent.id.a b.
but as the supreme court has instructed,judges should be at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences.pierson,at.moreover,the scope of the judge jurisdiction must be construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of the judge.stump,at.brunnock clearly had jurisdiction over cases like gross.the judge simply did not have jurisdiction over gross case itself.indeed,as a recent connecticut appellate court case explains,a judge does not act in the complete absence of authority,even if she acts erroneously,unless the judicial conduct is so far outside the normal scope of judicial functions that the judge was in effect not acting as a judge.leseberg,internal quotation marks omitted.that test is not met here ruling on conservatorship applications and related matters are judicial functions within the realm of a probate judge.see id.at.a judge fail ure to comply fully with statutory procedures,as was the case here,is insufficient to strip the judge of immunity.id.at.
the foregoing analysis applies to state as well as federal claims.as explained above,connecticut common law of judicial immunity is,so far as relevant here,the same as the federal test.see shay rossi,citing stump sparkman,d,overruled on other grounds,miller egan,leseberg,citing mireles waco,d.for the reasons discussed above,we hold that brunnock is entitled to judicial immunity on state law claims.
thus,brunnock did not act in the clear absence of subject matter jurisdiction,and he was not aware of the defects in personal jurisdiction,making judicial immunity appropriate.we therefore affirm the district court grant of judicial immunity to brunnock and its dismissal of all claims against him 
iii.immunity 
federal state law 
as discussed above,there are two distinct but related questions in this case first,whether donovan,newman,and grove manor are entitled to the defense of absolute immunity as to federal claims a question of federal law,and second,whether donovan and newman are entitled to such immunity as to state law claims a question of state law.we are certifying questions as to both of these issues.we are certifying questions regarding the state law issue because the connecticut supreme court has not definitively spoken on the subject of immunity for conservators and attorneys for conservatees.
we are also certifying a question that relates to the federal law question.we do so because application of the factors the supreme court has outlined intersects unsettled questions of connecticut state law and policy.therefore,we ask the connecticut supreme court to give us guidance as to the role of conservators,attorneys,and nursing homes within the connecticut probate court system.upon receiving this guidance,we will decide the federal claims at issue here.
we note that,in practice,the division between the federal and state law issues may vanish.as we explain infra,the connecticut supreme court,in its most recent case on immunity,explained that it was adopting supreme court case law on the subject.it does not appear to us that the federal and connecticut tests diverge much,if at all.however,we do not presume to decide the contours of connecticut law after all,the connecticut supreme court may expand,restrict,abandon,or otherwise modify its current state common law doctrine on this point.even if that is the case,we would nonetheless find helpful a discussion of the role of the various actors in the connecticut probate system in light of the federal law factors as enunciated in cleavinger.
of course,if connecticut state law analysis of immunity relies on the same factors as the federal law test,then the connecticut supreme court will so advise us.
in either event,we will ultimately apply and elaborate on the federal law test for immunity.first,in light of the guidance received by the connecticut supreme court,we will decide whether the defense of immunity is available to these defendants at all.then,we may also need to decide related questions,such as whether the defense should be raised at a motion to dismiss,or at a later stage.if we conclude that immunity applies to any of the federal claims against the defendants,we may also need to answer the question of precise scope and contours of that immunity.these determinations would be made as a matter of federal law.
therefore,although state and federal law questions are posed with regard to each defendant,we do not bifurcate our analysis below.
conservator kathleen donovan 
gross pleads several federal and state law claims against the former conservator,kathleen donovan conspiracy pursuant to,violation of his right to due process,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,breach of fiduciary duty,false arrest and tortious assault,and false imprisonment.the district court dismissed all of these claims,concluding that donovan,as a conservator acting pursuant to the probate court order,was entitled to immunity.the district court wrote,
donovan argument to extend judge brunnock judicial immunity to her actions is a simple one as the law is clear and well established.donovan was acting as an agent of the probate court,at the direction and under the supervision of judge brunnock.if judge brunnock is immune from suit,than sic donovan as conservator acting as his agent or at his direction must be immune.
however,we are not of the view that the law is clear and.to the contrary,as we read them,the statutes and case law in connecticut do not sufficiently enable us to analyze the factors set forth by the supreme court in deciding when an individual is entitled to immunity.
at the outset,we note that donovan is correct courts are willing to extend absolute judicial immunity to those who perform functions closely associated with the judicial process.cleavinger saxner,d.those who seek this absolute immunity bear the burden of demonstrating that public policy requires such a broad exemption from suit.see id.at.the supreme court has set forth a functional approach to determine whether a particular individual is entitled to immunity.the factors include 
a the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation b the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct c insulation from political influence d the importance of precedent e the adversary nature of the process and f the correctability of error on appeal.
id.at.see also butz economou,d describing the factors in greater detail.
in this case,the application of these factors directly intersects the nature and function of the connecticut probate court system and considerations of connecticut public policy.for example,although all individuals connected to the judicial process in some way would surely like to perform their functions without harassment or intimidation,cleavinger,at,certain of those individuals enjoy absolute immunity,see,imbler pachtman,d prosecutors entitled to absolute immunity,while others do not,see,antoine byers anderson,d court reporters not entitled to absolute immunity.which side of the line a conservator falls on necessarily involves questions regarding the role of a conservator in connecticut and the way that position is envisioned in connecticut statutory and common law scheme.
connecticut case law is not sufficiently on point to provide a rule of decision here.in carrubba moskowitz,the connecticut supreme court held that counsel for minor children were entitled to immunity.the court began the analysis by noting that the extension of judicial immunity to others generally has been very limited.id.at.moreover,
not every category of persons protected by immunity are entitled to absolute immunity.in fact,just the opposite presumption of persons protected by immunity are entitled only to the scope of immunity that is necessary to protect those persons in the performance of their duties.the presumption is that qualified rather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties.
id.at,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.these comments might lead one to conclude that courts should be very reluctant to expand the reach of immunity.
however,after adopting the supreme court functional approach,the court determined that counsel for minor children were entitled to absolute immunity.the court reasoned that counsel for minor children were subject to the court discretion,could be removed by the court at any time,and were,just as any other attorney,subject to discipline for violations of the code of professional conduct.id.at.the court emphasized that counsel for minor children served a dual function in addition to being attorneys advocating their clients,the child wishes,they must promot e the best interests of the child,id.at,which involves be ing more objective than a privately retained attorney,id.at.the court acknowledged that the dual obligations imposed on the attorney for a minor child are not easily disentangled.id.however,the role as advocate must always be subordinated to the attorney duty to serve the best interests of the child.id.at.the court also distinguished the case of representing a imposes a higher degree of objectivity on an attorney from that of representing an adult.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,after explaining that the attorney had an objective role,not purely as an advocate that made her integral to the judicial process,and that the complaint made no allegation that the attorney acted outside the usual role of an attorney for the minor children,the court concluded that the attorney was entitled to absolute immunity.id.at.
relying primarily on carrubba,donovan argues that she should be immune from suit.carrubba,however,is not sufficiently instructive.the application of the factors set forth in cleavinger to the circumstances of this case a federal question depends on the nature of the role a conservator serves under connecticut law,a topic that carrubba does not discuss.therefore,we think it most prudent to seek the assistance of the connecticut supreme court with respect to the cleavinger factors.
indeed,connecticut law seems to recognize that,in certain circumstances,conservators can be liable for their official actions.first,a probate court is required by statute to require the posting of a probate bond if it appoints a conservator for the estate of a respondent.see.ann.g.the court also has the ability,in its discretion,if it appoints a conservator of the person,to require the conservator to post a bond for the protection of the respondent.id.the court did not require such a bond in this case,which gross claims was part of the conspiracy against him.regardless,the fact that the law requires a probate bond,and permits a bond for the protection of the conserved person,suggests that the legislature was aware of the possibility of conservators liability.
the connecticut supreme court decision in jewish home for the elderly of fairfield county,cantore,is instructive.the home at which the decedent stayed sued the conservator when the conservator did not pay it for its services.it alleged an action on the probate bond to recover for the loss it suffered as a result of the conservator failure to ensure timely payment for the conservatee kosminer care.id.at.the connecticut supreme court determined that the complaint had stated a claim against cantore and that the home had standing to bring its claim.id.at.it held that cantore had a duty,among other things,to use kosminer estate to support her and pay her debts.id.at.thus,the connecticut supreme court holding in the cantore litigation seems to recognize that a conservator can be sued in an action on the probate bond when he fails to perform his duty.
moreover,a conservator is defined as a fiduciary,see.ann,and fiduciaries who,in good faith,make payments pursuant to the order of the court of probate having jurisdiction before an appeal has been taken from such order,shall not be liable for the money so paid even if the order under which such payment has been made is later reversed,vacated,or set aside,id.a.it could be,however,that a fiduciary may be liable if he did not act in good faith,if the probate court lacked jurisdiction,or if he acted after an appeal was taken and the underlying order is reversed.
thus,connecticut law seems to imply that at least certain types of conservators may be liable in certain circumstances.this suggests that conservators do not have absolute immunity from suit the question but that they may raise certain affirmative defenses to liability.in such a context,it appears inappropriate for us to hold that conservators are absolutely immune from suit.
it would be particularly inappropriate for us to so hold because,in other contexts,connecticut law explicitly recognizes certain conservators immunity.by law,a ll receivers or conservators of trust banks or uninsured banks shall be immune from suit and liability,both personally and in their official capacities.ann.a b west pocket part emphasis added.moreover,immunity under this section does not extend to attorneys retained by the conservator,id.a,or to intentional or wilful and wanton misconduct of the receiver or conservator,id.b.other types of conservators are similarly immune,see,id.guardians of people with mental retardation.these provisions do not apply to the kind of conservator at issue in this case.the fact that the legislature specifically made several types of guardians and conservators immune but not others lends support for the proposition that conservators like donovan are not immune or that,if such immunity exists,it is not absolute.inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.
to be sure,the connecticut supreme court may disagree and conclude that it is more consistent with the overall statutory scheme to hold that conservators like donovan are immune despite the fact that no statute explicitly confers immunity.for example,the court may reason that if other conservators are immune,donovan should be as well.this underscores the rationale for certification the state court is in a better position to speak to that question of state policy.see sealed sealed,cir where a question of statutory interpretation implicates the weighing of policy concerns,principles of comity and federalism strongly support certification.citation omitted.
admittedly,other federal cases have held that a conservator is entitled to immunity.see,cok cosentino,cir per curiam collins west hartford police department,d rzayeva united states,d sasscer,wl,at,
donovan suggests that conservators are simply an arm of the probate court.but this is not the end of the inquiry.although it is clear that the conservator acts under the supervision and control of the probate court,they do so in the care and management of the ward estate or person.probate of marcus,emphasis added.indeed,marcus,which donovan cites,held that it was impermissible for a conservator to make a gift to herself from the ward estate.the conservatrices sought to make such a gift,the probate court denied them permission,and they appealed.id.it seems at first cut illogical to hold that,if the conservatrices in that case made such an ultra vires distribution,they would be absolutely immune from suit by the ward,even though the actions they took were clearly impermissible.
in sum,our conclusion as to immunity as to federal claims against donovan is governed by the cleavinger factors.the analysis of those factors implicates questions of connecticut state law that,as described above,are not entirely clear.for example,there is obviously a need to assure that conservators can operate without the threat of harassing litigation,but connecticut courts,familiar with the role of the conservator within that state system,may believe that this factor deserves less weight than we might otherwise give it.similarly,the connecticut supreme court might inform us that there are strong procedural safeguards in place the second factor,but that these are undercut by the fact that probate judges in connecticut are elected the third factor.the connecticut court can also assist us in determining,for example,the chances of errors being corrected on appeal or the role of precedent in the connecticut probate system 
therefore,as to gross federal claims against donovan,we certify a question to the connecticut supreme court.we ask the court to explain the role and function of a conservator,in the context of connecticut probate court system,in light of the factors set forth by cleavinger saxner,d.upon receiving the connecticut supreme court response,we will decide whether immunity extends to conservators as a matter of federal law,and if so,the question of what the precise scope of that immunity is.
as to the state claims against donovan,we simply certify the question of whether conservators are entitled to immunity.regarding the state law claims,the connecticut supreme court determination will be final.
attorney jonathan newman 
gross makes several federal and state claims against newman conspiracy by way of,violation of his right to due process,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and malpractice.although donovan and newman are both attorneys,there is a significant caveat newman,as gross attorney,was an advocate,while donovan,as the conservator,was not.the parties seem to dispute whether newman role was solely that of an advocate gross position or whether he was to advocate gross views tempered by his own judgment newman position.however,it is clear that,at least to some extent,newman was supposed to act as an advocate.therefore,his role was to some degree less as an arm of the court,and he has a correspondingly weaker claim to immunity.
the cleavinger factors are relevant here,as they were for donovan 
a the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation b the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct c insulation from political influence d the importance of precedent e the adversary nature of the process and f the correctability of error on appeal.
newman argues that he is entitled to immunity because he was acting as an arm of the court,noting that he was appointed by the probate court to represent the interests of a person being considered for a conservatorship.brief of newman at.however,this statement misleadingly evokes the best interests standard that applies to counsel for minor children.see carrubba,at,holding that counsel for a minor child has a duty to secure the best interests of the child.by contrast,the statute on conservatorships indicates that the court may appoint an attorney to represent the respondent.ann.b,with no mention of best interests.in light of this statute,newman argument that a physician has already determined that the person is incompetent and therefore the attorney could not simply parrot the client wishes,but was obligated to assist the court in serving the client best interest,is particularly weak.it also appears to misconstrue the nature of the proceedings.the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is incompetent.id.d.until that time,the respondent is like any other competent client.moreover,after the conservator is appointed,she is the one who manages the ward affairs and his person.id.thus,if anyone,it is the conservator who exercises independent judgment as against the ward wishes,not the attorney.indeed,one can imagine that the system works best when the conservator reports to the court an independent judgment about what the ward best interests would be,and the attorney advocates for his client wishes,with the probate court ultimately responsible for the ward protection.of course,whether such a system works best is a matter of connecticut policy 
newman also points to various facts that he says support his claim that he acted properly gross could not attend the hearing because he was in the hospital though alternative arrangements could have,and by statute must have,been made signing papers as attorney for ward when gross had not yet been adjudged incompetent was merely a technical error the lack of notice was curable and so on.however,just as with donovan,newman may not bootstrap his arguments on the merits into an argument for immunity.at this stage,we must take all facts in the light most favorable to gross.the only issue on appeal is that of immunity.whether newman was or was not negligent is not before us.
instead,our analysis is governed by the cleavinger factors,and as with donovan,that analysis implicates questions of state probate law.for example,though attorneys typically should operate without the threat of harassing litigation,connecticut policy may favor giving relatively less protection for attorneys appointed for conservatees than for those for minor children.carrubba,at,noting that prosecutors in connecticut are entitled to absolute immunity but public defenders are entitled to only qualified immunity.as with donovan,the connecticut supreme court might inform us that there are strong procedural safeguards in place the second factor,but that these are undercut by the fact that probate judges in connecticut are elected the third factor.the cleavinger analysis is also affected by the fact that newman has some role as an advocate,making him commensurately less of an arm of the court.
therefore,as to gross federal claims against newman,we certify a question to the connecticut supreme court.we ask the court to explain the role and function of a attorney for a conservatee,in the context of connecticut probate court system,in light of the factors set forth by cleavinger saxner,d.upon receiving the connecticut supreme court response,we will decide whether immunity extends to attorneys for conservatees as a matter of federal law,and if so,the question of what the precise scope of that immunity is.
as to the state claims against newman,we simply certify the question of whether attorneys for conservatees are entitled to immunity.as to the state law claims,the connecticut supreme court determination will be final.
grove manor nursing home 
gross pled six claims against grove manor two civil rights conspiracy claims pursuant to,two statutory violations concerning the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and the patients bill of rights,and emotional distress intentional and negligent.of these,the civil rights claims are preserved on appeal and the remainder are waived.however,as to the emotional distress claims,dismissal was without prejudice and these claims may be reasserted in the future.
civil rights claims 
the civil rights claims against grove manor rise and fall with the determination of immunity.if the conservator and attorney have immunity,then the nursing home may as well,at least to the extent that it was merely carrying out their orders.if they do not,then the nursing home likely does not.for the reasons discussed above in connection with donovan and newman,we certify questions regarding the nursing home immunity as well.however,we note that the case for derivative immunity is weakest with regard to the nursing home.grove manor was furthest removed from the judicial process.moreover,no court case that we have found extends judicial immunity to an institution as opposed to an individual.
once again,our analysis is governed by the cleavinger factors.we will not rehash them here,but we note that,as with donovan and newman,the application of those factors to grove manor implicates connecticut probate law.because grove manor is more removed from the judicial process than donovan or newman,it may have a weaker case for immunity.however,despite this fact,the policy considerations may exist that militate toward finding grove manor immune,particularly if donovan and newman are immune.the connecticut supreme court is in the best position to address these questions in the first instance.therefore,as to gross federal claims against grove manor,we certify a question to the connecticut supreme court.we ask the court to explain the role and function of a nursing home in the context of connecticut probate court system,in light of the factors set forth by cleavinger saxner,d.upon receiving the connecticut supreme court response,we will decide whether immunity extends to nursing homes as a matter of federal law,and if so,the question of what the precise scope of that immunity is.
statutory and tort claims 
the district court declined to grant grove manor immunity as to the statutory claims and the tort claims.the district court reasoned that these causes of action went to grove manor decision to assign gross to a particular room,to assign him a particular roommate,and to keep him in the room with the roommate after the roommate attacked him.the district court concluded that these decisions were discretionary and not specifically called for by court order thus,even if immunity applied to grove manor,it would not apply to these discretionary acts.
the district court went on to dismiss plaintiff statutory claims because he did not discuss them in his opposition to grove manor motion to dismiss.we affirm the dismissal of these claims because they were waived below and are not discussed in the plaintiff opening brief on appeal other than in connection with whether grove manor has immunity.
this leaves the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims against the nursing home.as noted above,these claims survived the district court immunity analysis.roughly three weeks later,the district court held a telephone conference to get further background on the case and determine issues for discovery and the subsequent course of litigation.then,at the very end of that conversation,the following transpired 
the court so with respect to the ombudsman the period of damages would not exceed two months,the time from ewald receiving the complaint and gross being released.and with respect to the nursing home the period of damages would not exceed four days,the time after gross getting attacked and the nursing home reassigning him to a different room.is that inaccurate 
peters,counsel for gross with the facts before me i ca say that it is,your honor.
the court all right.given that,of course you understand that in order to sustain an action in district court there has to be a showing by you,the plaintiff,that your damages are or greater.and to be honest with you,i at a loss to see how that could possibly be the case on these facts.i do believe i have jurisdiction.
that not to say that if i dismiss this case you would not be able to file it in superior court.but i do believe you have federal court jurisdiction any longer given the remaining claims and the extent of the damages associated with those remaining claims.
peters we would like mean,we would not oppose that analysis which would call for you dismissing the case because then we could appeal.
