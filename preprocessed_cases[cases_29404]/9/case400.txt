this case presents as a regarded as disability claim under the americans with disabilities act ada.however,as the discussion below reveals,once the layers of argument are stripped away,the regarded as claim is revealed to be a chimera.thus,the district court grant of summary judgment,on reconsideration,as to the regarded as claim was appropriate,and the judgment is affirmed.
facts and background 
in late,appellant delia ruiz rivera ruiz rivera began working,on a temporary basis,as a packaging operator in appellee pfizer pharmaceutical llc pfizer puerto rico facility.nearly one year later,ruiz rivera achieved regular employee status when she was assigned to pfizer bottling department.ruiz rivera position as a packaging operator in the bottling department involved pouring pills,bottles,and caps,monitoring the conveyor,packing and inspecting the product,and cleaning machinery.
ruiz rivera became pregnant several months after becoming a regular employee.as her pregnancy progressed,she submitted several notes from her doctor to pfizer informing it of certain limitations,including a recommendation that she avoid walking long distances,that her shifts be limited,and that she work only in a seated position.
in august,ruiz rivera informed pfizer of several medical problems,including edema,numbness,and continued effects of a potentially herniated disc.based on her doctor recommendations,pfizer,through its physician,felix,authorized a short leave of absence.soon after ruiz rivera returned from leave,she submitted to felix another medical certificate from ramos,her physiatrist,asking that she be excused from work from august,through november,citing her herniated medical problems.accordingly,pfizer granted her temporary disability leave until november.come november,ruiz rivera sought and was provided another medical leave until january.she gave birth in late december,at which time her maternity leave commenced.
at the completion of her maternity leave,ruiz rivera submitted to felix at pfizer a medical certificate from ramos indicating that she was being treated for carpal tunnel syndrome and lumbo sacral disc herniation.ramos indicated that ruiz rivera was fit to return to work,with specific limitations,recommended that she avoid repetitive hand motions,placing her hands over her shoulders,lifting,pushing,holding,and bending,and placed a pound limitation on how much she could lift.at the same time,ruiz rivera presented to felix a medical certificate from a different doctor diagnosing her with major depression.based on these two submissions,pfizer granted an additional month of leave benefits to ruiz rivera.on march,after ruiz rivera had been on authorized leave for nearly seven straight months,she returned to work and insisted that pfizer implement her doctor earlier recommendations and restrictions.felix informed ruiz rivera that there were no opportunities available where she could work with such stringent limitations however,felix agreed to confer with ramos,and prepared for him a consultation form regarding ruiz rivera condition,treatment options,and rehabilitation opportunities.
after an additional week of leave,ruiz rivera reported back to work at pfizer.at that time,she provided to felix a consultation report which provided,in pertinent part

based on the information provided and the restrictions imposed by ramos,felix concluded that,i n view of this sic recommendations and after conversation with plaintiff work area supervisor where she can not perform the essential tasks of her job and needs her hands i do not recommend a rtw return to work to prevent further aggravation or lesion.case discussed with hr human resources for plan of action.
ruiz rivera later spoke to frances guzman,pfizer assistant personnel manager,who advised her that pfizer did not have to accommodate the restrictions imposed by her doctor because,in guzman view,ruiz rivera was not disabled under the ada guzman testified at her deposition that she explained to ruiz rivera that because she was entitled to accommodation,she should pursue medical leave and again seek temporary disability insurance.ruiz rivera asserts that guzman also told her that because of the conditions imposed by her physicians,there was no opportunity for her to work at pfizer or at any other pharmaceutical company.while pfizer took no action to terminate her at this point,ruiz rivera did not return to work after these conversations.
approximately three months later,in a letter dated june,pfizer requested that ruiz rivera return for a meeting to discuss her health and status.ruiz rivera responded by letter shortly thereafter,but did not accept pfizer request for a meeting.approximately six months later,pfizer again wrote to ruiz rivera requesting that she return to work.ruiz rivera did not respond.after ruiz rivera rebuffed this request,pfizer officially terminated her employment 
the amended complaint the complaint in this matter alleged numerous violations of federal and puerto rico law,including the americans with disabilities act ada,the puerto rico law counterpart to the ada,law of july,law title vii of the civil rights act,et the pregnancy discrimination act the puerto rico pregnant mothers protection act act of march,the puerto rico sex discrimination in employment act act of july,the puerto rico discrimination in employment act act of june,and puerto rico law of may.through summary judgment,pfizer moved for dismissal of the complaint.soon after,the parties stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of all but the ada and law claims.in support of its motion for summary judgment,pfizer argued that ruiz rivera was not disabled within the meaning of the ada,that she thus could not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination,and as a result,she was not entitled to any accommodations.in response,ruiz rivera asserted that she was disabled under the ada insomuch as she was substantially limited in the major life activity of sitting and standing,and that pfizer failure to accommodate her disability violated the ada.in the alternative,she argued in her summary judgment opposition papers that she was not disabled in the sense that she was not substantially limited on the major life activity of working but that pfizer regarded her as such when it refused to accommodate the restrictions imposed by her doctors.notably,as we discuss in more detail below,this was the first time that ruiz rivera raised the regarded as claim with any degree of specificity 
the district court conducted a thorough analysis of ruiz rivera failure to accommodate claim.see generally ruiz rivera pfizer pharm.llc,d.the district court determined that the record was devoid of evidence showing that ruiz rivera was disabled in any major life activity,and,accordingly,found that she was not entitled to accommodation.see id.at.the district court then went on to assess ruiz rivera purported parallel claim that she was not disabled,but that pfizer terminated her because it mistakenly regarded her as disabled.based on statements allegedly made by felix and guzman,the district court denied summary judgment,stating that ruiz rivera had proffered sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that pfizer regarded her as having an impairment which prevented her from going back to work and which led to her eventual termination.id.at 
pfizer filed a motion for reconsideration on december,arguing that ruiz rivera regarded as claim was legally insufficient if based solely on statements made in connection with her request for reasonable accommodation.rather than rebut pfizer legal argument,in her opposition ruiz rivera asserted only that reconsideration was inappropriate.the district court,in response,reversed course and issued an order granting pfizer motion for reconsideration and dismissing the regarded as claim ruiz rivera timely appealed that ruling to this court,though she did not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on the failure to accommodate claim.

iii.the regarded as claim 
the ada provides a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.katz city metal,cir quoting b.to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must prove that she was disabled within the meaning of the ada that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without accommodation and that she was discharged or adversely affected,in whole or in part,because of her disability.see also merck,sharp dohme química,cir.for purposes of the ada,one is considered disabled if she a has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities b has a record of such an impairment or c is regarded as having such an impairment.bailey,cir see also.the regarded as prong of the ada exists to cover those cases in which myths,fears and stereotypes affect the employer treatment of an individual,plant morton int l,cir quoting l,because congress has recognized that society accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.sullivan neiman marcus group,cir citations omitted.
regarded as claims primarily fall into one of two categories a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.sullivan,at citing sutton united air lines,d.
a plaintiff claiming that he is regarded as disabled can not merely show that his employer perceived him as somehow disabled rather,he must prove that the employer regarded him as disabled within the meaning of the ada.bailey,at.when working is the major life activity at issue,a plaintiff must demonstrate not only that the employer thought that he was impaired in his ability to do the job that he held,but also that the employer regarded him as substantially impaired in either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared with the average person having comparable training,skills,and abilities.sullivan,at quoting murphy united parcel,d.
because ruiz rivera did not appeal the district court dismissal of her failure to accommodate claim,that issue is not before us.ruiz rivera,d at.therefore,it is the law of the case that for the periods of time relevant to this inquiry ruiz rivera was not disabled within the meaning of the ada,did not have an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity,and pfizer was not obligated to accommodate her.on appeal,however,ruiz rivera appears to continue to press her argument that her impairment renders her disabled and entitles her to accommodation,while simultaneously arguing that pfizer mistakenly believed her to be substantially limited in a major life activity,regarded her as disabled,and terminated her as a result of this perception of disability.
from our review of ruiz rivera submissions,from the complaint to her papers on appeal,it is apparent that her regarded as claim is really nothing more than a poorly disguised version of her failure to accommodate claim.in fact,the initial pleading of her regarded as claim was so indistinct that pfizer did not even move for summary judgment on that claim,apparently because it was unaware it had even been raised indeed,the first time ruiz rivera spells out her regarded as theory is in her opposition to pfizer motion for summary judgment,something that pfizer strenuously,but unsuccessfully objected to as being an hour claim.on appeal,with the failure to accommodate claim not on review,the only issue is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the regarded as claim,on a motion for reconsideration,after initially finding material facts in dispute and denying the motion.we can understand how the district court may have been tripped up over this issue given the way in which ruiz rivera has plead and argued the case.but in the end,we think the district court got to the right result,as we will explain.
we begin with the complaint itself.as noted above,ruiz rivera complaint does not separate her failure to accommodate claim and her regarded as claim into distinct causes of action.the first cause of action,which alleges that pfizer termination because of plaintiff disability was in violation of the ada,contains nothing that would signal to a reader that it intended to raise a regarded as claim.instead,it affirmatively declares that ruiz rivera is disabled,because she has a record of a physical and mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities.there is no factual allegation that ruiz rivera had any impairment which pfizer wrongly regarded as limiting a major life activity any allegation that pfizer had stereotyped her or anything in fact that could remotely be characterized as a description of an impairment being mischaracterized or misperceived.rather,the only indication that a regarded as claim might have been lurking in the shadows of the complaint was the inclusion of the word perceived in one paragraph of her eleven paragraph first cause of action.
paragraph of the complaint alleges on march,pfizer intentionally discriminated against plaintiff because of her disability as described above in that pfizer terminated plaintiff because of her perceived disability.emphasis added.while this paragraph could signal to a defendant that plaintiff is asserting a regarded as claim,with no facts alleged to explain any false perception on pfizer part,and no facts alluding to any impairment which pfizer mistakenly believed to be substantially limiting,this allusion falls far short of the mark.as recently clarified by the supreme court,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle ment to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,bell atl.twombly,d citations omitted,and t o survive rule b dismissal,a plaintiff facts must possess enough heft to sho w that plaintiff is entitled to relief.clark boscher,cir quoting twombly.at.the fundamental purpose of our pleadings rules is to protect a defendant inalienable right to know in advance the nature of the cause of action being asserted against him.rodriguez doral mortgage,cir.we do not think that the mere inclusion in the complaint of the word perceived was enough to put pfizer on notice that ruiz rivera was making a regarded as claim against it.on this basis alone,the regarded as claim was subject to dismissal.
moreover,the supreme court has implied that regarded as claims under the ada require an even greater level of specificity than other claims.sutton,at.in order to allege an actionable regarded as claim,a plaintiff must select and identify the major life activity that she will attempt to prove the employer regarded as being substantially limited by her impairment.see sutton,at.dismissing ada regarded as claim in part for inadequacy of its pleading,wherein the petitioners failed to state a claim that respondent regard ed their impairment as substantially limiting their ability to work see also amadio ford motor,cir kaiser banc of am.inv,d.
it is apparent from our review that at the time ruiz rivera filed her complaint,regarded as disability discrimination was barely an throwaway line in one paragraph of a lengthy complaint.faced with a and convincing motion for summary judgment on her ada claim,however,ruiz rivera shifted legal theories and sought to her complaint in a way that might parry pfizer blow.it simply will not do for a plaintiff to fail to plead with adequate specificity facts to support a regarded as claim,hoping to play that card if her initial hand is a dud.see fleming,cir s ummary judgment is not a procedural second chance to flesh out inadequate pleadings.
ruiz rivera regarded as claim also fails on substantive grounds.the undisputed facts reveal that,in late march,ruiz rivera presented to felix at pfizer a list of workplace restrictions imposed by her doctor based on her various ailments.her doctor note indicated that the restrictions should remain in place for at least six months,perhaps longer.based on these these restrictions determined that ruiz rivera could not perform the essential tasks of her job as a packaging operator in the bottling department.ruiz rivera maintains that she then sought accommodation for her limitations and in doing so requested that she be given a different job at the facility pfizer denied ruiz rivera request,and,according to the testimony of frances guzman,assistant personnel manager,informed ruiz rivera that pfizer did not consider her to be disabled within the meaning of the ada and pfizer was under no obligation to accommodate her.
these undisputed facts,of course,were the basis for ruiz rivera claims for termination and failure to accommodate.she asserted that the impairments upon which her doctor restrictions were based constituted a disability under the ada which pfizer was required to reasonably accommodate.pfizer disagreed,concluding that ruiz rivera was not disabled within the meaning of the ada,and thus not entitled to any accommodation,and the district court concurred now,ruiz rivera uses pfizer lawful refusal to provide her with the accommodation as the primary basis for her regarded as claim.ruiz rivera does not maintain that she could perform her job as packaging operator in the bottling department with the restrictions imposed by her doctor,but that pfizer mistakenly believed her unable to do so rather,she maintains that she could perform her job if granted the accommodations to which the district court found she was not entitled.this,coupled with pfizer refusal to accommodate ruiz rivera request for a different job,is what forms the basis for her regarded as claim.
specifically,ruiz rivera insists that pfizer mistakenly regarded her as being substantially limited in the life activity of working.for her support,she cites to two events first,she cites felix response to the restrictions imposed by her personal physician,wherein felix determined she could not return to and work at her position in the bottling department at the pfizer plant and second,she points to the comment allegedly made to her by guzman to the effect that with the conditions imposed by her doctors,she could not perform any work at the pfizer plant or anywhere else in the pharmaceutical industry.as correctly argued by pfizer in its motion for reconsideration,ruiz rivera may not rely exclusively on her employer recognition or implementation of the restrictions imposed by her own physician to establish a regarded as claim.see lusk ryder integrated logistics,cir where the recognition of plaintiff limitations is not an erroneous perception,but is instead a recognition of fact,a finding that plaintiff was regarded as disabled is inappropriate.breitkreutz cambrex charles city,cir if a restriction is based upon the recommendations of physicians,then it is not based upon myths or stereotypes about the disabled and does not establish a perception of disability.see also wooten farmland foods,cir employer who terminated employee because of the restrictions associated with employee impairment did not regard employee as disabled in the major life activity of working where its perception of employee impairment was based not on speculation,stereotype,or myth,but on a doctor written restrictions.thus,pfizer recognition of ruiz rivera impairment,and unwillingness to provide the accommodation that ruiz rivera sought,but to which she was not entitled,simply does not transform its actions into regarded as discrimination.moreover,to allow this regarded as claim to stand would be tantamount to allowing her dismissed failure to accommodate claim in through the back door.see nuzum ozark auto,cir.
although the district court reconsideration of its original decision to deny summary judgment on the regarded as claim lacked written justification,it is clear to us that dismissal on reconsideration was both appropriate and warranted.any reliance on felix statements or opinion,based entirely on ruiz rivera own doctor recommendations,can not support a regarded as claim.furthermore,the allegation that pfizer mistakenly regarded ruiz rivera to be substantially limited in the life activity of working makes little sense in the face of the undisputed record that pfizer told ruiz rivera that it did not consider her impairment to constitute an ada covered disability.moreover,pfizer did not terminate ruiz rivera employment when it refused to accommodate the restrictions imposed by her doctor rather,it terminated her over nine months later,after numerous unsuccessful attempts to seek updates on her medical status.finally,the isolated comment allegedly made by guzman as to the impact of the restrictions on ruiz rivera ability to find work in the pharmaceutical industry is of no help to ruiz rivera.at the time that guzman allegedly made this comment,pfizer had determined,in reliance upon ruiz rivera own doctor recommendations,that ruiz rivera could not perform the essential functions of her job her impairment did not constitute a disability under the ada and it had no obligation to accommodate her.thus,while guzman may have considered the restrictions imposed by ruiz rivera doctors as limiting her chances of finding work elsewhere in the pharmaceutical industry,there simply is no evidence that ruiz rivera was refused accommodation or terminated because of this generalization.in light of the record,guzman statement at worst amounts to little more than a stray remark,one which standing alone is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.see patten stores,cir direct evidence of discrimination excludes mere background noise and stray remarks laurin providence,cir stray remarks,including statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself normally are insufficient to establish discriminatory animus citations omitted.
on reconsideration,the district court also dismissed ruiz rivera parallel regarded as claim under law of july,laws ann.tit,et,the puerto rico analogue to the ada.because law and the ada are coterminous,we affirm the district court dismissal of both regarded
