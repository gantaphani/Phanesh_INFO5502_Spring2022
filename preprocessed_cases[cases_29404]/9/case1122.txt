in,plaintiff thomas walczyk walczyk was convicted after a jury trial in connecticut on state law charges of disorderly conduct,see.a reckless endangerment,see id.a and improper firearm storage,see id.on appeal,the connecticut appellate court reversed,holding that walczyk conviction violated federal and state law because it was based on incriminating evidence obtained through search warrants that were not supported by probable cause.see state walczyk.thereafter,walczyk,his wife maximina,his minor child michelle,and his mother elizabeth initiated this civil action,suing defendants,all members of the farmington,connecticut police department,in the united states district court for the district of connecticut robert chatigny,chief judge,pursuant to and and connecticut law for money damages arising from events relating to walczyk reversed conviction.
although the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to some of plaintiffs claims,defendants now pursue an interlocutory appeal from so much of the district court order,entered on september,as denied them qualified immunity from plaintiffs unlawful arrest and search claims.see walczyk rio,d.not surprisingly,plaintiffs defend that denial.at the same time,elizabeth walczyk the district court denial of her motion for summary judgment on the liability element of her challenge to the search of her home.see id.at.meanwhile,thomas walczyk the award of summary judgment to defendants on his eighth amendment claim that he was detained on excessive bail.see id.at.
for the reasons discussed herein,we conclude that the arrest of thomas walczyk and the search of the home he shared with his wife and daughter were supported by probable cause.we reverse so much of the district court order as concluded otherwise,and we remand with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of defendants on that part of plaintiffs complaint.with respect to defendants search of elizabeth walczyk home,we affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity to defendants because the warrant authorizing that search was procured on the basis of plainly stale information and questions of fact remain as to whether any or all defendants acted knowingly or recklessly in misleading the issuing magistrate as to the currency of that information.those same questions of fact prompt us to affirm the district court denial of summary judgment to elizabeth walczyk on the liability element of her unlawful search claim.finally,with respect to walczyk excessive bail claim,we affirm the award of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground of absolute immunity.
factual background 
a.the underlying land.barberino realty acquires the land 
this case has its origins in a longstanding property dispute between the walczyk family and barberino realty and development corporation barberino.the land adjacent to the farmington homes of thomas walczyk at tunxis street and of his parents,elizabeth and lucien walczyk at tunxis acquired by barberino in.over the next two decades,barberino encountered various difficulties developing the land,only some of which are relevant to this appeal.
walczyk brandishes a rifle at barberino workers 
sometime in,a barberino work crew entered onto the undeveloped land to drill for soil samples preliminary to development.thomas walczyk,who was licensed to possess numerous firearms,brandished a rifle at the workmen and challenged their actions.the workmen sought police assistance,after which their work proceeded apparently without interruption and without any official action being taken against walczyk.
the incident nevertheless prompted barberino counsel to seek assurances from elizabeth and lucien walczyk that there would be no further attempts to hinder development of the land.in response,an attorney for the elder walczyks advised that his clients were claiming title to the undeveloped land by adverse possession.the claim was based on the walczyks long use of a portion of the undeveloped land for vegetable gardening and cattle grazing.
walczyk again brandishes a gun at a barberino worker 
despite these events,the relationship between the walczyks and barberino appears to have remained uneventful until january when,in response to a barberino demand that the walczyks remove certain items from the property,the elder walczyks reiterated their adverse possession claim.
a few months later,in march,a barberino worker equipped with a bulldozer attempted forcibly to remove various items from the disputed property.once again,thomas walczyk confronted the worker with a licensed firearm,specifically,an automatic assault rifle loaded with thirty rounds of ammunition,and ordered him off the property.police responded to the scene and directed walczyk to drop his weapon.walczyk initially ignored several such directives,yell ing about trespassing and some statute.police,at.when walczyk finally put down the rifle,a wrestling match ensued as he tried to prevent the police from taking him into custody.id.at.charged with threatening,reckless endangerment,and interfering with police,walczyk eventually pleaded guilty to the lesser infraction of creating a public disturbance.
the walczyks lawsuits claiming adverse possession 
the following month,in april,elizabeth and lucien walczyk sued for adverse possession of the undeveloped property.the action settled in with barberino paying the elder walczyks and granting them a perpetual agricultural easement over a portion of the disputed land.in return,elizabeth and lucien walczyk signed a quitclaim of any right,title,or interest in the property and promised not to oppose barberino development plans before the town planning and zoning commission.
four years later,in january,thomas walczyk sued barberino,as well as his parents,claiming that he held title to the disputed property through adverse possession.on march,the connecticut superior court rejected walczyk claim as a matter of law in granting judgment to barberino and quieting title in its favor,the connecticut court stated thomas joseph walczyk has no estate,interest in or encumbrance of said real property or any part thereof.walczyk barberino realty dev,no,wl,at.lexis,at.this judgment was affirmed on direct appeal,see walczyk barberino realty dev,and the connecticut supreme court declined further review,see walczyk barberino realty dev.
events relating to the challenged arrest and searches 
walczyk april threat to take matters into my own hands 
despite the state courts unequivocal rejection of his adverse possession claim,walczyk persisted in asserting a superior interest in the disputed land.on april,he visited the farmington police department to complain about barberino development efforts,insisting to defendant captain james rio that he walczyk had a common law right to the land because he had been farming and maintaining it for some time.arrest warrant aff.at.when rio explained that the police had received notice of the court order to the contrary,walczyk stated that he expected to secure reversal of that judgment based on witness perjury and judicial misconduct.more significantly for purposes of the issues raised on this appeal,walczyk told rio that,i f you guys do comply with what i telling you i take matters into my own hands.id.rio warned walczyk not to do anything illegal,but walczyk stated that he would do what he had to do to protect his property.id.alteration in original.
walczyk august reference to a potential bloodbath 
some five months later,on august,walczyk called the farmington police to complain again that barberino personnel were trespassing on the disputed property.responding to the scene,officer david hebert explained to walczyk that the police could not act on his trespass complaint without some documentary support for his property claim.in his report of the encounter,hebert noted that walczyk made some off color com m ents that the police were not taking the action needed to avoid a blood bath.police,at 
at walczyk subsequent criminal trial,hebert explained that,although he considered this remark offensive,he did not immediately place walczyk under arrest because the officer did not feel any direct threat to himself.nevertheless,he did understand walczyk comment as a threat toward the barberino corporation and who m ever they were going to have down there working.trial tr.vol.indeed,hebert informed barberino of the bloodbath statement,prompting its counsel to contact captain rio to request police protection at the disputed property site during any work periods.
the challenged arrest and search warrants 
soon thereafter,rio reviewed hebert report of his august,encounter with walczyk.rio was,of course,aware of walczyk earlier statement that,if police did not assist him in his land dispute,he would take matters into his own hands and do what he had to do to protect his rights.moreover,rio knew that walczyk was the licensed owner of a variety of firearms and that,over the years,he had responded to various situations by displaying,discharging,or threatening to discharge a firearm.in addition to the and incidents,detailed supra at,during which walczyk had brandished firearms specifically at barberino workers,these situations included a incident during which walczyk,armed with a loaded rifle,confronted an angry motorist who had followed him home a complaint by neighbors that walczyk shot a cat in his backyard and a argument during which walczyk threatened to shoot his brother john for using the undeveloped land for driving practice 
viewing the bloodbath comment in this larger context,rio concluded that the events of august,demonstrated probable cause to arrest walczyk for the connecticut class a misdemeanor of threatening,see.a and to search walczyk home and that of his parents for firearms that could be used as instrumentalities of the bloodbath threat.rio did not speak with officer hebert before making this determination,but he did consult with a state attorney,who concurred in the captain probable cause assessment.
rio then communicated the relevant circumstances to defendant sergeant william tyler and directed him to prepare the paperwork necessary to procure an arrest warrant for walczyk.after tyler completed and signed the arrest warrant,he and rio used the same information to prepare search warrant applications for the homes of thomas walczyk and his parents.these papers were then given to defendants corporal angela deschenes and officer shawn brown,who acted as affiants for the search warrant applications.on september,a magistrate authorized the arrest and search warrants 
facts supporting the warrants 
because plaintiffs claim,inter alia,that the warrant affidavits,on their face,fail to establish probable cause to support the challenged arrest and searches,we here reproduce the facts as detailed in the affidavits 
on,officer hebert of the farmington police department responded to a trespassing complaint made by thomas walczyk,tunxis street,farmington.walczyk complained of trespassing by employees of the barberino realty development corporation on property located on tunxis street.walczyk has had a long standing dispute over that property and has made claims in the past that he has common law rights to the land.walczyk told officer hebert that the farmington police were not taking the action needed to avoid a bloodbath.
officer hebert reported walczyk complaint to stephen barberino,the owner of the land in question.as a result of walczyk threat of a bloodbath,atty robert reeve,representing barberino,contacted james rio of the farmington police department.reeve expressed concerns for the safety of employees during imminent construction work planned for the tunxis street property.he requested extra police presence during work periods.
in the early spring of,the farmington police department received a letter from barberino attorney along with a copy of a march,decision made by the state of connecticut superior court regarding the issue of the land in question.the decision by judge christine keller was in favor of barberino realty development,and stated that thomas joseph walczyk has no estate,interest in or encumbrance of said real property or any part thereof.
during late winter of and early spring of walczyk came to the farmington police department to speak with rio about the land dispute and the impending land development.he told rio at that time that he had a common law right to the land because he had been farming and maintaining it for some time.walczyk said that he was in the process of getting a superior court ruling to reverse the one made in barberino favor.he claimed that stephen barberino had perjured himself and the presiding judge had acted inappropriately.rio explained that the farmington police had been advised of the ruling in favor of barberino and that until we were officially notified otherwise,all parties and the police department would have to abide by the last court ruling.walczyk responded that,if you guys do comply with what i telling you i take matters into my own hands.rio advised walczyk against any illegal actions to which walczyk responded that he would,do what he had to do to protect his property.
the farmington police department has investigated walczyk on previous occasions for incidents involving threatening during which times he has either threatened the use of or displayed a gun.
on officer charette of the farmington police department investigated a disturbance on tunxis street involving walczyk and his brother.the argument was over property on tunxis street for which thomas walczyk was suing his parents.his brother claimed that walczyk pushed him and threatened to shoot him.his brother felt no imminent threat but was concerned because he knew walczyk owned numerous guns.walczyk denied making the threat and no arrest was made.
on walczyk was arrested in farmington for cruelty to animals and unlawful discharge of a firearm.neighbors reported seeing him shoot a cat on his property with a handgun.
on neighbors complained that walczyk was shooting guns on property at the end of tunxis street.he was shooting but was not in violation.
on walczyk was arrested by the farmington police for threatening.a motorist followed walczyk home to complain about the way he was driving.walczyk went inside and came back with a assault rifle and an argument ensued.the assault rifle was taken as evidence.it was loaded with twenty rounds of ammunition.
on the farmington police department responded to a disturbance at tunxis street.the disturbance was over the same land dispute between walczyk and barberino employees.barberino employees were working on the land.walczyk approached them carrying an ar assault rifle ordering them to get off his property.one of the employee s complained that walczyk had pointed the gun directly at him.walczyk was arrested for threatening,reckless endangerment,and interfering with police.he denied actually pointing the gun at anyone.the gun was seized as evidence.it contained one round in the chamber and rounds in the magazine.walczyk fought with officers prior to being arrested.
as of,walczyk,according to connecticut state police records,has the following handguns registered in his name.
colt model,caliber,ser.
colt govt.model,caliber,ser.
smith wesson model,caliber,ser.
walthers woodsman model,caliber,ser.
he also has the following assault weapons registered in his name.
ruger sr,ser.
that a review of farmington police records indicate s that walczyk has maintained residences at both and tunxis,farmington.that town of farmington property records show that tunxis street is owned by lucian walzak sic,and tunxis street is owned by thomas walzak sic.
search warrant aff.and app.at 
execution of the warrants 
the challenged warrants were executed on september.on that date,defendant sergeant james jepsen contacted thomas walczyk and,on the pretense of wishing to discuss the land dispute,proposed a meeting at the police station.upon walczyk arrival,sergeant tyler placed him under arrest and detained him in a cell block on bail walczyk remained in custody until later that day,when his mother posted bail.
while walczyk was in custody,a team of officers,including sergeant jepsen and defendant detective brian killiany executed the challenged search warrants,seizing nearly licensed firearms from thomas walczyk home and licensed firearms from his parents home,as well as approximately rounds of ammunition,gun clips,ammunition belts,and other items related to firearms use.
connecticut invalidation of the challenged warrants 
after a connecticut jury found walczyk guilt of disorderly conduct,see.a reckless endangerment,see id.a and two counts of improper firearm storage,see id.he was sentenced to pay a fine of for each count of conviction.
the appellate court of connecticut reversed walczyk conviction,holding that the search warrant that resulted in seizure of the charged guns was not supported by probable cause.see state walczyk.at,at in reaching this conclusion,the court faulted the warrant supporting affidavit for failing to reconcile a construction of the bloodbath statement as a threat with the statement of what the defendant actually had said.id.at,at.specifically,the court held that a statement to a police officer that the police needed to act to avoid a bloodbath can not be the basis of probable cause to believe that the defendant,at that time or in the immediate future,would engage in threatening behavior.id.at,at emphasis in original.the connecticut court also noted that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause because it did not state that any of walczyk earlier misconduct had resulted in his conviction of threatening or of any other crime,distinguish between recent incidents and those that ha d become stale,or state that his firearm possession was in any way unlawful.id.at,at emphasis in original.nor did the court think that walczyk prior statement to captain he would take matters into his own hands and do what he had to do to protect his property established probable cause because rio advised walczyk not to do so,and,on august,walczyk followed instructions to report any possible trespass to the police.id.at,at emphasis in original.
d.the district court action 
on august,plaintiffs commenced this action,charging defendants with violating their federal and state constitutional rights to have arrests and searches supported by probable cause,depriving them of their federal rights to equal protection of the laws and to free expression,violating their federal and state constitutional rights to bear arms,and holding walczyk on excessive bail.defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted with respect to all claims except those challenging thomas walczyk arrest,the searches of his and his parents homes,and walczyk first amendment claim,which apparently had been previously abandoned.
we need not here discuss the district court rulings with respect to the plaintiffs equal protection or right to bear arms claims because neither is challenged on this appeal.as for walczyk excessive bail claim,the district court ruled as a matter of law that when a police officer sets temporary bail under,he performs a judicial function and hence has absolute immunity from suit.walczyk rio,d at.
with respect to plaintiffs unlawful arrest and search challenges,the district court concluded that,although the supporting warrants were facially valid,defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity because questions of fact existed as to whether they had knowingly and deliberately,or with reckless disregard of the truth,made material misstatements or omissions in the warrant affidavit s that were necessary to the finding of probable cause.id.at see franks delaware,d.the court identified three such material omissions the affidavits failure to disclose that the defendants had not spoken with officer hebert about his conversation with walczyk,none of walczyk previous arrests had resulted in a conviction for threatening,and walczyk had not lived at tunxis street for seven years.walczyk rio,d at.the court concluded that a reasonable juror could find that the omission of the first two items of information was critical to the finding of probable cause for the arrest,and that the omission of all three items was critical to the finding of probable cause for the searches of the houses and the seizures of the firearms.id.thus,it ruled that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity under either federal or state law assuming arguendo that connecticut would afford immunity to state constitutional claims because,when the record was viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,a jury could find that the defendants lacked even arguable probable cause to believe that walczyk had committed the crime of threatening or that the firearms to be seized were connected with criminal activity.id.at noting that ruling was consistent with connecticut appellate court determination that affidavits fell well short of establishing probable cause nevertheless,the district court denied elizabeth walczyk for summary judgment on the liability phase of her search warrant challenge,concluding that she had not shown that no reasonable juror could find defendants acts lawful.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and the standard of review 
because the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final judgment,it is generally not immediately appealable.see,jones parmley,cir.an exception obtains,however,when the denied motion was based on a claim of immunity,at least to the extent the immunity claim presents a purely legal question.mitchell forsyth,d recognizing jurisdiction to review purely legal question on which claim of immunity turns see ex rel.estate of vargo,cir observing that u nder the collateral order doctrine the denial of a motion for summary judgment is immediately appealable to the extent that the district court has denied the motion as a matter of law,although not to the extent that the defense turns solely on the resolution of questions of fact accord jones parmley,at.the rationale for this exception is the law recognition that immunity shields a defendant from suit itself,not merely from liability.see saucier katz,d the privilege is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.quoting mitchell forsyth,at.emphasis in original.in this case,defendants appeal from the district court denial of qualified immunity on plaintiffs search and arrest claims can be decided as a matter of law accordingly,our jurisdiction is established.
although an interlocutory appeal would not be available from either the denial of elizabeth walczyk motion for summary judgment on her unlawful search claim or the district court dismissal of walczyk excessive bail claim on the ground of absolute immunity,we elect to exercise pendent jurisdiction over both.w e may exercise pendent jurisdiction over issues that are not ordinarily subject to interlocutory review only when they are inextricably intertwined with the determination of qualified immunity or their resolution is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court ruling on qualified immunity.jones parmley,at quoting swint chambers county comm n,d.as we explain further below,see infra at,elizabeth walczyk claim is inextricably intertwined with the determination of defendants entitlement to qualified immunity in that the same disputed factual issues that preclude a finding of qualified immunity on this claim at this stage also make summary judgment inappropriate.as to walczyk excessive bail claim,if we were to determine that the district court improperly granted defendants absolute immunity,they might nonetheless be entitled to qualified immunity,and thus review of this determination is also inextricably intertwined with our resolution of defendants entitlement to qualified immunity.clynch chapman,d,characterizing absolute immunity in excessive bail claim as a cousin issue to qualified immunity.
we review de novo defendants legal challenge to the district court qualified immunity ruling,see jones parmley,at,as well as elizabeth and thomas walczyks from other summary judgment rulings,see,root liston,cir.
plaintiffs search and arrest claims 
the qualified immunity standard 
when a defendant officer charged with violations of federal constitutional rights invokes qualified immunity to support a motion for summary judgment,a court must first consider a threshold question do the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right if the answer to this question is no,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.saucier katz,at.see,pataki,cir observing that resolution of this first question favorable to defendant moots further inquiry into qualified immunity.the reason for this rule is that,where there is no viable constitutional claim,defendants have no need of an immunity shield.see generally farrell burke,cir because we have found no cognizable violation of p laintiff rights in this case,we need not reach the question of qualified immunity.holcomb lykens,cir declining to decide qualified immunity question and affirming summary judgment on ground that,as a matter of law,defendants did not violate plaintiff due process rights.
only if the answer to the first question is yes must a court proceed to the inquiry for qualified immunity was the right at issue clearly established at the time of the defendant actions as the supreme court has explained,this question is not answered by reference to how courts or lawyers might have understood the state of the law the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,at.emphasis added.if the right at issue was not clearly established by then existing precedent,then qualified immunity shields the defendant.even if the right at issue was clearly established in certain respects,however,an officer is still entitled to qualified immunity if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of the action at issue in its particular factual context.malley briggs,d accord iqbal hasty,cir.cerrone brown,cir lennon miller,cir see saucier katz,at.holding officer entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable officer in his position could have believed that the challenged conduct was within the bounds of appropriate police responses.in this respect,the supreme court has observed that qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,at.quoted approvingly in saucier katz,at.
the legality of the challenged arrest and searches 
applying these principles to this case,we consider first whether defendants actions violated plaintiffs rights under both the united states and connecticut constitutions to be free from unreasonable searches and arrests.see const.amend.iv.const.art.first,ordinarily,an arrest or search pursuant to a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate is presumed reasonable because such warrants may issue only upon a showing of probable cause.see franks delaware,at.united states awadallah,cir golino city of new haven,cir see also united states leon,d.plaintiffs nevertheless insist that the presumption is defeated in this case because the warrant affidavits,on their face,fail to demonstrate probable cause,see generally united states leon,at.and the issuing magistrate was,in any event,misled into finding probable cause by material omissions for which defendants were knowingly or recklessly responsible,see franks delaware,at.golino city of new haven,at.
a.the probable cause standard 
before discussing these two contentions,we observe that federal and connecticut law are identical in holding that probable cause to arrest exists when police officers have knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a crime.weyant okst,cir see state james,probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonable trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that a crime has been committed.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,under both federal and state law,probable cause to search is demonstrated where the totality of circumstances indicates a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.illinois gates,d accord united states gaskin,cir state vincent,noting that valid search requires probable cause to believe that the particular items to be seized are connected with criminal activity or will assist in a particular apprehension or conviction and that the items sought to be seized will be found in the place to be searched state orellana,citing illinois gates,at.accordingly,we need not separately discuss federal and state law in assessing probable cause for the challenged arrest and searches.
as the supreme court has famously observed,probable cause is a fluid concept not readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.illinois gates,at.see united states gaskin,at.while probable cause requires more than a mere suspicion,of wrongdoing,mallory united states,d,its focus is on probabilities,not hard certainties,illinois gates,at.in assessing probabilities,a judicial officer must look to the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,not legal technicians,act.id.quoting brinegar united states.accord united states gaskin,at.finely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence,useful in formal trials,have no place in a probable cause determination.illinois gates,at.nor can probable cause be analogized to a prima facie case.see id.observing that only the probability,and not a prima facie showing,of criminal activity is necessary to establish probable cause to search or arrest quoting spinelli united states,d.in sum,probable cause does not demand any showing that a belief be correct or more likely true than false.texas brown,d.it requires only such facts as make wrongdoing or the discovery of evidence thereof probable.
it has long been recognized that,where there is no dispute as to what facts were relied on to demonstrate probable cause,the existence of probable cause is a question of law for the court.see stewart sonneborn.observing that whether facts alleged to show probable cause are true is a matter of fact,but whether,supposing them to be true,they amount to a probable cause,is a question of law internal quotation marks omitted accord director of railroads kastenbaum.observing that where facts are in dispute,court submits the question of probable cause to the jury,but with instructions as to what facts will amount to probable cause if proved sanders palmer,cir holding that question whether facts,supposing them to be true,amount to a probable cause,is a question of law when the facts are disputed,it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury what facts,if established,will constitute a probable cause and to submit to them only the question as to the existence of those facts see also united states awadallah,at distinguishing between de novo review of legal question whether undisputed facts support probable cause and deferential review of factual question whether,in case of misstated or omitted material facts,affiant actions were deliberate or reckless.in this case,there can be no dispute as to what facts the defendants relied on to establish probable cause for the challenged arrest and searches they are memorialized in warrant affidavits.thus,whether the affidavits,on their face,demonstrate probable cause,is a question of law.in answering that question,however,a reviewing court must accord considerable deference to the probable cause determination of the issuing magistrate,see illinois gates,at.holding that duty of reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for probable cause determination internal quotation marks omitted accord velardi walsh,cir,mindful of the well established principle that a showing of probable cause can not be negated simply by demonstrating that an inference of innocence might also have been drawn from the facts alleged,see united states webb,cir see also united states,cir.
to the extent plaintiffs argue,in addition to their facial challenge,that material omissions infected the issuing magistrate probable cause determination,there is no dispute between the parties as to what purported omissions are appropriately considered.they are the three identified by the district court,that defendants had not spoken with officer hebert about his understanding of walczyk bloodbath statement none of walczyk prior arrests had resulted in a conviction for threatening,and walczyk had not lived at his parents home for seven years.see walczyk rio,d at.the materiality of these omissions presents a mixed question of law and fact.see velardi walsh,at.whether omitted information is relevant to the probable cause determination is a question of law that we review de novo.id.if we identify relevancy,then questions of fact may arise as to what weight a neutral magistrate would likely have given such information,and whether defendants acted deliberately or recklessly in omitting the information from the warrant affidavits,united states awadallah,at internal quotation marks omitted.even in such circumstances,however,a court may grant summary judgment based on qualified immunity where the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,discloses no genuine dispute that a magistrate would have issued the warrant on the basis of the corrected affidavits.velardi walsh,at emphasis in original.
mindful of these principles,we proceed to consider plaintiffs warrant challenges,focusing first on the arrest of thomas walczyk and the search of his tunxis street residence and then on the search of elizabeth walczyk tunxis street home.
thomas walczyk 
the facial challenge 
we reject as without merit thomas walczyk contention that the challenged warrant affidavits,on their face,fail to state probable cause for his arrest or the search of his tunxis street home.the facts alleged establish probable cause to believe that walczyk had violated connecticut law by threaten ing to commit a crime of violence in reckless disregard of the risk of causing terror to another person.a,and that walczyk maintained in his residence firearms that,in light of past use,were relevant evidence that he intended to threaten violence and recklessly disregarded the threat terrorizing effect.
the facts reveal that,on august,walczyk complained to officer hebert that the police were not taking the action necessary to avoid a bloodbath.a reasonable person would understand the bloodbath reference as a prediction of probable violence between walczyk and barberino.more to the point,a reasonable person would understand from other facts alleged in the affidavits that walczyk would likely be the person initiating any such violence.a few months earlier,walczyk had stated to captain rio that,if the police did not assist him in his property dispute with barberino,he would take matters into his own hands,doing whatever he had to do to protect his property rights.rio knew that what walczyk frequently put into his hands to resolve disputes were loaded firearms that he stored in his home.in the past,walczyk had brandished firearms retrieved from his home at various individuals,including barberino workers on two occasions.on one of those occasions,the brandished weapon was a loaded automatic rifle and when police intervened,walczyk initially defied their orders to put down the weapon and resisted arrest.moreover,the affidavits demonstrated that walczyk plainly knew how to fire his weapons he had used them to kill a cat on his property.rio further knew that walczyk efforts to vindicate his property rights peaceably through the courts had failed.under the totality of these circumstances,the issuing magistrate certainly had a substantial basis to conclude that,when walczyk told police that their continued failure to assist him in his property dispute with barberino would result in a bloodbath,he was effectively threatening to employ violence against barberino employees with reckless disregard for the terror such a threat would cause when communicated to the intended victim.
we are,of course,mindful that a connecticut appellate court has ruled otherwise.observing that walczyk bloodbath statement was made to secure police assistance,that court concluded a statement to a police officer that the police needed to act to avoid a bloodbath can not be the basis of probable cause to believe that the defendant,at the time or in the immediate future,would engage in threatening behavior.state walczyk.at,at emphasis in original.we respectfully disagree.walczyk may have desired police assistance in his land dispute,but how he sought to compel that assistance was by threatening violence.walczyk was,after all,the only person to have used an instrument of violence in connection with the land dispute.given his prior brandishing of loaded firearms,it was certainly probable that walczyk bloodbath statement was a threat to use violence against barberino workers if the police did not intervene in his favor something they could not do in light of state court rulings.whether walczyk would,in fact,have acted on his threat is not determinative of whether it was probable that he had made the threat with reckless disregard of the terror it would cause barberino we conclude that the affidavits,on their face,state facts reasonably supporting such a finding by the issuing magistrate.
walczyk submits that the search warrant affidavit nevertheless failed to demonstrate that there was any connection between his present lawful possession of firearms and the alleged crime of threatening.we are persuaded that the warrant affidavit states probable cause to believe that a search of walczyk home for firearms would produce evidence relevant to demonstrating that walczyk had committed the offense of threatening.at the time the search warrant affidavit was prepared,walczyk apparent possession of firearms constituted relevant evidence which could suggest that his intent in making the bloodbath remark was,in fact,to threaten violence.see state crudup,discussing intent element of threatening.specifically,a seizure of firearms from walczyk home could have shown that,at the time walczyk made the bloodbath remark,he had the actual capacity to cause bloodshed.moreover,such a seizure following the authorized search could have served to corroborate witness accounts that walczyk had used weapons against barberino workers and others in the past,which in turn could have helped establish his reckless disregard of the bloodbath remark terrorizing effect.in sum,walczyk possession of firearms was evidence relevant to the mens rea element of the crime because a factfinder could reasonably infer from such possession and from walczyk past use of firearms that his bloodbath statement was not idle hyperbole,but an intentional threat of violence made with reckless disregard of its potential to cause terror.as the search warrant affidavit makes clear,the police were aware that walczyk had previously used his home to store the firearms he brandished in confrontations with others,including barberino workers,and thus they had probable cause to believe that evidence relevant to his alleged threatening would turn up in a search of his home.
accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs facial challenge to the warrant affidavits in this case necessarily fails as a matter of law 
purported omissions 
walczyk asserts that two of the three identified material omissions misled the issuing magistrate into erroneously finding probable cause to support his arrest and the search of his home.
a failure to speak with officer hebert 
first,the district court pointed to defendants failure to disclose that no officer had spoken directly with officer hebert,who would have revealed that he did not himself feel threatened by walczyk bloodbath statement.the conclusion is unconvincing both as a matter of law and fact.
preliminarily,we observe that the law permitting one law enforcement officer to rely on the report of another in applying for a warrant nowhere requires direct consultation to ensure that the officer reviewing the report ascribes no more weight to the described facts than the reporter intended.see generally panetta crowley,cir martinez simonetti,cir velardi walsh,at.indeed,we have specifically ruled that a police officer is not required to explore and eliminate every theoretically plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest.martinez simonetti,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we reject the suggestion that a law enforcement officer is guilty of a material omission when,in applying for a warrant,he fails to disclose that he has not spoken directly with a fellow officer on whose report he relies to establish probable cause.
even if we were to assume,however,that the applicant officer failure to ascertain that the reporting officer did not consider words he heard to be threatening was relevant to a determination of probable cause,that is not this case.officer hebert did understand walczyk bloodbath statement as a threat.at walczyk criminal trial,hebert testified that he did not understand walczyk to be threatening him,but he most certainly did understand walczyk to be threatening any barberino employees who came onto the disputed property.as we have already noted,this understanding finds ample support in the totality of facts recounted in the warrant affidavits.in sum,because hebert subjective view of walczyk statement,if it had been solicited by defendants and reported to the issuing magistrate,would actually have reinforced rather than undermined probable cause,we conclude that a corrected warrant affidavit would raise no genuine dispute as to the magistrate issuance of warrants for the arrest of walczyk or the search of his home.
b the lack of a prior conviction for threatening 
a second purported omission is the defendants failure to disclose that none of walczyk prior conduct had resulted in a conviction for threatening.this omission is hardly relevant.certainly,nothing in the challenged affidavits wrongly insinuates that walczyk had such a conviction.absent such conduct,we expect that when a magistrate,mindful of the government burden to demonstrate probable cause,reviews a warrant application that does not report a prior conviction for a particular crime,the magistrate assumes for purposes of determining whether the government has carried its burden that no such conviction exists.see generally minnesota dickerson,d noting that probable cause requirement ensures against government action based on speculation.moreover,as this court observed in brown,the law does not demand that an officer applying for a warrant volunteer every fact that arguably cuts against the existence of probable cause,as long as he does not omit circumstances that are critical to its evaluation,cir.it was the particulars of walczyk past conduct in using or threatening to use firearms to resolve disputes that was critical to the determination of the probability that his bloodbath statement constituted a threat of violence.this probability is in no way undermined by the lack of a prior conviction for threatening.
because we identify no merit in thomas walczyk facial challenge to the warrant affidavits authorizing his arrest and the search of his home,and because we determine as a matter of law that no alleged omissions were material to the issuance of these warrants,we conclude that he as well as his wife and daughter fails to demonstrate a viable unlawful search or arrest claim under federal or state law.accordingly,we reverse the district court order denying defendants summary judgment with respect to these plaintiffs unlawful search and arrest claims,and we remand with directions to enter such a judgment.
elizabeth walczyk 
the lack of probable cause 
according to defendants,the theory for searching elizabeth walczyk residence was that it probably contained firearms accessible to her son,constituting some further evidence that his bloodbath statement was a threat of violence.to the extent elizabeth walczyk joins in her son facial challenge to the warrant affidavits and to his charged material omissions regarding officer hebert and walczyk criminal record,we have already explained why we reject these arguments.the district court,however,identified another omission that raises greater concern with respect to the search of elizabeth walczyk home.
the warrant affidavit reported that thomas walczyk was licensed to possess various firearms and that he maintained two neighboring residences where such firearms would likely be found a review of farmington police records indicate s that walczyk has maintained residences at both and tunxis,farmington,search warrant aff.and app.at.the implication was that walczyk had maintained the residences recently.what the affidavit omitted,however,was the apparently undisputed fact that walczyk had not resided at his mother tunxis street residence for more than seven years.
there can be no question that the omitted information was relevant to any assessment of probable cause.in evaluating probable cause,a magistrate is always required to consider whether the facts adduced in the warrant application appear to be current,true at the time of the application,or whether they have become stale.rivera united states,cir.the law sensibly draws no rule for staleness.rather,a magistrate is expected to consider the age of the facts in light of the conduct at issue with a view toward ensuring that probable cause exists at the time the warrant is to be executed,not simply at some past time.see see also united states martino,cir observing that,in circumstances of continuing or ongoing conduct,as contrasted with isolated illegal acts,the passage of time between the last described act and the presentation of the application becomes less significant.thus,where information is seven years old,a magistrate must be alerted to that fact to make a reasonable probable cause determination.
as we have already observed,the question of what weight a magistrate would have given omitted relevant evidence is generally a question for the finder of fact.see velardi walsh,at.in this case,however,we can conclude as a matter of law that nondisclosure of the staleness of the dual residency allegation was fatal to a demonstration of probable cause.not only was the allegation seriously outdated,it was the sole support for a search of elizabeth walczyk home.a comparison best makes this point.with respect to tunxis street,the issuing magistrate could have inferred that walczyk maintained guns at that address because he was licensed to possess such weapons and,on at least one occasion,he was actually seen retrieving a loaded assault rifle from that premises to brandish at a person with whom he had a dispute.further,neighbors had reported seeing him fire a handgun on that property.by contrast,no facts were alleged indicating that walczyk had ever stored or retrieved firearms from his parents home,much less that he had done so in the seven years since last residing there.defendants urged that inference simply from walczyk license to possess firearms and his purported residence at as well as tunxis street.whatever questions might be raised about the strength of such an inference in any circumstance,it could not be drawn from a dual residency allegation that was seven years old.
defendants submit that the search of walczyk tunxis street residence would have been meaningless if he were free to cross the street to his parents home,where he formerly lived for many years,and have free access to other weaponry.appellant br.at.this argument overlooks the fact that the warrant affidavit fails to allege any from walczyk dual that anyone ever stored guns at tunxis street.the affidavit makes no mention of the fact that lucien or elizabeth walczyk was licensed to possess guns.as we have recently reiterated,probable cause to search must be based on particularized information about the place to be searched,not simply on a target mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity.united states martin,cir quoting ybarra illinois,d.once the dual residency allegation is corrected,we can conclude as a matter of law that the affidavit is devoid of any particularized information establishing probable cause to search elizabeth walczyk home.
defendants claim of qualified immunity elizabeth walczyk motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability 
despite our ruling that the search of elizabeth walczyk home was not supported by probable cause,defendants might still be entitled to claim qualified immunity from liability for damages if the search was supported by arguable probable cause.escalera lunn,cir holding that,even in the absence of probable cause,officer will still be entitled to qualified immunity from a suit for damages if he can establish that there was arguable probable cause.arguable probable cause exists if either a it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed,or b officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.id.quoting golino city of new haven,at see also caldarola calabrese,cir.like the district court,we conclude that questions of disputed fact preclude a judicial resolution of this issue in favor of either side.
while no competent officer who knew that thomas walczyk had not resided in his parents home for more than seven years could reasonably think that the stale allegation of dual residency established probable cause to search that premises for firearms,it can not be determined from the present record which officers,if any,even should have knowledge.further record development and factfinding are necessary to determine,among other things,which of the defendants,if any,actually reviewed the police records that purportedly established walczyk residence at both and tunxis street whether these records would have alerted a reasonable officer to the staleness of the dual residency allegation which defendants,if any,possessed independent knowledge that the dual residency statement was not accurate the circumstances under which the dual residency allegation was communicated along the chain of defendants and whether any defendant reliance on such communication without further inquiry was reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances because a resolution of some of these matters in favor of elizabeth walczyk could preclude one or more defendants from claiming that they acted with arguable probable cause in searching her home,the district court correctly concluded that defendants did not yet establish their entitlement to qualified immunity.on the other hand,because a resolution favorable to one or more defendants could afford them the benefit of a qualified immunity shield,the district court also correctly denied summary judgment on liability to elizabeth walczyk.accordingly,we affirm both these rulings.
walczyk excessive bail claim 
connecticut law allows state police to set temporary bail in certain cases.see.c a the district court dismissed walczyk excessive bail claim as a matter of law,holding that when a police officer sets temporary bail pursuant to this statute,he performs a judicial function and hence has absolute immunity from suit.walczyk rio,d at.other district courts in connecticut have similarly ruled.see sanchez doyle,d,accord machuca canning,wl,at,minney kradas,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,bacciocchi chapman,dist.lexis,at,clynch chapman,d at.citing sanchez and clynch by analogy,this court recently concluded that absolute judicial immunity shielded a prosecutor who ordered a defendant bond increased pursuant to.because the prosecutor was performing a judicial function.see root liston,at observing that courts apply functional approach to immunity questions.following root,we now hold what the citations to sanchez and clynch implied police officers setting bail under.a are engaged in a judicial function that affords them absolute immunity.
it is well established that officials acting in a judicial capacity are entitled to absolute immunity against actions,and this immunity acts as a complete shield to claims for money damages.montero travis,cir extending absolute immunity to parole board officials performing a function in making parole decisions see also butz economou,d granting absolute immunity to administrative hearing examiners performing adjudicatory functions within federal agencies.as the supreme court has explained,it is the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it,that inform s our immunity analysis.forrester white,d holding that judges do not enjoy absolute immunity when performing administrative,legislative,or executive functions.following this functional approach to immunity questions,this court in root liston observed that o rdinarily,it is judges who set bail,and judges enjoy absolute immunity when they do so.at internal citations omitted.in short,because the setting of bail is a judicial function,see cleavinger saxner,d,absolute immunity extends to police officers when they perform that function pursuant to statute.
accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of walczyk excessive bail claim.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize 
the unlawful search and arrest challenges of thomas,maximina,and michelle walczyk are without merit as a matter of law because the warrants for walczyk arrest and for the search of these plaintiffs home were supported by probable cause.defendants are entitled to have summary judgment entered in their favor on these claims.
the warrant authorizing the search of elizabeth walczyk home was plainly not supported by probable cause nevertheless,the district court correctly denied summary judgment to both elizabeth walczyk and defendants because disputed questions of fact must be resolved before it can be determined whether defendants actions are shielded by qualified immunity or whether plaintiff is entitled to have a liability judgment entered in her favor.
summary judgment was correctly entered in favor of defendants on thomas walczyk claim of excessive bail because police officers,when setting bail pursuant to.a,perform a judicial function,which affords them absolute immunity from suit for money damages.
that part of the district court order denying defendants summary judgment motion with respect to the unlawful search and arrest claims of plaintiffs thomas,maximina,and michelle walczyk is hereby reversed and the case is remanded for entry of such a judgment.in all other respects the appealed summary judgment rulings of the district court are affirmed.
i agree fully with the outcome of this case,and i concur with most of the majority reasoning however,i disagree with its description of the qualified immunity standard we should apply and its related discussion of arguable probable cause.a long line of decisions of this court features the same doctrinal misstatements,and it is time we stopped repeating uncritically this particular language and gave it the attention it deserves i join all of the majority opinion except part ii b and i write separately to call the court attention to our collective failure to harmonize our qualified immunity analysis with the supreme court directives.
the portion of the majority qualified immunity discussion that i find objectionable reads as follows if the right at issue was not clearly established by then existing precedent,then qualified immunity shields the defendant.even if the right at issue was clearly established in certain respects,however,an officer is still entitled to qualified immunity if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of the action at issue in its particular factual context.op.at quoting malley briggs,d.these two sentences and the citation to malley reveal the two flaws i see in this circuit approach to qualified immunity.first,our approach splits the single question of whether a right is clearly established into two distinct steps,contrary to supreme court precedent.second,we demand a consensus among all hypothetical reasonable officers that the challenged conduct was unconstitutional,rather than positing an objective standard of reasonableness to which defendant officers should be held,as the supreme court has repeatedly instructed us to do.i address both of these points in turn.
the supreme court has made clear that t he relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his or her conduct was unlawful in the situation he or she confronted.saucier katz,d.that is,whether a right is clearly established is the same question as whether a reasonable officer would have known that the conduct in question was unlawful.this court case law,in contrast,bifurcates the clearly established inquiry into two steps.see,cerrone brown,cir a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity from liability for his or her discretionary actions if either his or her conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,or it was objectively reasonable for him or her to believe that his or her actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.by splitting the relevant,dispositive inquiry in two,we erect an additional hurdle to civil rights claims against public officials that has no basis in supreme court precedent.
whether a reasonable officer would know his or her conduct to be unlawful requires an inquiry into the state of the law at the time of the conduct and in light of the specific context of the case.saucier,at.if the right at issue has not previously been articulated,or had been addressed only in a factual context that is distinguishable in a fair way,id.at,a reasonable officer might not have known that the challenged conduct was unlawful see also id.t he right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he or she is doing violates that right.quoting anderson creighton,d.contrary to what our case law might suggest,the supreme court does not follow this clearly established inquiry with a second,ad hoc inquiry into the reasonableness of the officer conduct.once we determine whether the right at issue was clearly established for the particular context that the officer faced,the qualified immunity inquiry is complete.
wilson layne,d,illustrates the inquiry that the supreme court contemplates for qualified immunity.the wilsons brought suit against law enforcement officers who permitted members of the media to accompany them in an early morning raid of the wilsons home.id.at.having concluded that the officers actions violated the fourth amendment,the court considered whether the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.the court explained that what clearly established means in this context depends largely upon the level of generality at which the relevant legal rule is to be identified.id.at.quoting anderson,at.that is,to be clearly established,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he or she is doing violates that right.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not obvious from the general principles of the fourth amendment,id.at,or judicial decisions that the presence of the media was unlawful,and g iven the undeveloped state of the law,the officers can not have been expected to predict the future course of constitutional law,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
wilson confirms that whether an officer conduct was objectively reasonable is part and parcel of the inquiry into whether the law was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct and for the particular context in which it occurred.to ask whether an officer violation of an individual right was objectively reasonable after we have found that the right was clearly established in the particularized sense finds no warrant in wilson,saucier,or any other recent supreme court discussion of qualified immunity.see also brosseau haugen,d per curiam groh ramirez,d hope pelzer,d.
i suspect that our bifurcation of the clearly established analysis derives from the eminently reasonable principle that whether a right is clearly established is not answered by reference to how courts or lawyers might have understood the state of the law.op.at.we do not expect law enforcement officers to keep abreast of every development in the case law or to recognize every implication of legal precedent for police conduct that courts have not previously considered.see saucier,at.it is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.but our bifurcated approach makes too much of this principle by divorcing the reasonableness inquiry from the state of the law at the time of the conduct in question.the inquiry described by the supreme court already incorporates a recognition that police officers should not be expected to anticipate every application of legal principles because it requires that the right be clearly established with particularity for the conduct at issue.
in this case,the particularity requirement means that our clearly established inquiry is not complete upon reaching the indisputable conclusion that an individual has the right to be free from arrest,search,or seizure absent probable cause.see anderson,at.rather,we must determine whether it was clearly established that the situation the officer confronted did not give rise to probable cause.see id.at.holding that officials who reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present should not be held personally liable see also saucier,at.e ven if a court were to hold that the officer violated the fourth amendment by conducting an unreasonable,warrantless search,anderson still operates to grant officers immunity for reasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions.in other words,based on the law at the time the conduct occurred,would a reasonable officer have known that his or her actions were not supported by probable cause,and therefore were in violation of the fourth amendment 
the majority opinion takes this question wholly outside of the clearly established inquiry and asks whether the officers had arguable probable cause.see op.at.this court has used the term arguable probable cause to describe the standard for finding that a defendant officer is entitled to qualified immunity for his or her reasonable but mistaken determination that probable cause existed in a particular context.see caldarola calabrese,cir i n the context of a qualified immunity defense to an allegation of false arrest,the defending officer need only show arguable probable cause.this is because at its heart,t he concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct.internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original cerrone,at we have also stated that arguable probable cause falls under the objective reasonableness determination of our qualified immunity test.see jenkins city of new york,cir.yet therefore the existence of arguable probable cause are considerations that properly fall within the clearly established inquiry as the supreme court has described it.see anderson,at.brosseau,at.it is not surprising,then,that arguable probable cause finds no mention in any supreme court opinion the need for a separate term to describe this concept arises only once we have improperly splintered the clearly established inquiry.because i believe arguable probable cause is both imprecise and an outgrowth of the first flaw in our qualified immunity analysis,i do not agree with the majority use of the term.
i recognize that the distinction i am drawing is a fine one,but i believe it has real consequences.our approach does not simply divide into two steps what the supreme court treats singly,asking first,whether the right is clearly established as a general proposition,and second,whether the application of the general right to the facts of this case is something a reasonable officer could be expected to anticipate.instead,we permit courts to decide that official conduct was reasonable even after finding that it violated clearly established law in the particularized sense.by introducing reasonableness as a separate step,we give defendants a second bite at the immunity apple,thereby thwarting a careful balance that the supreme court has struck between the interests in vindication of citizens constitutional rights and in public officials effective performance of their duties.anderson,at.quoting davis scherer,d.
my second objection to the majority formulation of the qualified immunity standard is that it treats objective reasonableness as turning on whether officers of reasonable competence could disagree.op.at.this language,which our cases frequently recite,see,iqbal hasty,cir cerrone,at lennon miller,cir,derives from the supreme court decision in malley,at.whether reasonably competent officers could disagree about the lawfulness of the conduct at issue,however,is not the same question the supreme court has repeatedly instructed us to consider whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his or her conduct was unlawful in the situation he or she confronted.saucier,at.emphasis added see also brosseau,at.quoting saucier groh,at.same hope,at.same.as with our bifurcation of the clearly established inquiry,our requirement of consensus among all reasonable officers departs from supreme court dictates and unjustifiably raises the bar to liability for violations of constitutional rights.
reasonable person standards are familiar constructs in the law.they define the level of prudence,care,or knowledge that the law will require of a defendant called to task for his or her actions.in the qualified immunity context,the reasonable officer embodies the minimum degree of judgment and awareness of the law that courts expect law enforcement officials to exercise in the conduct of their duties.that is,the reasonable officer standard sets the threshold beyond which a defendant officer will not be entitled to immunity.as i have discussed,to determine what conduct a reasonable officer should have known to be unlawful in the situation presented,a court must decide whether the law was sufficiently clear regarding the conduct at issue,such that the reasonable officer,and thus the defendant,would have had fair notice that his or her conduct was unlawful.brosseau,at.
asking whether officers of reasonable competence could disagree shifts this inquiry subtly but significantly.instead of asking whether the defendant conduct was beyond the threshold of permissible error,as the reasonable officer standard does,this inquiry affords a defendant immunity unless a court is confident that a range of hypothetical reasonably competent officers could not disagree as to whether the defendant conduct was lawful.this standard is not only more permissive of defendants seeking to justify their conduct it also takes courts outside their traditional domain,asking them to speculate as to the range of views that reasonable law enforcement officers might hold,rather than engaging in the objective reasonableness determination that courts are to make.
the supreme court has specifically criticized the conflation of an objective reasonableness standard with a requirement of unanimous consensus in the context of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.in williams taylor,d,the court interpreted the statutory provision allowing a federal court to grant review of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus when a state court judgment involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,d.the fourth circuit had previously held that a state court adjudication involved an unreasonable application of federal law only if the state court has applied federal law in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is unreasonable.williams,at.quoting green french,cir emphasis added.both the majority and plurality supreme court opinions rejected the fourth circuit interpretation of the unreasonable application standard,explaining that whether an application of the law is objectively unreasonable is a different,less stringent standard than one that asks whether reasonable jurists would unanimously find an application of law unreasonable.see id.at.majority opinion a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.the federal habeas court should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one by resting its determination instead on the simple fact that at least one of the nation jurists has applied the relevant federal law in the same manner the state court did in the habeas petitioner case.id.at.plurality opinion as congress is acutely aware,reasonable lawyers and lawgivers regularly disagree with one another.congress surely did not intend that the views of one such judge who might think that relief is not warranted in a particular case should always have greater weight than the contrary,considered judgment of several other reasonable judges.our court similarly has adopted an unjustifiably stringent standard in the qualified immunity context by prohibiting liability for constitutional violations where a court believes that one reasonably competent officer would find the conduct at issue lawful,even if the overwhelming majority would not.
finally,i note that although we repeat malley officers of reasonable competence test with regularity,and it appears frequently in the decisions of other federal courts of appeals,see,brittain hansen,cir armstrong city of melvindale,cir wollin gondert,cir,it has not appeared a second time in any majority opinion of the supreme court.it seems curious that we would continue to rest our qualified immunity standard on language the supreme court has carefully eschewed for over twenty years since malley was decided.
in sum,the supreme court has struck a careful balance between the vindication of constitutional rights and government officials ability to exercise discretion in the performance of their duties.our case law,in subtle but important ways,has altered this balance in favor of defendants by adding another analytic step to the qualified immunity analysis and equating objective reasonableness with unanimity among officers of reasonable competence.in the vast majority of cases,including this one,the particular phrasing of the standard will not alter the outcome of the qualified immunity analysis.there is no doubt in this case that a reasonable officer would believe that the arrest of thomas walcyzk,as well as the search of his home and the seizure of firearms found there,were lawful.yet the effect in future cases may not always be so benign.what is more,the majority framework introduces unnecessary complications into an already complicated qualified immunity analysis.it is time to eliminate these complications and reconcile our qualified immunity analysis with the supreme court most recent,authoritative jurisprudence.
lucien walczyk is not a party to this lawsuit,having died prior to its commencement.
in addition to holding that walczyk failed to adduce evidence sufficient to establish any of the elements of adverse possession,the court ruled that his claim was barred by the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and laches because he had initiated and directed his parents suit against barberino and made the strategic choice to pursue that claim and its settlement only in their name.see walczyk barberino realty,no,wl,at.lexis,at,the plaintiff,by his failure to disclose his own claim in a timely fashion,effectively misled the defendants in the settlement of that claim and now seeks to take unfair advantage of a strategic decision he made,with the advice of counsel,to prosecute the first adverse possession claim in his parents names only.
walczyk acknowledged the comment at his deposition in this case i said well here the law.it got a thousand years of history behind it and it clearly designed to prevent blood shed and disputes over property.now if a blood bath ensues,are you going to be responsible,being th
