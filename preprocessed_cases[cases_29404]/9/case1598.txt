petitioners are and hispanic former employees of johnson johnson.they allege that johnson johnson subjective compensation and promotion practices resulted in discrimination against them and other and hispanic employees of johnson johnson and its subsidiaries.they filed suit against johnson johnson on behalf of themselves and other employees,alleging disparate impact and disparate treatment in violation of,title vii of the civil rights act of,and the laws of the state of new jersey.on august,following extensive discovery,petitioners filed a motion for class certification pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the putative class identified by petitioners was all persons of african american and or hispanic descent employed by defendant johnson johnson in any permanent salaried exempt or nonexempt position in the united states at any time from november,to the present.see app.at.the proposed class encompassed approximately current or former employees of johnson johnson and all of its united states subsidiaries,regardless of position or length of employment.following further discovery,the district court held a full day of oral argument on the issue of class certification.on december,the district court issued an order december order denying the motion for class certification.according to the district court,petitioners failed to identify any johnson johnson policy at the subsidiary or business unit level that resulted in discrimination thus,according to the district court,petitioners proof fell short of establishing commonality and typicality,such that class certification would have been inappropriate.see gutierrez johnson johnson,d,
on december,petitioners filed a letter with the district court explaining that they and johnson johnson had reached an agreement for an extension of time to file a motion requesting that the district court reconsider its denial of class certification.in this letter,the petitioners stated that plaintiffs understand that this extension is sought and may be granted without prejudice to plaintiffs right to seek leave of court to appeal the order denying certification.app.at.this was the only submission to the district court filed within ten days of the denial of class certification.the district court granted the extension in a december,letter,ordering submission of the motion by january.on that day,petitioners filed their motion to reconsider on april,the district court denied petitioners motion to reconsider april order.
on april,petitioners filed a petition with this court,seeking permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.this petition was filed within ten rule days of the denial of petitioners motion to reconsider,but days after the entry of the order denying class certification.the petition was referred to a motions panel.on april,our clerk office wrote to the parties and requested that they address the question of whether the petition for permission to appeal was timely,given the time limit in rule f.after additional briefing on the issue of whether petitioners rule f petition was timely,the motions panel issued a september,order referring the petition to a merits panel.the motions panel did not decide the issue of whether to grant the rule f petition.the motions panel order read the foregoing motion for leave to appeal and the clerk submission are referred to a merits panel.the clerk shall issue a briefing schedule.the parties are directed to address whether the application under rule f should be granted and this court authority to grant the application.app.at.the parties timely filed their submissions on these issues,and the question now before this court is whether to grant petitioners permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the district court december,denial of class certification.
the district court had jurisdiction over petitioners claims of employment discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,as well as and.plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal pursuant to.f.this court has the discretion to grant the petition for interlocutory review under rule f and.
in determining whether to grant the petition,this court has substantial discretion and may base its decision to grant permission to appeal on any consideration that it finds persuasive.see.f advisory committee note.to guide the exercise of its discretion,this court employs the factors set forth in newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure sets forth the rules and procedures governing class actions.see.rule f,which governs the method by which a party can appeal from the grant or denial of class certification,directs that a court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within ten days after the order is entered.f.a rule f appeal is a specific type of interlocutory appeal,and the courts of appeals have very broad discretion in deciding whether to grant permission to pursue a rule f appeal.see.f advisory committee note.according to the advisory committee note,which was appended to rule following the adoption of rule f,t he court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal,akin to the discretion exercised by the supreme court in acting on a petition for certiorari.id.as the note further states,p ermission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.id.because the motions panel neither granted nor denied petitioners request for permission to appeal pursuant to rule f when it referred the matter to a merits panel,we would normally have to determine whether to grant petitioners permission to appeal the district court denial of class certification.
before we can determine whether to grant petitioners request for permission to appeal the denial of class certification,however,we must first determine whether petitioners rule f petition is timely.rule f requires that a petition requesting permission to appeal an order granting or denying class certification be filed within ten days after the entry of the order.this time limit,as other courts have noted,is strict and mandatory.see,jenkins bellsouth,cir noting that the deadline provides a single window of opportunity to seek interlocutory review,and that window closes quickly to promote judicial economy carpenter boeing,cir noting that the timeliness requirement is mandatory coco incorporated village of belle terre,new york,cir per curiam noting that rule f is inflexible see also gary sheahan,cir.as the seventh circuit has noted,in order t o ensure that there is only one window of potential disruption,and to permit the parties to proceed in confidence about the scope and stakes of the case thereafter,rule f window of review is deliberately small.gary,at see also blair equifax check services,cir discussing the reasoning behind the adoption of rule f and noting that rule f is drafted to avoid delay in the district court proceedings.
although the time limit is clearly strict and mandatory,the circuit courts have carved out a narrow exception to the rigid time limit.the circuit courts agree that a motion to reconsider the grant or denial of class certification tolls the time limit within which to file a petition for permission to appeal under rule f.see carpenter,at mcnamara felderhof,cir shin cobb county bd.of,cir per curiam gary,at see also united states dieter,d noting that a motion for rehearing in another context renders the original judgment and thus tolls the time period for appeal provided the motion is filed within the time to file a notice of appeal.
we join the other circuits in holding that the period within which to file a rule f petition is tolled by the filing of a timely and proper motion to reconsider the grant or denial of class certification thus,the time period in rule f does not begin to run until the district court rules on the motion to reconsider.we stress that,for the purpose of tolling the time within which to file a rule f petition,a timely motion to reconsider is one that is filed within the period set forth in rule f.see shin,at by timely filed,we mean when a motion for reconsideration,instead of a rule f petition for permission to appeal,is filed within ten days after the certification order.accordingly,and regardless of any conflicting local rules,a motion to reconsider a class certification decision that is filed more than ten days after the order granting or denying class certification is untimely with respect to rule f and will not toll the period for filing a rule f petition.see,carpenter,at mcnamara,at gary,at.we also stress that the period for filing either a rule f petition or a motion to reconsider runs from the order granting or denying class certification.see.f.a later order that does not change the status quo will not revive the time limit.see jenkins,at w hat counts is the original order denying or granting class certification,not a later order that maintains the status quo.carpenter,at an order that leaves status unchanged from what was determined by a prior order is not an order granting or denying class action certification.mcnamara,at as the district court merely reaffirmed its prior ruling,the court order was not an order granting or denying class action certification under rule f.
petitioners filed their motion to certify the proposed class on august.the district court denied the motion on december.petitioners filed their motion to reconsider on january,pursuant to the district court scheduling order.they filed neither a rule f petition nor a motion to reconsider the denial of certification within ten days of the december order.accordingly,because the rule f period passed without either a rule f petition or a proper motion to reconsider being filed,petitioners april,rule f petition,which is now before us,is not timely.
petitioners argue that because they filed their rule f petition within ten days of the district court april,denial of their motion to reconsider,that petition is timely.this argument is unavailing because the april order did not change the status quo.see jenkins,at.the denial of the motion to reconsider merely affirmed the district court decision not to certify the class.accordingly,the denial of the motion to reconsider does not qualify as an order granting or denying class action certification within the meaning of rule f.see jenkins,at carpenter,at mcnamara,at.the december order,not the april order,was the decision that started the running of rule f period.thus,in order for their rule f petition to have been timely,petitioners should have filed their petition within ten days of that decision.because petitioners did not file their petition until long after the rule f period expired,the petition now before us is untimely.
petitioners also argue that,even though their rule f petition was not filed within ten days of the december order,their january,motion to reconsider tolled the period until the district court april,ruling on the motion.petitioners contend that their motion to reconsider was timely because it was filed within the time period agreed to by the parties and approved by the district court.as a timely motion to reconsider,petitioners suggest,the motion would thus toll the rule f period.as noted supra,however,the fact that the motion was timely for the purposes of the district court schedule does not necessarily make it timely for an appeal to this court.a timely motion to reconsider in the rule f context is,as we have noted,one that is filed within ten days of the grant or denial of class certification.it is the period in rule f,and not any other schedule or time period,that dictates whether a motion to reconsider will toll rule f strict time period and make a rule f petition timely for the purposes of this court review.petitioners motion to reconsider was not filed within ten days of the december order,and therefore the time limit in rule f was not tolled.the fact that the district court extended the time for petitioners to file their motion to reconsider beyond the time limit within which to file a timely rule f petition does not change our determination that petitioners petition was untimely 
alternatively,petitioners suggest that even if their motion to reconsider was not timely for the purpose of tolling rule f,their december,letter requesting more time to file a motion to reconsider could be considered a sufficient motion for the purpose of tolling the rule f period.we disagree.it is true that courts do not require a formal motion or pleading in order to consider a filing to be such a motion.see,mcnamara,at noting that trial management plan could be considered a motion to reconsider where the plan included a specific request to modify its ruling with respect to class certification.furthermore,as this court has noted in another context,it is the relief desired,not the title of the motion,that dictates how this court should view a particular filing.see,united states contents of account numbers and at merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner,and smith,cir.despite this general rule,we will not construe the letter filed with the district court on december,to be a motion to reconsider.petitioners letter does not in any way provide the district court with the reasons or errors upon which petitioners were basing their claim for relief.additionally,it does not comply with the district of new jersey local civil rule that governs motions to reconsider,as it was not accompanied by a brief setting forth concisely the matter or controlling decisions which the party believes the judge or magistrate judge has overlooked.see.at best,the letter is,as petitioners characterized it,a notice of their intent to seek reconsideration.see appellant br.at,app.at.the letter was a petition for additional time to file a court document,not a filing itself.while the petitioners letter may have preserved the time to file a motion to reconsider with the district court,it was not a proper motion to reconsider.thus,the letter can not,by itself,toll the period for filing a rule f petition even though it was filed with the district court within ten days of the december order 
for all of the foregoing reasons,we hold that petitioners rule f petition was untimely.
during her oral argument to this court,counsel for the petitioners suggested that johnson johnson waived its ability to challenge the timeliness of the rule f petition because johnson johnson did not raise that argument before the district court.as with the argument that the petition was timely,this argument also suffers from multiple infirmities.initially,we note that johnson johnson could not have challenged the timeliness of the rule f petition in the district court,as the petition was not before that court.the rule f petition was filed with and addressed issues before this court.unlike interlocutory appeals filed pursuant to b and federal rule of appellate procedure,no certification by the district court was required.
we raised the issue of timeliness sua sponte.because the petition was filed with and addressed to this court,as opposed to the district court,the proper challenge to the timeliness of the petition would have been with this court.thus,johnson johnson did not prejudice its ability to now challenge the timeliness of the petition by failing to first raise that argument in the district court.
additionally,johnson johnson did not,as petitioners argue,waive its challenge to the timeliness of the rule f petition by failing to object to the district court approval of the extension of time requested by petitioners.petitioners suggest that by agreeing to an extension of time to file the motion to reconsider,johnson johnson effectively agreed to an extension of time to file the rule f petition and forfeited the ability to challenge the filing of that petition.the language of the letter belies this contention,however.the original draft of the letter to the district court stated that the parties,petitioners and johnson johnson,agreed that the extension of time to file a motion to reconsider would not prejudice petitioners ability to appeal the denial of class certification.see app.at.johnson johnson objected to this language,and the letter that was ultimately submitted read plaintiffs understand that this extension is sought and may be granted without prejudice to plaintiffs right to seek leave of court to appeal the order denying certification.app.at emphasis added.the fact that johnson johnson would not state that it agreed that the extension of time to file a motion to reconsider would not prejudice the petitioners rule f petition suggests that johnson johnson did not waive or forfeit any objection to the timeliness of the rule f petition.
furthermore,because a motion to reconsider and the rule f petition are distinct motions,the failure to object to the timeliness of one does not forfeit the failure to object to the timeliness of the other.finally,as this court had not yet adopted the rule that a timely and proper motion to reconsider tolls the time to file a rule f petition,it was not clear at that time that whatever johnson johnson agreed to with regard to petitioners motion to reconsider would necessarily have any effect on petitioners ability to file a rule f petition.thus,requiring johnson johnson to object in the district court to the filing of petitioners motion to reconsider in order to preserve an objection in this court to the timeliness of the rule f petition would have required prior knowledge of a rule we had not yet announced.
for all of these reasons,we will not ignore the untimeliness of petitioners rule f petition based on johnson johnson actions although it may be possible in certain circumstances to waive an objection to an rule f petition,johnson johnson was not required to object in the district court to petitioners actions in order to preserve an objection to the timeliness of the petition before this court.accordingly,johnson johnson did not waive any challenge to the timeliness of petitioners rule f petition.
when it referred petitioners rule f petition to a merits panel,the motions panel requested that the parties submit briefs addressing the impact of the supreme court decision in bowles russell,d,and whether the doctrine of unique circumstances would apply to toll the time for petitioners to file their rule f petition.in bowles,the supreme court noted that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.bowles,at.at quoting griggs provident consumer discount,d.the court distinguished between time limits for taking an appeal that are set forth in a statute and those that are derived from,rules.see id.at.at see also eberhart united states,d per curiam discussing jurisdictional time limits and the supreme court holding in kontrick ryan,d.according to the court,the failure to file a notice of appeal within a time limit deprives the appeals court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.see bowles,at.at.where a time limit is set forth in a procedural,rule,however,a court can exercise its discretion and hear an untimely appeal.see id.at.at.additionally,the court noted,a party that seeks the enforcement of a time limit can be found to have waived its objection to an untimely petition,whereas the jurisdictional time limits are not waivable.see id.at.at.
the import of this distinction between jurisdictional and rules,according to the supreme court,is that courts can not create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional time limits.see id.at.at.in bowles,the supreme court held that one such equitable exception,the doctrine of unique circumstances,was not applicable to cases where the time limit was jurisdictional.see id.at.at.the doctrine of unique circumstances,first explicated in harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,prevents a party from being penalized for relying on a district court assurance that the party has additional time,beyond the time in a statute or rule,to file an appeal.see harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,d per curiam see also schneider ex rel.estate of schneider fried,cir the unique circumstances doctrine was designed to prevent the appellant reliance on the district court mistake from prejudicing the appellant.sonicraft,nlrb,cir noting that the doctrine is limited to the situation where the district court assures a party that he has time to appeal,and the party relies and forgoes filing a timely appeal.as both the supreme court and this court have noted,the doctrine is to be very narrowly construed and rarely applied to expand the time to file an appeal.see bowles,at.at kraus consolidated rail,cir.
in light of bowles,we would be without jurisdiction to hear petitioners appeal if rule f is jurisdictional because petitioners petition was filed more than ten days after the december order.bowles also suggests that if rule f is jurisdictional,the doctrine of unique circumstances would be unavailable to save petitioners untimely petition.however,the time limit set forth in rule f for filing a petition for permission to appeal is closer in nature to the,time limits discussed in eberhart and kontrick than it is to the,jurisdictional time limit at issue in bowles.rule f is a rule promulgated by the supreme court,and the time limit is not set forth in a statute.rule f,like the rules discussed in eberhart and kontrick,is thus a,procedural rule designed to ensure that the business of the courts is done in an orderly fashion see bowles,at.at asher baxter int l,cir how much time litigants have to take interlocutory appeals is a question for the rulemaking process,which implies that the deadline is not jurisdictional.
although the time limit in rule f is rather than jurisdictional,it is clearly a strict and inflexible time limit.see,coco,at.to the extent that the doctrine of unique circumstances can still be used to toll time periods after bowles the doctrine can not save petitioners untimely petition.in the letter petitioners filed with the district court requesting additional time to file their motion to reconsider,petitioners wrote that they understood that the extension of time would not prejudice their ability to seek review of the denial of class certification.although this was an incorrect assumption in light of the paucity of case law in this circuit concerning the effect of a motion to reconsider on the rule f time period,petitioners can not use the district court approval of the extension of time to save their untimely petition.the district court made no affirmative statements about the effect of the extension of time on petitioners ability to appeal to this court.at best,petitioners may have relied on the district court to correct their mistaken understanding of the law,which is not a situation in which the doctrine of unique circumstances would apply.accordingly,the doctrine of unique circumstances provides no relief for petitioners.given the narrow manner in which this court has interpreted the doctrine of unique circumstances,and to the extent that it survives bowles,we will not toll the rule f time period based on the district court grant of additional time to file a motion to reconsider 
we stress that rule f time limit for filing a motion to reconsider is a strict and mandatory time period,for rule f creates a brief opportunity for expedited review.asher,at.therefore,unless a motion to reconsider is filed within ten days of the order granting or denying class certification,the rule f petition will be untimely if filed outside the window.the purpose of rule f,in part,is to ensure that interlocutory appeals of class certification decisions are heard and dec
