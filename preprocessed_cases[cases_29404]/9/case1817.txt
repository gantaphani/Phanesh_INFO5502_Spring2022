opinion of the court 
robert robert,then a minor,filed this action against the stetson school stetson,several stetson employees,and others.his complaint asserted claims against the school and its staff members under for violating his federal constitutional rights by subjecting him to physical and psychological abuse the complaint also contained a variety of claims against these defendants.in this appeal,robert challenges the district court decision that stetson and its staff did not act under color of state law,as well as two of the district court evidentiary rulings.we affirm.
robert was a victim of sexual abuse,and he in turn molested his younger brother.in,when robert was,the philadelphia court of common pleas found him to be a dependent child,see.cons.stat.ann,and placed him,with his mother consent,in the temporary custody of the philadelphia department of human services dhs at no time,however,did a court find robert to be a delinquent child,see.cons.stat.ann,nor was he convicted of any crime.
dhs decided that robert would be best served by enrolling him in stetson,a school that specializes in the treatment and education of juvenile sex of fenders.this decision was not mandated by any court order and was done with the consent of robert mother.dhs remained robert legal custodian throughout his stay at stetson and was authorized to remove him at any time if it was not fully satisfied with the services that stetson was providing.in fact,at the urging of robert mother,dhs eventually did remove robert from stetson in march.
stetson is a private,residential institution located in barre,massachusetts.at the time of robert enrollment,stetson had approximately residential students and four or five commuter students.all of the stetson students were sex offenders.incorporated under massachusetts law and licensed by the state,stetson was governed by a board of trustees,the members of which were elected by a board of corporators.none of the members of the board of trustees or the board of corporators were appointed by a government entity,and none were federal,state,or local employees.
stetson buildings and property were all privately owned and maintained,and stetson had full control over its admissions process.admissions decisions were made by a committee that reviewed applications and conducted interviews of interested applicants.stetson was not obligated to accept any student.in fact,stetson historically refused to accept students with criminal records and had successfully gone to court to exclude students whom it did not believe satisfied its stringent enrollment criteria 
in pursuing its mission of providing treatment and education to juvenile sex offenders,stetson worked in close concert with state and local governments.for example,stetson and the city of philadelphia entered into various financial and performance contracts regarding philadelphia children placed in the school.these contracts were entered into pursuant to the pennsylvania child protective services act.cons.stat.ann.et.according to the testimony of richard robertson,stetson executive director,the city of philadelphia paid stetson slightly more than per day for each student,an amount that was insufficient to cover the school actual costs.costs not covered by tuition were covered by grants from private foundations,other charitable contributions,and loans.neither dhs nor the city of philadelphia had any involvement in the management of stetson.that task was left entirely to the stetson staff.
stetson provided a structured environment for its students.students were not permitted to leave campus without supervision,were assigned bed times,were generally awakened at approximately the same time,and ate their meals at times set by the staff.although the school did not require uniforms,it had a dress code students were allowed to use both computers and telephones,but when students used a telephone,a stetson staff member was normally in the room for therapeutic reasons students were allowed to write and receive mail.
some were also allowed to leave campus with supervision and to go home for vacations.stetson did not employ any mechanical or chemical restraints the buildings did not have bars on the windows and the school did not permit corporal or physical punishment.
robert alleged that stetson staff members subjected him to physical and psychological abuse,including wrestling with him and kicking and punching him.robert claimed that this conduct violated stetson policy against horseplay and severely disrupted his treatment.he reported this alleged abuse to a stetson therapist in february.after an internal investigation,stetson concluded that three of its counselors had violated the policy and subsequently suspended them.the commonwealth of massachusetts also investigated and decided that stetson had acted appropriately in punishing the counselors.
not satisfied with the school response,robert filed this action,asserting claims under for violations of his constitutional rights,as well as claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress,assault and battery,false arrest,false imprisonment,invasion of privacy,negligence,and civil rights violations.on motion of the stetson defendants,the district court bifurcated the trial.after hearing evidence on the question of state action,the court made findings of fact related to that question and held that the stetson defendants were not state actors.a trial was then held on robert claims,but the jury did not award him any relief,and robert took this appeal.
embodying the requirement of the fourteenth amendment,see lugar edmondson oil,d united states price,d,provides a cause of action that may be asserted against e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution emphasis added.thus,a plaintiff in a section action bears the threshold burden of proving that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.mark borough of hatboro,cir quoting moore tartler,cir.
as noted,the stetson school is a private institution,and thus the school and its employees do not formally wield the authority of the state.there are,however,some circumstances in which seemingly private behavior may fairly be treated as that of the state itself.brentwood acad.tennessee secondary,d quoting jackson metropolitan edison,d.the supreme court recently wrote that there are a host of facts that can bear on the fairness of such an attribution and that a midst such variety,examples may be the best teachers.id.we therefore begin our analysis of the question in this case with the supreme court decision in kohn,d,which provides the example that is most closely analogous to the present case.
concerned the new perspectives school,an institution with many similarities to the stetson school.the new perspectives school was a nonprofit institution that specialized in treating and educating students who had experienced difficulty completing public high schools largely due to drug,alcohol,and behavioral problems.new perspectives was a private school,located on private property,and operated by a private board of directors.students who attended new perspectives were generally referred by local school committees or the state department of health.the school committees paid new perspectives for its services,and at least of new perspectives operating budget came from public funds.to be eligible for this funding,new perspectives was required to comply with various local and state regulations.the school also entered into contracts with governmental bodies that referred students to the school.
applying the factors discussed in blum yaretsky,d,a case handed down on the same day as,the supreme court held that new perspectives discharge of employees was not state action.first,the court rejected the argument that the school was a state actor because virtually all of its income was derived from government funding,at.the court stated that a cts of private contractors do not become acts of the government by reason of their significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts.id.at.the court likewise found no merit in the argument that extensive state regulation of the school was sufficient to make it a state actor,because the challenged conduct by new perspectives was not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation.id.next,the court concluded that new perspectives was not performing a function that had been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state.id.at.quoting jackson,at.emphasis added in.the court recognized that the education of maladjusted high school students is a public function and that state law required that services be provided for these students at public expense.at.see also id.at.marshall,dissenting.but the court noted that until recently the state had not undertaken to provide education for students who could not be served by the traditional public schools,and the court commented that a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its acts state action.id.finally,the court rejected the argument that there was a symbiotic relationship between new perspectives and the state sufficient to make new perspectives a state actor.the court observed that t he school fiscal relationship with the state was not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government.id.
in light of,it is apparent that many of the factors upon which robert relies here are insufficient to establish state action.for example,it is clear that stetson receipt of government funds did not make it a state actor.similarly,although robert relies on the detailed requirements set out in dhs contracts with stetson,those requirements are also insufficient because they did not compel or even influence the conduct on the part of the stetson staff that robert challenged.see american mfrs.mutual ins.sullivan,d mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the state black,at pervasive regulation made no difference because the complained of conduct was not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation.
robert argues,however,that the stetson school,unlike the new perspectives school,performed a function that has traditionally been the exclusive province of the state.indeed,robert brief forswears reliance on any other theory of state action.see appellant br.at only the public function test is useful and relevant in reviewing the state actorship determination by the district court in the present matter on appeal.as we have noted,this test imposes a rigorous standard that is rarely satisfied,mark,at,for w hile many functions have been traditionally performed by governments,very few have been exclusively reserved to the state.flagg brothers lefkowitz,d.
in this case,robert has not made the requisite showing.as was true of the new perspectives school in,the record here does not show that the stetson school performed a function that has been traditionally the exclusive province of the state.in fact,the undisputed evidence showed that the only schools that offered services similar to those provided by stetson were private schools.see appendix at testimony of richard robinson indicating that he is unaware of any public schools that specialize in educating and treating sex of fenders.the mere fact that stetson performs a function which serves the public does not makes its acts state action,at.
this conclusion is supported by our decision in black by black indiana area sch,cir,a case involving a private bus company with which a school district had contracted to transport students to and from school.we found that case to be indistinguishable from,concluding that 
w hile the company and the individual defendants affiliated with it were carrying out a state program at state expense,they were not performing a function that has been traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state and there was no state regulation that compelled or even influenced the conduct which is alleged to have violated plaintiffs constitutional rights.
black by black,at.we went on to state that as in,the cooperation between the state and the contractor was only that appropriate to the execution of the subject matter of the contract and the contractor fiscal relationship with the state is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the state.id.at quoting,at.finally,although school busing is commonly thought of as a traditional state function,we concluded that the state contractor was not providing a service within the exclusive province of the state.id.we believe that the facts of the present case warrant the same conclusion.
robert appears to suggest that this case is different because the services that stetson provided were services that dhs was required by state law to provide.see appellant br.at.this very argument,however,appears to have been rejected in.in dissent in that case,justice marshall highlighted the fact that the new perspectives school provide d a service that the state was required to provide under a state statute enacted a few years earlier,at.marshall,dissenting see also id.at,but the court was not persuaded.see at.that legislative policy choice in no way makes these services the exclusive province of the state.
stressing the restrictions placed on students liberty while attending the stetson school,robert argues that the involuntary nature of his commitment made his situation there entirely analogous to the situation of either a prisoner or mentally committed individual held against will.appellant br.at.there is,however,no factual basis for analogizing robert situation at the stetson school to that of a prisoner or a person who has been involuntarily civilly committed.whether or not robert,a minor at the time in question,personally wanted to attend the stetson school,his legal custodian,dhs,wanted him placed there,and his mother consented.thus,his enrollment at stetson was not involuntary in the sense relevant here,he was not deprived of his liberty in contravention of his legal custodian or his mother wishes 
finally,we do not believe that the present case is comparable to milonas williams,cir,a case that robert believes is directly on point.in milonas,a class consisting of students at the provo canyon school for boys brought section claims against the school and members of its staff,alleging that inhumane treatment at the school violated the constitution.the provo canyon school,as described in the tenth circuit opinion,was an unusual facility.a private facility for boys with severe physical,psychological,and emotional problems,the school was described in the district court opinion,which the tenth circuit quoted,as not a school in the traditional,ordinary,classroom sense.at.although the school did offer classes,the district court observed,the school was also a correctional and detention facility.while students were generally admitted at the insistence of one or both of their parents,others were received at the school directly from juvenile courts and probation officers from across the nation.id.at.conditions at the school were unusually harsh and restrictive.id.the district court wrote 
students are restricted to the grounds.students are confined.some students are locked in and locked up with varying degrees of personal liberty restored as each progresses through the institutional program.if a student leaves without permission,he is hunted down,taken into custody and returned 
regardless of origin,condition or motivation,once arrived,each person during the beginning phases of the school program was locked in,isolated from the outside world,and whether,crippled or learning disabled,was subject to mandated physical standing day after day after day to promote right thinking and social conformity.mail was censored.visitors were discouraged.disparaging remarks concerning the institution were prohibited and punished.to graduate from confinement to a more liberated phase,one had to pass a lie detector test relating to attitude,truthfulness and future conduct.some failed to pass and remained in confinement for extended periods of time.
the tenth circuit concluded that the state ha d so insinuated itself with the provo canyon school as to be considered a joint participant in the of fending actions.id.at.the court relied on the involuntary commitment of some students,the school detailed contracts with the school districts,the school receipt of substantial state funding,and extensive state regulation.see id.recognizing that the new perspectives school in was indeed quite similar to the provo canyon school,the tenth circuit attempted to distinguish the cases by noting that the plaintiffs in were employees of the school,whereas the plaintiffs in milonas were students,some of whom have been involuntarily placed in the school by state officials who were aware of,and approved of,certain of the practices which the district court enjoined.id.at.
milonas is not binding on us,and we can not agree entirely with the court reasoning.the milonas court reliance on significant state funding of tuition and the detailed contracts between the school and local school districts appears to us to be squarely inconsistent with.moreover,we are uncertain what the milonas court had in mind when it sought to distinguish on the ground that the plaintiffs in that case were school employees,rather than students.there are,of course,circumstances in which this distinction might matter.for example,a state directive might require a private entity to engage in the conduct challenged by a student while imposing no such requirement regarding conduct challenged by an employee.but it is unclear why the milonas court thought that it was important that the plaintiffs in the case before it were students.it is possible that the milonas court took this view because it believed that some state officials were aware of,and approved of certain of the provo canyon school practices concerning the treatment of students.it is not clear that even such awareness and approval would be enough to establish state action but if this is not what the milonas court had in mind,the significance of the fact that the plaintiffs were students is obscure.
in any event,we need not decide whether we would agree with the tenth circuit on the facts presented in milonas,because the case now before us is quite different.here,robert was not involuntarily placed in the school by state officials who were aware of,and approved of the practices attacked in robert complaint.robert was enrolled at stetson by his legal custodian and with his mother consent,and we are aware of no evidence that any state officials were aware or approved of the conduct by the members of the stetson staff that forms the basis of robert less any evidence that they provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the challenged conduct must in law be deemed to be that of the state.blum,at.see also san francisco arts athletics,d.
moreover,for what it is worth,there is simply no evidence that stetson subjected its students to anything approaching the conditions at the provo canyon school.as far as the record here reveals,stetson students were not placed in solitary confinement,discouraged from seeing visitors,required to take lie detector tests,or subjected to censorship of their mail.on the contrary,it is undisputed that robert was allowed to leave campus with an instructor,had regular contact with his family including frequent visits with his mother and,was allowed to leave campus with his family,and was even allowed to go home for vacations.
robert emphasizes the fact that stetson students were not allowed to leave the school grounds without permission and that,if they did,the school would attempt to locate and return them,with the help of the local police department if necessary.see appellant br.at.he argues that his complete inability to leave the stetson school without having a bench warrant issued for his detention,effectively ma de him a prisoner,much more analogous to an inmate,than to any other situation.id.at.in response,stetson states 
in the event that a student were to leave campus without permission,stetson,like all responsible private or public schools,would notify local police for the student own welfare and for the protection of the community.stetson would not issue a warrant and arrest order because stetson lacked the jurisdictional basis and the legal authority on its own to invoke custodial proceedings.
appellees br.at citations to appendix omitted.
robert has not referred us to any evidence in the record that supports his assertion that the school did more than simply notify the police department if a student left without permission nor has he referred us to any provision of massachusetts statute or common law that gave stetson any greater authority with respect to a missing student than is enjoyed by any of the state other privately owned and run residential schools.
in sum,whether or not we would follow milonas,we are satisfied that that case is easily distinguishable from the case before us.particularly in light of the supreme court decision in,we agree with the district court that robert failed to show that the challenged actions of the stetson staff may be fairly attributed to the state.
robert also challenges two evidentiary rulings made by the district court during the trial on his claims.first,he argues that the district court erred by limiting the expert testimony of anne wolbert burgess,who was prepared to testify that the behavior to which robert was subjected at stetson constituted child abuse.the district court accepted burgess as an expert in child abuse,but the court ruled that an expert opinion on the question whether specific conduct constituted child abuse would not be helpful to the jury under.moreover,the court concluded that testimony by burgess on this point would result in undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence within the meaning of,and the court therefore precluded such testimony.in addition,the court ruled that burgess was not qualified to render an opinion diagnosing plaintiff with stress disorder and that such testimony would be unnecessarily cumulative to the testimony of plaintiff other experts.as a result of these rulings,burgess testimony was limited to the treatment that she believed would have been best for robert.
robert argues that the district court erred in limiting burgess testimony.he claims that burgess testimony was offered to help explain to the jury the ramifications,and implications,of uninvited physical contact by staff with plaintiff,in the guise of horseplay.robert brief at.more specifically,he argues that expert testimony was necessary to explain that children who act out sexually and who have been the victims of sexual abuse are at an increased risk for harm caused by uninvited inappropriate physical contact.see id.at.therefore,he contends that the district court made it impossible for him adequately to explain the seriousness of the horseplay by the stetson staff.id.at.
we review a district court decision to admit or reject testimony under rule for abuse of discretion,and,we will not reverse such a ruling unless it is arbitrary and irrational.bhaya westinghouse,cir quoting united states deperi,cir,cert.denied,d.we hold that the district court ruling limiting burgess testimony under.was within the proper bounds of its discretion.
in addition to burgess,two other experts testified on robert behalf at trial.see stetson brief at.these two witnesses,edward doughtery and robert prentky,both psychologists,testified at length about the impact that the alleged physical and mental abuse of robert could have on someone with his history.see appendix at portion of doughtery testimony portion of prentky testimony.both experts explained that someone like robert,who has been the victim and perpetrator of sexual abuse,is particularly susceptible to harm caused by inappropriate contact.see id.at explaining that,prior to entering stetson,robert had a brittle personality due to numerous problems in his early development and that the conduct at stetson caused him a great deal of stress and problems appendix at child abuse,virtually b
