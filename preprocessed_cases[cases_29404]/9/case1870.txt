jehovah is a vdoc inmate who was incarcerated at sussex i prison sip in waverly,virginia when he filed this lawsuit.in his pro se complaint,he alleges four courses of action taken by vdoc employees that he claims violated his rights under rluipa and the first and eighth amendments.
first,jehovah claims that various policies have prevented him from taking communion in the manner required by his religious beliefs.jehovah mandates that he take communion by drinking red wine and consuming bread dipped in honey,olive oil,sugar,cinnamon,and water.while he was incarcerated at nottoway correctional center ncc from september to march,jehovah was not permitted to take communion at all pursuant to a memorandum prohibiting the practice for inmates in segregation.in april,jehovah was transferred to sip and placed in the general population.jehovah requested permission from the warden to take communion but did not receive a response,so he filed a grievance.in january,while jehovah grievance was pending,vdoc issued a new policy prohibiting all inmates from consuming wine during communion.jehovah filed another grievance,which vdoc denied.vdoc revised its policy in january to allow inmates to consume bread dipped in wine but not to drink wine.jehovah filed a third grievance,which was also denied.in december,vdoc changed its policy yet again to ban inmates from consuming communion wine by any method 
second,jehovah asserts that he has been unable to secure a job that will allow him to observe his sabbaths.jehovah faith prohibits him from working during the old jewish sabbath friday sundown to saturday sundown or the new christic sabbath sunday at sunset to monday at sunrise vdoc requires inmates to participate in programming including work and educational activities for a certain number of hours per week in order to be eligible for good conduct allowances and earned sentence credits.see.in february jehovah was assigned to a cleaning position,and his supervisor required him to work seven days a week.jehovah requested that vdoc accommodate his observance of the sabbaths,but vdoc refused,informing him that his failure to work could lead to sanctions.he filed a grievance,which vdoc denied.vdoc staff has not approved him for any job for which he has applied since december,including jobs for which they had previously approved him according to jehovah,there are few prison jobs available to him at sip and other prisons which he can work and keep observing the sabbaths.compl.
third,jehovah states that vdoc has housed him with people who are and unbelievers,contrary to his religious beliefs.compl.jehovah is directed by god not to be yoked to unbelievers.compl.at one point jehovah was housed with a satanist and,even though vdoc knew of jehovah religious views.compl.this inmate harassed jehovah and subjected him to,rhetoric.compl.after several requests to be reassigned,jehovah filed a grievance to which vdoc never responded.since july,jehovah has been assigned to live with an atheist,an agnostic,a worldly muslim,a insincere christian,a racist black atheist,a hell angel biker,and a black from an gang.other vdoc prisons had been able to accommodate jehovah requests to be housed only with christians.
finally,jehovah alleges that he has suffered various medical ailments that vdoc medical staff have deliberately ignored.in while incarcerated at ncc,jehovah experienced,among other things,tongue lesions,chest and throat pain,difficulty swallowing,coughing,nausea,lethargy,and unexplained weight loss.after medical staff at ncc detected and acknowledged jehovah symptoms but before they could diagnose them,jehovah was transferred to sip on march.compl.jehovah developed further symptoms after arriving at sip,and after testing negative for strep throat he was referred to king.on april,king examined jehovah for the first time.he found holes in jehovah tonsils but did not acknowledge any of jehovah other symptoms he ordered a test for hiv,which was negative,and then did not provide any further care.compl.jehovah symptoms worsened,and he sought additional treatment from king on june.king ignored all of jehovah symptoms except his coughing,neck lesion,and nasal drip king ordered a chest and urine and blood tests the appeared normal but the urine and blood tests revealed abnormalities consistent with infection.jehovah maintains king ignored these results and provided no further treatment.jehovah saw king again on july,and king referred him to mental health staff,who ultimately determined that he had no psychological problems.jehovah condition continued to deteriorate when jehovah next saw king on august,king disregarded most of his symptoms and treated him for gastroesophageal reflux disease with prilosec,which made many of jehovah symptoms worse.compl.king also referred jehovah to mental health staff again to be evaluated for bipolar disorder,of which staff found no symptoms.this pattern continued into,with king and other vdoc doctors allegedly acknowledging only some of jehovah symptoms,ignoring test results indicating infection,and failing to improve jehovah condition 
jehovah filed this lawsuit on july,seeking compensatory and injunctive relief for these alleged violations of rluipa,the first amendment,and the eighth amendment.on september,the district court sua sponte dismissed all of jehovah claims except his communion claim pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra.appellees moved to dismiss the remaining claim on december.in support of their motion they submitted a declaration from vdoc chief of corrections operations david robinson discussing the purposes of the wine ban.jehovah responded with numerous discovery requests to which appellees responded in part and otherwise objected.he then filed a motion to compel discovery and to hold an evidentiary hearing,which the district court denied on may.on august,the court granted appellees summary judgment motion and dismissed jehovah rluipa and first amendment claims regarding the communion wine ban.jehovah timely appealed the dismissal of all his claims.
on appeal,jehovah argues that the district court erred in dismissing his sabbath,cell assignment,and deliberate indifference claims under,and granting appellees summary judgment on his communion wine claim.

the first amendment protection of the right to exercise religious beliefs extends to all citizens,including inmates.estate of shabazz.in turner safley,the supreme court held that when a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.the turner court laid out a test for determining whether a prison regulation that infringes on an inmate first amendment rights is nonetheless reasonable and therefore constitutionally valid.first,is there a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it id.second,are there alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates id.at.third,what is the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates,and on the allocation of prison resources generally id.and finally,do there exist obvious,easy alternatives suggesting that the regulation is an exaggerated response to prison concerns id.under this framework,t he burden is not on the state to prove the validity of prison regulations but on the prisoner to disprove it.overton bazzetta.
rluipa provides more stringent protection of prisoners free exercise rights than does the first amendment,applying strict scrutiny instead of reasonableness.lovelace lee,cir.it prohibits any government entity from imposing a substantial burden on an inmate religious exercise unless the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.a.the inmate bears the initial burden of showing a substantial burden on her religious exercise,but the government must establish that the burden is the least restrictive way to further a compelling governmental interest.id.b.the standard is exceptionally demanding,and it requires the government to show that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting party.holt hobbs,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
jehovah and appellees agree that summary judgment of jehovah rluipa claim regarding vdoc wine ban was improper for two reasons.first,jehovah did not have the opportunity to brief the issue of whether the wine ban substantially burdened his religious exercise.the district court held that jehovah had not demonstrated a substantial burden.but the court had previously found,during the stage,that p rohibiting plaintiff from taking wine with communion burdens the exercise of his religion.because of this,the parties did not address the substantial burden prong of rluipa in their summary judgment briefing.a district court may resolve a motion for summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party,but it must first provide notice and a reasonable time to respond.f see also coward jabe,app x,cir unpublished after giving notice and a reasonable time to respond,the district court may grant a motion for summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party.jehovah was not afforded the requisite opportunity to demonstrate an issue of material fact regarding the burden imposed by the wine ban.
second,the parties agree that the record is insufficient to support the conclusion that the wine ban is the least restrictive means to address the government purported security interest the robinson affidavit,which appellees proffered in support of their summary judgment motion,does not even attempt to explain why an absolute ban is the least restrictive measure available.at the very least,the government must acknowledge and give some consideration to less restrictive alternatives.couch jabe,cir both jehovah and appellees agree that this burden has not yet been satisfied,and we agree.therefore,we reverse the district court summary dismissal of jehovah rluipa wine ban claim and remand for further proceedings.
although we must subject jehovah first amendment claim to a standard more deferential to vdoc,we find that a reasonable jury could rule in jehovah favor.under turner,jehovah bears the burden of showing not only that his religious exercise was substantially burdened,but also that the wine ban is not reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.at see also overton,at.the district court based its first amendment holding on its finding that jehovah failed to demonstrate a substantial burden on his religious exercise.as with the rluipa claim,the court failed to provide notice that it would be considering this alternative ground for summary judgment.however,we may affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on any ground in the record.bryant bell atlantic,cir.therefore,we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether the wine ban is unreasonable under turner.
turner first prong asks whether there is a rational connection between a legitimate penological interest and the policy infringing on an inmate free exercise.at.the robinson affidavit attests that the communion wine policy is motivated by safety and security concerns,specifically intended to avoid the mishandling of alcohol and to prevent inmates who have struggled with alcoholism from engaging in unhealthy behavior.promoting the inmates safety and health is a legitimate concern.see mcrae johnson,app x,cir unpublished finding that in the prison setting,suppression of contraband and maintaining the health and safety of inmates and staff constitute compelling governmental interests.emphasis added citing cutter wilkinson,u.it also seems clear that the communion wine ban is,in the most general sense,logically connected to its asserted goal restricting inmate wine consumption is a rational approach to preventing alcohol misuse and abuse.what is unclear,however,is whether the other turner prongs the availability of alternative means of exercising the right,the impact of accommodation,and the existence of alternatives support the conclusion that the wine ban is reasonable.
in the first amendment context,the availability of alternative means of practicing religion is a relevant consideration.holt.at see also,at analyzing an absolute ban on attending and addressing whether inmates retain the ability to participate in other muslim ceremonies emphasis added.although the ban at issue prohibits drinking wine at communion,it does not prevent inmates from engaging in other aspects of communion,nor does it affect other religious practices.it is noteworthy,however,that a previous version of the ban permitted inmates to consume wafers dipped in wine.that version,like the current one,allowed clergy to bring one fluid ounce of wine into the prison.neither version categorically prohibits alcohol on the premises.the only difference between the two policies is that inmates used to have an alternative means of consuming communion wine in a controlled environment,whereas now they are completely barred from participating in that practice.
regarding the impact of an accommodation on other inmates,guards,and prison resources,the record is largely silent.drawing reasonable inferences in jehovah favor,however,a reasonable jury could find that exempting jehovah from the ban would have a minimal impact on prison resources.wine is already permitted on the premises,and religious services take place in a controlled environment in which jehovah would be supervised.furthermore,a jury could find that the prison population would not be endangered by a single inmate with no history of alcohol abuse consuming a small amount of wine in this setting.
finally,jehovah has proposed several alternatives to the ban,including to apply the same security measures used for medication to wine,to allow jehovah an accommodation to drink wine,and to apply the ban only to inmates who have been convicted of infractions involving stealing or alcohol and inmates with a history of alcoholism.a reasonable jury could find that at least one of these alternatives is so obvious and easy as to suggest that the ban is an exaggerated response.turner,at.therefore,we reverse the district court summary dismissal of jehovah first amendment wine communion claim.
