francis hannon appeals from the district court final order dismissing his claims against jeffrey beard and maryjane hesse for lack of personal jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
hannon claims against beard and hesse are part of a,lawsuit filed in the district court for the district of massachusetts.hannon and his fellow plaintiffs,all prisoners in massachusetts,alleged various federal and state constitutional violations against numerous defendants,most of whom were officials in the massachusetts department of corrections doc.however,hannon,who was convicted in pennsylvania and has spent most of his prison time there,also included a claim against beard and hesse,who were officials in the pennsylvania doc during the time periods relevant to this action.
since his conviction and incarceration in pennsylvania,hannon has been the quintessential jailhouse lawyer,pursuing relief and filing numerous grievances and lawsuits on behalf of himself and other prisoners challenging their conditions of confinement.hannon estimates that he has represented thousands of his fellow inmates in proceedings.he alleges that the pennsylvania doc grew tired of his lawsuits and agitation and,in order to prevent him from filing more lawsuits and in retaliation for the actions he had already taken,began a strategy of transferring him to prisons.
transfers of state prisoners to prisons in other states are effected pursuant to the interstate corrections compact compact,which generally permits states to contract for one state incarceration of another state convicts in consideration for payment.pursuant to the compact,hannon was transferred in to a district of columbia prison and,in the first several months of,was transferred to another district of columbia prison,two different maryland prisons,and eventually back to pennsylvania.in december of,he was transferred from pennsylvania to massachusetts.hannon alleges that his legal materials disappeared during the transfer to massachusetts.
hannon asserts that the decision to transfer him to massachusetts was authorized and directed by beard,the secretary of the pennsylvania doc,in retaliation for hannon lawsuits against doc officers.though beard asserted that he has not been involved with hannon subsequent to the transfer,he did not deny involvement leading up to the transfer.
once in massachusetts,hannon sent a number of letters to hesse,a pennsylvania doc prison librarian,requesting legal materials.she responded several times,sometimes denying his requests and sometimes sending requested material either to him or to a prison librarian in massachusetts.at times,she sought legal counsel advice to determine whether she was required to send the requested materials.she states that every time she denied a request for material,it was because legal counsel had advised her that she was not required to supply hannon with it.
in,hannon filed a complaint against beard and hesse,as well as against numerous massachusetts prison officials,in the massachusetts district court.his claims against beard and hesse allege that they violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights and his rights under articles xi and xii of the massachusetts declaration of rights by transferring him between prisons,confiscating his legal materials,and refusing to provide him with requested legal materials.
in january,after he filed this action,hannon learned that he was to be transferred yet again.his emergency motion for a temporary restraining order enjoining the transfer was denied,and this was affirmed by us on appeal.he was transferred to new jersey.
beard and hesse filed a motion to dismiss,arguing,among other things,that the massachusetts district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.on june,the district court granted the motion and dismissed hannon claims against hesse and beard for lack of personal jurisdiction.the court reasoned that the statute did not reach hesse or beard because they did not transact business within massachusetts the decision to transfer plaintiff and confiscate legal materials all occurred in pennsylvania where the pennsylvania defendants reside.the district court concluded that a transfer pursuant to the compact does not alone constitute the transaction of business in massachusetts.because the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,it did not reach any of the other grounds for dismissal argued in beard and hesse motion to dismiss.several of hannon claims against other defendants,as well as other plaintiffs claims,survived motions to dismiss.final judgment on the dismissal of the claims against beard and hesse was entered pursuant to hannon rule b motion,and hannon timely appealed.
it is axiomatic that,t o hear a case,a court must have personal jurisdiction over the parties,that is,the power to require the parties to obey its decrees.daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson,poole,cir quoting united states swiss am.bank,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the court personal jurisdiction over a defendant.daynard,at.under the prima facie standard,which the district court applied,we accept the plaintiff properly documented evidentiary proffers as true,and construe those facts in the light most congenial to the plaintiff jurisdictional claim.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review the district court application of this standard de novo.id.
hannon has not alleged that beard or hesse has engaged in continuous and systematic activity in massachusetts so,in the absence of general jurisdiction,the court power will depend upon the existence of specific jurisdiction.see id.at.specific jurisdiction exists when there is a demonstrable nexus between a plaintiff claims and a defendant activities,such as when the litigation itself is founded directly on those activities.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.furthermore,to establish personal jurisdiction,hannon must show that the massachusetts statute grants jurisdiction and,if it does,that the exercise of jurisdiction under the statute is consistent with the constitution.daynard,at.
because we have construed the massachusetts statute to be coextensive with the limits allowed by the united states constitution,we often sidestep the statutory inquiry and proceed directly to the constitutional analysis.see id.however,hannon claim involves pennsylvania state officials exercise of their discretion,rather than a conventional contract or tort claim.it would be useful therefore to consider first,as the district court did,whether the massachusetts statute reaches beard as the secretary of the pennsylvania doc and hesse as a prison librarian for the pennsylvania doc.see stroman realty,wercinski,cir reasoning that,although a statute was coextensive with the limits of due process,the statute reach warranted consideration first because the case involved a challenge to a state official rather than a conventional contract or tort claim.
hannon assertion of personal jurisdiction under the statute is based on the portion of that statute providing that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person,who acts directly or by an agent,as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person transacting any business in this commonwealth.laws ch,a.that provision should be construed broadly,and does not require that the defendant have engaged in commercial activity.the language is general and applies to any purposeful acts by an individual,whether personal,private,or commercial.ealing harrods,cir internal quotation marks omitted.physical presence in massachusetts is not required in order to transact business in massachusetts.fairview mach.tool,oakbrook int l,d.for example,in hahn vermont law school,we held that a law school transacted business in massachusetts when,at plaintiff request,it mailed application information to him in massachusetts and later mailed him an offer of admission,cir.we reasoned that t he purposeful actions of vermont law school in mailing to plaintiff in massachusetts application information and an acceptance letter were sufficient,without more,to constitute transacting business under the broadly construed massachusetts statute.id.at.though the mailing of the application and offer of admission were not substantial contacts,we emphasized that less is required to support jurisdiction when the cause of action arises from the defendant contacts with the forum than when it does not.id.
to support jurisdiction in this case,hannon alleges that beard authorized,directed,effected his transfer from the pennsylvania doc to the massachusetts doc pursuant to the compact.the compact creates a agreement between the states,and outlines the specific procedures for transferring inmates.according to the terms of the compact,pennsylvania was required to send an application to massachusetts requesting to transfer hannon,arrange and pay for hannon transportation to a massachusetts institution,transfer funds owed to hannon to massachusetts,furnish documents and provide legal advice as necessary to massachusetts,and pay for hannon medical,psychiatric,and dental care or treatment in massachusetts,and authorize hannon security classification,among other things.massachusetts,in turn,was obligated to make regular reports to pennsylvania on hannon conduct.see.law ch.in sum,as hannon alleges,when beard arranged for the transfer between the pennsylvania doc and the massachusetts doc pursuant to an existing,contract between the two,he caused extensive services to be rendered in massachusetts,caused payment to be made in massachusetts,and procured the application of massachusetts law to hannon future conduct.
the contacts that beard would have had to make to arrange for hannon transfer from pennsylvania to massachusetts are sufficient to constitute transacting business under the statute.the district court erred when it reasoned that because t he decision to transfer plaintiff occurred in pennsylvania,it lacked jurisdiction over beard.a defendant need not have been physically present in the forum state in order to have transacted business there.see fairview,d at.just as mailing a letter and an offer of admission to massachusetts was transacting business in hahn,see at,so can actions arranging for the transfer of hannon to massachusetts,which necessarily involved at least some communication and interaction between beard in pennsylvania and his counterparts in massachusetts.
that beard actions were not commercial is not relevant,see ealing,at,nor is the fact that he was a state official.beard citation to the fifth circuit decision in stroman realty does not help him.that case was filed in texas and involved a challenge to an arizona government official enforcement of arizona law in arizona the action attacked the validity of that law.see stroman realty,at.by contrast,hannon does not challenge the laws that permit a transfer,but rather alleges that beard initiated the transfer in retaliation for and in order to hinder hannon exercise of constitutional rights.
beard cites no case that suggests that prison officials can not be subject to personal jurisdiction in a foreign state merely because they are state officials.certainly,there are constitutional limitations on a plaintiff ability to hale a prison official into another state,which we address shortly.under these circumstances,though,we hold that beard transacted business in massachusetts for purposes of the state statute,particularly because the contacts hannon alleges form the basis for hannon claim against beard.
hannon jurisdictional case for hesse is far less persuasive.hannon bases his argument on hesse responses to a number of written requests for legal materials that he sent to her from a massachusetts prison.at least twice hesse sent requested materials to a massachusetts prison librarian and so advised hannon,about six times she denied hannon requests after receiving advice from legal counsel that she was not obligated to send the materials,and three times she directly sent hannon the requested material.
these limited interactions do not constitute transacting business under the massachusetts statute.hesse did not initiate contact with hannon,and she did not purposefully direct any action toward massachusetts.she had nothing to do with hannon transfer there,and it was merely incidental that she sent replies to massachusetts because that was where he happened to have been transferred.our cases make clear that contacts with the forum state must be purposeful in order to constitute the transaction of business.see ealing,at.hesse responses to hannon letters were not purposeful contacts with massachusetts.we therefore hold that the district court did not err when it dismissed hannon claim against hesse for lack of personal jurisdiction because the massachusetts statute does not authorize personal jurisdiction over hesse.
having determined that the massachusetts statute permits jurisdiction over beard,we must decide whether asserting jurisdiction over him would comport with the requirements of due process.in the personal jurisdiction context,we have characterized compliance with the constitution as implicating three distinct components,namely,relatedness,purposeful availment sometimes called minimum contacts,and reasonableness.see.sch.of law,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the first step to achieving personal jurisdiction is that a claim must arise out of,or be related to,the defendant activities.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the relatedness standard is flexible and focuses on the nexus between the defendant contacts and the plaintiff cause of action.adelson hananel,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in typical tort claims,our inquiry is whether the plaintiff has established cause in fact,the injury would not have occurred but for the defendant activity and legal cause,the defendant conduct gave birth to the cause of action.sch.of law,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although hannon alleges a constitutional claim,section claims have been analogized to tort claims for personal jurisdiction analysis.see,stroman realty,at it also seems normally accurate to describe as torts suits against public officials for individual misconduct.
though the relatedness standard has been described as the least developed part of the due process standard,see,swiss am.bank,at,it seems clear that hannon claims against beard arise from beard voluntary contacts with massachusetts.hannon alleges that beard ordered him transferred among numerous facilities along the east coast,including massachusetts,in retaliation for his numerous lawsuits against the pennsylvania doc on behalf of himself and on behalf of other prisoners.beard contacts with massachusetts in arranging for hannon transfer are therefore directly related to hannon retaliation claim,which is based on the transfer itself.hannon alleged constitutional injury would not have occurred but for beard arrangement for his transfer.
that hannon was not a party to the compact or arrangements made between beard and massachusetts is not relevant to this relatedness analysis.though it was not argued in the briefs,beard counsel at oral argument stressed that,because hannon was not a party to the compact between pennsylvania and massachusetts,the compact and any arrangements made pursuant to it can not be used by hannon to assert jurisdiction over beard.indeed,article xxxii of the intergovernmental agreement for the implementation of the compact restricts any rights under the agreement to the state parties.however,beard provided no case law for the proposition that only a party to a contract can use the contract as a basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over another party to the contract,and we conclude that the proposition is unsound as applied to this situation.first,the relatedness requirement focuses on the nexus between the plaintiff claim and the defendant contacts with the forum state,not on the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant.see sawtelle farrell,cir.this suggests it does not matter that the compact was not between hannon and beard,but only that it established ties between beard and massachusetts,and that it formed the basis of hannon complaint.
