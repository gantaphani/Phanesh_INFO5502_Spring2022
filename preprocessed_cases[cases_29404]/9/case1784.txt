opinion of the court 
norman grayson,an inmate at various times of the three institutions named as defendants,brought this pro se damages action under,alleging the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.the district court granted grayson leave to proceed in forma pauperis,but denied his further request for appointed legal counsel.upon the defendants motions,the court dismissed grayson complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
although the court found that his claims had possible substantive merit if pled adequately,it did not provide leave to amend before dismissing the action.this was contrary to our court rule,established before congress enacted the prison litigation reform act plra that such leave must be granted when amendment could cure the deficiency and would not be inequitable.see dist.council bradley,cir darr wolfe,cir borelli city of reading,cir see also shane fauver,cir discussing law.
the primary question presented on appeal is whether a of the plra,codified at e,altered the legal landscape so that the district court did not need to grant leave to amend before dismissing grayson deficient in forma pauperis complaint.we addressed a similar provision of the plra in shane,a case.there we held that s d of the plra,codified in part at c,did not alter our rule that inadequate complaints should be dismissed without granting leave to amend only if amendment would be inequitable or futile.shane,at.however,we reserved the question of whether the nearly identical e should be interpreted differently.id.at.today we reach that question and hold that e requires the same response 
grayson complaint alleges that surgery was performed on his knee in early at the mayview state hospital to correct an injury he sustained playing basketball.while the complaint names the hospital,it does not allege that he received negligent or inadequate care there.later in,grayson was transferred to the allegheny county jail,where he claims his leg ropes were confiscated and his requests for medical assistance were refused.while incarcerated there,grayson knee injury worsened after a fall in a stairwell occasioned by a defective handrail,which fell out of the wall while he was handcuffed to another prisoner for transport to a court hearing.he claims that he requested medical assistance after the fall,but received none.grayson was later transferred to a third facility and eventually to the camp hill prison hill,where he alleges three or four weeks passed before he received treatment for his knee.grayson complaint does not name any individual defendants.it also fails to allege that any of the facilities where he was kept maintains a pattern or practice of denying medical assistance to inmates.
the defendants responded to grayson complaint by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the hospital and hill,both agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania,argued that the eleventh amendment barred grayson claims against them.the jail,an agency of allegheny county,argued that grayson failed to plead that it had a policy,practice,or custom of deliberate indifference toward prisoners requests for medical treatment.the district court referred the action to a magistrate judge,who recommended granting the motions to dismiss.in the course of these proceedings grayson filed a memorandum order that further explained the factual basis for his suit and identified allegedly responsible individuals.other than invoking the term deliberate indifference to describe the conduct of the defendants,the memorandum order was not responsive to the arguments made in the motions to dismiss.
the district court considered grayson memorandum order and the magistrate judge recommendation.in a brief statement,the court adopted the recommendation and dismissed grayson action without further comment.grayson appealed and our court appointed pro bono counsel 
before considering the effect of e on in forma pauperis complaints,we address whether grayson complaint should have been dismissed under law.
grayson does not dispute that his claims against the two commonwealth defendants,mayview state hospital and hill,were properly dismissed on eleventh amendment grounds under pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.rather,he contests only the dismissal of his claim against the allegheny county jail.grayson maintains that his memorandum order,submitted in response to the defendants motions to dismiss,contained sufficient factual statements to meet the pleading requirements of a short and plain statement of the claim.a.according to grayson,his allegations support a claim of deliberate indifference to his medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.see estelle gamble,d rouse plantier,cir monmouth county corr.inst.inmates lanzaro,cir.
were grayson claims made against an individual defendant,the contents of his complaint and memorandum order would adequately place that defendant on notice that he alleges deliberate indifference to his medical needs.but grayson is not suing any individual he seeks relief only from the jail.hence the stringent requirements for municipal liability apply grayson must allege that a policy or custom of the jail was the moving force behind a violation of his eighth amendment rights.see bd.of county comm rs of bryan county brown,d berg county of allegheny,cir.because grayson alleges a constitutional violation was committed by the jail employees,rather than by the jail itself,to satisfy the moving force requirement he must allege that the jail was deliberately indifferent to the possibility that such a violation would occur.bryan county,at.berg,at.
neither grayson complaint nor his memorandum order alleges that the jail had a policy of denying medical treatment to inmates.nor does he allege that other inmates suffered similar deprivations of medical attention that might establish a custom.see bielevicz dubinon,cir.lacking any indication from grayson filings of what policy or custom he seeks to challenge under,we can not say that the jail had fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d.
having determined that the district court correctly concluded that grayson filings were inadequate,we turn to the manner in which the court dismissed his action.under rule a,if a plaintiff requests leave to amend a complaint vulnerable to dismissal before a responsive pleading is filed,such leave must be granted in the absence of undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive,unfair prejudice,or futility of amendment.foman davis,d in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the first four of these reasons devolve to instances where permitting amendment would be inequitable thus amendment must be permitted in this context unless it would be inequitable or futile.of course,the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the district court,but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason,inequity or futility appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the federal rules.foman,at.
when a plaintiff does not seek leave to amend a deficient complaint after a defendant moves to dismiss it,the court must inform the plaintiff that he has leave to amend within a set period of time,unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.see shane,at internal quotation marks omitted see also dist.council,at darr,at borelli,at.indeed,we have never required plaintiffs to request leave to amend in this context.dist.council,at.
the district court did not follow these principles.before it dismissed the case,the court should inequity or futility of advised grayson that he could amend his complaint and given him a chance to do so.neither inequity nor futility of amendment is present.there is no suggestion that grayson lacks good faith or proper motives.as noted above,a properly amended complaint would state a claim upon which grayson could obtain relief,and none of the defendants suggests otherwise.
finally,we can not say that grayson receipt of the defendants motions to dismiss and the magistrate judge recommendation constitutes the functional equivalent of the procedure outlined in our cases.see,shane,at.the motions and recommendation apprised grayson of his pleadings deficiencies,but failed to inform him expressly that he could amend his complaint to fix the problem borelli,at.therefore,under our precedent,the district court erred.it should have told grayson that he had leave to amend his complaint to cure its deficiencies and granted him a set period of time in which to do so 
the defendants contend that e required the district court to dismiss grayson complaint without providing leave to amend.while the court did not rely on the plra,we can affirm on any ground supported by the record.hughes long,cir.
as amended by the plra,e states the following 
notwithstanding any filing fee,or any portion thereof,that may have been paid,the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that 
a the allegation of poverty is untrue or 
b the action or appeal 
i is frivolous or malicious 
ii fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted or 
iii seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.
while this provision is limited to in forma pauperis plaintiffs at least two other provisions of the plra contain similar dismissal requirements.for prisoners seeking relief from a governmental entity or its officer or employee,plra a,codified at,provides a screening process to separate cognizable claims from those lacking merit like e,the screening process of targets claims that are frivolous,malicious,or fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.similarly,pursuant to plra d,codified in part at c,prisoners challenging prison conditions will have their complaints dismissed for the same reasons.
because grayson is a prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis and challenging the conditions of his confinement,all three of these plra provisions could apply to his case.however,is not at issue because the district court did not implement a screening process.moreover,under shane c does not support the court failure to grant leave to amend.see at.therefore,to prevail the defendants must convince us to treat e differently from the similar provision,c,at issue in shane 
sections e and c apply to different though often overlapping sets of claimants,but the differences end there.section c,the provision at issue in shane,states that a district court 
shall on its own motion or on the motion of a party dismiss any action brought with respect to prison conditions by a prisoner if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous,malicious,fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.
c.we concluded in shane that c did not affect our requirement that,where a defendant moves to dismiss a deficient complaint,the court should grant leave to amend unless amendment would be inequitable or futile.shane,at.the most natural reading of e is no different.both provisions employ the same language,borrowed from rule b,to require that district courts shall dismiss complaints that fail to state a claim.
defendants suggest that the words shall dismiss in e should be read to require district courts to dismiss deficient complaints without granting leave to amend.we rejected an identical argument in shane.
we acknowledge that the words of the statute do not foreclose the following,more expansive reading if a complaint fails to state a claim for any reason,including a pleading error that could be cured by amendment,the court shall dismiss forthwith and without permitting a curative amendment.but we believe that this reading is more strained and would produce results that we doubt congress wanted.if shall dismiss were interpreted to mean shall dismiss forthwith and without permitting a curative amendment,it would seem that a court would be required to grant a motion to dismiss a technically defective claim even if a request for leave to amend to cure the defect were pending.we doubt that congress wanted to require such a harsh,and seemingly pointless,result.we are also hesitant to conclude that congress meant to change established procedures without a clearer indication than we have here.
id.at.we continue to subscribe to this reasoning.neither the provision at issue in shane,c,nor the in forma pauperis provision applicable here,e,says anything about when to permit amendment.thus,there is no reason to depart from our rule that plaintiffs whose complaints fail to state a cause of action are entitled to amend their complaint unless doing so would be inequitable or futile.
the great majority of other courts of appeals which have interpreted e concur with our interpretation.see lopez smith,cir en banc gomez usaa fed.sav.bank,cir perkins kansas of corrections,cir.the ninth circuit noted,as we do,that e says only that a court shall dismiss a complaint.it does not say that such a dismissal may be without leave to amend.lopez,at.similarly,both the second and tenth circuits found that the shall dismiss language of e did not modify district courts responsibility to grant leave to amend.gomez,at perkins,at the ninth and tenth circuits further observed that the statutory language of the three plra dismissal provisions mirrors that found in rule b.lopez,at perkins,at.thus,there is no reason that a district court should fail to retain its authority under that rule to permit plaintiffs leave to amend.
the defendants urge us to adopt the position of the sixth circuit,see benson,cir mcgore wrigglesworth,cir,and the dissent in lopez,see at sneed,dissenting we find these authorities unpersuasive.the sixth circuit reasoned that,because the plra authorizes sua sponte dismissals,it must also remove district courts discretion in permitting a plaintiff to amend a complaint to avoid a sua sponte dismissal.mcgore,at.but it failed to cite any authority explaining why sua sponte dismissals must be without leave to amend.section e does not require dismissal to proceed so immediately that leave to amend is foreclosed,and we will not read such a harsh result into the statute 
nor do we find the lopez dissent persuasive.at sneed,dissenting.it relied on a statement in neitzke williams,d,characterizing e predecessor,d.section d provided that a court may dismiss an in forma pauperis case if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.neitzke explained that complaints that fail to state a claim are not necessarily frivolous,and that the term applies to a more limited set of claims than rule b.at.the court proceeded to describe the interaction between rule b and d.
under rule b,a plaintiff with an arguable claim is ordinarily accorded notice of a pending motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and an opportunity to amend the complaint before the motion is ruled upon.these procedures alert him to the legal theory underlying the defendant challenge,and enable him meaningfully to respond by opposing the motion to dismiss on legal grounds or by clarifying his factual allegations so as to conform with the requirements of a valid legal cause of action by contrast,the sua sponte dismissals permitted by,and frequently employed under,d,necessary though they may sometimes be to shield defendants from vexatious lawsuits,involve no such procedural protections.
id.at.emphasis added.the lopez dissent insisted that,after neitzke,congress knew d afforded no procedural protections for frivolous complaints.therefore,the dissent claimed,by enacting e which contains language similar to d but adds that the district court shall dismiss not only frivolous complaints,but also those that fail to state a claim or seek relief from a defendant immune from intended that in forma pauperis complaints inadequate under any of these standards be immediately dismissed without leave to amend.lopez,at.
we are unconvinced by this argument because we believe it rests on an erroneous reading of both the old d and its current manifestation,e.neitzke did not describe d as involving no such procedural protections,as the lopez
