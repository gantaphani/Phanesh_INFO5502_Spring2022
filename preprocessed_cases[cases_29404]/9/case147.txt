michael dunn appeals the entry of summary judgment against him on his claim that his former employer,boston university bu,discharged him because of his age in violation of the massachusetts fair employment practices act.laws ch,b.the district court ruled that dunn had failed to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination.without ruling on the sufficiency of dunn prima facie showing we affirm.even assuming that dunn made that prima facie showing,he failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether bu stated reasons for discharging him,as part of a reorganization of its information technology department,were pretextual.
we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to dunn.see,ponte steelcase,cir.after receiving a bachelor degree in computer engineering,in,dunn worked for a year or so as a hardware support specialist before becoming a systems administrator and,later,the manager of the computer support center,for a massachusetts company with employees.in,dunn began working for bu,as a computer hardware repair technician.after several promotions,in the fall of,at age,dunn assumed the title of assistant director of distributed computing,a group within bu information services technology is t department.in this job,dunn supervised nine employees providing desktop computer services and support to faculty and staff.
earlier in,bu had hired tracy schroeder,age,as the vice president of is schroeder began making organizational changes,including the merger of the distributed computing group with another group within is t known as the it help center.the purpose of that change,schroeder explained,was to improve the efficiency of the department by bringing staff who were performing similar functions together in teams and to reduce the fragmentation of the department presentation to the client community,bu students,faculty,and staff.this merger resulted in the elimination of the distributed computing group,and the layoff of its director and dunn immediate supervisor,stephen rosman,who was years old at the time.
the merger also resulted in a title change for dunn,who became manager of field support for the it help center in october.dunn retained the same salary and benefits,but lost managerial responsibility over four employees,and viewed the title change as a demotion.within two months or so,however,those employees were to work under dunn after their supervisor quit.dunn reported to stacy gianoulis,age,a project director in the help center.
in february,as part of the continued restructuring of the is t department,dunn became manager of desktop support,while jill beckman,who was then around years old,became manager of desktop support.beckman,who holds an undergraduate degree in music synthesis a major she described as all about music and computers,had started working at bu in,before she completed college.she began as a technical consultant at university computers,a computer store,diagnosing and repairing hardware and software problems.in,beckman was promoted to the position of manager of technical services at the store,so that its technical consultants reported to her.during her time at university computers,beckman worked with different ticketing systems used to track service requests,contributing to the development of two such systems known as oompa and onehelp.
in april,gianoulis called dunn to apprise him of some further upcoming organizational changes,including that,due to overwork,the employee then serving as manager of the service desk would have her title changed to manager,accounts and student services and be relieved of her responsibilities over the service desk itself.gianoulis explained that this would open a new service desk manager position,but that he was really looking for a younger person in that role.dunn did not express any interest in the new position,which,as he testified at his deposition,offered a lesser grade and pay than the job he had at the time.ultimately,bu hired a year old for the service desk manager job.
a few weeks later,in early may,gianoulis submitted a written proposal to schroeder for reorganizing the desktop services group.in addition to dividing the responsibilities of the manager of the service desk,as just discussed,this proposal combined the responsibilities of the central support position held by beckman and the field support position held by dunn into a single new position,manager of the d esktop s ervices team.gianoulis explained that,while desktop services had initially been divided into the field support and central support teams,each with its own manager,as we worked through the merger a s these two groups become more integrated and with the adoption of onehelp as our ticketing system it is clear there needs to be one operational manager of the desktop services team to manage the day to day support activities.
gianoulis further proposed that the new manager of desktop services position be given to beckman,citing her history and performance of actively managing a support group and knowledge of service management systems,as well as her role in developing onehelp,the ticketing system.a job description for the manager of desktop services position awarded to beckman had been completed in october,but,contrary to written bu policy,was never posted in its job listings though gianoulis did discuss the written reorganization proposal with an employee in bu human resources department,who said she had no objections.nor did schroeder or gianoulis consider any candidates for the job besides beckman.
gianoulis also proposed that dunn who was years old at that point would be laid off.the restructuring of the desktop services group affected other older employees as well,though none adversely three employees in their received promotions,while a and a year old retained their jobs.schroeder approved gianoulis proposal and,on may,gianoulis informed dunn that his job was being eliminated due to restructuring.
at his deposition in this case,gianoulis testified that dunn was never considered for the manager of desktop services position because beckman was already doing the role in her prior job as manager of desktop support.gianoulis explained that,during beckman time in that job,she provided desktop support to students,staff and faculty in a high volume environment.dunn role as field support manager,gianoulis recalled,was more limited,only supporting a select group of administrative staff and doing a lot of vendor negotiation,as well as business applications support for the select group of clients that he supported.gianoulis added that dunn had told him specifically that he was interested in desktop support,he was interested in windows system management,which he considered his area of expertise.
in november,dunn filed a charge of discrimination against bu with the massachusetts commission against discrimination.he subsequently withdrew the charge and brought suit against bu in massachusetts superior court,claiming age discrimination in violation of both the federal age discrimination in employment act,et,and its analog.laws ch,bu removed the case to the district court,invoking its federal question jurisdiction.
in due course,bu filed a motion for summary judgment,see,arguing that dunn could not establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under either federal or state law and that,in any event,bu had legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for laying off dunn,who lacked evidence that those reasons were pretextual.dunn first response to bu summary judgment motion was a motion seeking voluntary dismissal of his adea claim with prejudice,see.a,and for the district court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining age discrimination claim,see c relief which,if granted,would have resulted in remand of the case to the superior court.as the basis for this motion,dunn stated that the standard on summary judgment for discrimination claims arising under federal law is significantly less liberal than the standard on summary judgment for discrimination claims arising under state law.in a decision that dunn has not questioned on appeal,the district court dismissed the adea claim,but refused to remand the chapter claim to state court,declaring that such forum shopping is clearly improper.dunn trs.of boston,wl,at.
after dunn filed his opposition to bu summary judgment motion,the district court heard oral argument on it and,as noted at the outset,granted the motion,ruling that dunn had not made out a prima facie case that he was laid off because of his age.id.at.as a result,the district court did not reach bu alternative argument that,even if dunn could establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,he could not demonstrate a genuine issue as to whether bu stated reasons for laying him off were pretextual.this appeal followed.
summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.a dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the party.a fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.patco constr.people united bank,cir quotation marks omitted.

generally,a plaintiff who is terminated from his position establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by producing evidence that he is a member of a class protected by.laws ch.he performed his job at an acceptable level he was terminated and his employer sought to fill his position by hiring another individual with qualifications similar to his.sullivan liberty mut.ins.as the supreme judicial court has explained,however,the fourth element is nonsensical in a reduction in force case the plaintiff is not replaced,nor does his employer seek to fill the position,for the very purpose of a workforce reorganization is generally to reduce the number of employees.id.
in sullivan,then,the supreme judicial court consider ed how the fourth element of a prima facie case must be varied so that a plaintiff who is laid off during a reduction in force may establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination,holding that a plaintiff does so by producing some evidence that his layoff occurred in circumstances that would raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.id.at see also woodward emulex,cir explaining that w here the employer does not replace the plaintiff with a new employee some evidence that the employee layoff occurred under circumstances that would raise a reasonable inference of discrimination is necessary to establish the fourth prong of a prima facie age discrimination case under massachusetts law.
applying sullivan,the district court ruled that dunn had failed to produce any such evidence.dunn challenges this ruling on two principal grounds.first,he argues that the transfer of his responsibilities to the younger beckman sufficed,in and of itself,to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination,regardless of the additional circumstances of his layoff.that is incorrect,as we explain below.second,dunn argues that the circumstances of his layoff demonstrated a reasonable inference of age discrimination in that a schroeder and gianoulis deviated from the standard application of university hiring policies and procedures in giving beckman the manager of desktop services job,b dunn qualifications for that position were superior to those of beckman,and c gianoulis stated to dunn,in april,that gianoulis was really looking for a younger person for a different job,that of service desk manager.as discussed infra,we conclude that,even if these facts suffice to make out a prima facie case under.laws ch,b,they fail to create a genuine issue as to whether bu stated reasons for laying dunn off were pretexts for age discrimination.
dunn argues that t he mere fact that an year difference existed between dunn and beckman should be sufficient for dunn to establish a prima facie case.in sullivan,however,the supreme judicial court specifically declined to follow decisions holding that a plaintiff challenging his layoff can establish the fourth element of a prima facie case of discrimination by showing,in an age discrimination claim,that an employee at least five years younger than him was retained.at quotation marks omitted.the supreme judicial court rejected that formulation,as such evidence is insufficient to establish a legally mandatory,rebuttable presumption of unlawful discrimination.id.quotation marks omitted.
emphasizing that his entire job was given to beckman,dunn argues that he made out a prima facie case on the theory that the employer retained unprotected or younger workers in the same position.it is true that,in sullivan,the court acknowledged that,in some reduction in force cases,the fact that an employer retained in the plaintiff same position an employee outside the plaintiff protected class may indeed be sufficiently probative to allow a factfinder to believe that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.id.at.in a case that sullivan called a satisfactory model for massachusetts law,id.at,this court has endorsed the same view as a matter of federal employment law.see currier united techs,cir.
what dunn fails to acknowledge,however,is that this court has also in another case cited approvingly in sullivan,at expressly rejected the argument that an employer delegation of duties to other individuals not in the plaintiff protected class amount s to retaining individuals in the same position so as to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under either federal or massachusetts law.lewis city of boston,cir.as this court explained,m erely demonstrating that,as a result of the reduction in force,the employer consolidated positions or allocated duties of discharged employees to other existing employees does not itself raise a reasonable inference that the employer harbored discriminatory animus toward any one employee.id.here,then,the fact that bu reorganized the desktop services group by consolidating the field and central support manager jobs into a single position,and awarding that position to an employee less than years old instead of to dunn,does not raise a reasonable inference that the basis for that decision was dunn age any more than it would suggest,since beckman is a woman and dunn is not,that the basis for that decision was dunn sex.
despite dunn suggestion to the contrary,it makes no difference that,while his position was eliminated in the reorganization,the functions that dunn performed were not.indeed,by definition,a accomplished by consolidating positions and reallocating duties results in the elimination of one or more positions,rather than in the elimination of their functions.again,this court held in lewis that an employee must come forward with something more then evidence of the inevitable transfer of his or her responsibilities to existing employees to make out a prima facie case of a discriminatory layoff.see id.
dunn maintains that such a transfer demonstrates the continuing need for the work that the employee was performing prior to his termination a fact which,he says,this court deemed sufficient to make out a prima facie case of discrimination in its decisions in rodriguez torres caribbean forms mfr,cir and hidalgo overseas condado ins.agencies,cir.dunn reliance on those cases is misplaced.in relevant part,they recognize simply that an employer continuing need for the plaintiff services can establish the fourth element of a prima facie case of discriminatory termination,that he or she was replaced,even if the employer does not in fact hire a replacement.see rodriguez torres,at hidalgo,at.
as already noted,though,the requirement that a plaintiff prove his replacement as part of his prima facie showing of discriminatory termination is nonsensi
