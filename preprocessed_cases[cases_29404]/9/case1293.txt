nomura securities international,frank zayas,and anton appel collectively nomura appeal,and darnel wilson wilson,from orders entered by judge sweet.the subjects of the appeal and concern wilson application for attorney fees after his acceptance of a rule offer of judgment offer.
the offer covered wilson claims of racial discrimination under federal,state and local,title vii,section,the new york state human rights law,and the new york city human rights law.the various substantive claims were factually and legally identical for present purposes,and the legal work performed by wilson counsel was therefore indivisibly related to all claims.
we affirm the district court rulings that wilson may not recover attorney fees under title vii above and beyond those contained in the offer,see k,and that wilson is not entitled to recover attorney fees under title vii mixed motive exception,see g b,because he had not proven,nor had the district court found,that the defendants had acted with a mixed motive.
the primary issue,however,is whether the district court erred in granting wilson an award of attorney fees for his new york city human rights law claim even though the offer,which wilson accepted,covered all rights to attorney fees for work on his title vii claim.because all of wilson claims were inextricably intertwined and the legal work on them was essentially indivisible,we hold that acceptance of the offer settled all of wilson rights to attorney fees.
background 
on february,wilson filed charges against nomura with the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc charge.these charges alleged racial and religious discrimination.after the eeoc issued wilson a right to sue letter,he filed the present complaint claiming racial discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.title vii the civil rights act of,as amended,section the new york state executive law et.new york state human rights law and the administrative code of the city of new york et.new york city human rights law or nychrl.

discussion 
on appeal,nomura argues that the district court allowed wilson to recover attorney fees through the offer,which included fees for the title vii claim,and a second time by awarding fees on the nychrl claim.nomura argues that any additional award of attorney fees should be limited to the legal work done solely in connection with the nychrl claim,which the parties agree was coextensive with and indivisible from the title vii work.wilson seeks to recover fees associated with his title vii claim under the mixed motive provision of the statute,to have the district court ruling reducing the requested attorney fees reversed,and to recover fees with respect to opposing nomura motion for reconsideration and this appeal.

a recovery of attorney fees on title vii and nychrl claims 
title vii fees 
we agree with the district court that acceptance of the offer fully settled wilson title vii claim,including any right to attorney fees.provides that a t any time more than days before the trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.as used in rule,the term costs refers to all costs awardable under the statute or other authority that is the basis for the underlying claim.marek chesny,d.where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,therefore,such fees are costs for purposes of rule.id.
nomura offer to wilson included all costs available under all local,state or federal statutes accrued to date.ja at.because title vii expressly includes attorney fees in its definition of costs,wilson acceptance of the offer settled his claim for damages and his right to attorney fees under title vii.see k t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee including expert fees as part of the costs.lyte sara lee,cir.
wilson argues that he is entitled to attorney fees beyond those included in the offer based on a amendment to title vii,g b.that section provides 
on a claim in which an individual proves a violation under m of this title and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,the court i may grant declaratory relief,injunctive relief,except as provided in clause ii,and attorney fees and costs demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a claim under m of this title and ii shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,reinstatement,hiring,promotion,or payment,described in subparagraph a.
section g b was added to title vii specifically to address the situation in which the plaintiff does not receive a damages award at trial but nonetheless serves a public purpose by prov ing that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent.gudenkauf stauffer communications,cir.however,unlike in gudenkauf,where the plaintiff prevailed before a jury on a discrimination claim,in this case,there has been no factual determination of an improper motive with respect to wilson claims of discrimination.furthermore,the offer included an award for damages,placing him outside the class of plaintiffs protected by the statute,those who prov e a discriminatory intent but are not awarded damages because the defendant prevailed on its mixed motive defense.id.therefore,the offer compensated wilson for any and all rights to attorney fees with respect to his title vi
