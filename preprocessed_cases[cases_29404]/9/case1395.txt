the subject matter of this appeal involves the payment by appellant,who is incarcerated,of out of his weekly income of to defray the costs of unsuccessful litigation against prison officials arising from a prison altercation with a fellow inmate.despite the small amount of money involved,the appeal presents important issues for us to resolve.congress,in recent amendments to the in forma pauperis statute,aimed to reduce the volume of meritless litigation flooding federal courts by making payment of filing fees mandatory.this statute also provides a mandatory mechanism for collecting costs when assessed by courts against prisoners who are made to pay the consequences should they lose.but when,as here,a prisoner has only a small amount of disposable income available,any judgment for costs looms large since,without a little money,a prisoner is powerless to satisfy his barest wants.
recognizing this practical consideration,congress decreed that mandated deductions taken from a prisoner account for costs be limited to percent of the prisoner weekly earnings.but,when appellant was taxed in the district court for deposition costs and in the court of appeals for printing costs,defendants treated each judgment as a separate item and levied percent for each,amounting to a total deduction of percent.we think this manner of deduction violates the statute,and that defendants may recover only percent of appellant weekly earnings toward the total amount owed.this result fairly construes the statutory limit because a heavier deduction might otherwise deprive appellant of his right of effective access to the courts,as well as of his last farthing.
john whitfield plaintiff or appellant,an inmate in the custody of the new york department of correctional services department,appeals an order entered october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before judge denny chin.the order concludes that taxing litigation costs against plaintiff,payable to defendants former superintendent charles scully,deputy superintendent gail haponik,and correctional officers jack tornabene and craig mitchell,is appropriate.whitfield contends on appeal that it was an abuse of discretion to authorize the taxation of costs against him,for the reason that such authorization did not comply with the applicable rules of procedure or take into proper equitable account the meager income he earns per week while incarcerated.appellant further argues that the department recoupment of percent of that weekly income for repayment of the taxable costs violates the cost collection provisions of the in forma pauperis statute,supp.iv.
background 
on may,whitfield,an inmate at green haven correctional facility,filed this suit pro se,pursuant to,in the southern district of new york.in his complaint plaintiff alleged that defendants scully,haponik,tornabene,and mitchell violated his eighth amendment rights by failing to protect him from another prison inmate and,at a disciplinary hearing arising from an earlier altercation with that inmate,violated his due process rights.plaintiff was granted permission to proceed in the litigation in forma pauperis.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed whitfield complaint.see whitfield scully,civ,wl.whitfield motion to reargue was denied.see whitefield scully,civ,wl may.we affirmed.see whitfield scully,wl,at cir,summary order.
on february,the clerk of court for the second circuit,as requested in the bill of costs submitted by defendants,entered a judgment taxing in printing costs against whitfield for appellate briefs and appendices.whitfield promptly filed objections to this award of costs.on april,our mandate,silent as to costs,issued to the district court.on may,a deputy clerk in the southern district of new york entered a judgment taxing against whitfield as requested by defendants under local civil rule to defray the stenographic charges incurred while deposing whitfield.at the same time,the deputy clerk left blank the space on the entry sheet that would have provided for the taxation of costs had they been included in the circuit mandate.
acting according to its standard operating procedures,the new york state department of correctional services treated the district court deposition taxation of and the appellate printing taxation of as separate judgments,and began recouping payments from whitfield prison account to satisfy those judgments.pursuant to those procedures,the department recoups percent of all incoming receipts to be credited toward each outstanding judgment on a monthly basis,unless the account balance drops below ten dollars,in which case no collection is made until the balance again exceeds ten dollars.at the same time,under department policy,no more than two encumbrances are collected at a given time therefore,even if additional judgments or fees were outstanding,the total rate of recoupment would never exceed percent.thus,the department currently collects a total of percent or of whitfield total weekly earnings of,and at this rate not accounting for outside gifts or for time taken off from work whitfield can expect to repay the district court deposition costs in slightly more than seven years and the larger appellate printing costs in a little less than nine years.
on august,whitfield moved in the district court for review of the district clerk taxation of costs.in his affidavit in support of the motion,plaintiff noted that his claims on the merits of the action had not been frivolous and had been filed in good faith.he also contended that the taxation imposed an undue hardship on his ability to purchase necessary commissary items such as shampoo or stamps to send mail to his family,and to contribute to the naacp and certain prison organizations that he supports.in sum,he maintained that such taxation of costs created deterrent effects that impinged on his right of access to the courts and contradicted the spirit of the in forma pauperis statute.
in an order dated october,the district court denied whitfield motion for review,reasoning simply that the taxation of costs was appropriate.whitfield scully,civ,slip op.at,citing glucover bottling,civ,wl,at.meanwhile,whitfield february objections to appellate printing costs were referred to the merits panel that had affirmed summary judgment,and were deemed by that panel to be a motion to disallow those costs.whitfield objections were denied in an unpublished order.see whitfield scully,cir.
whitfield filed a notice of appeal from the district court denial of his challenge to the costs imposed,and we appointed counsel to represent him.that appeal is now before us.

ii taxation of costs 
deposition costs in the district court 
rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure generally governs the taxation of costs against an unsuccessful litigant in federal district court.
costs other than attorneys fees.except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the united states or in these rules,costs other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs such costs may be taxed by the clerk on one day notice.on motion served within days thereafter,the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.
construing this provision,the supreme court has held that the term costs includes only the specific items enumerated in.crawford fitting gibbons,d accord united states ex rel.evergreen pipeline constr.merritt meridian constr,cir.that statute provides,in pertinent part 
a judge or clerk of any court of the united states may tax as costs the following 
fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case 
fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses and 
fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case.
a bill of costs shall be filed in the case and,upon allowance,included in the judgment or decree.
the courts of appeals have consistently interpreted this statute to permit the taxation of deposition expenses,when necessarily incurred for use of the deposition in the case.see,in re baby food antitrust,cir.see generally james moore et,moore federal practice c i,at ed collecting circuit cases.
in addition,because rule d allows costs as of course,such an award against the losing party is the normal rule obtaining in civil litigation,not an exception.mercy county of suffolk,cir.for this reason,the losing party has the burden to show that costs should not be imposed for example,costs may be denied because of misconduct by the prevailing party,the public importance of the case,the difficulty of the issues,or the losing party limited financial resources.see ass of mexican am.educators california,cir en banc cantrell int l of workers,cir en banc.as a general matter a district court may deny costs on account of a losing party indigency,but indigency per se does not automatically preclude an award of costs.see mcgill faulkner,cir.in light of the general rule,when a prevailing party is denied costs,a district court must articulate its reasons for doing so.see cantrell,at.
on appeal,whitfield challenges the district court decision to tax deposition costs on the grounds that it failed not only to comply with local civil rule but also to take equitable account of his indigency.
local civil rule 
local civil rule permits district judges in the southern district of new york to tax deposition costs,in pertinent part,as follows 
unless otherwise ordered by the court,the original transcript of a deposition,plus one copy,is taxable if the deposition was used or received in evidence at the trial,whether or not it was read in its entirety.costs for depositions are also taxable if they were used by the court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment or other dispositive substantive motion.costs for depositions taken solely for discovery are not taxable.
local civ.c,reprinted in second circuit redbook,at vincent alexander,emphasis added.
whitfield maintains that his deposition was not taxable because even though defendants submitted the transcript as an attachment to their summary judgment papers,the district court did not cite to it in the written decision granting summary judgment for defendants and therefore did not use the deposition in the sense contemplated by local civil rule.we can not adopt the construction appellant urges.
to begin with,district courts have authority to enact local rules governing the conduct of the business before them,and such local rules have the force of law.see weil neary.somlyo,cir.we accord considerable deference to the district court interpretation of its own local rule.see losacco city of middletown,cir.the plain language of the rule first sentence,providing that depositions are taxable if used or received in evidence at the trial emphasis added,suggests that the word use extends well beyond explicit reliance on the deposition as a basis for decision.in addition,the second and third sentences,allowing taxation if the deposition was used by the court in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment but not if taken solely for discovery,further suggest an dichotomy between depositions submitted in conjunction with a motion for summary judgment,on the one hand,and purely investigative depositions never actually submitted to the court for its use,on the other.
whitfield protests that such a broad reading would invite abuse insofar as prevailing parties could render a deposition taxable simply by appending it to a motion for summary judgment,regardless of its pertinence to the litigation.yet the filing of a deposition transcript necessarily means a court will use it,since summary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c emphases added see also lennon miller,cir.c provides for a review of the entire record.
even more to the point,however,is the fact that the discretion to tax such a deposition is still limited by,which allows taxation of costs only when the deposition was necessarily obtained for use in the case emphasis added.see merritt meridian constr,at no abuse of discretion where district court limited taxation of photocopying costs,given that prevailing party failed to itemize costs or to explain why additional copies were necessary under see also a court rules must be consistent with federal statutes.a same somlyo,at same.
our decision on which whitfield relies most heavily supports this result.see harris twentieth film,cir.in harris,we affirmed the district court exercise of its discretion refusing to tax certain depositions not cited in its opinion granting summary judgment,where nothing elsewhere in the record indicate d that the contents of those depositions were in any way needed in connection with the motion for summary judgment,or in any manner affected the decision of the district court.id.at.
but harris did not purport to interpret local rule,nor to hold that depositions not cited in a district court ruling are not taxable.rather,harris looked to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,which confirmed the district court discretion as to stenographers fees where the evidence is taken in court.id.at.harris then reasoned that in light of rule a,a fortiori,the court has such discretion as to such fees in connection with depositions.id.we found no abuse of discretion,ruling that t he trial court is better acquainted with the proceedings than we can be.id.by emphasizing the district court discretion to deny such deposition costs,harris implicitly recognized the discretion to award costs as well,even though nothing in the record suggested the depositions were even needed.but harris did reverse the district court to the extent that its discretion was constrained by a federal statute imposing minor,mandatory costs for depositions admitted into evidence.see id.citing then.
in sum,we hold that the district court used whitfield deposition under local civil rule and,therefore,did not abuse its discretion in taxing the costs of the deposition.a district court that rules on a motion for summary judgment must use a filed deposition transcript to determine whether there is any genuine issue as to any material fact.such use provides a sufficient basis for the district court to tax costs on whitfield,as long as the taxation of costs satisfies the relevant statutory limits such as.because whitfield does not maintain that the district court contravened those statutory limits,and because the trial court is in a better position than we are to assess the extent to which it used the instant deposition in ruling on defendants summary judgment motion,the taxation of deposition costs may not be said to be an abuse of discretion.
to the extent whitfield contends the district court failed to take proper account of his indigency,his rights and obligations are governed by the federal in forma pauperis statute.feliciano selsky,cir.as we recently explained,federal courts have long enjoyed authority to waive the payment of fees or security at the commencement of a civil suit by a plaintiff who demonstrates his inability to pay.see id.at.in,however,congress amended relative to suits by prisoners who seek the benefits of the in forma pauperis provision.id.citing the prison litigation reform act of,title viii of the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat.
pursuant to a as amended,a district court may authorize a prisoner to bring a civil action in forma pauperis,upon the prisoner submission of an affidavit stating his assets and the nature of the action,as well as a certified copy of a prison account statement for the previous six months.see a.section b provides that the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee,and mandates collection,when funds exist,of an initial partial filing fee equal to percent of the average monthly balances or deposits whichever is greater as shown on the prison account statement.id.b.subsequent to this initial partial payment,the prisoner must make monthly payments equal to percent of the income credited to his prison account in the preceding month,so long as the account balance is greater than ten dollars,until the fee has been paid in full.see id.b.
in addition,f governs the taxation and collection of costs against such a litigant as follows 
judgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit or action as in other proceedings 
a if the judgment against a prisoner includes the payment of costs under this subsection,the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of the costs ordered.
b the prisoner shall be required to make payments for costs under this subsection in the same manner as is provided for filing fees under subsection a.
c in no event shall the costs collected exceed the amount of the costs ordered by the court.
id.f.although the statute refers to a for the manner of payment,we have recognized that this reference is a typographical error as it makes the statute unintelligible and that the actual process for payment of costs is instead described in b.see feliciano,at.
in this context,whitfield insists the district court abused its discretion by failing to reduce or eliminate the award of costs on account of his limited financial means,particularly in light of his good faith and the fact that his suit was not dismissed as frivolous.but good faith and the absence of frivolous claims,by themselves,do not require a district court to deny costs,let alone require an appellate court to vacate a district court award of costs.see aerotech,estes,cir finding that a denial of costs is not warranted simply because a lawsuit was not brought in bad faith,since a ll parties to a federal action have an obligation to act in good faith and with proper purpose.see generally james moore et,moore federal practice b,at ed collecting circuit decisions.there is also widespread agreement among the courts of appeals that indigency per se does not preclude an award of costs against an unsuccessful litigant,see feliciano,at,unless the united states is a party to the proceeding,see maida callahan,cir per curiam.
moreover,although district courts retain discretion to limit or deny costs based on indigency,see mcgill,at,the amendments to have undercut the ability of prisoners to appeal an award of costs on the ground of indigency.indeed,f a as amended clearly states that i f the judgment against a prisoner includes the payment of costs under this subsection,the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of the costs ordered emphases added.as the sixth circuit explained 
when judgment is entered against a prisoner and costs against the prisoner are assessed,f a now requires that the prisoner pay the costs either in full,or in accordance with the payment process set forth in b.the prisoner ability to pay the costs is no longer an issue 
because a prisoner can no longer challenge the assessment of fees from the district court on the grounds that the prisoner is unable to pay the assessment,if a court chooses to tax a prisoner costs,the prisoner is required to pay the assessment in full.
knebl,cir citations omitted accord feliciano,at.accordingly,f a restricts our authority to modify a district court discretionary award of costs against a prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis on the ground that the prisoner is unable to pay.
whitfield complains that this result is inconsistent with our earlier decision in in re epps,cir.in epps,we issued a writ of mandamus directing the district court to reduce an indigent prisoner filing fee from to,in light of the supreme court admonition that t he discretion conferred on district judges by section be exercised so as not to deprive litigants of the last dollar they have.id.at quoting adkins dupont de nemours.but filing fees are conceptually distinct from costs.filing fees are collected by the court at the outset of litigation even from plaintiffs who will ultimately prevail,whereas costs are awarded only at the end of litigation as a matter of equity to the prevailing party.moreover,even if epps could be read to establish our statutory authority to limit a district court discretion in setting costs by reference to a litigant indigency,that authority has been reduced by congress subsequent enactment of f a,as explained above.
in his pro se appellate brief,whitfield further protests that as applied by the trial court to the facts of his case impinges on his constitutional right of access to the courts by unduly deterring him from filing civil actions in the future because of the threat that similar,additional costs could be imposed.we find no merit in this challenge.requiring prisoners to make economic decisions about filing lawsuits does not deny access to the courts it merely places the indigent prisoner in a position similar to that faced by those whose basic costs of living are not paid by the state.nicholas tucker,cir quoting roller gunn,cir rejecting similar challenge to mandatory filing fee provision in b.
again,it was not an abuse of the district court discretion to tax in deposition costs against whitfield,despite his claim of indigency.
costs on appeal 
whitfield also appeals the taxation of in appellate printing costs by the circuit clerk on the ground that defendants waived these costs by failing to request that the district clerk include them in the final judgment.
rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure governs the taxation of appellate costs.that rule states that if a judgment is affirmed,costs of the appeal are taxed against the appellant,unless the law provides or the court orders otherwise.fed.a.the rule also expressly permits taxation of the cost of producing necessary copies of a brief or appendix,fed.c,and outlines the procedures to be followed by a party seeking to have appellate costs taxed,see fed.d e.under rule d,a party seeking to have appellate costs taxed must file an itemized bill of costs with the circuit clerk within days after entry of judgment.fed.d.any objections,in turn,must be filed within days after service of the bill of costs.fed.d.upon the circuit clerk approval of the bill of costs,rule d contemplates that any costs so approved will be incorporated by the circuit clerk into that court mandate and then by the district clerk into the final judgment 
the circuit clerk must prepare and certify an itemized statement of costs for insertion in the mandate,but issuance of the mandate must not be delayed for taxing costs.if the mandate issues before costs are finally determined,the district clerk the circuit clerk the statement of costs,or any amendment of it,to the mandate.
in the southern district of new york,local civil rule requires any party seeking to recover costs to file with the district clerk a request to tax costs w ithin thirty days after the entry of final judgment,or,in the case of an appeal by any party,within thirty days after the final disposition of the appeal,unless this period is extended by the court for good cause shown.local civ.a,reprinted in second circuit redbook,at vincent alexander.the rule further provides that a ny party failing to file a request to tax costs within this thirty day period will be deemed to have waived costs.id.
in the present litigation,the circuit clerk did not include the appellate printing costs in this court mandate of april,presumably because whitfield had filed objections to those costs in february,so that the appellate printing costs were not finally determined until the motions panel rejected appellant objections in december.thus,whitfield waiver argument must fail,since,even assuming arguendo that defendants had a duty under local civil rule to request that these costs be included in the judgment entered on may,defendants failure to do so was excusable because
