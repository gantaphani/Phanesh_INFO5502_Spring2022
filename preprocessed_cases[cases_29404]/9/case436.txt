kathleen sued her employer,merck sharp dhome and mónica díaz,human resources director for,for discrimination based on sex,national origin,and disability,and for violation of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra and various state statutes.torres appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of and díaz on all claims.after careful consideration,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background 
torres worked for from march,until she was terminated on october.she worked as a sales representative at from until,at which time she was transferred to merck sharp dhome de mexico de on a temporary assignment.at all times during her employment at,torres remained the employee of,was paid by in currency and maintained her employee benefits as a employee abroad.before her transfer to,torres work performance was satisfactory,even exemplary.both and are subsidiaries of merck company merck.
alleged harassment and discrimination at 
torres alleges that from her first day at work in mexico,she endured continuous harassment and discrimination.she claims that her colleagues at made negative and harassing comments about her gender,her citizenship,her salary,and her puerto rican accent.in,torres was reassigned within to ricardo spinola business unit.torres claims that things became worse for her under spinola supervision because of his derogatory comments about her being a puerto rican woman.when torres complained to spinola that he was harassing her and threatened to report him to merck headquarters in new jersey,he allegedly warned her that if she did so,she would face the consequences.torres claims that as a result of this harassment,she began suffering headaches,hypertension,and anxiety.
throughout her tenure in mexico,torres had constant contact with.three times a year,she participated in meetings that included representatives from,and in august,torres spent a week in offices on a temporary assignment to assist in relaunching a product.torres never complained about her work environment in during these visits.
employee misconduct 
merck,parent company,has a corporate business ethics policy applicable to all its subsidiaries.the policy specifically states that a cceptance of a merck executive or management position at any level includes acceptance of responsibility to uphold the company policies governing ethical business practices.it provides that 
c orporate conduct is inseparable from the conduct of individual employees in the performance of their work.every merck employee is responsible for adhering to business practices that are in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the applicable laws and with the ethical principles that reflect the highest standards of corporate and individual behavior.since only such behavior is consistent with merck traditions,and since such behavior is essential to the success of its business endeavors,the company will not accept anything less.like integrity of product,integrity of performance is a merck standard whenever we do business,and ignorance of the standard is never an acceptable excuse for improper behavior.
in addition,the business ethics policy specifically requires that a ll transactions be accurately reflected in the company books and records to permit their audit and control.managers at all levels are responsible for the completeness of the document and for ensuring that funds are spent for the described purposes.the policy also counsels that e mployees who may be undecided about whether contemplated actions are within the limits of legality or propriety should seek guidance from the office of ethics or the legal department before actions are taken.provided torres with a copy of this policy on a yearly basis.
toward the end of august,the human resources director for,gerardo gonzáles,alerted jimmy angueira,senior director in charge of latin america human health at merck,that torres had been misusing company resources by shipping personal packages using corporate courier account.in turn,angueira forwarded mónica díaz,human resources director for,an email from gonzáles detailing the problem 
kathy torres has been misusing companies sic resources,making dhl personal shipments with charge to msd.as per a preliminary report from finance,these shipments have been happening for more than a year,there are more than fifteen shipments totaling dollars.since she is a product manager,she has a grant to use this service for business related issues,but neither dhl nor msd hold evidence that she paid with her own money these shipments.
following up on this information,díaz spoke directly with gonzáles regarding torres use of the corporate courier account.on october,gonzáles met with torres to discuss the shipments at issue.torres admitted that thirteen out of nineteen shipments she had sent using the corporate courier account were for personal purposes.on october,torres sent gonzáles an email detailing the personal shipments she had made and explaining that due to a personal omission she had not given the matter the required and not made payment for the same within a reasonable time.torres subsequently paid for her use of the courier service to ship personal packages.gonzáles forwarded torres email admitting the use of corporate resources for personal reasons to díaz and angueira merck,and advised them of the conversation he had with torres.
after receiving this information,díaz,angueira merck,and césar simich,managing director for,discussed the matter and decided to recommend the termination of torres employment.the recommendation was approved by grey warner,senior vice president for latin america human health at merck.gonzáles informed torres of the termination decision in mexico on october.pursuant to merck company procedures,torres relocation to puerto rico was handled by the merck.internal assignment division.
torres claims that after being terminated,did not pay her last paycheck,did not issue her form,did not pay the state and federal taxes that were withheld from her salary,and did not properly notify her of her right to continued medical coverage as required by cobra.
ii.procedural background 
torres filed suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on december,against spinola,díaz,and gonzález claiming discrimination based on nationality and gender,and retaliation under title vii discrimination under the americans with disabilities act ada violation of the cobra and violation of various state statutes.
on june,the district court dismissed all of torres claims against spinola and gonzález,and torres federal claims against díaz.on september,díaz and filed a motion for summary judgment as to torres remaining claims against them.on december,the court entered summary judgment in favor of díaz and,dismissing all of torres federal claims with prejudice and her local claims without prejudice.
iii.standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we review a district court order granting summary judgment de novo,looking at the record in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.see rodríguez smithkline beecham,cir.nevertheless,the party may not rest merely upon the allegations or denials in its pleading.see centennial wireless,cir.instead,the party must set forth specific facts showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to each issue upon which she would bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial.see id.quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.the evidence presented by the party may not be conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,or unsupported speculation.reynolds tobacco,cir.
iv.title work environment 
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits an employer from discriminating against any individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated.harris forklift,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.to succeed in a hostile workplace environment claim,torres must show that she is a member of a protected class that she was subjected to unwelcome harassment that the harassment was based on her membership of the protected class that the harassment was so severe or pervasive that it altered the conditions of her employment and created an abusive work environment that the objectionable conduct was objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been established.city of providence,cir citing faragher city of boca ratón,d.
on summary judgment,claimed that torres failed to satisfy the sixth element of this test and the district court agreed,dismissing the claim on the ground that employer liability can not attach for plaintiff claim for hostile work environment.
an employer liability for a hostile work environment claim depends on the harasser employment status relative to the victim is vicariously liable if torres supervisor at created a hostile work environment see faragher,at.burlington,ellerth,d,but if a created the hostile work environment,will be held liable only if it was negligent either in discovering or remedying the harassment,see crowley bean,cir.other circuits have addressed the question of employer liability in the case of harassment by,third parties.those courts seem to be in general agreement that such cases should be analyzed using the same standard that is applied in the case of harassment.see,lockard pizza hut,cir folkerson circus circus,cir.
the district court applied the negligence standard of employer liability because it found that torres alleged harassers were neither her supervisors nor her,but rather third parties for purposes of title vii liability.the district court noted that and were separate and independent legal entities and that neither one controls the operations of the other.the district court further found that while torres was at all times employed by,spinola was at all times an employee of.as such,the district court considered spinola a,thus limiting liability to negligence.
torres theory of employer liability was that and together constituted a single employer,which warrants vicarious liability to under the single employer doctrine,two nominally separate companies may be so interrelated that they constitute a single employer subject to liability under title vii.see nlrb,cir.the single employer also integrated employer test may apply in cases where liability is sought to be imposed on the legal employer by arguing that another entity is sufficiently related such that its actions can be attributable to the legal employer.engelhardt richards,cir applying the single employer test to a claim under the fmla,but citing to its application in title vii cases.
but the district court rejected that argument,holding that 
even assuming arguendo that merck puerto rico and merck mexico could both be considered plaintiff employers for purposes of the title vii analysis,we have no evidence to sustain a finding that merck puerto rico had any control over the actions of spinola,a employee.as such,there is no evidence to sustain a finding that at any time spinola was acting as an agent of merck puerto rico.
the district court did not address whether and could,in fact,be considered a single employer.on appeal,avoids this question,arguing that while spinola was a supervisor,he was a supervisor for,not.as such,he could not,and,in fact,did not,bring official power to bear on torres.torres reiterates her liability argument,claiming that the district court erred in using a negligence standard applicable to the actions of and third parties to evaluate liability for her supervisor discriminatory and harassing conduct.we think there is a triable issue of fact on this question.
the flaw in both the district court and analyses is that they ignore the fact that if and are considered to be one and the same company,the agent spinola of one automatically becomes the agent of the other for purposes of title vii liability.that is,the question of spinola relationship to is answered by the single employer theory.
the factors considered in determining whether two or more entities are a single employer under the test are common management interrelation between operations centralized control over labor relations and common ownership.romano int l,cir.all four factors,however,are not necessary for status.knowlton teltrust phones,cir see also pearson component tech,cir.rather,the test should be applied flexibly,placing special emphasis on the control of employment decisions.romano,at we choose to follow the more flexible approach which focuses on employment decisions,but only to the extent that the parent exerts an amount of participation that is sufficient and necessary to the total employment process,even absent total control or ultimate authority over hiring decisions.quoting cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir 
applying the single employer test,we find that there is enough evidence in the record to survive summary judgment.with respect to the interrelation between corporations factor,there is ample evidence of a reciprocal relationship between and.first,the record shows that and perform substantially the same function.see engelhardt,at finding little,if any,evidence to suggest any interrelation between operations of the two companies,and noting that the nature of the two businesses was was in the retailing business whereas the subsidiary was in the wholesaling business.there is also evidence of frequent interchange of employees between and,centralized merck human resources and personnel policies,as well as a unified system through which all expatriated employees are funneled.see id.finding no interrelation where the subsidiary was not a division of the parent company whereby upper echelons of control are centralized and efficiencies are realized through consolidation of redundant administrative,human resource,and management functions.
with respect to centralized control of labor primary consideration in evaluating employer status,romano,at is a significant amount of evidence weighing in favor of a finding.as mentioned above,merck established human resources and personnel policies applicable to all its subsidiaries.moreover,the record shows that,and merck all had substantial control over torres employment.see id.at finding little evidence of centralized control of labor relations where t here is no evidence to suggest that one of the companies deferred to the other in making hiring,firing,assignment,scheduling,or compensation decisions.paid torres,provided her benefits and retained the power to terminate her.meanwhile,had virtually exclusive control over her employment and had substantial influence over the ultimate decision to terminate her.
torres termination process itself evinces centralized,control over employment decisions.the purported reason for torres termination was the violation of a professional ethics policy established by merck,applicable to all its subsidiaries,including and.see id.finding no evidence that the parent company required the subsidiary to adopt the same policies and programs,and therefore no inference that defendants centrally determined both companies employment practices.moreover,the termination was ultimately approved by human resources personnel for merck latin american division,on recommendation after consulting with.
both and are subsidiaries of merck.as such,they share common ownership.however,we presently have no information about the first factor,management of the companies.
in sum,we think that the evidentiary record leaves a triable issue of fact as to whether and and merck are one single employer for purposes of title vii liability for a hostile work environment.thus,we find that for purposes of summary judgment,torres has presented sufficient evidence to establish potential liability for her hostile work environment claim.
the district court similarly dismissed torres discrimination claim under the ada,et,on the ground that did not know about her medical condition and therefore could not have had the discriminatory animus required under the ada.see pueblo int l,cir describing the ada requirement that an employee establish that her employer adverse employment decision was motivated by the employee disability.the district court did not address the extent to which or knew about torres medical conditions or potentially discriminated against her because of them.as under title vii,the single employer test has been applied to determine liability under the ada.see swallows barnes noble book stores,cir under the single employer or integrated enterprise doctrine,two companies may be considered so interrelated that they constitute a single employer subject to liability under the adea the ada.thus,for the same reasons articulated as to the title vii claim,we reverse the district court dismissal of torres ada claims.
vi.retaliation under title vii 
to establish a prima facie showing of retaliation,a plaintiff must prove that she engaged in protected activity an adverse employment action occurred and a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.dressler daniel,cir.an employee has engaged in an activity protected by title vii if she has either opposed any practice made unlawful by title vii,or made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.a see also dressler,at.
it is uncontested that torres engaged in protected activity when torres filed her charge of discrimination with the eeoc on november,little over a month after her termination.torres claims that the retaliatory adverse employment action consisted of merck failure to timely pay her last paycheck provide her forms timely pay her state and federal taxes pay her christmas bonus and make a good faith effort to send her required cobra notice.
the district court first held that none of torres allegedly retaliatory acts amount to adverse employment actions actionable under title vii because they all took place once plaintiff was no longer employed at merck puerto rico.while this appeal was pending,however,the supreme court decided burlington northern santa fe railway white,d,changing the legal standard to be applied to retaliation claims under title vii.while we express no opinion as to how this issue should be resolved,we think it proper to allow the district court to first address this issue in light of burlington.accordingly,we remand torres title vii retaliation claim to the district court to the extent its viability depends on a finding of adverse employment action.
the district court went on to address alternative grounds on which to dismiss the specific allegations of retaliation.the district court held that merck failure to pay torres christmas bonus was not actionable because of a lack of causal connection between the alleged retaliatory act and torres protected activity.we agree.torres filed her discrimination action on november,but the payment of those bonuses has been outstanding since december.without evidence of specific retaliatory animus motivating the of the bonuses after november,there is no reason to believe that decided not to pay torres because she filed a claim of discrimination.
with respect to merck failure to pay torres withheld taxes,however,the district court held again that there was a lack of causal connection between the alleged retaliatory act and her protected activity because had outsourced this duty to an accounting firm.we do not think an additional link breaks the causal chain altogether.the fact that hired ernst young to do a job does not absolve it from responsibility for getting the job done more importantly,it does not strip from its power to prevent the job from being done.
the district court also dismissed torres retaliation claim based on merck failure to provide cobra notice on the ground that the claim was preempted by the employee retirement income security program erisa.erisa expressly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in the statute.a emphasis added.the term state law is defined by the statute as including all laws,decisions,rules,regulations,or other state action having the effect of law,of any state.id.c see also van camp info,cir,overruled on other grounds by warner ford motor,cir.because torres retaliation claim is brought under title vii,a federal law,her claim is not preempted by erisa.
therefore,we remand to the district court torres retaliation claims based on failure to pay her last paycheck,its failure to provide her forms,its failure to pay her puerto rico and federal taxes,and its failure to comply with cobra requirements 
vii.cobra compliance 
cobra requires employers to give employees the opportunity to continue health care coverage for a specified period of time after a qualifying event,at the employee expense.a see becton dickinson caribe,cir.termination of employment is considered a qualifying event.cobra also requires employers to notify health care plan administrators of the termination within days of the qualifying event.id.a.thereafter,plan administrators have fourteen days to notify the qualified beneficiary of her right to continued coverage.id.c.
torres claims that did not comply with cobra notice requirements because it used her old address to notify her of her cobra rights,despite the alleged fact that she called at some point after december,to inform the company of her new puerto rico address.noting that torres admitted to having her mail forwarded from her old address to her new puerto rico address,the district court dismissed torres cobra claim holding that had substantially complied with cobra notification requirements because its notice was reasonably calculated to reach torres.we disagree.
cobra does not state how notice should be given.but courts that have addressed the issue have held that a good faith attempt to comply with a reasonable interpretation of the statute is sufficient.smith rogers galvanizing,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also,degruise sprint,cir e mployers are required to operate in good faith compliance with a reasonable interpretation of what adequate notice entails.internal quotation marks omitted branch bernd,c ourts have generally validated methods of notice which are calculated to reach the beneficiary,aff cir.several courts have specifically found that employers are in compliance with a when they send cobra notices via first class mail to an employee address.see holford exhibit design consultants,d,ramallo.printing,d.
through the health care plan administrator sent torres a notice of her rights under cobra on january,via certified mail to the address torres had given when she worked at.torres alleges that she informed of her new address in puerto rico in a telephone call made to the company.looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to torres,we can not say as a matter of standard we apply on summary made a good faith effort to comply with cobra because there is a dispute as to the facts regarding whether knowingly sent the notice to the wrong address.
viii.conclusion 
we affirm the district court dismissal of torres retaliation claim based on failure to pay her christmas bonus.we reverse the district court order with respect to torres title vii hostile work environment claim,her ada claim,and her retaliation claim insofar as it is based on failure to pay her last paycheck,its failure to provide her forms,its failure to pay her puerto rico and federal taxes,and its failure to comply with cobra requirements,and remand for further proceedings.in light of this conclusion,the district court should also reconsider the dismissal of torres supplemental claims.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
affirmed in part,reversed in part and remanded.
