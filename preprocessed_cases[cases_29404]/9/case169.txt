a leading lexicographer defines a statute of limitations as a statute establishing a time limit for suing in a civil case,based on the date when the claim accrued as when the injury occurred or was discovered.black law dictionary ed.the main reason for establishing a limitations period is to ensure the diligent presentation of known claims by promoting the elimination of stale claims,and certainty about a plaintiff opportunity for recovery and a defendant potential liabilities.rotella wood.when as in the case at hand a plaintiff dawdles,bad things often happen.so it is here because maritza álamo hornedo failed to commence her action within the time prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations,we affirm the district court order of dismissal 
inasmuch as this appeal follows the grant of a motion to dismiss,we glean the relevant facts from the complaint.see ex rel.maddox elsevier,cir sec.tambone,cir en banc.
in,the plaintiff worked for the parole board of puerto rico,but economic forces placed her employment in jeopardy.that spring,the puerto rico legislature enacted a series of austerity measures,collectively known as law,designed to improve the island dire financial straits.the measures included a reduction in the size of the government commonwealth employees with less than years of service were to be terminated.
despite its harshness,law had a few oases of job security.for example,it spared certain public safety sectors,police and fire.an amendment to the law created additional oases.these newly created oases included an exemption for employees of the parole board.see laws ann.tit,m.
in light of this amendment,the plaintiff believed that she would be shielded from the adverse effects of law.her hopes were dashed when,less than four months later,she received a letter from the body charged with implementing law the junta de reestructuración y estabilización económica y fiscal jref notifying her that she would be terminated pursuant to that law.the wheels,once set in motion,continued to turn despite the plaintiff protests.the process culminated in a final termination letter received by the plaintiff on february.as provided in that letter,her employment was ended on march.
that summer,the union to which the plaintiff belonged filed suit in the local court of first instance.the union suit sought to reinstate the plaintiff and other unionized parole board employees who were similarly situated,and to recover back pay for them.the union prevailed and a judgment entered in its favor on february.
although the plaintiff was reinstated to her position,the pot continued to boil.eight months after the court of first instance entered its judgment,the plaintiff repaired to the federal district court.she invoked federal question jurisdiction,see,and alleged that the jref members,including josé pérez riera and juan carlos puig had deprived her of due process of law in violation of.she also asserted supplemental claims arising under puerto rico law.all of these claims sought compensatory and punitive damages.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the plaintiff section claim was.the district court agreed and dismissed the section claim with prejudice.at the same time,it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff remaining claims,dismissing them without prejudice.see c.this timely appeal followed.
the plaintiff assigns error to the district court application of the statute of limitations.section claims borrow the forum state statute of limitations for actions.see city of rancho palos verdes abrams.for this purpose,puerto rico is the functional equivalent of a state.see santiago puerto rico,cir.
although section borrows its limitations period from state law,the accrual date for a section claim is measured by federal law.see morán vega cruz burgos,cir.under federal law,such a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff knows,or has reason to know of the injury on which the action is based.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in puerto rico,the borrowed limitations period is one year.see rodriguez narvaez nazario,cir citing laws ann.tit.the court below held that the plaintiff section claim accrued no later than february of,when the plaintiff received the final termination letter.her federal complaint,which was not filed until october,therefore came too late.
the plaintiff argues that the district court started with the wrong date.in her view,the section claim did not accrue until february of,when the court of first instance entered a judgment vindicating her position.without that judgment,she posits,her injury was too ethereal to be the stuff of a concrete cause of action and,thus,too ethereal to trigger accrual.
this argument will not wash.by the time that she received formal notice of her imminent termination february,the plaintiff knew of her injury and of its cause the defendants actions.no more was exigible.
to be sure,the plaintiff laments that she did not then have judicial confirmation of the unlawfulness of her firing.but to our knowledge,no court has ever been so vain as to deem judicial evaluation of an adverse employment decision the sine qua non of the accrual of a section claim based on that decision.rather,the case law is consentient that such a claim accrues when the employee is given notice of the adverse employment decision.see,chardon fernandez,per curiam lópez gonzález municipality of comerío,cir morris gov t dev.bank,cir.this makes perfect sense in,say,a case in which an employee underlying claim is one of wrongful termination of employment,the injury of which the plaintiff complains is her ouster,not judicial recognition that her ouster was illegal.
the plaintiff also suggests that her prior suit in the court of first instance somehow tolled the statute of limitations.this suggestion is fanciful.
to begin,exhaustion of state remedies is not a condition precedent to the maintenance of a section action.see patsy bd.of regents,rogers okin,cir.thus,the commencement and pendency of a state proceeding ordinarily does not toll the limitations period for a parallel action under section.see,rodríguez garcía municipality of caguas,cir ramirez de arellano alvarez de choudens,cir.the plaintiff attempts to parry this thrust by noting that,under puerto rico law,the statute of limitations can be interrupted by,among other things,suing on the relevant claim.laws ann.tit.once the court action comes to a definite end,the statute of limitations begins to run anew.rodríguez garcía,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiff reliance on this principle elevates hope over reason.in order to have the tolling effect desired by the plaintiff,the complaint in the first action must assert causes of action identical to those asserted in the second action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
this identicality requirement has three facets.the two actions must seek the same form of relief they must be based on the same substantive claims and they must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities.id.at.the plaintiff offers no developed argumentation sufficient to show that she satisfies these conditions.
in all events,it is readily apparent that the plaintiff has not satisfied the identicality requirement.the first action,brought in the court of first instance,sought the equitable remedies of reinstatement and back pay the second action,brought in the federal district court,sought the legal remedies of compensatory and punitive damages.thus,it is plain that the two actions did not seek the same form of relief.
we hasten to add that this conclusion breaks no new ground.this court has held,squarely and repeatedly,that under puerto rico law,seeking only equitable relief does not toll the statute of limitations where the subsequent complaint seeks damages.nieves vega ortiz quiñones,cir collecting cases.
in view of the plaintiff failure to satisfy the first facet of the identicality requirement,we need not inquire into the other two facets.puerto rico law is pellucid that a plaintiff who seeks to interrupt the running of a statute of limitations on this basis must satisfy all three facet
