background 
unite is a union of approximately members,many of whom are immigrants.on november,the immigration and naturalization service ins conducted a raid of industries,a garment factory in melville,new york that employed numerous unite members.according to unite,the ins had conducted similar raids of factories in the past,arresting workers it believed to be illegal or undocumented aliens.unite had become concerned that employers were using ins raids to retaliate against workers engaged in activities.it also had received reports that ins officers conducting these raids were mistreating workers and engaging in selective prosecution tactics.
in the late,as part of its effort to investigate and explore the concerns,unite began submitting foia requests to the ins aimed at gathering information relating to workplace raids.this action stems from unite may,foia request to the ins,which sought all documents in the ins possession concerning the november raid and the events preceding and following its occurrence.the ins new york district office denied the request on august,claiming that,under foia exemption a,b a,the information sought reasonably could be expected to interfere with an open investigation and law enforcement proceedings.according to the ins,its investigation unit had made the decision earlier that year to institute administrative enforcement proceedings against due to the company employment of illegal or undocumented aliens.
on september,unite filed an administrative appeal with the department of justice office of information and privacy in which it challenged the ins denial of its request.that office denied unite appeal on march,again relying on foia exemption a.in response,on march,unite filed this action in the district court seeking an order directing the ins to comply with its foia request.
on june,the ins concluded its enforcement proceeding against and entered into a settlement that required the company to pay a fine.the ins foia office subsequently obtained the file and copied the materials relating to the investigation and enforcement action.in august,several months after unite had initiated its action in federal court,the ins produced documents.it withheld pages and made a number of redactions to prevent disclosure of and work product material,personal information concerning individuals names and social security numbers,and documents that potentially could reveal the investigative techniques used by the ins.following this initial production,the parties engaged in numerous discussions relating to the withheld documents,and on april,the ins released several more documents.the parties subsequently informed the district court that they had settled all of the substantive issues in the case and that the only remaining matter was attorney fees.accordingly,the district court directed that the case be conditionally discontinued,subject to its being restored on unite application in the event that resolution of the issue of attorney fees was not achieved within sixty days.the district court never rendered a judgment on the merits or endorsed a consent decree or settlement agreement,nor was it asked to do so by the parties.
on june,when the parties had failed to reach an agreement concerning attorney fees,the district court restored the case to the active calendar.the parties subsequently filed motions on the attorney fees issue,each addressing the applicability of the supreme court then recent decision in buckhannon.on may,the district court issued a written ruling denying unite request for an award of attorney fees.see union of needletrades,indus.and textile employers,clc,d.
this timely appeal followed.

we generally review a district court award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.see,mautner hirsch,cir.however,where an appellant contention on appeal regarding an award of attorneys fees is that the district court made an error of law in granting or denying such an award,the district court rulings of law are reviewed de novo.baker health mgmt,cir.
ii.the application of buckhannon to foia provision 
according to the american rule,the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.courts may reallocate the burdens of litigation,however,when authorized or directed to do so by a statute.peterson continental cas,cir citing alyeska pipeline serv,at.foia is one such statute.pursuant to its provision,a court may assess against the united states reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under foia in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.a e.
as both parties agree,at the time unite commenced this action,courts determining whether a foia plaintiff had substantially prevailed applied the catalyst theory of recovery.see.low income advocacy council usery,cir vermont low income see also chesapeake bay found.united states dep t of,overruled by oil,chem.atomic workers int l union,dep t of energy,oil,chem.atomic workers.under the catalyst theory,as long as the plaintiff satisfied certain criteria,see,chesapeake bay,at,a district court could award attorney fees even in the absence of a favorable judgment on the merits,see,vermont low income,at noting that a judgment is not an absolute prerequisite to an award of attorney fees under foia.
one year into this litigation,the supreme court issued its decision in buckhannon rejecting the catalyst theory as a basis for an award of fees under the fair housing amendments act of fhaa,et,and the americans with disabilities act of ada,et.see buckhannon,at.one of the petitioners in buckhannon,buckhannon board and care home,buckhannon,operated assisted living homes and had failed a state fire marshall inspection because some of its residents were incapable of under state law,meaning that they were not capable of moving themselves from situations involving imminent danger.id.at.citing.after receiving cease and desist orders requiring that it close its facilities,buckhannon filed suit on behalf of itself and other similarly situated homes against the state,two state agencies and various individuals.see id.at.it sought injunctive and declaratory relief,as well as damages,contending that the state law violated the ada and the fhaa.see id.at.shortly after filing the complaint,the petitioners dropped their claim for damages,leaving only their claims for equitable relief.see id.at.while the case was still in its early stages,the state passed legislation deleting the requirement.see id.at.on the respondents motion,the district court dismissed the case as moot after concluding that the new legislation had removed the offending provision.see id.the petitioners subsequently moved for an award of attorney fees,arguing that,under the provisions of the ada and the fhaa,they were the prevailing parties because they had achieved the result they sought and their lawsuit had acted as the catalyst for the voluntary change in the respondents conduct.see id.the district court denied the petitioners motion,and the fourth circuit,following an earlier en banc decision rejecting the catalyst theory,affirmed in an unpublished,per curiam opinion.see id.at.citing state bd.of educ.of,cir.noting that most circuits recognized the validity of the catalyst theory,the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement.see id.
affirming the fourth circuit,the court rejected the catalyst theory,holding that it was not a permissible basis for an award of attorney fees under the ada and the fhaa.id.at.the court analysis began by focusing on the term prevailing party,the legal term of art used by congress in the ada,the fhaa and numerous other provisions.see id.at.citing black law dictionary,the court noted that prevailing party was defined as a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded also termed successful party.id.citing black law dictionary ed.noting that it had never had occasion to decide whether the term prevailing party allows an award of fees under the catalyst theory,id.at,the court undertook a general examination of its decisions addressing awards granted under various provisions,see id.at.following this review,the court stated that its decisions,taken together,establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees create the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.id.at.citing.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.the catalyst theory,the court held,falls on the other side of the line from these examples in that it authorizes an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.the court further held that where a plaintiff realizes the objective of its lawsuit without a consent decree or a judgment on the merits,a defendant voluntary change in conduct lacks the judicial imprimatur necessary to render the plaintiff a prevailing party.id.
unite argues that buckhannon holding and rationales do not dictate rejection of the foia catalyst theory.this position,however,takes too narrow a view of the court ruling.our cases acknowledge that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory extends to more than just the two provisions at issue in that decision.in new york state federation of taxi drivers westchester county taxi limousine commission,cir,for instance,we held that d espite the fact that the holding in buckhannon applied to the fhaa and ada,it is clear that the supreme court intends the reasoning of that case to apply to the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,as well.id.at.likewise,in regional school district,board of education,cir,a decision in which we rejected the catalyst theory as a permissible basis for an award of attorney fees under the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,et,we recognized that although buckhannon concerned the provisions of the ada and the fhaa,the decision expressly signaled its wider applicability.id.at.
a number of circuits addressing provisions other than those under consideration in buckhannon have taken a similarly broad view of the court decision.see,john.county intermediate unit,cir applying buckhannon to cases brought under the idea and noting that buckhannon heralded its wider it dealt only with the provisions of the fhaa and the ada richardson miller,cir although buckhannon applied to the fhaa and ada,the court specifically noted that provisions of several other statutes,including the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,should be interpreted consistently.chambers ohio dep t of human,cir noting that buckhannon categorically rejected the catalyst theory as a permissible basis for awarding attorney fees smith,cir holding that the supreme court express rule of decision in buckhannon sweeps broadly and its reasoning is persuasively applicable to an award of attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,d a.bennett yoshina,cir there can be no doubt that the court analysis in buckhannon applies to statutes other than the two at issue in that case.crabill trans union,cir recognizing the supreme court emphasis on the similarity of most federal statutes and suggesting that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory applies to the provision contained in the fair credit reporting act.
addressing the precise question raised in this appeal,the circuit concluded that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory is broad enough to preclude an award of attorney fees to foia plaintiffs who have failed to secure either a judgment on the merits or a consent decree.see oil,chem.atomic workers,at.the in oil,chem.atomic workers submitted a foia request to the united states enrichment corporation usec seeking information concerning the effect that privatization of two enrichment plants would have on the union members.see id.at.when the usec refused to provide the requested information,the union brought a civil action in federal court.see id.following several status conferences before the district court,the parties filed a report stating that i n light of the usec production of substantial amounts of material responsive to the union claim for relief,the action is hereby dismissed.id.at.the district court signed the parties report,which reserved for the union the right to file a request for attorney fees.see id.the union subsequently filed an application for fees,which the district court granted,in part,under foia provision.see id.at.
the issue on appeal in oil,chem.atomic workers was whether the supreme court decision in buckhannon,issued while the appeal was pending,applied to foia cases.see id.reversing the district court award,the circuit held that it did.see id.at.the court acknowledged that foia use of the substantially prevailing language differed slightly from the fee provisions at issue in buckhannon,which used the term prevailing party.see id.at.that difference notwithstanding,the court adhere d to the proposition that eligibility for an award of attorney fees in a foia case should be treated the same as eligibility determinations made under other statutes unless there is some good reason for doing otherwise.id.at.noting that it had seen nothing to suggest that congress sought to draw any fine distinction between prevailing party and substantially prevail,the circuit held that in order for plaintiffs in foia actions to become eligible for an award of attorney fees,they must have been awarded some relief by a court,either in a judgment on the merits or in a consent decree,id.at quoting buckhannon,at.after concluding that the report filed by the parties and signed by the district court constituted neither a decision on the merits nor a consent decree,see id.at,the court held that under buckhannon,the union was not entitled to attorney fees because it did not substantially prevail.id.at.
we believe the same result is required here.less than five months after unite filed its complaint seeking an order directing the ins to produce certain information relating to the investigation and raid of,the ins complied by producing over documents.after the parties worked through various disagreements concerning the remaining redacted and allegedly privileged documents,they jointly reported that they had settled all of the substantive issues in the case and that the only remaining issue was whether unite was entitled to attorney fees.in light of the parties report,the district court discontinued the action subject to its being reopened in the event that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the issue of attorney fees.the district court never granted any relief on the merits,nor was it asked to do so by unite.moreover,unite never requested that the district court order a consent decree or endorse,or retain jurisdiction over,a settlement agreement.accordingly,while unite may have accomplished the objective it sought to achieve by initiating this foia action,its failure to secure either a judgment on the merits or a consent decree renders it ineligible for an award of attorney fees under buckhannon.
several decisions extending buckhannon to provisions not at issue in that case rely on the supreme court statement,following its citation to an appendix listing over provisions,including foia,see buckhannon,at.citing marek chesny,d appendix to opinion of brennan,dissenting,that the court had interpreted these provisions consistently,buckhannon,at.citing hensley eckerhart,d.we do not suggest that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory necessar
