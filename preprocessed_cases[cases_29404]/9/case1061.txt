new york state prisoner teddy lewis sued the named defendants,officials and employees of the new york state department of correctional services,pursuant to for alleged violations of his constitutional rights while being held at great meadow correctional facility great meadow.proceeding pro se,lewis now appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,judge,dismissing his suit with prejudice based on his refusal to testify at trial while incarcerated at great meadow.because we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in ordering dismissal,we affirm.
background 
proceedings 
teddy lewis is a new york state inmate incarcerated through at least the rest of his multiple murders.in,lewis initiated this action against defendants for alleged racial harassment and physical assaults sustained during his transfer from attica correctional facility to great meadow in 
the litigation of lewis claims was beset by repeated and lengthy delays spanning more than a decade.for example,although the case was designated ready for trial on may,the docket reflects no activity until august,when the matter was reassigned to judge kahn.thereafter,despite lewis letters to the court objecting to continued delay no steps were taken to set his case down for trial until december,when the court advised the parties that trial would commence on march.it did not.
instead,by letter dated january,defense counsel sought leave to file a motion for summary judgment.leave was granted,and the district court awarded summary judgment to defendants on march.lewis appealed,and this court vacated the judgment by unpublished summary order dated january,because of the absence of factual findings or legal analysis supporting the award.see lewis benson,cir.
following remand,on february,defendants moved for partial summary judgment on behalf of the supervisory officials not alleged to have been personally involved in the assault.in a report issued on september,magistrate judge randolph treece recommended that the motion be granted,and,over lewis objections,judge kahn adopted the recommendation 
as to plaintiff claims against the remaining defendants,in march,the district court assigned jeremy chen as pro bono counsel for lewis and set the case down for trial on june,at the federal courthouse in albany.
b.the trial and dismissal of lewis action 
before trial,lewis was incarcerated at the new york state correctional facility in auburn,new york auburn,approximately miles from the federal courthouse in albany.see generally boyce motor lines united states.recognizing court authority to take judicial notice of geography.lewis asserts that on the morning of june,he was transported from auburn to albany and placed in a holding cell at the federal courthouse.there,at approximately,chen advised lewis that during the course of the federal trial he would be held at great meadow,the facility where the alleged assaults had occurred and where certain of the defendants were still employed.great meadow,located in comstock,new york,is approximately miles from albany.
the morning court proceedings commenced on the record at in judge kahn chambers the trial transcript reveals that judge kahn,plaintiff counsel chen,and defense schwartz of the new york attorney general discussed the fact that lewis would be shackled during trial,an action apparently deemed necessary in light of the violent nature of both lewis crimes of conviction and his disciplinary record in prison.indeed,it was lewis own counsel who proposed that his client feet and hand be shackled during trial,leaving his dominant hand free for taking and passing notes.
with this resolved,judge kahn inquired of counsel is there anything else before we bring up the jury and the plaintiff trial tr.at.the attorneys proceeded to discuss various factual stipulations and the number of witnesses they would call,with chen indicating that lewis would be the only witness in support of the plaintiff case.chen the court lewis would sit in on jury selection.at no time,however,did chen raise the issue of lewis incarceration during trial at great meadow,nor was the subject broached by defense counsel or judge khan.indeed,neither the trial transcript nor the clerk detailed notes indicate that a discussion of this subject took place prior to jury selection.
jury selection commenced at and concluded at,whereupon the jury was sworn and given preliminary instructions by judge khan.the court then declared a break before opening statements.id.at.the transcript of the colloquy that ensued when the break concluded at suggests that it was during that interval that the issue of plaintiff incarceration during trial at great meadow first arose 
the court correct me if i wrong,chen,but lewis is concerned about testifying particularly against the defendants who are now assigned to the great meadow correctional facility 
chen that correct,your honor.
the court and as i understand it,he states that he wo so testify unless he transferred to another facility.i told him that i personally have no power over transferring.as i understand it,i do think that within my power to do that.and what your position on that schwartz 
schwartz i do understand,judge,because,yes,lewis is currently housed at auburn correctional facility.correct 
chen that is correct.
schwartz that another facility.so he concerned about 
chen he will be housed at great meadow temporarily.
the court during this trial.
chen during the course of this trial.and since this is where the incident took place,and he also concerned about the fact that other defendants are currently employed there,that that concerns him.
schwartz this is the first i heard of the fact that he was going to be housed there.i do know that i have any know i do have any authority to determine where an inmate is being housed during the course of the trial.i can discuss the matter with the officers and 
the court do you want to do that over the next few minutes 
schwartz yes,judge.
the court and then let me know your position.and then we act accordingly.
schwartz yes,judge.
the court okay.go ahead.
following this break,judge khan noted on the record what counsel had reported to the court.
the court on the record.as i understand it,and correct me if i wrong,the attorney general,schwartz,is not opposed to trying to arrange a new facility,but he ca do that at the moment,he would have to look into this.and as he stated,the plaintiff has no right to select the facility he going to stay at during the two or trial.
lewis,and correct me again,if i wrong,has stated that he just wo testify because of this he does want to dismiss the case himself he not consenting to dropping the case.
if there no other solution,i would dismiss the case and certainly preserve his right to appeal.there a presumption that any facility he staying at,he going to be treated properly and lawfully.
the court then inquired as to whether any defendants were still assigned to great meadow and,upon learning that they were,noted that another option available to it was just to adjourn this trial for about a few weeks or a month,return lewis to auburn,and try the case at the federal courthouse in syracuse.id.at.after consulting with lewis,chen reported to the court that because his client fears for his life at great meadow,lewis preferred choice would be to have the trial adjourned until it could be conducted in syracuse.id.at.
defense counsel objected,reiterating that inmates have no right to determine where they are housed and noting that adjournment would inconvenience his clients.he offered yet another option during trial,lewis could be placed in the shu at great meadow where surveillance cameras operated around the clock.if this accommodation was insufficient to persuade lewis to proceed with trial,defense counsel urged dismissal.
judge kahn allowed chen to confer with lewis to discuss this option,but lewis did not consent to shu placement,noting that some of the alleged abuse occurred at that site.chen again urged adjournment and transfer of the trial to syracuse.
having heard from the parties,the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review and applicability of the drake factors 
because lewis testimony was to be the only direct evidence introduced in support of his allegation that defendants assaulted him during his transfer to great meadow,the district court viewed his refusal to testify as a failure to prosecute rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure states that i f the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order,a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.
we review a dismissal for failure to prosecute for abuse of discretion.see,ruzsa rubenstein sendy attys at law,cir.this is because the power of a district court to take such explicitly sanctioned by rule b has generally been considered an inherent power,governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.link wabash,d see also theilmann rutland,cir noting that,because authority to dismiss for lack of prosecution is inherent power of district courts,the scope of review over an order of dismissal accorded an appellate court is extremely narrow.we identify abuse of discretion when a district court challenged decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when its ruling can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.wynder mcmahon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,lewis does not charge the district court with errors of law or fact.rather,he asserts that the dismissal falls outside the range of permissible decisions 
in reviewing this argument,we are mindful that dismissal for lack of prosecution is a harsh remedy that should be utilized only in extreme situations.minnette time warner,cir internal quotation marks omitted gill stolow,cir in final analysis,a court has the responsibility to do justice between man and man and general principles can not justify denial of a party fair day in court except upon a serious showing of willful default.in recognition of this principle,w e have in fact fashioned guiding rules that limit a trial court discretion when determining whether dismissal for failure to prosecute is appropriate in a particular case.united states ex rel.drake norden,cir.we review the trial court decision by examining five factors,namely,whether 
the plaintiff failure to prosecute caused a delay of significant duration plaintiff was given notice that further delay would result in dismissal defendant was likely to be prejudiced by further delay the need to alleviate court calendar congestion was carefully balanced against plaintiff right to an opportunity for a day in court and the trial court adequately assessed the efficacy of lesser sanctions.
see also harding fed.reserve bank of,cir listing factors.in making use of this test,n o one factor is dispositive,and ultimately we must review the dismissal in light of the record as a whole.united states ex rel.drake norden,at see also palmieri defaria,cir holding that proper review of dismissal for failure to prosecute requires careful examination of each case in its own factual circumstances internal quotation marks omitted.
significantly,however,the cases in which we have announced and applied the drake factors have almost exclusively concerned instances of litigation misconduct such as the failure to comply with a scheduling order or timely to respond to pending motions.see,ruzsa rubenstein sendy attys at law,at missing deadline for filing amended complaint united states ex rel.drake norden,at same lesane hall sec.analyst,cir failing to respond to motion for summary judgment lucas miles,cir failure timely to file amended complaint nita.dep t of envtl,cir failing to respond to pending motions minnette time warner,at,failing to respond to defendant motion for dismissal peart city of new york,cir failing to comply with two court orders and otherwise demonstra ting a lack of respect for the court,culminating in failure to appear at start of trial romandette weetabix,cir failing to effect timely service harding fed.reserve bank of,at failing timely to file amended complaint and other litigation delays.in such contexts,where dismissal operates as a sanction for dilatory tactics during the course of litigation or for failure to follow a court order,the straightforward application of the factors identified above provides a reasonable means for evaluating the district court exercise of its discretion under rule b.
this case,however,presents a quite different scenario.lewis did not miss a filing deadline,fail to comply with a discovery order,overlook a scheduled court date,indulge in dilatory litigation tactics,or engage in any other misconduct.thus,the factors discussed in drake for identifying abuse of discretion in a district court decision to impose the sanction of dismissal in response to a plaintiff dilatory,contumacious,or forgetful behavior are not particularly helpful to our analysis.rather,lewis refusal to testify while housed at great meadow is better viewed as presenting the district court with two questions whether to grant lewis the adjournment he requested,and upon denial of that request,whether to dismiss lewis case due to his refusal to offer the only direct evidence that could support his claims.we consider each of these issues in turn.
b.the district court acted within its discretion in granting dismissal 
denial of adjournment 
accommodating lewis concerns,first raised after the jury was sworn,would have required that the trial be adjourned and then rescheduled to be tried out in syracuse.trial tr.at.such an adjournment would have delayed proceedings a few weeks or a month.id.at.it would,moreover,have required the declaration of a mistrial and the dismissal of the sworn jury.under these circumstances,the first relevant inquiry is not,as in drake,whether the delay would have been temporally significant,at,but rather whether the district court decision to deny the requested adjournment was itself an abuse of discretion.
this court precedent instructs us to be particularly solicitous of a district court ruling on a motion to adjourn the scheduled start of a trial proceeding.sequa gbj,cir.we will not disturb such a ruling absent a showing of clear abuse.id.t o make that showing,the complaining party must establish both that the denial of the adjournment was arbitrary,and that it substantially impaired the presentation of his case.accord farias instructional,cir identifying no abuse where,on first day of trial,court denied continuance to obtain absent witness and noting that decisions regarding trial adjournments rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only where there is showing both of arbitrariness and of prejudice to the defendant ungar sarafite,d the matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge,and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that when a party requests a trial adjournment of several weeks after a jury has been sworn,under circumstances that will require that jury to be dismissed and a new one empaneled,a district court acts well within its discretion in requiring strong justification for the adjournment.see united states cusack,cir identifying no abuse where district court denied two to three week continuance requested i n the middle of trial to obtain expert witness moffitt.state bd.of,cir affirming rule b dismissal after jury was sworn where plaintiff,the only one that could testify to matters alleged in the complaint,was not available to testify and noting that a court faced with an request to postpone a trial is entitled to a more detailed showing than plaintiff and her counsel supplied to the district court in this case.the only such justification suggested by the record is lewis fear that he would be abused if housed during trial at great meadow,the site of the alleged assault by the defendants,some of whom were still employed at the facility at the time of trial.
on the record presented here,this justification was not sufficiently strong to remove denial of the requested continuance from the range of permissible decisions.the district court observed that it could understand lewis discomfort.trial tr.at.we construe this statement to reflect the court recognition of the subjective genuineness of lewis professed fear.the court did not find,nor was it asked to find,that lewis fears were objectively reasonable.rather,the court referenced a presumption that lewis would be treated properly and lawfully at any state correctional facility in which he was housed during trial,including great meadow.id we identify no error in the district court reliance on such a presumption in the absence of objective evidence to the contrary.to hold otherwise would place an enormous burden on district courts hearing prisoners complaints,because if an incarcerated plaintiff subjective fear of abuse in a particular penal facility were enough to mandate a transfer out of that facility during trial,then why not also during depositions,during all phases of discovery,or,indeed,as soon as the complaint is filed 
this is not to suggest that district courts should afford anything but careful review to incarcerated litigants claims that fears of retaliation hamper their presentation of evidence in cases against prison officials.depending on the circumstances,we expect that any number of steps might be taken to mitigate such fears,including the accommodation suggested by the defendants here,namely,placement in a unit during the course of trial.see regs.tit,providing for inmates in protective custody to be housed in shu to maximize the safety and security of both the inmates and the facility indeed,had the district court decided that in this case it was,in fact,appropriate to grant an adjournment and transfer the trial,we would view such a ruling as also falling within the court broad discretion.nevertheless,mindful of the ease with which claimants may assert subjective fears of abuse,as well as the considerable challenges that confront penal authorities in ensuring the lawful confinement,transportation,and transfer of thousands of inmates,some of whom,like lewis,have demonstrated records for violence even in custody that demand placement,we decline to hold that the district court was required to grant such an adjournment.
finally,in upholding the district court denial of the continuance requested here,we note that lewis has not demonstrated good cause for failing to alert the district court to his concerns about great meadow in a timely fashion.lewis assertion that he did not know that he would be housed at great meadow until on the morning of trial is hardly convincing.lewis may not have known for a fact that he would be so housed,but neither he nor his counsel can claim surprise in light of the totality of the circumstances.lewis was a violent criminal serving,in effect,a life sentence for multiple murders.he also had a record for violence in prison lewis could hardly have expected to be confined during the pendency of his civil trial in anything but a facility moreover,neither he nor his counsel could reasonably have thought that lewis would continue to be housed at auburn during trial and transported daily to the federal courthouse in albany,a driving distance of more than miles each way.thus,the very real probability that lewis would be detained during trial at great meadow should have been apparent to him and his lawyer well before jury selection.if lewis feared detention in that facility and wished to ensure his confinement elsewhere,he or his counsel should have made a motion before the day of trial.
even if lewis could not have anticipated his transfer to great meadow before the morning of trial,the transcript indicates that lewis was in contact with his attorney both before and during jury selection and,according to lewis,both were aware of lewis impending transfer before the morning proceedings began.however,rather than bring these concerns to the district court attention promptly,lewis and his counsel waited until moments before opening statements were to be made.although the delay was over an that brief time,a pretrial conference was held,during which the parties were specifically asked to raise any issues requiring resolution before the trial began.more important,a jury was selected and sworn.in denying the requested continuance,the district court could have properly considered plaintiff failure to raise his concerns about great meadow housing or to seek an adjournment during this critical time.
in sum,because lewis failed to demonstrate that his fear of confinement at great meadow during trial was objectively reasonable so as to warrant his refusal to testify at trial,and unreasonably delayed in moving to avoid trial confinement at great meadow,we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in refusing to grant an adjournment and to transfer the trial to another courthouse within the northern district.
dismissal for refusal to testify 
we proceed to consider the district court related,yet analytically distinct decision to dismiss lewis case with prejudice in light of his refusal to testify in the absence of an adjournment and transfer.
it is beyond dispute under our precedent that a district court may dismiss a case under rule b when the plaintiff refuses to go forward with a properly scheduled trial.zagano fordham,cir see generally charles wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at nn.ed.an action may be dismissed under federal rule b if the plaintiff,without offering some explanation that is satisfactory to the court,is not ready to present his or her case at trial or if the plaintiff refuses to proceed at the trial.
our sister circuits agree.one naturally expects the plaintiff to be present and ready to put on her case when the day of trial arrives.a litigant day in court is the culmination of a lawsuit,and trial civil trial an increasingly precious commodity in our nation courts.moffitt.state bd.of,at.thus,where a district court is confronted with a plaintiff unwillingness to proceed on the date scheduled for trial,as opposed to the more typical failure to comply with her discovery obligations on time,or to meet some other deadline,it is not unreasonable to consider treating such unwillingness more severely.id.internal quotation marks omitted see knoll v.at t,cir where a plaintiff does not appear at the trial date or,as in this case,is inexcusably unprepared to prosecute the case,rule b dismissal is particularly appropriate.indeed,such behavior constitutes the epitome of a failure to prosecute.owen wangerin,cir the remedy of dismissal for failure to prosecute is usually applied when the plaintiff is not ready for trial or fails to appear.brock unique racquetball health clubs,cir recognizing in context of rule that trial judge must have broad latitude to impose the sanction of default for occurring after a trial has begun.citations omitted 
this reasoning applies with no less force where,as here,a party expressed unwillingness to proceed to trial follows the denial of a request for a continuance.see,knoll v.at t,at affirming rule b dismissal where attorney,inter alia,attempted to force the court to grant a continuance by refusing to proceed on the day of trial lopez aransas county indep.sch,cir holding that trial court denial of plaintiff s oral motion for a continuance was well within its discretion and that,faced with plaintiffs refusal to proceed,district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the cause with prejudice for want of prosecution ali v.a g,cir holding that rule b dismissal was not abuse of discretion where court previously denied plaintiffs request to delay trial due to incomplete discovery and plaintiffs and their attorney were not ready to proceed on day of trial hooper chrysler motors,cir holding that district court did not abuse its discretion where case was dismissed with prejudice by the district court when plaintiff declined to go to trial after denial of his motion for continuance.to the contrary,where a plaintiff refuses to proceed with trial following a district court unfavorable ruling on a request for continuance or in limine motion,we have noted that a district court ha s no real choice but to dismiss the case.palmieri defaria,at see also zagano fordham,at observing that,upon denial of plaintiff motion to dismiss action without prejudice,plaintiff was obliged to go to trial,failing which involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute was appropriate internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original but see merker rice,cir holding that district court abused its discretion in dismissing action following plaintiff refusal to proceed without expert witness where such refusal was not arbitrary or unreasonable.
the concerns underlying these decisions are only heightened once a civil jury has been selected and sworn.t he right to a jury trial is too precious to permit its effectiveness to be destroyed by of jurors drawn caused by unnecessary delays in preparation,lack of attention to the case,or undue procrastination by party or counsel or both.theilmann rutland,at internal citation omitted.therefore,where a party fails to appear or refuses to proceed with trial after the jury ha s been drawn,dismissal with prejudice may be particularly appropriate.id.emphasis in original see also michelsen lines,cir holding that district court did not abuse its discretion where,after jury was selected,court denied renewed motion for continuance to obtain presence of plaintiff and expert,and dismissed case for failure to prosecute.see generally judith kaye,jury reform a work in progress,judicature,w e must be concerned with the quality of the jury experience for each person summoned to serve.we want jurors to experience a court system that works well,respects their time and their lives,and values their performance of this most vital civic duty.
again,we recognize that lewis refusal to testify without an adjournment and transfer was grounded in a professed concern for his personal safety if housed during trial at great meadow.we reiterate that such concerns warrant careful district court consideration.in this case,despite the fact that lewis waited until a jury was empaneled before raising his detention concerns,the district court explored various options with the detaining officials and the parties,the most promising of which was lewis detention in the great meadow shu for the brief trial.the court took a number of recesses,the last of which afforded lewis and his attorney an opportunity to consider the shu option.while our review task would be easier if,upon receiving lewis refusal to accept the shu option,the district court had provided a fuller explanation for its decision not to adjourn and transfer the option first identified by the court to order dismissal with prejudice,we nevertheless conclude that the decision manifests no abuse of discretion.
the drake factors do not dictate a contrary result 
even if we were to review the challenged dismissal by reference to the five factors identified in drake,we would reach no different conclusion.
while a delay of several weeks in prosecuting a case is not always significant,see,shannon,cir,it is more likely to be so when it occurs after a jury has been sworn because of the risk of a mistrial.peart city of new york,at holding that,while delay caused by plaintiff counsel failure to appear at trial might be said to be minimal in view of her offer to begin trying the case ten days later,we have upheld a dismissal for failure to prosecute where a plaintiff refusal to proceed to trial was of much shorter duration.in this case,lewis refusal to testify unless his case was adjourned and transferred not only risked a mistrial,it demanded it.under these circumstances,the first drake factor supports the district court decision to dismiss.
the second factor yields the same conclusion because the record demonstrates that lewis and his counsel were given both clear notice that lewis continued refusal to testify could result in dismissal and multiple opportunities to confer to determine whether to change course to avoid that result.see united states ex rel.drake norden,at lesane hall sec.analyst,at holding that brief and technical warning of dismissal to pro se plaintiff was insufficient.
while a delay of several weeks would not have prejudiced defendants in challenging the merits of lewis claim,it would have prejudiced the entity bearing their costs,the state of new york,insofar as it had expended resources to arrange for the presence of the eight defendants,an additional witness,and lewis himself in albany on the day of trial.while the need to duplicate these expenses might not,by itself,warrant dismissal,the factor lends some support to the district court decision.kaempen,cir failure to appear for trial,without excuse,prejudices an adversary and interferes with the court docket about as much as any procedural default can.the other side is likely to have spent thousands of dollars getting its lawyers ready to try the case and arranging for witnesses and exhibits to be available.if the trial does not proceed,the money and effort will have been wasted.the judge is likely to have gone to considerable trouble to clear out time from criminal cases,motion hearings,work in chambers,and other matters,for the civil trial.in many cases jurors and witnesses will have been put to great inconvenience.johnson kamminga,cir observing,in case requiring transportation of incarcerated witnesses,that the costs associated with a delay in proceeding with a trial are likely to be more burdensome than those occasioned by delays in discovery,and c onsequently,it is not unreasonable to treat a failure to attend trial more severely than a failure to comply with discovery orders in a timely fashion.
finally,while the district court did not,at least on the record,carefully balance the need to alleviate court calendar congestion against plaintiff right to his day in court,nor assess the efficacy of lesser sanctions,it is not clear how these final two factors would be weighed in this case.defense counsel did propose one compromise lewis in great meadow shu during trial,where his safety could be monitored by lewis rejected.no party suggested that lewis evidence might be offered in a form other than live testimony,see generally muhammad warden,baltimore city jail,cir discussing potential alternatives where can not be present at trial nor does such a possibility seem likely given the critical need for a jury to assess his credibility,see id.at observing that where credibility assessment is critical n ot only the appearance but the reality of justice is obviously threatened by inmate witness absence see also stone morris,cir discussing factors relevant to determining whether should be permitted to testify in person,including whether the prisoner is the only person who can render testimony consistent with the allegations of his complaint accordingly,we view these two factors as neutral,neither supporting nor undermining the challenged dismissal decision.
thus,although we do not think the drake factors are particularly useful to our analysis of the dismissal judgment in this case,because three of those factors support the dismissal,while two of the factors are neutral,we conclude that,even on such review,the judgment should be affirmed.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude as follows 
the challenged judgment of dismissal for failure to prosecute pursuant to.b,entered after the jury was sworn,is properly reviewed by considering a the district court refusal to grant an adjournment and transfer of the case and b the district court decision to dismiss the case with prejudice when plaintiff,upon failing to secure the requested adjournment and transfer,refused to testify at trial.
the district court acted within its discretion in denying adjournment and transfer where plaintiff a failed to demonstrate that his subjective concerns about detention at great meadow were also objectively reasonable and not adequately accommodated by placement in the great meadow shu and b should have recognized and raised his concerns about great meadow detention long before the jury was sworn.
the district court similarly acted within its discretion in dismissing plaintiff case with prejudice when,upon failing to secure the requested adjournment and transfer of his trial,he refused to adduce the only direct evidence supporting his claim,his own testimony.
because three of the factors identified in united states ex rel.drake norden,cir also support dismissal,while two are neutral,the district court judgment must be affirmed even on such analysis.
the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.
i respectfully dissent because i believe that the district court improperly denied lewis his day in court.see truax corrigan.t he due process clause requires that every man shall have the protection of his day in court sokol holdings,bmb munai,cir it is a fundamental principle of american law that every person is entitled to his or her day in court.quoting tice am.airlines,cir see also holt pitts,cir w hen an inmate civil action reaches the trial stage,and his claim proves sufficiently meritorious to survive motions for dismissal and summary judgment,a court must then take all reasonable steps necessary to insure that the inmate receives the fair day in court to which he is entitled.

as the majority indicates,at approximately on the first day of trial,lewis counsel advised lewis that during the trial he would be housed at great meadow,the facility where the alleged assaults had occurred and where certain of the defendants were still employed.majority op.at see appellant supp,dated,at.by,lewis had raised with the district court through counsel his concern about testifying particularly against the defendants who are now assigned to great meadow.trial tr.at.by,lewis case was dismissed with prejudice.id.at.
upon hearing lewis concerns on the morning of june,the assistant state attorney general defending the case stated that he could try to arrange a new facility at which lewis could be housed during trial but also noted that he could not do that at the moment.trial tr.at.shortly after,the district court stated that it could understand lewis discomfort,and,upon confirming that certain of the defendants were in fact still assigned to great meadow,the district court not lewis sua sponte raised the option of adjournment.id.at.t he other choice is to adjourn this trial for about a few weeks or a month and the case can be tried in syracuse for a few days,which would have allowed lewis to avoid being housed at great meadow during his trial.id.
at approximately,lewis trial counsel stated to the district court that lewis fears for his life if he ever brought back to great meadow and that lewis preference would be to have this trial adjourned and then rescheduled to be tried out in syracuse.id.at.lewis counsel made clear that lewis was not agreeing to a dismissal,and he not requesting that.id.at.
in dismissing lewis case with prejudice shortly before,the district court appears not to have conducted any hearing,for example,regarding lewis claim of possible reprisals.the rationale offered for the district court decision appears to be that the plaintiff has no right to select the facility he going to stay at during the two or trial and t here a presumption that any facility he staying at,he going to be treated properly and lawfully.id.at.
unlike the majority,i believe that in reviewing the district court decision to dismiss this case with prejudice,we should apply the factors set forth in united states ex rel.drake norden,cir.see id.w e review the trial court decision to dismiss for failure to prosecute by examining whether the plaintiff failure to prosecute caused a delay of significant duration plaintiff was given notice that further delay would result in dismissal defendant was likely to be prejudiced by further delay the need to alleviate court calendar congestion was carefully balanced against plaintiff right to an opportunity for a day in court and the trial court adequately assessed the efficacy of lesser sanctions.the conclusion i draw easily from such analysis is that this is not one of those rare occasions when the drastic remedy of dismissal was warranted.colon mack,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
first,it is clear that,but for the fact that he learned on the morning of trial that he would be housed at great meadow,lewis was prepared to testify at trial.see peterson term taxi,cir per curiam.a relatively brief postponement of the trial at most a few weeks or a month,as suggested sua sponte by the court below would have been an inconsequential delay in the history of this case.see lesane hall sec.analyst,cir lucas miles,cir see also francis morganthau,civ,wl,at may.
