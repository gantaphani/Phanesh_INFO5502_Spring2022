this appeal stems from francisco garcia dismissal from a new york state medical school,the state university of new york health sciences center at brooklyn suny,following his repeated failure to successfully complete the medical school curriculum.after his dismissal,garcia visited a psychologist who subsequently diagnosed him as having attention deficit disorder and a learning disability.relying on this diagnosis,garcia sought readmission to suny.although suny agreed to readmit garcia,the two could not come to terms on how much of the curriculum garcia would have to retake and so garcia never actually.
instead,garcia brought suit against suny and various suny administrators and professors.garcia complaint alleged violations of the free speech guarantee of the first amendment,see const.amend.i,title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,see,and of the rehabilitation act,see a.the complaint was dismissed by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york reena raggi,district judge.see garcia state of new york health sciences ctr.at brooklyn,no.cv,wl.we affirm the district court judgment dismissing the complaint.
among other issues,this appeal raises the following question of first impression whether,consistent with the eleventh amendment guarantee of state sovereign immunity,title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act may be applied against states in private suits seeking money damages.
background 
garcia enrolled in the medical program at suny in the fall of.his first year was not a successful one.garcia failed four anatomy,genetics,neuroscience,and was in the lowest quartile in four others.
on may,after he received his failing mark in gross anatomy,garcia and six other students who failed the course wrote a letter to the chairman of the department of anatomy and cell biology,siddiqui.the letter requested a change in suny policy that required them to retake the entire gross anatomy course over the summer.they sought instead to retake only the portions of the course they had failed.their request was rejected.
because of garcia poor grades,the first year grades committee grades committee recommended that he repeat the entire first year curriculum.garcia appealed this decision to the academic promotions committee promotions committee.he denied that he had any difficulty understanding concepts,solving problems or learning material and stated that he could do better next year by working harder.the promotions committee upheld the grades committee decision and required garcia to repeat the first year curriculum.
garcia second year at suny,which represented his second try at the first year curriculum,while somewhat improved,was still unsuccessful.he failed neuroscience again and barely passed embryology and biology.this time the grades committee,after reviewing his academic record,recommended that he be dismissed.the promotions committee agreed and,in june,garcia was officially dismissed from suny.
thereafter,garcia arranged to be examined by an outside psychologist,elizabeth auricchio.she diagnosed him as having attention deficit disorder add and a learning disability ld.on approximately august,garcia forwarded this diagnosis to suny with a request that he be readmitted and either have his neuroscience grade adjusted to a passing mark or be permitted to take a neuroscience exam scheduled for august.
on august,suny agreed to readmit garcia,but refused to adjust his neuroscience grade or to permit him to sit for the august.instead,suny conditioned garcia readmission on his retaking the second and third trimesters of the first year curriculum,working with suny counselors to develop a study regimen to overcome his add and ld difficulties,and undergoing a psychiatric evaluation and,if appropriate,treatment for his add.
garcia states that given his age at the time,his financial situation and the humiliation he would face in explaining to family and friends that he was redoing the first year curriculum a third time,he rejected suny proposal.he responded with a that he be permitted to advance to the second year curriculum without successfully completing neuroscience,and the following summer retake a neuroscience course or exam.suny rejected this proposal,explaining that,
a student must successfully complete all basic science courses in the year in order to progress into the succeeding year.with your unsatisfactory grade in neuroscience,a major course in the first year curriculum,you are not eligible to take second year courses.
no further proposals were made,and garcia was not readmitted to suny.
garcia filed suit in federal district court in brooklyn seeking million in damages from suny and the other defendants garcia did not request injunctive relief.his complaint alleged that his dismissal from suny in june was in retaliation for the may letter he had to siddiqui opposing suny requirement that he retake gross anatomy during that summer,and that the defendants refusal to permit him to sit for the neuroscience exam or to adjust his neuroscience exam to a passing mark violated both title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act.
judge raggi granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.she concluded,inter alia,that the letter to siddiqui did not involve speech on a matter of public concern and thus was not protected by the first amendment,and the accommodations garcia sought under title ii and were unreasonable.this appeal followed.
while the appeal was pending,the supreme court handed down its decision in bd.of tr.of of garrett,d.the court held that title i of the ada,which prohibits the states,municipalities and other employers from discriminat ing against a qualified individual with a disability because of th at disability in regard to terms,conditions,and privileges of employment,a,is not an effective abrogation of state sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.see garrett.at.in light of garrett,we requested that the parties brief the question of whether title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act validly abrogate state sovereign immunity.the united states intervened with respect to this question.
discussion 
first amendment retaliation 
garcia contends that in dismissing his first amendment retaliation claim,the district court erroneously relied on the public concern doctrine to hold that his may letter to siddiqui was not protected speech.under the public concern doctrine,when expression can not be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social or other concern to the community,but is simply a personal matter,it is not afforded first amendment protection.connick myers,d.
suny correctly concedes that the public concern doctrine does not apply to student speech in the university setting,see qvyjt lin,but is reserved for situations where the government is acting as an employer,see,pickering bd.of,d hellstrom dep t of veterans affairs,cir morris lindau,cir.
the key to the first amendment analysis of government employment decisions is this the government interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer.the government can not restrict the speech of the public at large just in the name of efficiency.but where the government is employing someone for the very purpose of effectively achieving its goals,such restrictions may well be appropriate.
waters churchill,d plurality.
if every personnel decision were subjected to intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment,effective government administration would be threatened and,in turn,the efficient provision of services and benefits would be jeopardized.connick,at.limiting first amendment protection to speech related to matters of public concern ameliorates this risk it strikes a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.id.at.quoting pickering,at.
university students are not employed by the government,so the government interest in functioning efficiently is subordinate to the students interest in free speech.waters,at.the need for the public concern doctrine to accommodate an elevated efficiency interest is therefore wholly absent.university students speech deserves the same degree of protection that is afforded generally to citizens in the community,not the curtailed protection afforded government employees.see healy james,d stating that state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the first amendment and the first amendment protections should apply with no less force on college campuses than in the community at large.
despite conceding that the district court erred in applying the public concern doctrine to garcia case,suny argues that the dismissal of garcia claim should nonetheless be affirmed.suny contends that garcia has failed to advance factual allegations supporting a prima facie case of retaliation.we agree.
to survive summary dismissal,a plaintiff asserting a first amendment retaliation claim must advance allegations establishing that the speech or conduct at issue was protected,that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff,and that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse action.dawes walker,cir see also blatter,cir en banc per curiam.garcia has failed to meet the third showing.there is no material evidence of a causal relation between the may letter garcia to siddiqui and garcia dismissal from suny in june of.in fact,the record belies his claim of retaliation some thirteen months passed between the date of the letter and his dismissal,numerous suny officials on both the grades committee and the promotions committee approved his dismissal,those officials did so based on substantial evidence of garcia persistent academic deficiencies,and suny made a reasonable proposal in good faith that,if accepted,would have avoided garcia dismissal.

title ii of the ada 
suny and the other defendants argue that garcia title ii claim for money damages against them is barred by the eleventh amendment.in dube state of new york,we held that f or eleventh amendment purposes,suny is an integral part of the government of the state of new york and when it is sued the state is the real party,cir internal quotation marks omitted.insofar as garcia is suing the individual defendants in their official capacities,he is seeking damages from new york,and the eleventh amendment therefore shields them to the same extent that it shields suny.see,will michigan dep t of state police,d kentucky graham,d.insofar as garcia is suing the individual defendants in their individual capacities,neither title ii of the ada nor of the rehabilitation act provides for individual capacity suits against state officials.see walker snyder,cir title ii,cert.denied,d alsbrook city of maumelle,cir en banc title ii calloway boro of glassboro dep t of police,d,title ii and collecting similar cases montez romer,d,title ii and.
eleventh amendment principles 
the eleventh amendment of the federal constitution provides in relevant part 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state 
const.amend.xi.on its face,the eleventh amendment does not reveal its applicability to the case at hand,for garcia is not bringing suit against new york as a citizen of another state.see seminole tribe of florida,d stating the text of the amendment would appear to restrict only the article iii diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts.
yet,as the supreme court has confirmed for over a century,see hans louisiana,the significance of the eleventh amendment is not what it provides in its text,but the larger background principle of state sovereign immunity that it confirms.seminole tribe,at.the ultimate guarantee of the eleventh amendment is that nonconsenting states may not be sued by private individuals in federal court.garrett.at.
this guarantee is not absolute.congress may abrogate the immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and act s pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.id.at quoting kimel florida bd.of regents,d.with respect to title ii of the ada,it is clear that the congress fully intended to abrogate state sovereign immunity.see a state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the constitution of the united states from an action in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.what is unresolved,however,is whether title ii was enacted pursuant to a grant of constitutional authority that empowers congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity.
in enacting title ii,congress purported to rely on its authority under both the commerce clause of article i and of the fourteenth amendment.see b invoking the sweep of congressional authority,including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce,in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced by people with disabilities.to the extent that title ii rests on congress authority under the commerce clause,it can not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity.this is because congress may not base its abrogation of the states eleventh amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in article garrett.at see also seminole tribe,at.the eleventh amendment restricts the judicial power under article iii,and article i can not be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.
section of the fourteenth amendment,however,does grant congress the authority to abrogate the states sovereign immunity.kimel,at.thus,if title ii is a valid exercise of congress power,then nonconsenting states may be hailed into federal court by private individuals seeking money damages.see garrett.at.we turn our attention to this critical issue.
title ii and of the amendment 
section of the fourteenth amendment authorizes congress to enforce,by appropriate legislation the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty or property,without due process of law,nor deny any person equal protection of the laws.city of boerne flores,d.when operating under,congress may prohibit conduct that itself violates the fourteenth amendment substantive guarantees.congress may also remedy or deter violations of these guarantees by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct than is otherwise unconstitutional,garrett.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted,subject to the requirement that there be congruence and proportionality between the violation to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.city of boerne,at.congress may go no further,however,for to do so would work a substantive redefinition of the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment,and congress has been given only the power to enforce,not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.kimel,at.citations omitted emphasis in original see college sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d t he term enforce in is to be taken seriously the object of valid legislation must be the carefully delimited remediation or prevention of constitutional violations.
we turn to the specific question of whether title ii of the ada is within the ambit of congress authority under.where disability discrimination is at issue,the fourteenth amendment only proscribes government conduct for which there is no rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.see garrett.at cleburne cleburne living center,d.indeed,so long as a state disparate actions are rationally related to a legitimate purpose,no fourteenth amendment violation is presented even if the actions are done quite hard headedly or hardheartedly.garrett.at.
several baseline considerations are applied under the fourteenth amendment to determine whether such a rational relationship in fact exists.first,the classification is permissible so long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.see heller doe,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.second,a state has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.id.a statute is presumed constitutional and t he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.and finally,because t he problems of government are practical ones and may justify,if they do not require,rough accommodations,the fit between the classification and the asserted government justification may be imperfect and may in practice result in some inequality.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
assessing the strictures of title ii against these baselines,the extent to which title ii is neither congruent nor proportional to the proscriptions of the fourteenth amendment becomes apparent.consider title ii requirement as implemented through the doj regulations,see that a state make reasonable modifications in its programs,services or activities,see b,for qualified individual s with a disability,unless the state can establish that the modification would work a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program,service,or activity,see b.while the absence of a reasonable accommodation would be permissible under the fourteenth amendment so long as there were any rational basis for the absence,this provision of title ii allows but a single basis for not providing the accommodation a showing that a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program,service,or activity would occur.see thompson colorado,cir in contrast to the equal protection clause prohibition on invidious discrimination against the disabled and irrational distinctions between the disabled and the nondisabled,title ii requires public entities to recognize the unique position of the disabled and to make favorable accommodations on their behalf.
moreover,whereas under the fourteenth amendment the absence of an accommodation would be presumptively permissible with the burden of challenging it squarely on the plaintiff,title ii shifts the burden of proof onto the state to defend the absence.indeed,this burden shift is consistent with the elevated scrutiny generally applied to suspect classifications such as race and nationality,suggesting that title ii is working a substantive elevation in the status of the disabled in equal protection jurisprudence.see garrett.at title i of the ada makes it the employer duty to prove that it would suffer an undue burden,instead of requiring as the constitution does that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer decision.kimel,at.measured against the rational basis standard of our equal protection jurisprudence,the adea plainly imposes substantially higher burdens on state employers t he act substantive requirements nevertheless remain at a level akin to our heightened scrutiny cases.
finally,while the fourteenth amendment countenances inequality in the treatment of the disabled as long as the disparate treatment is rationally related to a legitimate government end,title ii requirement that state governments make reasonable modifications is far broader the eradication of unequal effects.specifically,title ii focuses on disparate effects divorced from any inquiry into intent.see generally roger hartley,the new federalism and the ada state sovereign immunity from private damage suits after boerne,soc.change,no other civil rights statute so aggressively roots out needless impediments to full participation in the mainstream of american economic and social life.even in cases involving suspect classifications subject to heightened scrutiny under the fourteenth amendment,disparate effects alone are insufficient to establish an equal protection violation.see garrett.at citing washington davis,d see also alsbrook,at stating that it can not be said that title ii identifies or counteracts particular state laws or specific state actions which violate the constitution.title ii targets every state law,policy,or program city of boerne,at.in most cases,the state laws to which rfra applies are not ones which will have been motivated by religious bigotry.
although we find that title ii in its entirety exceeds congress authority under,this conclusion does not end our inquiry as to whether title ii validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.this is because title ii need only comport with congress authority to the extent that the title allows private damage suits against states for violations.
title ii itself is silent as to the parameters of when a monetary recovery may be had see.instead,title ii simply incorporates the remedial scheme of the rehabilitation act of,see a incorporated into title ii by,which in turn incorporates the remedial scheme of title vi of the civil rights act of,et.see ferguson city of phoenix,cir.and significantly,title vi remedial scheme includes a judicially implied private cause of action.see guardians ass civil serv.comm n,d.thus,by referencing title vi remedial scheme,title ii and of the rehabilitation act incorporate an implied private right of action.
this is significant because,when operating in the realm of judicially implied private rights of action,courts have a measure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the statute.gebser lago vista independent sch,d because congress did not expressly create a private right of action under title ix,the statutory text does not shed light on the scope of available remedies.we believe this latitude allows us to restrict the availability of title ii monetary suits against the states in a manner that is consistent with congress authority,and that thereby validly abrogates state sovereign immunity from private monetary suits under title ii.indeed,since congress expressly intended to abrogate the states sovereign immunity under title ii,see,it is particularly appropriate that we fashion the scope of the implied right in a manner that effectuates this aim and,at the same time,does not offend the constitution.gebser,at.see also franklin gwinnett county publ,d a lthough we examine the text and history of a statute to determine whether congress intended to create a right of action,we presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless congress has expressly indicated otherwise.emphasis added citations omitted.moreover,to do otherwise would lead to the following anomalous result congress passing a law that leaves the courts responsible for establishing the contours of the remedial scheme,only to have the courts adopt a scheme that compels a conclusion that the statute exceeds congress constitutional authority.public citizen united states dep t of justice,d counseling that courts should avoid interpretations that would render a statute unconstitutional.
the question,therefore,is how title ii monetary claims against the states can be limited so as to comport with congress authority.the answer,we believe,is to require plaintiffs bringing such suits to establish that the title ii violation was motivated by discriminatory animus or ill will based on the plaintiff disability.government actions based on discriminatory animus or ill will towards the disabled are generally the same actions that are proscribed by the fourteenth,conduct that is based on irrational prejudice or wholly lacking a legitimate government interest.see james leonard,a damaged remedy disability discrimination claims against state entities under the americans with disabilities act after seminole tribe and flores.
we believe that adopting any lesser culpability standard for title ii monetary suits against states would do little to achieve the congruence and proportionality required under of the fourteenth amendment.the point is made clear by consideration of the next lower culpability standard available allowing monetary awards upon a showing of an intentional or willful violation of title ii itself.simply requiring a knowing violation of title ii would still leave states subject to monetary liability for the full spectrum of conduct
