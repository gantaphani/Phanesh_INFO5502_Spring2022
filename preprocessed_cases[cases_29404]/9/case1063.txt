this case requires us to decide whether the city of new york city fire alarm inspectors must be compensated under the fair labor standards act flsa,et,for all or part of their commuting time from home to work and back because they are required by their employer to carry and keep safe necessary inspection documents during their commutes.rajkumar singh,thomas matthews,vivek patil,trushant shah,faramarz robeny and fredo joseph collectively the plaintiffs appeal from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york castel,granting summary judgment in favor of the city and denying the plaintiffs for summary judgment.we hold that,in the particular circumstances of this case,the mere carrying of inspection documents without any other active responsibilities while commuting is not work under the flsa,except to the extent that it increases the duration of the commute.the record shows that any increase in commuting time in this case is de minimis as a matter of law and thus not compensable under the flsa.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment,concluding that none of the plaintiffs commuting time is compensable under the flsa.in addition,we conclude that singh first amendment retaliation claim is without merit because his speech was not a matter of public concern and was made only in his capacity as an employee and not as a citizen.
background 
for purposes of this appeal,we accept as true the plaintiffs version of the facts and all other undisputed facts.the plaintiffs are employed by the city as inspectors within the fire alarm inspection unit faiu in the new york fire department.as field inspectors,the plaintiffs perform fire alarm inspections throughout the five boroughs of new york city.based on a collective bargaining agreement,they are paid to complete a hour work week,from to on monday through friday,including a break for lunch.
field inspections generally take place monday through thursday,with each inspector completing approximately five scheduled and sixteen unscheduled inspections each week.on friday mornings,inspectors normally report to faiu headquarters to return completed inspection files for the past week and pick up new inspection files for the coming week.these files generally include documents describing the floor plans and fire alarm history of the buildings to be inspected various inspection checklists,forms,and reports and any correspondence between building owners and city agencies.inspectors are responsible for keeping these documents safe from the time they pick them up on friday morning until the time they return them on the following friday.the plaintiffs estimate that the collective weight of these weekly assigned materials is between fifteen and twenty pounds.
the present dispute arises from the city requirement that inspectors carry these inspection files without pay in an briefcase during their commutes from home to work and back.in order to improve efficiency and maximize hours the city does not permit inspectors to store their documents overnight at faiu headquarters or to start or end their workday at headquarters.instead,the city requires inspectors to report directly to their first inspection site at with all necessary inspection materials and to sign out at the end of the day at the closest firehouse.inspectors who report to inspection sites without the proper inspection files or who fail to keep the inspection files safe during the week are subject to discipline by the faiu.
the plaintiffs assert that carrying and keeping safe inspection files affects their commutes in various ways and that they should therefore be compensated for their time and effort.for example,matthews and shah testified that carrying documents caused them occasionally to miss a bus or train.patil and robeny similarly testified that carrying the briefcase slowed down their walk to the subway station.joseph testified that the briefcase slowed his commute by give or take ten minutes,although he admitted it was difficult to specify an exact number.singh testified that carrying the documents caused him occasionally to miss the subway and that,as a result,he had to plan for twenty or thirty minutes extra time for his commute each way.singh further testified that he would sometimes take the subway in the opposite direction of where he was heading in order to board a train with fewer people and more space for his briefcase.in addition,several inspectors complained that keeping the documents safe after work hours was inconvenient,preventing them from attending social events because they had to go directly home in order to ensure the safety of the documents.the plaintiffs do not assert that they were assigned any other tasks during their commutes.
separately,singh contends that the city violated his first amendment rights when it suspended him without pay for thirty days in alleged retaliation for voicing concerns regarding the city policy as well as its policy of retaining inspectors in provisional status for longer than nine months.singh complained to various supervisors and fire department officials on several occasions in and about the requirement that inspectors transport and safeguard inspection documents,stating his belief that the practice violated the flsa.following those complaints,on april,singh reported to his first inspection site without inspection documents.henry gittlitz,manager,informed singh that his actions were a dereliction of duty and cautioned that any repeat behavior would result in administrative charges.in june,singh wrote on his time sheets that his workday began and ended at home.deputy chief fire inspector barrington brown directed singh to discontinue this practice and informed him that his behavior could lead to administrative and criminal charges.singh was later suspended for thirty days without pay on july.the fire department provided singh with a memorandum detailing the five charges against him on august.this litigation began shortly thereafter.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on both the flsa and the first amendment retaliation claims.see singh city of new york,d.on the flsa claim,the district court noted that ordinary commuting time is not compensable under the flsa because the act,et,specifically excludes traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity of employment,singh,d at,but any work completed during a commute that is integral and indispensable to a principal activity of employment falls outside that exclusion,id.at.the court then found that even if carrying and possessing inspection files was necessary for the inspectors to perform their jobs,that fact without more does not make this activity integral and indispensable to the principal activity of the inspections.id.at.the district court further concluded that any additional commuting time as a result of carrying the briefcases was de minimis as a matter of law.id.at.finally,the district court rejected singh first amendment retaliation claim,explaining that his speech was not constitutionally protected because singh voiced concerns only as an employee upon matters of personal interest and not as a citizen upon matters of public concern id.at.
discussion 
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that their commuting time was not compensable under the flsa and that singh retaliation claim fails because he did not engage in protected speech on a matter of public concern.this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party and resolving all factual ambiguities in its favor.see buffalo teachers fed tobe,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if we conclude that the case presents no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
flsa claim 
we analyze the plaintiffs flsa claim in two parts whether the plaintiffs are entitled to compensation for their entire commute because the city requires them to carry inspection documents during their commute and if not,whether the plaintiffs are entitled to compensation for any additional commuting time resulting from the city policy.
all commuting time 
the flsa guarantee s compensation for all work or employment engaged in by employees covered by the act.coal,iron muscoda local.though congress has never explicitly defined what constitutes work under the flsa,the supreme court has generally described work as physical or mental exertion whether burdensome or not controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.id.at.see also chao gotham registry,cir.however,exertion is not necessarily required for an activity to be compensable because an employer,if he chooses,may hire a man to do nothing,or to do nothing but wait for something to happen.armour wantock.the issue is whether the time is spent predominantly for the employer benefit or for the employee which is a question dependent upon all the circumstances of the case.see also reich new england telecomms,cir.
because the activity at issue here occurs outside the scheduled workday,the act,which amended the flsa,adds a further obstacle to the plaintiffs potential recovery.the act exempts employers from compensating employees under the flsa for or on account of time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities of employment and any activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities.a.the supreme court has interpreted this provision to mean that any activity that is integral and indispensable to a principal activity is itself a principal activity.ibp,alvarez,d.accordingly,while employees need not be compensated for or on account of commuting to and from work,they must be compensated for any work performed during a commute that is integral and indispensable to a principal activity of their employment.see reich city transit,cir smith aztec well servicing,cir aiken city of memphis,cir see also any work which an employee is required to perform while traveling must,of course,be counted as hours worked.
in short,in order for the plaintiffs to prevail under the flsa,as amended by the act,they must demonstrate that carrying inspection documents during a commute constitutes work under the flsa and is an integral and indispensable part of their inspecting duties.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the mere carrying of a briefcase without any other active responsibilities does not transform the plaintiffs entire commute into work 
as noted earlier,whether an employee expenditure of time is considered work under the flsa turns in part on whether that time is spent predominantly for the benefit of the employer or the employee.although we have not previously applied the predominant benefit standard to commuting time,we find useful guidance from flsa cases applying this test in other contexts.for example,courts frequently apply the predominant benefit standard in the context of employee break time,where employees have sought compensation for their breaks because,though relieved from normal duties,they remain responsible for certain functions in these cases,courts have distinguished between employer requirements that substantially hinder an employee ability to use the time freely and those requirements that place only a minimal burden on the employee use of time.thus,in reich southern new england telecommunications,at,we held that employees who were required to remain at their outdoor work site during their lunch breaks to maintain public safety and provide security must be compensated for that time because it was spent predominantly for the benefit of the employer.in that situation,we noted that although the employees were otherwise free to eat their lunch,they lacked flexibility with regard to the lunch break and their presence at the work site was indispensable.id.at.
importantly,we distinguished those circumstances from several cases decided by other circuits where employees,though retaining some employment duties,were significantly less burdened such that the break time remained predominantly for the employees benefit.id.at.for example,in hill united states,cir,the sixth circuit held that the postal service did not need to compensate a letter carrier for his lunch break during which he remained accountable for the safety of undelivered mail and had to carry with him various postal items and receipts.id.at.the court reasoned that these burdens did not require him to engage in any substantial activities or interfere with his lunch period to such an extent that the flsa would require compensation.id.likewise,several other circuits have held that police officers need not be compensated for meal time during which they were required to remain in uniform and to respond to calls for assistance and inquiries from the public,because those minimal restrictions,though benefitting the employer,still permitted the officers flexibility and independence such that they predominantly benefitted from the time.see,avery city of talladega,cir armitage city of emporia,cir.
this case is significantly more similar to these latter cases than to southern new england telecommunications.carrying a briefcase during a commute presents only a minimal burden on the inspectors,permitting them freely to use their commuting time as they otherwise would have without the briefcase.whether it be reading,listening to music,eating,running errands,or whatever else the plaintiffs choose to do,their use of the commuting time is materially unaltered.while the city certainly benefits from the plaintiffs carrying these materials,it can not be said that the city is the predominant beneficiary of this time.
we acknowledge that the constraints of commuting may limit an employee ability to use commuting time as freely as in other contexts,such as during a break.but those constraints,which are normal incidents of employment,see,should not factor into the predominant benefit test,just as the constraints of a remote work site should not factor into the test for a worker who can not use his break time as freely as he could with a more convenient work site.in the commuting context,we believe that the appropriate application of the predominant benefit test is whether an employer restrictions hinder the employees ability to use their commuting time as they otherwise would have had there been no restrictions.based on this test,we conclude that the mere carrying of inspection documents does not transform plaintiffs otherwise commute into compensable time 
although we reach our holding based on the predominant benefit test,our analysis in many ways resembles a de minimis test.in an analogous case,the sixth circuit held that police officers need not be compensated for their entire commuting time,during which they were required to monitor police radios in order to respond to emergencies,because the amount of work involved in monitoring a police radio during a commute is simply de minimis.aiken,at.as the court explained,the compensability of the commute is determined by whether the employer requires the employee to perform a significant amount of work during the commute.id.at.our analysis mirrors that of the sixth circuit we simply reach our holding through a slightly different path.the point is that,under either approach,when an employee is minimally restricted by an employer during a commute,such that his or her use of commuting time is materially unaltered,the commuting time will generally not be compensable under the flsa.
in deciding this case,we note the practical consequences of the plaintiffs challenge.ruling in their favor could have a impact,suddenly imposing upon businesses across the country a liability to compensate employees anytime those employees must commute to work with important documents,tools,or communications devices in the sixty years following the act,we are unaware of any court that has required employers to pay employees for otherwise commuting time simply because employees must travel with a briefcase or a small toolbox or a handheld device in order to be prepared for the work
