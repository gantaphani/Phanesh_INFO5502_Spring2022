this is an employment discrimination case in which three ousted employees challenge the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of their quondam employer.after close perscrutation of a substantial record,we conclude i that we have jurisdiction over this appeal ii that the lower court permissibly refused to consider the employees of material facts iii that the employees knowingly and voluntarily released their claims under both federal and local law coincident with the termination of their employment iv that those releases were valid,enforceable,not the product of coercion,and dispositive of the claims asserted by the employees here and v that,in the absence of viable claims on the part of the employees,the derivative claims mounted by their spouses can not stand.accordingly,we affirm the entry of summary judgment.
background 
prior to,alejandro cabán hernández cabán,peter villano blas villano,and josé colón luna colón toiled in puerto rico for philip morris usa.during that year,philip morris undertook a corporate restructuring,the aim of which was to align its puerto rico operations more closely with its operations in the continental united states.as part and parcel of this reorganization,philip morris notified cabán,villano,and colón collectively,the appellants,early in,that their positions were to be eliminated.
philip morris afforded the appellants an opportunity to interview for jobs within the restructured enterprise.but there was a rub spanish was the appellants native them,only villano was fluent in the new posts required an ability to communicate effectively in english.
in may of,all three appellants participated in an interview process.cabán and colón were not offered new positions.villano received an offer but for a job that he deemed unsuitable.the employment of all three men with philip morris ended shortly thereafter.they did,however,elect to receive special severance benefits a subject to which we shortly shall return.
in march of,the appellants brought a civil action in puerto rico federal district court.in their complaint,they alleged that philip morris had discriminated against them on the basis of their national origin,in violation of to title vii and laws ann.tit,law.they claimed,among other things,that philip morris had fostered a work environment that was discriminatory,hostile,and harassing as to employees that they had been trimmed from the payroll as a direct result of this discriminatory animus and that the company had imposed the requirement for the revamped positions as a means of ensuring their departures.
the appellants wives joined in the suit.they brought claims under article of the civil code,laws ann.tit,averring that philip morris discriminatory actions toward their husbands had caused them the wives mental anguish and emotional distress.
philip morris denied the material allegations of the complaint and pleaded an affirmative defense of release.see.c.at the conclusion of discovery,it moved for summary judgment.see.c.in connection with that motion it submitted,as required by the district court local rules,a statement of material facts not in dispute,adorned with record citations.see b.although the appellants seasonably opposed the motion,the district court determined that the of facts upon which their opposition relied was not in conformity with the local rules.see c.consequently,the court deemed philip morris statement of facts admitted.see e.
in due course,the district court granted the summary judgment motion,concluding that the appellants had executed valid releases when they left their employment and that those releases barred the prosecution of the claims asserted in the complaint.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
the appellants suggest for the first time in their reply brief that we lack jurisdiction over their appeal because the district court grant of summary judgment did not finally dispose of all claims against all parties.ordinary rules do not apply with respect to claims that a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.see,am.fiber finishing,tyco healthcare,cir see also puerto rico,cir explaining that b ecause federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,they have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects whenever such defects come to their attention.accordingly,we begin with the jurisdictional objection.
to put this objection into perspective,we must canvass the record.in their complaint,the appellants named what appeared to be two discrete corporations,philip morris usa,and philip rico,as defendants.both were served but only the former answered the complaint and,later,moved for summary judgment.
building on this foundation,the appellants posit that they are entitled to a default judgment against philip rico.see.a.they further posit that the existence of this loose end deprives us of appellate jurisdiction see.b see also alstom caribe,geo.reintjes,cir explaining that to be final and,thus,immediately appealable,a decision must be one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment quoting catlin united states.
this nascent jurisdictional objection does not survive scrutiny.the record reflects that,shortly after suit was commenced,the district court scheduled its initial conference.see.b.in preparing for that conference,the parties stipulated that philip morris usa maintained a branch office in puerto rico and did business in puerto rico under the name philip rico.the clear import of this stipulation was that philip rico was not a separate corporate entity but,rather,a division of philip morris usa.
the district court accepted this stipulation and,in subsequent orders,referred to the employer as philip morris usa.consistent with this understanding,the court,in granting summary judgment,noted that philip morris puerto rico branch had been merged into philip morris usa several years before the occurrence of the events giving rise to this suit.see cabán hernández philip morris usa,slip op.at,unpublished.
the parties stipulation resolves the jurisdictional objection.stipulations eliminate the need for proving essentially uncontested facts,thus husbanding scarce judicial resources.gomez rivera rodríguez,cir.since stipulations are important to the efficient and expeditious progress of litigation in the federal courts,parties are encouraged to stipulate as to factual matters.see ti fed.credit union delbonis,cir.once a party has entered into a stipulation,however,that party is not at liberty to renege unilaterally on a stipulated fact without leave of court,which ordinarily will not be granted absent a showing of good cause.see am.honda motor richard lundgren,cir ti fed.credit union,at.
here,the trial court correctly read the stipulation to mean that there was only one defendant.gomez,at determining the meaning and effect of a stipulation presents a question of law.the appellants have shown nothing that would constitute good cause or otherwise justify relief from the stipulation.certainly,the mere mention of the appellation philip rico in the corporate disclosure statement does not afford a basis for undoing the stipulation.the use of the name on the brief cover is even less informative for aught that appears,the brief cover merely replicated the caption of the case as set out in the appellants complaint.in all events,that loose language can not be used as a wedge to split an organization that the parties have agreed is a single corporation into two separate corporate entities.
to cinch matters,it is evident that philip morris relied on the stipulation and,thus,did not file an answer to the complaint on behalf of philip rico.under the circumstances,that reliance was both reasonable and detrimental.a party detrimental reliance,reasonably undertaken,weighs heavily in the balance when the adverse party attempts to revoke a factual stipulation.see am.honda,at.that weight grows even more ponderous when,as in this case,the revocation attempt is not made until after judgment has entered and the case is on appeal.
having completed our canvass of the record,we conclude,without serious question,that the stipulation must be accorded full force and effect.that conclusion,in turn,ends the jurisdictional inquiry.because the parties stipulated that philip rico is not an independent entity,the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of philip morris usa,was a final order that disposed of all claims against all parties to the case.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.see see also alstom caribe,at.
iii.the merits 
we turn now to the merits.before addressing the district court decision,we must plot the contours of the summary judgment record.then,after limning the summary judgment standard,we test the viability of the appellants statements of claim.at that stage,we divide our analysis into three segments,discussing separately the appellants title vii claims,their claims under puerto rico law,and their spouses claims.
summary judgment record.
the appellants assert that their of material facts,submitted as part of their opposition to philip morris summary judgment motion,should be considered an integral part of the summary judgment record.they base this assertion on a claim that the district court erred in finding the noncompliant with the local rules.in pertinent part,those rules require a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to accept,deny,or qualify each entry in the movant statement of material facts paragraph by paragraph and to support any denials,qualifications,or new assertions by particularized citations to the record.see c.
what transpired below is not in dispute.the appellants submitted a timely opposition to the summary judgment motion,but their of material facts did not conform to the requirements of the local rules.consequently,the district court,in accordance with the provisions of local rule e,deemed philip morris statement unopposed and accepted its stated facts as true.
before us,the appellants attempt to confess and avoid.they admit that they did not furnish specific record citations to support their version of the facts but they nonetheless argue that their submission of selected excerpts rather than unexpurgated documents minimized the hardship to the district court and,thus,constituted substantial compliance with the strictures of local rule.that argument gives short shrift to the interests at stake,and we reject it.
we repeatedly have emphasized the importance of local rules similar to local rule.such rules were inaugurated in response to this court abiding concern that,without them,summary judgment practice could too easily become a game of.ruiz rivera riley,cir.such rules are designed to function as a means of focusing a district court attention on what what is controverted.calvi knox county,cir.when complied with,they serve to dispel the smokescreen behind which litigants with marginal or unwinnable cases often seek to hide and greatly reduce the possibility that the district court will fall victim to an ambush.id.
given the vital purpose that such rules serve,litigants ignore them at their peril.in the event that a party opposing summary judgment fails to act in accordance with the rigors that such a rule imposes,a district court is free,in the exercise of its sound discretion,to accept the moving party facts as stated.see,cir ruiz rivera,at.
a review of the record in this case reveals that the district court acted justifiably in rebuffing the appellants proffered and crediting philip morris version of the facts.to begin,the appellants did not admit,deny,or qualify philip morris assertions of fact paragraph by paragraph as required by local rule c.instead,they submitted an alternate statement of facts in narrative form this failing alone would have warranted a deeming order.
to make matters worse,the appellants did not adhere to the record citation requirement.some assertions in the appellants were completely unsupported by any hint of a record citation.numerous other facts memorialized in their were supported only by general references to multiple exhibits,a reference to exhibits through,yet those transcripts and answers to comprised hundreds of pages.this is far removed from compliance with the requirement that a n assertion of fact shall be followed by a citation to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion,e emphasis supplied,and leaves the district court to grope unaided for factual needles in a documentary haystack.
rules like local rule are meant to ease the district court operose task and to prevent parties from unfairly shifting the burdens of litigation to the court.the appellants submission contravened the local rule and,thus,thwarted this salutary purpose.given this significant noncompliance,the district court did not abuse its discretion in deeming philip morris statement of facts unopposed and crediting the factual assertions contained therein.
summary judgment standard.
orders granting summary judgment engender de novo review.calvi,at.that review is confined to the record that was properly before the district court at the time of its decision.mandel boston phoenix,cir.here,then,our task is to determine whether the district court appropriately granted summary judgment based on the facts as set forth in philip morris moving papers.
we will affirm the entry of summary judgment only facts as stated show beyond any legitimate question the movant entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.see depoutot raffaelly,cir see also.c.in marshaling the facts for this purpose,we must draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.see calvi,at.that does not mean,however,that we ought to draw unreasonable inferences or credit bald assertions,empty conclusions,rank conjecture,or vitriolic invective.see cadle hayes,cir reynolds tobacco,cir.
title vii claims.
five years ago,we held squarely that rights conferred by title vii,like many other rights created by federal statutory law,may be surrendered through the execution of a release.see melanson,cir.the waiver must,of course,be knowing and voluntary.id.because release is an affirmative defense,see.c,the burden rests with the releasee to establish that a particular release satisfies these criteria.see id.at see also squibb,cir.
conducting this inquiry requires the use of a lens.we must,therefore,evaluate the totality of the circumstances in order to determine whether an employer has adequately demonstrated the knowing and voluntary character of an employee asserted waiver.see smart gillette.disab.plan,cir.we have mentioned certain factors that typically inform this inquiry.these include 
the plaintiff education,business experience,and sophistication the parties respective roles in deciding the final terms of the arrangement the agreement clarity the amount of time available to the plaintiff to study the agreement before acting on it whether the plaintiff had independent as the advice of signing the agreement and the nature of the consideration tendered in exchange for the waiver.
id.at.this list,however,is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.see id.at.as long as the circumstances viewed in the aggregate show that the waiver was knowing and voluntary,the employer need not establish that every factor cuts in its favor.
in this instance,a canvass of the six smart factors shows,beyond hope of contradiction,that each appellant waiver was knowing and voluntary.we explain briefly.
one smart the appellants philip morris unilaterally crafted the terms of the proposed settlement.that factor,however,is of only modest import here it might have cut more sharply in the appellants favor had there been evidence that they attempted to negotiate the terms of the release but were rebuffed.the summary judgment record,however,discloses no such evidence.
the first smart factor strongly favors philip morris.although the appellants educational backgrounds vary,each of them has a diploma and some educational instruction beyond the level.cabán worked for philip morris for over three decades colón worked there for nearly a and villano,after spending almost a decade in a comparable position with another firm,worked approximately five years at philip morris.all three held responsible supervisory positions,and each applied for a new position that required substantial business acumen.given the lack of any evidence to the contrary,a reasonable factfinder scarcely could conclude either that the appellants were insufficiently sophisticated to waive their claims or that those waivers were the product of anything other than free will.
the third smart factor also weighs heavily in the employer favor.the releases,all of which were substantially similar,were crystal clear.each release stated explicitly that the signer was waiving any claims,known or unknown,promises,causes of action,or similar rights against philip morris arising under the guise of many different laws including federal,state and local laws and statutes,executive orders,rules and regulations,other administrative guidelines,and common law legal doctrines.this language hardly could have been more direct or to the point.
the fourth,fifth,and sixth smart factors push in the same direction.the releases and other documents were furnished to the appellants both in english and spanish.the company then gave the appellants a significant amount of which to decide whether to sign the releases.the appellants were advised,both orally and in writing,of their right to consult with counsel before making a decision.this opportunity was not squandered two of the appellants sent the document package including the proffered release to a lawyer before executing the release.the third appellant villano spoke to an attorney before accepting the company offer,but did not submit the critical documents for the attorney perusal.
each appellant elected to take the proffered consideration and signed a version of the release.the releases provided for a rescission period that is,an employee who chose to execute a release had seven days from the date of execution within which to cancel it.none of the appellants exercised his right of rescission within the allotted time frame.
we add,moreover,that the consideration was substantial.in exchange for signing a release,an employee received a lump sum equal to three months salary as well as other benefits such as career transition services.
notwithstanding these indicia of knowledge and volition,the appellants assert that the packages they received were confusing,as each package contained both a description of the severance benefits to which a discharged employee was automatically entitled as well as a description of the additional benefits that would inure to him should he opt to sign the proffered release.we agree that,in an ideal world,a severance package might well contain completely separate forms for accepting these two types of emoluments.but employers are required to provide fair notice to affected employees,not perfect notice.here,when the entire package is taken into account,the appellants argument falters.
the most important reason is that,in a subsection entitled description of the increased benefits for eligible employees,the paperwork informed each affected employee,clearly and conspicuously,that i n addition to all of the benefits described above that is,in addition to the severance benefits to which he was would,if he sign ed the general agreement and release that was enclosed,receive the additional benefits enumerated in the materials.to reinforce this point,the materials expressly advised each affected employee that the receipt of severance benefits was not contingent on his execution of the release.in the circumstances of this case,these caveats satisfied the employer obligation to give fair notice.
to say more about the releases themselves would be supererogatory.the smart factors overwhelmingly favor a finding that the appellants knowingly and voluntarily executed the releases.that one of the six factors tends to favor the appellants is not enough to tip the summary judgment balance the law is clear that no single factor is determinative in evaluating whether a waiver is knowing and voluntary.see smart,at.it is sufficient to sustain the validity of a release and the enforceability of its terms,at the summary judgment stage,that the relevant circumstances point unerringly toward that result.
the appellants have a fallback position.they asseverate that,notwithstanding the persuasive force of the smart factors,a finding that they acted knowingly and voluntarily is precluded or,at least,called into legitimate question because they were coerced into signing the releases.in this regard,they complain that each of them felt he had no other alternative but to sign the agreement and general release due to the pressure,rage,indignation,depression,demoralization and confused mental state caused by the hostile,discriminatory work environment created by philip morris.appellants br.at.to drive this point home,the appellants attempt to draw an analogy to situations in which an employer has made working conditions so unsavory that options given to employees become nothing more than a charade.vega kodak,cir see young sw.savs.loan ass n,cir.
these importunings comprise more cry than wool.the cases that the appellants cite to support their claim of coercion are,without exception,constructive discharge cases.in those instances,the employees claimed that they were choosing between further service under intolerable working conditions and resignation.see,vega,at.here,however,there was no such hobson choice the appellants already had been told of their impending loss of employment at the time they opted to waive their rights.their choice was either to sign the proffered releases and receive extra benefits or to pursue legal action over the loss of their jobs.either way,they would no longer be subject to the hostile work environment that they claim flourished at philip morris.so viewed,that hostile work environment,even if it existed,could not have played a legally significant role in the appellants decisions to sign the proffered releases 
that ends this phase of the matter.for the reasons elucidated above,we find the case law upon which the appellants rely to be inapposite and their legal theory untenable.accordingly,we reject their claim of coercion and hold that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment on the title vii claims.
law claims.
because diversity jurisdiction is present here,see a,we also must consider the appellants claims under puerto rico law the basic premise under which diversity jurisdiction operates is straightforward a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to apply state substantive law see erie tompkins.alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir.state contract law falls within this sphere.see,pritzker yari,cir.consequently,the effect of the releases on the appellants law claims must be evaluated under substantive principles of puerto rico law.
as a general rule,r ights granted by the laws of puerto rico may be renounced,provided such renunciation be not contrary to law,to public interest or public order,or prejudicial to the interest of a third person.laws ann.tit,see ponce gas serv,save when expressly prohibited or restricted by law,rights may be waived and compromised.the appellants have not identified any provision of puerto rico civil code,or any specific tenet of puerto rico case law,that invalidates the releases or undercuts their efficacy in point of fact,the puerto rico courts have explicitly given their imprimatur to releases of employment discrimination claims.see,marte pegasus,no,wl cir,english translation unpublished.as a theoretical matter,then,a release of law claims is authorized under the law of puerto rico.
the fact that the appellants legally could have released their law claims does not mean that they did so here.the question reduces to whether the documents that they signed actually effected a release in accordance with puerto rico law.interpreting article of the civil code,laws ann.tit,the puerto rico supreme court has enumerated three requirements for the valid release or settlement of a claim i an uncertain legal relationship,ii an intent to eliminate the uncertainty,and iii reciprocal concessions.see citibank,dependable ins,offic.trans.the releases
