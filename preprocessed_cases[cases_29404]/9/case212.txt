in this employment discrimination suit,ousman cham alleges that the defendant,station operators,discriminated against him on the basis of race and national origin,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and retaliated against him for taking medical leave,in violation of the family and medical leave act fmla,et.
this appeal follows two trials.at the first trial,the district court dismissed the title vii claims before the case was submitted to the jury,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of cham on the fmla claim.the district court then granted station operators motion for a new trial.only the fmla retaliation claim was at issue in the second trial,and the jury returned a verdict for station operators on that claim.
cham appeals,challenging the dismissal of his disparate treatment title vii claim during the first trial,the grant of the defendant motion for a new trial,and the exclusion of certain evidence during the second trial.we reject cham claims of error and affirm.
factual background 
ousman cham was at the time of the second trial a year old muslim and a native of the gambia who had immigrated to the united states in.cham worked for the defendant,station operators,a division of exxon mobil from may,to may,at an exxon mobil gas station and convenience store in smithfield,rhode island.
cham was hired by station operators as a sales associate,a term for a cashier and clerk,and so remained for the duration of his employment.cham was hired as a hourly employee and shortly thereafter became a hourly employee.cham testified that he was regularly scheduled to work forty hours per week once he became a employee.the undisputed testimony at trial was that no employee was entitled to any particular shift and that cham did not have a contract with station operators guaranteeing him any shifts or even forty hours per week.full benefits were provided at hours a week.
in february,andrew pelletier became the new assistant manager at the smithfield store and so became cham supervisor.pelletier took over scheduling responsibilities in september of,and became manager in december.cham claims his hours began to be reduced when pelletier took over scheduling.
while under pelletier supervision,on december,cham was scheduled to work an shift,but did not come in or inform the store that he would not be able to work.cham testified that his car broke down on the way back from new york and he did not have access to a phone to call in to work.cham was placed on probation for violating company policy by failing to notify the store that he would not be able to make it to work.
a few weeks later,on january,cham was injured in a car accident.the next day,cham informed pelletier that he was taking fmla leave from january to february,due to a back injury sustained in the accident,on his doctor recommendation.at some point during this leave,cham informed pelletier that his leave would need to be extended until march,and cham remained out of work until march 
when cham returned to work,he was consistently scheduled to work hours per week,although his actual work hours fluctuated.sometimes he worked less than scheduled.for example,cham called out on two shifts that is,he called to say he could not work those shifts.cham claimed this reduction in scheduled hours was in retaliation for taking fmla leave and in violation of title vii.cham quit his employment at station operators on may,two days after suffering a panic attack at work that sent him to a hospital emergency room for treatment.
procedural history 
cham filed suit against station operators on may,in rhode island state court cham initial complaint alleged that station operators discriminated against him on account of race,national origin,and religion,in violation of title vii and certain provisions.the complaint pled disparate treatment,failure to promote,and hostile work environment theories under title vii.
station operators removed the case to federal court on august.cham filed a second amended complaint on february,which added new claims of interference with fmla rights and retaliation in violation of the fmla.the second amended complaint also added sex discrimination as one of the bases of the title vii claim.
cham fmla and title vii theories were advanced in his pretrial memorandum as pled in the second amended complaint,with cham additionally contending that the disparate treatment amounted to a constructive discharge.at a january,pretrial conference,cham agreed to dismissal of his title vii failure to promote claim and his fmla interference claim as.
cham first jury trial,which lasted four days,began on january,on his disparate treatment and hostile work environment claims under title vii,the fmla retaliation claim,and certain pendent claims.at the close of plaintiff evidence,station operators moved for judgment on all claims under federal rule of civil procedure a.cham counsel agreed to dismiss the hostile work environment claim.the remainder of the motion was disputed.the court dismissed the hostile work environment claim as agreed,and took the motion under advisement as to the fmla retaliation claim and the title vii disparate treatment claim.
at the close of all the evidence,station operators renewed its rule a motion as to all claims,which the court took under advisement.at the start of the final day of trial,cham moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a on his two remaining claims.cham clarified that he was no longer advancing a title vii claim of on the basis of religion or sex,leaving national origin and race as the bases of his disparate treatment claim.the district court denied cham motion and granted station operators motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the title vii disparate treatment claim.only the fmla retaliation claim went to the jury,and it returned a verdict in favor of cham and awarded in damages.no final judgment was entered.
on february,station operators filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b or,in the alternative,a new trial under rule,as to the fmla retaliation claim,which cham opposed.
on june,the district court denied the defendant request for judgment as a matter of law on the fmla retaliation claim but granted the request for a new trial on that claim.cham station operators,d.the court explained that a great deal of prejudicial evidence had been introduced which was relevant to the hostile work environment claim but was irrelevant to the fmla retaliation claim.id.at.the court noted that the hostile work environment claim was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiff after the evidence was introduced.id.the court concluded this evidence had great potential to confuse the jury and to unfairly prejudice station operators,and so granted the motion id.
station operators filed two motions in limine before the second trial,the allowance of which are claimed to be error.first,the court excluded evidence of cham work hours and schedules for all time periods before september.second,the court excluded the testimony of two health care providers who had treated cham for a panic attack on may.
the second trial,restricted to the fmla retaliation claim,lasted three days,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of station operators.the district court entered judgment in favor of station operators and cham timely appealed.
cham argues that the district court erred in granting station operators rule motion to dismiss his disparate treatment claims,in granting station operators rule motion for a new trial,and in granting the motions in limine excluding evidence of his work hours before september and his panic attack.we reject each challenge.
rule dismissal of the title vii disparate treatment claim 
we review de novo a grant of judgment under rule a.gloria,cir.a district court may grant a rule motion before the case is submitted to the jury if,after the party has been fully heard on an issue,the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.the court considers a ll of the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,and may not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence.malone lockheed martin,cir alteration in original quoting espada lugo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,the plaintiff is not entitled to inferences based on speculation and conjecture.id.quoting vázquez valentín santiago diaz,cir,rev on other grounds,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the mcdonnell douglas framework,see mcdonnell douglas green,d,governs the allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in title vii cases,as here,mary honor ctr.hicks,d.
first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.generally,a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that he is a member of a protected class he was qualified for the job the employer took an adverse employment action against him and the position remained open or was filled by a person with similar qualifications.kosereis rhode island,cir.the last two elements may var y according to the nature of the plaintiff claim,but require,among other things,a showing of an adverse employment action.alvarado santos dep t of health,cir,cert.denied,d.
once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case,the burden of production shifts to the defendant to produce evidence that the adverse employment actions were taken for a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.mary,at quoting.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.if the defendant produces such evidence,the mcdonnell douglas framework disappear s and the sole remaining issue is discrimination vel non.reeves,at quoting postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d internal quotation marks omitted.the ultimate burden of persuasion always remains on the plaintiff,who must be afforded an opportunity to show that the reasons offered by the defendant were a pretext for discrimination.id.at see also vélez thermo king de,cir.
cham theory of discrimination is that pelletier permanently reduced his scheduled weekly hours on account of race or national origin several times after pelletier assumed responsibility over work schedules in september from forty hours to hours during holiday weeks,as soon as pelletier took charge,from forty to hours following cham return from fmla leave on march,and from hours to hours in.
that cham established the first two elements of a prima facie case is not disputed.the parties do dispute whether cham hours were reduced and,if so,whether the reduction amounted to an adverse employment action whether cham was treated less favorably than employees outside of his protected class and whether there is sufficient evidence from cham that station operators proffered justification was pretextual.
we affirm the district court rejection of cham claims.the loss of a shift on holiday weeks fails because any such loss does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action.an adverse employment action typically involves discrete changes in the terms of employment,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing significant change in benefits.morales vallellanes potter,cir quoting burlington,ellerth,d,cert.denied,d.to be adverse,an employment action must materially change the conditions of plaintiffs employ.id.quoting gu bos.police dep t,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
cham claim is based on the purported loss of three shifts during the weeks encompassing labor day,thanksgiving,and christmas.such a reduction simply does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action in the context of a workplace where schedules fluctuate and no employee is entitled to any given shift.further,the decision did not cause a significant change in benefits.id.quoting burlington,at internal quotation mark omitted.it is clear from the record that the fluctuation in hours above hours did not affect cham benefits.
as to cham being scheduled for a hour shift for one week in may,that likewise does not amount to an adverse employment action.such a reduction for a single week is not an adverse employment action.there is no evidence that such a reduction was to last for longer than a week,nor that a reduction would lead to a loss of benefits provided to employees,such as health insurance.we also reject out of hand cham extreme argument that a reduction amounts to a constructive discharge,as cham working conditions were not rendered so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in his shoes would have felt compelled to resign.ahern shinseki,cir quoting marrero goya of,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
cham final variant of his disparate treatment claim is that his work schedule was reduced from forty to hours a week upon his return from fmla leave.cham theory is that he normally was scheduled to work,and did in fact work,five shifts per week,but that upon returning from fmla leave his shift was taken away,reducing his scheduled hours to per week.station operators argues that cham work hours fluctuated and his scheduling upon his return was within the scope of this normal variation.
whether cham evidence that there was a drop in scheduled hours after his fmla leave is sufficient to make a prima facie case is questionable.station operators records of employees scheduled hours for all of,except for the last week,were lost and so not in evidence.as a result,while the evidence is undisputed that cham was scheduled for hours a week from march,to may,and that he was scheduled for forty hours from january,to february,there is no evidence as to cham scheduled hours during.given the lack of schedules,it is impossible to compare cham scheduled hours from before the last week of december to the hours for which he was scheduled after his return from fmla leave.the undisputed testimony at trial was that no employee was entitled to any particular shift and that cham did not have a contract with station operators guaranteeing him any shifts.in terms of cham hours actually worked,there was substantial fluctuation in cham weekly hours before he took fmla leave.
nevertheless,there was a drop in the hours that cham actually worked from the data available cham worked an average of approximately hours per week before the fmla leave averaged over the course of his employment,and an average of approximately after leave.
even assuming that this reduction for a scheduled employee amounted to an adverse employment action for title vii disparate treatment purposes,cham failed to provide sufficient evidence that station operators proffered explanation was pretextual.the court did not err in granting station operators rule motion.we may bypass the prima facie case issue because it is clear that plaintiff has not mustered enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant stated reason for the employment action was pretextual.freadman metro.prop.cas.ins,cir see also reeves,at a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.emphasis added lockridge of me,cir rathbun autozone,cir.this reasoning applies to rule motions to dismiss at trial.see reeves,at t he standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the standard for judgment as a matter of law,such that the inquiry under each is the same.quoting anderson liberty lobby,d see also dance ripley,cir affirming dismissal of plaintiff claim at the close of plaintiff evidence because the defendant put forth a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason during plaintiff case and the plaintiff presented no evidence demonstrating pretext.
the legitimate explanation,through pelletier testimony,was that he had to hire two extra employees and needed to give them hours.one was hired to cover cham shifts when cham was on fmla leave further,cham had,before the leave,received overtime hours and station operators policy was to avoid employees working overtime.when cham returned to work,pelletier kept the new hire to cover some shifts,including the hours cham complains about,and pelletier testified that this hiring,rather than any racial animus,motivated the scheduling decisions.one of the reasons the court gave for granting the motion was that while cham was on leave,someone was hired to cover his shifts,and that this was a legitimate reason for cham scheduling when he returned from leave.
there is no evidence of pretext.pelletier,the supervisor cham claims was racially motivated to reduce his hours after the fmla leave,did not materially reduce cham hours from september,when pelletier took charge of scheduling,to january,just before cham fmla leave.cham own testimony was that his particular forty hour schedule began in november,under pelletier.under pelletier,cham was the highest paid sales associate during the relevant time period.moreover,upon his returning from fmla leave,cham scheduled hours were equal to or greater than most of the other employees at the station operators location.this included the employee who was hired to cover some of cham shifts while he was on leave as well as the employee who was hired shortly after his return from leave.
further,there is little evidence of racial animus.while cham testified that pelletier made certain remarks,cham voluntary dismissal of his hostile work environment claim is indicative of the fleeting nature of any such comments.moreover,such stray workplace remarks normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.gonzalez el dia,cir.
cham offers two arguments as to why station operators explanation was pretextual.first,cham claims that a caucasian employee,joe parker,was similarly situated and did not have his scheduled hours reduced from forty to.however,cham introduced no evidence as to parker schedule before january,and instead compares his schedule to parker only over the course of a few months in.further,cham introduced no evidence as to any hours parker actually worked at any point in time.finally,cham and parker worked different shifts parker worked the night shift,reducing any similarity between the two.these considerations undermine cham comparison to parker.see garcía bristol myers squibb,cir to demonstrate pretext by producing evidence that plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated employees,a plaintiff must show that others similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer emphasis added quoting kosereis,at internal quotation marks omitted.
second,cham claims that he was disciplined more harshly in december than a caucasian employee for similar violations of company policy.first,the form of discipline cham received being placed on probation imposed no additional tangible consequences over the form of discipline the other employee received a written warning.second,the two situations are not comparable while both cham and the caucasian employee were disciplined for failure to appear for their scheduled shifts,cham had failed to provide any notice to station operators that he would not be able to work,whereas the other employee informed station operators that he would not be able to work thirty minutes after his shift was supposed to begin.
the district court did not err in granting the rule motion.
rule grant of a new trial 
we review the district court grant of a new trial for abuse of discretion.jennings jones,cir.a trial court may grant a new trial on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.id.at.moreover,the district court has the power and duty to order a new trial whenever,in its judgment,the action is required in order to prevent injustice.id.quoting kearns keystone shipping,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court may independently weigh the evidence in deciding whether to grant a new trial.id.
the district court reason for granting a new trial here was that because cham hostile work environment and disparate treatment claims had been dismissed,the jury had been exposed to much evidence that was irrelevant,and could be both prejudicial and confusing,to cham fmla retaliation claims.cham,d at.the district court found that such irrelevant evidence had great potential to confuse the jury and to unfairly prejudice station operators,particularly given that the timeliness of cham fmla retaliation claim depended on whether station operators violation was willful in nature.id.at.
the district court did not abuse its discretion.the admission of evidence that later becomes irrelevant when one or more claims is rejected as a matter of law prior to submission to the jury may be grounds for granting a new trial,if deemed unduly prejudicial.see macpherson of montevallo,cir sec happ,cir an erroneous admission of evidence may be grounds for granting a new trial,if refusing to grant a new trial appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice quoting.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,it is beyond question that most of the prejudicial evidence was introduced in support of cham hostile work environment claim and was rendered irrelevant when cham voluntarily agreed to dismissal of the claim.to the extent any of it was introduced solely as to the disparate treatment claim,it became irrelevant when the court dismissed that claim under rule.
cham argues that the evidence was not sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial.often,where evidence is rendered irrelevant because certain claims are dismissed before the case goes to the jury,the appropriate response is to instruct the jury to disregard the evidence see guthrie penny,cir declining to reverse district court denial of a motion for a new trial where evidence as to pain and suffering became irrelevant when certain claims were dismissed before trial,and noting that there was a less drastic remedy of an explicit instruction to the jury on the matter see also.if the court admits evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose but not against another party or for another purpose the court,on timely request,must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.despite station operators failure to request such an instruction,it was within the court discretion to grant the more drastic remedy of a new trial.
there are times where such irrelevant evidence is sufficiently prejudicial that a limiting instruction will not be sufficient and a new trial is proper.see macpherson,at affirming district court grant of a new trial in part because evidence admitted in support of a disparate impact theory,which was dismissed at the close of plaintiff case,was no longer relevant.
this was a judgment call for the experienced trial judge who sat through the first trial and was able to gauge the effect of the evidence on the jury.see correia feeney,cir noting that we owe much deference to the trial court new trial determination.the district court provided a cogent explanation for its result,particularly given that cham had to prove that the fmla violation was willful for his claim to be timely and the irrelevant evidence could have affected the willfulness finding.
the district court concluded there would be a miscarriage of justice if the verdict were to stand.cham,d at.in reaching that conclusion the court commented on the vagueness of the hostile environment evidence as well as that evidence lack of connection to race.id.at.the court stated n one of this evidence has any bearing on the fmla retaliation claim that ultimately went to the jury,and cham counsel,recognizing the claim lack of merit,voluntarily withdrew the hostile environment claim but only after putting the extraneous evidence before the jury.id.emphasis added.
