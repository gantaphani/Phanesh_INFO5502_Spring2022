kevin deegan commenced this action,pursuant to,seeking damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief against the city of ithaca,new york,the city attorney marriette geldenhuys,and the chief of police richard basile collectively,defendants.deegan alleged that his first and fourteenth amendment rights were violated when he was prevented,under the purported authority of municipal noise ordinances,from preaching in ithaca commons.following discovery,the district court entertained cross motions for summary judgment and resolved the case on a record consisting of facts stipulated by the parties and the testimony of deegan noise expert.the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the complaint.
we find that the challenged noise ordinances,as interpreted,construed,and enforced by defendants against deegan can not withstand constitutional scrutiny.therefore,we remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of deegan and award him appropriate relief.
background 
plaintiff kevin deegan,a resident of west seneca,new york,believes that he has a duty as a christian to preach,and he has carried out that tenet of his faith for more than twenty years by speaking in raised voice to in public areas such as parks,malls,streets and sidewalks.in deegan view,that method of communication enables him to reach as many people as possible and stimulate dialogue about his religious beliefs.with that purpose,deegan and three of his colleagues visited ithaca commons on october.
ithaca commons is a two block,t shaped public pedestrian mall located in downtown ithaca with walkways,benches,a playground,storefront businesses,restaurants,several pavilions,and a water fountain with nearby seating.in addition to attracting patrons to the many businesses located on the commons,the area serves as a general gathering place and a popular hang out for students from nearby colleges.musicians and other entertainers perform regularly in the commons,which is also the site of numerous community events,such as the downtown ithaca chili cookoff and winterfest,ithaca festival craft show,m t bank summer concert series,and the apple harvest festival,which draw thousands of visitors and feature exhibitions,concerts,poetry readings,and dance,among other things.it has also been a forum for demonstrations and protests highlighted by speeches,music performances,marches,and open discussion concerning a variety of issues including nuclear weapons,environmental protection,animal rights,gay and lesbian rights,and campaign finance reform.
shortly after deegan and his colleagues positioned themselves in the middle of the t and began preaching,deegan was approached by an ithaca police officer who was responding to a noise complaint lodged by an employee of a nearby business no one else complained about deegan preaching.the officer did not interview the complainant or other witnesses rather,upon hearing deegan and his companions,the officer advised him that their speech violated the ithaca noise ordinance because it could be heard from feet away in the ithaca commons area and further advised him to keep the volume of his speech lower.when deegan asked whether he could relocate to a street corner outside of the commons,the officer informed him that the ordinance applies anywhere in the city.at deegan request,the officer left to get a copy of the ordinance.
while the officer was away,deegan heard a singing group feet from his location and heard people talking who were more than feet from him they were left undisturbed and there is nothing in the record regarding complaints about other people.although deegan attempted to speak more softly,when the officer returned ten minutes after departing,he told deegan that even the lower volume violated the ordinance.the officer provided deegan with a copy of the ithaca noise ordinance.after reviewing the statute,deegan voiced disagreement that its provisions required him to speak so low as not to be heard feet away,but the officer informed him that he had to keep his voice at that level or face arrest.the officer described deegan as delivering his speech persistently and continuously and speaking at the top of his lungs.deegan chose not to communicate his message by speaking in a volume that carried no more than feet or by circulating brochures,and he did not seek a permit to use amplified sound.concluding that he could not communicate effectively and also comply with the ordinance,deegan left ithaca on october,never to return to preach because his subsequent request for permission to speak in a voice that is audible at a distance of more than feet was denied by defendants.
section of the city of ithaca municipal code provides in relevant part 
unreasonable noise prohibited.
no person shall intentionally cause public inconvenience,annoyance or alarm or recklessly create a risk thereof by making unreasonable noise or by causing unreasonable noise to be made.
for the purpose of implementing and enforcing the standard set forth in subsection a of this section,unreasonable noise shall mean any sound created or caused to be created by any person which either annoys,disturbs,injures or endangers the comfort,repose,health,peace or safety of the public or which causes injury to animal life or damages to property or business.factors to be considered in determining whether unreasonable noise exists in a given situation include but are not limited to any or all of the following 
the intensity of the noise.
whether the nature of the noise is usual or unusual.
whether the origin of the noise is associated with nature or activity.
the intensity of the background noise,if any.
the proximity of the noise to sleeping facilities.
the nature and the zoning district of the area within which the noise emanates and of the area within feet of the source of the sound.
the time of the day or night the noise occurs.
the time duration of the noise.
whether the sound source is temporary.
whether the noise is continuous or impulsive.
the volume of the noise.
the existence of complaints concerning the noise from persons living or working in different places or premises who are affected by the noise.
municipal code of the city of ithaca,new york the noise ordinance.joint stipulation.ithaca commons also has an ordinance regulating amplified sound,which provides in relevant part as follows 
amplified sound.
except by special permit no person shall operate or cause to be operated on ithaca commons any boom box,tape recorder,radio or other device for electronic sound amplification in a loud,annoying or offensive manner such that noise from the device interferes with conversation or with the comfort,repose,health or safety of others within any building or at a distance of feet or greater.
municipal code of the city of ithaca,new york the sound amplification rule.joint stipulation.there is nothing in the joint stipulation to suggest that deegan was provided with a copy of section on october.with respect to the enforcement of the two noise ordinances,the parties stipulated that defendants prohibit any noise that can be heard feet away.id.at.
deegan commenced this civil rights action on october.he asserted a single cause of action under the first and fourteenth amendments alleging violations of his rights to freedoms of association and assembly,free exercise of religion and equal protection.following discovery,the district court denied the parties cross motions for summary judgment.
thereafter,the parties stipulated that the foregoing facts and the testimony of deegan noise expert would constitute the entire trial record upon which the district court would dispose of the case.deegan city of ithaca,wl.the district judge qualified thomas katra as an expert in noise and noise measurement and adopted katra factual findings as follows 
t he court finds that katra made his measurements in february at the same place and time of day as the october,incident in issue that decibels was the maximum noise level at which a person could speak and still be in compliance with the ordinance percent of the time that this decibel level is lower than that generated by the clicking of boots,conversations between two or three people,a shop door opening and closing,a small child playing on a playground and a cellular telephone that most normal human activity would be clearly audible at a distance of feet and that a spirited conversation between two people would be clearly audible at a distance of feet.the court further finds that there is no evidence regarding how many people were in close proximity six to eight feet of plaintiff while he was preaching that katra did not measure the decibel level of plaintiff preaching that the duration of a loud sound is an important factor in whether it is annoying or alarming and that factors such as annoyance and alarm can not be scientifically measured.
id.at.the district court did not adopt katra opinions and expressly rejected the opinion that under the conditions at ithaca commons,deegan mode of communication,that being preaching,can not comply with the restriction.id.at.noting that the parties stipulated to define preaching as speech that can be heard beyond feet,the district court reasoned that proof that plaintiff can not preach is not proof that he can not reasonably make his message heard.id.at.the district court found no evidence to support a conclusion that deegan speech must be heard from more than feet away in order to communicate his religious message.id.at.the district court also expressly rejected katra opinion that the subject ordinance is incompatible with ithaca commons,finding the opinion unsupported,unexplained and irrelevant because compatibility was not an issue here.id.at.
the district court determined that deegan failed to carry his burden to establish that the noise ordinance violate d the first amendment requirements of,narrow tailoring or alternative channels of communication and that he did not demonstrate that the ordinance was selectively enforced against him in violation of the equal protection c lause.id.at.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants,and deegan appealed.
discussion 
as written,the city of ithaca noise ordinance and the ithaca commons amplified sound rule do not necessarily raise constitutional concern.the noise ordinance identifies twelve nonexclusive factors to be considered in determining whether noise is unreasonable.none of the factors is weighted.the amplified sound rule prohibits,in the absence of a special permit,amplification in a loud,annoying or offensive manner such that noise from the device interferes with conversation or with the comfort,repose,health or safety of others within any building or at a distance of feet or greater.with regard to application of the ordinances,the parties stipulated as follows 
the city of ithaca,city attorney for city of ithaca sic,and the city of ithaca police department,interpret,construe,and enforce the city of ithaca and ithaca commons noise ordinances,specifically sections and,to prohibit any noise that can be heard feet away.this prohibition applies to any type of noise,including speech,whether the noise is amplified or unamplified and whether in ithaca commons or in the city.
joint stipulation.in other words,as applied by the city and its enforcement authorities,the statutory considerations for determining whether noise is excessive or unreasonable are displaced by a bright line rule restricting any in the city at any time of the day or it can be heard feet away.id.emphasis added.the ordinances do not on their face suggest such an application.applied as they are,however,the ordinances can not survive constitutional review.
on appeal,defendants argue repeatedly that noise regulations require consideration of the twelve factors set forth in section in the context of the location in which the noise is generated.although such a reasonableness determination certainly is indicated by the statutory text,defendants can not escape their stipulated representation that the standard does not,in practice,guide their interpretation,construction,and enforcement of the regulations.accordingly,the undisputed fact to which we apply the relevant constitutional standard is that noise that is audible at a distance of feet is illegal in the city of ithaca.
standard of review 
as noted above,the material facts in this case are not in dispute.we analyze the district court application of the law to those facts de novo.see mobil shipping and transp.wonsild liquid carriers,cir.a challenge to the constitutional validity of a local ordinance presents a question of law.see ramos town of vernon,cir.
first amendment considerations 
i n history,at least,government suppression of speech has so commonly been directed precisely at religious speech that a clause without religion would be hamlet without the prince.capitol square review and advisory bd.pinette,d.deegan religious speech is fully protected by the first amendment,applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,and defendants do not assert otherwise.see const.amends.i and xiv.as we recently reiterated,the government authority to regulate speech or expressive conduct on property that has traditionally been open to the public for such activity,such as public streets and parks,is sharply circumscribed.hobbs county of westchester,cir citations omitted.
forum analysis 
defendants argue that ithaca commons is not a public forum in the literal or true sense of that term and the proximity of residences should be considered when evaluating restrictions on speech.the record,however,clearly establishes that the commons is a classic public forum,as the term has developed in first amendment jurisprudence,because it is the type of area traditionally available for public expression and the free exchange of ideas.see hotel employees restaurant employees union city of new york dep t of parks and recreation,cir.the ithaca commons rules expressly provide that the purpose of the enactment is to promote the general welfare and public use of the area.municipal code of the city of ithaca.a plaque in the commons,which the parties describe as commemorating and stating the purpose for ithaca commons,proclaims that the area is dedicated to the citizens of ithaca as a public gathering place,commercial center and community focal point.
significantly,the commons is used routinely for a wide array of community,educational,performing and other expressive events and activities.see hotel employees union,at noting that the primary factor in determining whether property is a public form is its use.this quality makes ithaca commons the type of area that has been described as a prototypical or quintessential public forum.see,schenck network of western new york,d public sidewalks that are associated with free exercise of expressive activities are the prototypical example of a traditional public forum perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d noting that streets and parks have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public,and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
regulating expression in a public forum 
speech finds its greatest protection in traditional public fora like ithaca commons.see make the road by walking,turner,cir.even in a public forum,however,the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech,and the supreme court has articulated a three part test to determine whether such restrictions interfere with rights guaranteed by the first amendment.ward rock against racism,d.to withstand constitutional scrutiny,government restrictions must be content neutral,in that they target some quality other than substantive expression narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and permit alternative channels for expression.id.this standard is commonly referred to as intermediate scrutiny.see,mastrovincenzo city of new york,cir noting that we apply intermediate scrutiny to regulations of expressive activity that are not based on content.
in a first amendment challenge,the government bears the burden of showing that its restriction of
