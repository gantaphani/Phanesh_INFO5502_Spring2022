after a lengthy battle to redeem egregious violations of their civil rights,the plaintiffs were granted attorneys fees pursuant to the civil rights attorney fees awards act of the fees act.they were later denied additional recompense for services rendered in i litigating the fee petition,ii attempting to collect the underlying judgments,and iii seeking statutory interest.displeased with the district court calculation and apportionment of the fees awarded and with its rejection of their supplemental motion,the plaintiffs prosecuted this appeal.
after careful consideration of a tangled record,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in two respects.first,the court used an inappropriate methodology in apportioning the original fee award.second,despite the plaintiffs presumptive entitlement to further relief,the court failed adequately to explain its denial of the supplemental motion.consequently,we vacate the orders appealed from and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
our earlier opinion in i,cir,contains an exegetic account of the events that form the backdrop for the orders at issue.we urge the reader who hungers for further detail to consult that opinion and rehearse here only those facts needed to put this appeal into perspective.
in august of,ernesto espada,a puerto rico police officer,beat two teenage boys,angel santiago and ernid gómez.charles,an agent of the puerto rico treasury department,stood by without intervening and trained his gun first on gómez and then on gómez mother,margaret who witnessed the attack.
on august,and the two boys sued and espada under and puerto rico tort law the commonwealth of puerto rico agreed to represent but not espada.
espada failed to answer the complaint and the clerk of court entered a default against him on june.see.a.answered the complaint and later moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment.a flurry of activity followed,including an interlocutory appeal,several motions,and protracted pretrial discovery involving and the plaintiffs.
this skirmishing culminated in a trial that began on august.espada did not participate in the trial,represented by four attorneys,mounted a ferocious defense.
at the end of the plaintiffs case in chief,the district court granted motion for judgment as a matter of law santiago.see.a.at the close of all the evidence,the court submitted the remaining claims to the jury including questions as to the amount of damages to be assessed against the defaulted defendant,espada.the jurors found liable to gómez for violating his fourth amendment rights by failing to intervene notwithstanding espada use of excessive force.they also found him liable to under local law for negligently causing her harm.espada liability to all three plaintiffs was assumed by reason of the default.
the jurors awarded damages as follows for gómez against for against for gómez against espada for against espada and for santiago against espada.appealed,but to no avail.see i,at.espada did not appeal.
in due course,the plaintiffs moved under the fees act for attorneys fees referable to services rendered through october.the district court granted fees in an amount that the plaintiffs thought was too meager.when the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration,the court revised the award,using the lodestar method.ii,civ,wl,at.as part of its calculations,the court made a fifteen percent global reduction to take account of what it characterized as overly generic descriptions of time expended.id.at.it then apportioned responsibility for payment of the award between the defendants based on the relative damages assessed against each of them by the jury.id.at.thus,the court ordered the overall award to be paid percent by and percent by espada.id.
during some of the time that the fee petition was pending,the underlying judgments remained unsatisfied.eventually,the plaintiffs filed a supplemental motion seeking payment of attorneys fees generated after october,in litigating the fee petition itself and in litigating to compel payment not only of the judgments but also of interest thereon.the district court,without explanation,denied this motion.see,civ,unpublished order.
paid the damages judgments against him on or about october,but as of march,he had not paid any interest.espada has not paid any part of the judgments or fees and is apparently.
the plaintiffs appeal both the fee award and the denial of their supplemental motion.our standard of review is familiar.we review a fee award for abuse of discretion.coutin young rubicam,cir.a district court may abuse its discretion if it fails to consider a significant factor in the decisional calculus,if it relies on an improper factor in working that calculus,or if it considers all the appropriate factors but makes a serious error in judgment as to their relative weight.id.within this framework,an error of law is always tantamount to an abuse of discretion.see,cir.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiffs advance three claims.they assert that the district court erred in i apportioning fees based on the defendants relative liability for damages,ii applying a global reduction to their fee request,and iii denying them fees for their efforts in litigating the fee petition and trying to collect the underlying judgments including the accrued interest.we address these claims of error sequentially.
first,we sketch the legal landscape.congress authored the fees act as a means of encouraging persons to seek redress for civil rights violations through judicial avenues.hensley eckerhart,d coutin,at.under that statute,a prevailing party in a civil rights suit is entitled to reasonable attorneys fees unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.hensley,at.quoting,at,reprinted in.
a reasonable fee typically is determined through the lodestar method,which involves multiplying the number of hours productively spent by a reasonable hourly rate to calculate a base figure.hensley,at.coutin,at.in fashioning the lodestar,a district court may adjust the hours claimed to eliminate time that was unreasonably,unnecessarily,or inefficiently devoted to the case.hensley,at.subject to principles of interconnectedness,see,lipsett blanco,cir,the court may disallow time spent in litigating failed claims.it also may adjust the lodestar itself,upwards or downwards,based on any of several different factors,including the results obtained and the time and labor actually required for the efficacious handling of the matter.see hensley,at.coutin,at.
reasonableness in this context is largely a matter of informed judgment.there are,however,guideposts in the case law.for instance,a district court may deem an expenditure of time unreasonable if the reported hours are excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.hensley,at.see,united states metro.dist.comm n,cir grendel den,larkin,cir.by like token,it may discount or disallow the total hours claimed if it determines that the time is insufficiently documented.hensley,at.see grendel den,at.
of particular pertinence for present purposes,time records may be too generic and,thus,insufficient as a practical matter to permit a court to answer questions about excessiveness,redundancy,and the like.in that event,the court may either discount or disallow those hours.see.gas pipeline acres of land,cir see also gay officers action league puerto rico,cir warning that failure to keep time records in reasonable detail is apt to have deleterious consequences.
after determining the time reasonably expended by the prevailing party legal team,the court must focus on the rates to be applied to those hours.see,grendel den,at.we eschew any more precise description of that process,as this appeal does not involve any challenge to the district court computations.
when the district court arrives at the lodestar and completes its consideration of possible adjustments,it ought to provide a concise but clear explanation of its calculation of the resultant fee award.hensley,at.alternatively,a reviewing court sometimes may be able to infer the district court reasoning from the record as a whole.united states arango,cir inferring trial court reasoning from the record in criminal sentencing context.we emphasize,however,that the district court explanation is valuable,and the requirement ought not to be sidestepped routinely.
where the plaintiffs have prevailed over more than one defendant,the court must take an additional step it must determine whether the fee award should run jointly and severally against the defendants or,if not,what portion of the award each defendant should bear.see grendel den,at.in cases in which apportionment is the preferred option,there is no uniform prescription as to how to effect that result.rather,a district court in a case must choose among a variety of modalities.these modalities include equal division among the defendants,division by relative liability,and division by assignment of the time reasonably expended in litigating against each defendant.id.at.the appropriate choice among these modalities depends on the contours and idiosyncrasies of the particular case.id.at.the guiding principle is equity the district court should strive to determine the most fair and sensible solution for apportioning the fee award.id.
allocation of fees by time expended is the default modality in certain circumstances that method is ordinarily the most appropriate when,in a case in which joint and several responsibility has been deemed inappropriate,the relative time dedicated to litigating with one defendant is clearly disproportionate to the time required to litigate with another defendant.
our decision in grendel den illustrates this point.there,the district court considered only that both defendants had participate d to some degree at every stage of the litigation and apportioned the awarded fees equally between them.id.on appeal,we modified that order because one defendant had mounted three times the opposition as had the other defendant.id.holding that equity required that percent of the fee award be allocated against the former defendant.
other federal appellate courts have enunciated similar tenets and concluded that,when the defensive efforts mustered by one defendant have been markedly more robust than the defensive efforts mustered by another,the relative time spent litigating against each of them is the appropriate methodology by which to apportion an award of attorneys fees.for example,the ninth circuit has held that,under fairness principles,markedly unequal efforts by each defendant require apportionment by the time expended method.corder gates,cir.in so holding,the court stated that the party that is the focus of the litigation should ordinarily bear the bulk of the litigation costs,especially when the time expended by the plaintiff in pursuing each defendant is grossly unequal.id.emphasis in original.other cases reflect similar reasoning.see,nash chandler,cir deeming time expended the most equitable method of apportionment as to one defendant who,unlike other defendants,was not a principal in the litigation se.legal def.group adams,cir upholding apportionment by time expended because of the plaintiff efforts were directed toward one defendant alone.
a.the apportionment of fees.
against this background,we return to the case at hand.the district court decided that the responsibility for fees should not run jointly and severally,and that apportionment was in order no one disputes either of these eminently reasonable decisions.the court proceeded to use the relative liability method as a means of effectuating that apportionment,comparing the damages assessed against each defendant to apportion the awarded attorneys fees.see ii,wl,at.because the total damages assessed against espada were percent of the aggregate damages awarded,the court apportioned responsibility for payment of the fees percent to espada and percent to the court based this division on the following arithmetic it divided each of the portions of the damages awarded against espada and and,respectively by the total damages award.this calculation resulted in percent responsibility for espada and percent for.
the issue here is the district court selection of a relative liability method of apportionment.the plaintiffs take umbrage at that choice.they asseverate that since was the only defendant to mount a a ferocious one at lawyers spent virtually all of their time litigating against him.conversely,very little time was spent litigating against espada.on this basis,they posit that should be held responsible for the lion share of the awarded fees.
disagrees with this construct.he emphasizes the broad discretion vested in the district court and argues that a relative liability apportionment of the fee award falls within the encincture of that discretion.
this is a case in which the considerable time spent by the plaintiffs in litigating against dwarfs the rather modest amount of time spent in litigating against espada,as was his right,mounted a defense,employing four lawyers and battling the plaintiffs at every turn.by contrast,espada never answered the complaint but,rather,defaulted while the litigation was in an embryonic stage.the time,effort,and energy involved in litigating against can be compared to the time,effort,and energy involved in securing a default and proving damages against a party.
of course,espada actions were front and center.the claims against were based on multiple theories of failure to intervene to prevent espada unlawful behavior.the first of these required the plaintiffs to show that espada used excessive force that observed what was transpiring and that he took no action to prevent the ongoing mayhem.see i,at.the second theory required the plaintiffs to show that assisted espada in placing one or both of the victims in harm way.see id.at.
so viewed,developing the claims against depended in part on developing the basis for a case against espada.but given the entry of default,the plaintiffs would not have had to make the case against espada except for decision to resist the claims against him.see goldman,antonetti,ferraiuoli,axtmayer hertell medfit int l,cir a n entry of a default against a defendant establishes the defendant liability.
the rule that we glean from the case law runs along the following lines.where apportionment is indicated,the choice among available options generally lies within the district court sound discretion.see grendel den,at.but when the time required to litigate against one defendant is grossly disproportionate to the time required to litigate against another defendant and the two defendants are not in privity,then the time expended method of apportionment should be used.see,corder,at.
this is a case of the latter stripe because espada defaulted,the plaintiffs had no need to spend significant time either in preparing a case against him or in presenting that case to the jury thus,it was,as the lone defendant actually contesting the plaintiffs proof,who caused the plaintiffs to incur the bulk of the time expended.the short of it,then,is that the amount of time spent in mounting the case against was grossly disproportionate to the amount of time spent in litigating against espada.
we have carefully perused the record,the district court explanation of the fee award,and the court comments on the choice of a relative liability method of apportionment.see torres rivera ii,wl,at.it is clear from that perusal that the district court did not appropriately weigh the disparity in time expended,nor did it offer any adequate justification for veering off in the direction of relative liability.fairness and equity dictate that,given this inequality and the apparent absence of any offsetting circumstances,the court should as a matter of law have used the time expended method of apportionment and calculated the approximate time spent in litigating against each defendant.see grendel den,at explaining that a court undertaking to fashion a fee award should make every effort to achieve the most fair and sensible solution that is possible.the fee award,therefore,can not stand.
b.the global reduction.
even though vacation of the fee award is in order,see supra part ii a,we are mindful that the plaintiffs have contested the global reduction essayed by the district
