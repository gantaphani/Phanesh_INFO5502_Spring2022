this appeal gives added credence to the ancient adage that the bearer of bad news has a losing office such is literally true in this case if plaintiff allegations are accepted.plaintiff,a public school teacher,claims he expressed concern about a serious hazing incident to his employer the school board and,as a result,lost his job.
plaintiff louis cioffi plaintiff or appellant claims his job as athletic of physical education was abolished by his employer defendant averill park central school district in retaliation for statements he made about a hazing incident involving high school football players.cioffi brought a employment retaliation action against the school district,the averill park central school district board of education board of education or board,thomas mcgreevy,the president of the board of education,and michael johnson,the superintendent of the school district collectively,defendants.when defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing his complaint,the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,granted the motion in an order dated september,holding that cioffi statements were not constitutionally protected speech and,even if they were,he had shown no causal connection between his statements and the abolition of his position.the district court also held that defendants mcgreevy and johnson could not be sued in their individual capacities because they were entitled to legislative immunity.
background 
from to cioffi was a social studies teacher and athletic director for the averill park central school district.in june the school district appointed him to the position of athletic of physical education.he held that position for three years until june.
as athletic director,cioffi supervised kevin earl,the football coach at averill park central high school.earl coached the football team from to.over the years,cioffi had complained to the school board,previous superintendents,and the current superintendent defendant johnson about earl coaching methods.cioffi believed earl was improperly supervising the players and that he was encouraging the high school athletes to use creatine,a muscle enhancing supplement that is considered dangerous.
a.the hazing incident 
in early october defendant mcgreevy,the president of the board of education,received a letter from lauren ashdown,a parent of a high school football player.ashdown relayed stories she had heard of disturbing misbehavior in the boys such as a shampoo bottle being shoved up a student rectum.cioffi and another administrator investigated ashdown allegations.the investigation led to an october,interview with a student on the football team.the student,a freshman,told cioffi that he had been by other football players.is a hazing a form of sexual which the victim is pinned down on the floor by several players while another player rubs his genitalia in the victim face.after the hazing was brought to superintendent johnson attention,the school district took certain steps to address it,such as changing supervision protocols in the football locker rooms,seeking the involvement of the new york state police,and advising parents in the school district that unspecified incidents of sexual harassment hazing had been uncovered.the school district,however,failed to inform the parents of the freshman who had been the victim of the assault recited above.
november,letter 
on november,cioffi sent a letter to superintendent johnson which outlined his prior criticism of coach earl and earl supervision of the football team.in the letter,plaintiff expressed concern regarding the school district handling of the subsequent investigation into the.he wrote also that his overriding concern has been for the health and safety of the students,as well as for the school district potentially being held liable for professional misjudgment.plaintiff requested that the superintendent forward his letter to the school board,which johnson did.
events from december to february,
media scrutiny and greater public interest in the hazing escalated in december when the public learned the details of the when the hazing victim filed a criminal complaint on december.this interest persisted for several months as a number of students and teachers were arrested and the entire high school football coaching staff was suspended.on january,however,the board met in an executive session during which there was an informal consensus to abolish cioffi athletic director position as part of the budget for the coming year.
on january,after learning of the impending abolition of his position,cioffi held a press conference during which he expressed his belief that the board decision to eliminate his position was in retribution for his criticisms regarding coach earl,the football program,and the investigation into the.plaintiff reiterated his overriding concern for the student athletes.
a month later,on february,the board met in public session to vote on the budget for the upcoming school year.it voted to approve the proposed budget which called for the abolition of cioffi position of athletic director.the budget created a new position,athletic principal.the personnel change was justified on the grounds of fiscal savings to the school district.although cioffi lost his athletic director post,as a tenured teacher he exercised retreat rights which allowed him to return to employment as a social studies teacher at a salary lower than he earned as athletic director,but considerably higher than the pay of the teacher he replaced in the social studies department.
district court proceedings 
cioffi brought this action claiming defendants abolished his position in retaliation for the november,letter and his comments at his press conference.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the grounds that the november,letter and press conference are not protectable speech because they do not address matters of public concern even if cioffi speech constituted protectable speech,there is no causal connection between the speech and the elimination of cioffi job and superintendent johnson and president mcgreevy were entitled to absolute immunity because the approval of the school budget by the board was a legislative act.cioffi averill park cent.sch.dist.bd.of,wl,at.cioffi appeals.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
discussion 
i applicable lawa.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and resolving all factual ambiguities in his favor.konits valley stream cent.high sch,cir mandell county of suffolk,cir.we,like the district judge,are not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue of fact for trial exists when there is sufficient evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.
first amendment rights of public employees 
the rights of an individual like cioffi to speak out on matters of public concern are enshrined in the first amendment to the constitution.it is well settled that public school teachers,or athletic directors,as in this case,do not check their first amendment rights at the schoolhouse door when they enter public employment.see melzer bd.of,cir.nonetheless,it is also true that a public employer has a distinct interest in regulating the speech of its employees in order to ensure and promote the efficiency of the public services it performs.rankin mcpherson,d.the problem is to balance the employee free speech rights with the interests of the public employer.see pickering bd.of,d.thus,public employees like plaintiff do not enjoy free reign to speak out without regard to the interests of their public employer.see bernheim litt,cir a public employee right to freedom of speech is not absolute.
a public employee who makes a first amendment claim of employment retaliation under must show that his speech addressed a matter of public concern,he suffered an adverse employment decision,and a causal connection exists between his speech and that adverse employment decision,so that it can be said that the plaintiff speech was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action.morris lindau,cir.even if the plaintiff establishes these three elements,his claim remains subject to several defenses.first,the state may defend its actions by showing the employee speech disrupted the workplace.rankin,at.see connick myers,d.to prevail with this defense the public employer must demonstrate that its interest in promoting an efficient workplace outweighs the employee interest in commenting on matters of public concern.connick,at.also,the employer may avoid liability by demonstrating that it would have taken the same adverse employment action even in the absence of the protected conduct.mount healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
issues on appeal 
it is undisputed that abolishing cioffi position as athletic director was an adverse employment action.because defendants do not contend cioffi speech disrupted or had the potential to disrupt the workplace,we need not balance cioffi first amendment rights against the defendants interests in maintaining an efficient workplace.see velez levy,cir.we therefore concern ourselves with whether cioffi speech addressed a matter of public concern a causal connection exists between his speech and the abolition of his position and the defendants would in any event have abolished cioffi position in the absence of his speech.
because cioffi did not properly raise the issue on as we discuss in more detail in a need not address whether president mcgreevy and superintendent johnson,the individual defendants,enjoy absolute legislative immunity.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of these two defendants on the basis of legislative immunity must be affirmed.
ii is plaintiff speech a matter of public concern 
a.what speech 
we must first determine the speech at issue.defendants contend cioffi can not use his january,press conference as the basis for his claim because it came after the board informal decision to abolish his position.bernheim,at plaintiff may not base her claim of retaliation upon acts that predated her speaking out.we do not accept defendants position.
the adverse employment action did not predate the press conference.rather the adverse decision occurred not on january,but on february,the date of the official vote to abolish cioffi job.the board informal decision of january,held in executive closed session,was just that informal.board members were free to change their tentative votes when the official vote occurred a month later.indeed the record reflects that what occurred on january constituted no more than an informal consensus.it was not until february,when the board voted in public session,that an official adverse employment action could be said to have occurred.we therefore examine both the november,letter and the january,press conference to see if this speech relates to matters of public concern.
b.the speech at issue is a matter of public concern 
the question whether speech addresses a matter of public concern and thereby enjoys protection under the first amendment is one of law.see connick,at.we examine the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record to make this determination.id.at.generally,the first amendment protects any matter of political,social or other concern to the community.morris,at.
our review of the november,letter and january,press conference leads us to conclude that as a matter of law these instances of speech address matters of public concern and are therefore protected by the first amendment.we examine the content of the speech first,followed by an analysis of its form and context.
the letter and press conference discuss and stem from an incident of obvious concern to the sexual assault of a student on school property.any community would be acutely interested in such an incident that constitutes nothing less than a criminal attack on a minor.the incident itself,the deficiencies in adult supervision that allowed it to occur,and the possible insufficiencies of the school response implicate the health,welfare and safety of young students,all of which are matters of importance to the public.see,calvit minneapolis pub,cir statements criticizing school child abuse policy deemed matter of public concern bernheim,at statement regarding quality of education in school is a matter of public concern.state laws in new york criminalizing sexual assault and specifically sexual assault on children underscore the public concern on this topic particularly where,as in this case,public criminal charges were filed against teachers and students in connection with such an assault.see penal law mckinney defining sex offenses id.defining hazing munafo metro.transp,cir o ne would need look no farther than the existence of similar state laws to recognize that safety in the workplace is a matter of public concern.
to be sure,while the case before us involves a hazing incident that happens to constitute sexual assault,we do not imply that to be a matter of public concern an event need rise to the level of criminality.as noted above,the protections of the first amendment are not so constrained.a matter of public concern is generally any matter of political,social or other concern to the community.morris,at quoting connick,at.we do not doubt that criminal activity in schools is of social or other concern to communities.nor do we doubt that activities may also on their form,context and of public concern,discussion of which is equally protectable under the first amendment.see,salge edna indep.sch,cir holding speech about reasons for school principal resignation a matter of public concern.
in both the letter and press conference plaintiff addresses two issues that are of paramount interest to a community faced with a hazing incident in its schools first,how the school district allowed such an incident to occur and,second,how the school district conducted its investigation into the hazing.with regard to how the hazing was allowed to occur,in his letter cioffi discusses perceived defects in the level of oversight and supervision over earl and the football program leading up to the incident.he states that earl was allowed to run by a different set of rules from other faculty members and coaches.cioffi also chronicles his many complaints about the football program over the years,indicating that his alarms were raised to no avail.cioffi ends his letter voicing consternation about the manner in which the board and school administration conducted the investigation.he states that he has a problem accepting the explanation about why perpetrators of the hazing have not actively been sought out and that his concern was that others may have been victimized as well.at the press conference,cioffi addresses again and in detail these same issues of oversight of earl and the football program and the school district handling of the hazing investigation.the content of the letter and press conference that we have pointed to here establish the very public nature of cioffi speech.
form and context 
the form and context of the letter and press conference also favor cioffi.although cioffi sent the november letter privately to johnson and the board only,it is not thereby deprived of first amendment protection.see rankin,at.the private nature of the statement does not vitiate the status of the statement as addressing a matter of public concern.rookard health hosps,cir that plaintiff speech was made privately,rather than publicly,did not remove it from first amendment protection.the subject of the letter was no mere private employment grievance,but assaultive conduct against a minor that,when publicly disclosed,triggered criminal charges as well as public outcry.as for the press conference,its form is plainly public,with cioffi remarks specifically directed to the community and the media.
next we examine the context in which cioffi spoke.such review further convinces us that his speech addresses matters of public concern.defendants admit that both the letter and press conference occurred while a media frenzy ensued around the hazi
