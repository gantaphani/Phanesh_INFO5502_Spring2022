challenging certain decisions of the police chief and the conduct of a fellow officer,a discharged police officer sought relief in federal court under and massachusetts law.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the merits of all claims except one for assault and battery,over which it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.see c.the discharged officer now appeals.having viewed the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the discharged officer,we conclude that summary judgment was properly entered.
joel rosenfeld was suspended from the millis,massachusetts,police department on may.on that date,rosenfeld was also required to surrender both his service firearm and his firearms license.police chief albert baima ordered these actions pending an investigation of the circumstances surrounding an april altercation between rosenfeld and fellow officer david egy,the other.for his own part in the altercation,egy was placed on administrative leave and ordered to surrender both his service firearm and firearms license.
although egy eventually was reinstated to the active roster,rosenfeld was not.nor did rosenfeld troubles end there.on october,baima denied rosenfeld renewal application which rosenfeld had submitted along with several letters of recommendation following the expiration of his confiscated license.
rosenfeld also was experiencing problems at home.in december,rosenfeld wife,charlotte,filed for divorce.based on an affidavit filed with the probate court,charlotte soon thereafter obtained an ex parte restraining order against rosenfeld subsequently,a hearing was held to determine whether the ex parte order should be continued in effect.rosenfeld,egy,and baima were present at this hearing,during which egy submitted to the probate judge a written police report detailing rosenfeld alleged failure to comply with the initial order.the court ultimately continued charlotte restraining order.
although the above events are undisputed,their causes are hotly contested.specifically,the parties dispute the actual motivations behind charlotte procurement of the restraining order and baima decision to deny the renewal application.an appreciation of the parties competing versions requires some backtracking.
in,officer rosenfeld had sued chief baima for trespassing on his property.apparently,baima had entered rosenfeld home to ensure that rosenfeld,who had called in sick to work that day,was genuinely sick.in,the millis board of selectmen held seemingly unrelated hearings to determine whether baima should be removed as police chief although rosenfeld,egy,and several other police officers testified against baima at the hearings,the board took no adverse action.rosenfeld believes that baima has held a grudge against him ever since.
despite any grudge that may have existed,baima and rosenfeld enjoyed a professional working relationship during the ten years that followed the hearings.but in,a series of events caused the relationship to sour.the problems began when charlotte rosenfeld informed officer egy that her husband had been abusing her.egy thereafter began calling the rosenfeld home times per day,allegedly out of concern for charlotte safety.rosenfeld contends,however,that he never abused charlotte and that,in fact,egy and charlotte were involved in an extramarital affair.
disgusted with the constant interaction between charlotte and egy under the guise of friendship,rosenfeld initiated the april,altercation.upon encountering egy at the station house,rosenfeld demanded that egy stay away from charlotte.egy refused,stating that he knew all about rosenfeld spousal abuse.to prove his point,egy produced a photograph depicting charlotte with a black eye.at some point,egy also struck rosenfeld in the chest.
the following day,rosenfeld notified chief baima of egy assault.when asked to explain his actions,egy informed baima that rosenfeld had been abusing charlotte.thereafter,baima turned the investigation over to the district attorney,removed rosenfeld from the active duty roster,and ordered rosenfeld to surrender his service firearm and firearms license.
these decisions,together with egy assault,egy involvement in the subsequent proceedings,and baima eventual denial of rosenfeld firearms renewal application,were the primary bases for rosenfeld lawsuit.rosenfeld complaint contained fourteen separate counts,collectively alleging violations of the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments,as well as several constitutional and torts under massachusetts law.
following discovery,egy and baima moved for summary judgment on all of rosenfeld claims.as noted earlier,the district court granted summary judgment on all counts except an count,which it dismissed without prejudice under c.see rosenfeld egy,no.civ,wl,memorandum and order on motion for summary judgment.the court reasoned,inter alia,that baima was entitled to qualified immunity on claims arising out of his denial of rosenfeld firearms renewal application,and the doctrine barred certain claims against egy.
this appeal followed.
we review summary judgment decisions de novo,after viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.rosenberg city of everett,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
rosenfeld raises several arguments on appeal challenging the district court entry of summary judgment.having considered all such arguments,we agree with the district court that summary judgment was proper on all counts except the count.because we are convinced by the court thorough reasoning with respect to most of rosenfeld claims,we affirm its entry of judgment on those claims without further elaboration.in our view,only two issues warrant further discussion whether the district court properly granted summary judgment for baima on rosenfeld claim that the denial of his firearms renewal application deprived him of his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and whether the district court properly granted egy summary judgment on rosenfeld constitutional claim against him.we discuss these issues in turn.
a.the denial of the renewal application 
we first consider rosenfeld claim that baima refusal to renew rosenfeld license to carry,after receiving no corroborating evidence of rosenfeld alleged domestic abuse,was nothing more than retaliatory discipline originating from baima discriminatory animus.rosenfeld contends that this discriminatory animus,allegedly rooted in hard feelings about rosenfeld trespass suit and testimony before the millis board of selectmen,caused baima to deny the renewal application in violation of rosenfeld rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.
in granting summary judgment for baima on this claim,the district court ruled that baima was entitled to qualified immunity.see harlow fitzgerald,d g overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.the able district court judge may well have decided this question correctly,but we need not and do not reach it rosenfeld claim fails because no reasonable jury could find either a first or fourteenth amendment violation on the facts that rosenfeld has adduced.saucier katz,d a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right this must be the initial inquiry.citation omitted.
before turning to the first amendment claim,we dispose of rosenfeld fourteenth amendment equal protection and substantive due process claims,which do not require extensive analysis.as to equal protection,rosenfeld h
