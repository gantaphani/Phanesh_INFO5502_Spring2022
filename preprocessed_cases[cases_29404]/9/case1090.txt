background 
on august,at approximately marie gilles,a old united states citizen of haitian descent,was traveling southbound through westchester county on the taconic state parkway.she was driving a white dodge cargo van,owned by her brother.she was transporting approximately ten packed gallon cardboard barrels to a shipping facility in mount vernon,new york.gilles owned the adonai community store,a grocery store,in poughkeepsie,new york.as part of her business she provided a shipping service for her customers to send supplies to relatives overseas.gilles did not have personal knowledge of the contents of the barrels,but had the shipping invoices with her.according to the invoices,the barrels contained food and clothing to be shipped to destinations in jamaica and haiti.
on his way to work detective guy repicky noticed gilles van,driving approximately and apparently heavily laden.repicky observed some barrels,partly covered by a blanket.he also noticed that the van slowed and moved abruptly into the right lane when passed by a marked police car 
repicky has been employed with the westchester county department of public safety since october,and has been a detective since.in november he was assigned to the department unit.as part of his responsibilities he was advised by the new york state police upstate new york regional intelligence center of all terrorism alerts and activities relevant to westchester county.in august,as a result of the republican national convention which was scheduled to start on august,the department had been put on alert for improvised explosive devices vbieds which could possibly be used in the new york metropolitan area.vans were specifically indicated as capable of carrying such devices.repicky was aware of this alert.
repicky called his dispatcher and requested that she run the van license plate.his dispatcher informed him that the plate had been reported as stolen 
repicky requested state police assistance to stop the van,and was present when several new york state police marked patrol cars stopped the van at approximately repicky approached the passenger side of the van,and a state trooper approached the driver side of the van.both officers approached the van with their guns drawn.gilles testified that repicky screamed at her,pointed his gun at her and threatened to shoot her if she moved.the state trooper ordered gilles out of the van,and placed her in handcuffs.she was placed in the rear of the marked police car,with her hands cuffed behind her back.
gilles and repicky disagree about what happened next.gilles asserts that she was asked for her driver license and she responded that it was in her car.she kept asking what did i do she told repicky that the barrels contained food,clothing and school supplies.repicky asserts that gilles initially did answer his questions and that she was very upset and crying,that after about five to ten minutes she became responsive,but repeatedly told repicky that she did not know what was in the barrels.
after the van was pulled over,a dog was brought to the scene,but did not alert.repicky then requested a narcotics dog.while the narcotics dog was at the scene,repicky was informed that the reported stolen license plate was an error.the narcotics dog also did not alert.
gilles and repicky again disagree about what happened next.repicky contends that after he learned about the stolen license plate error,he asked another officer on the scene to remove gilles handcuffs,approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after the initial stop.gilles contends that she was held in handcuffs for more than one hour.
the officers searched the van and recovered gilles driver license and the shipping invoices.they did not discover any explosive devices or materials that could be used to create such a device.gilles maintains that she explained that her customers bought quantities of food and clothing items on sale in this country to send to their relatives in jamaica and haiti.repicky claims that gilles continued to disavow knowledge of the contents of the containers.
according to repicky,at approximately he requested that gilles accompany him to headquarters,but told her i ca just let you go.repicky testified that his motive for asking her to come voluntarily to headquarters was to enable her to use the bathroom to clean up because it was evident that she had begun to menstruate heavily.according to gilles,repicky ordered her to follow them back to headquarters.gilles acknowledged that she had begun to bleed,but testified that repicky never asked her to come to headquarters or gave her any reason other than that he had to complete his investigation.gilles was permitted to drive her van,with a police vehicle in front of her and a police vehicle behind her.she did not feel free to leave,and repicky testified that she was detained at that point,although not under arrest.
at police headquarters,repicky eventually spoke to someone at the shipping company,who confirmed that gilles had an ongoing business relationship with them.repicky spoke with his supervisors and then informed gilles that she was free to leave,at 
gilles filed a civil rights action against repicky,asserting that her continued detention violated her fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.in an unpublished decision,the district court granted summary judgment to repicky,finding that repicky was entitled to qualified immunity for his actions.gilles repicky,civ.clb,wl,at.specifically,the district court concluded that it was objectively reasonable for detective repicky to have believed that his actions were lawful at the time of the stop and detention of plaintiff.id.the district court dismissed gilles contention that her continued detention was unreasonable the fact that more time was taken than necessary in connection with otherwise reasonable police conduct is not in itself a basis for a civil rights violation.id.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party.russo city of bridgeport,cir.quoting hoyt andreucci,cir,cert.denied,d.we accept gilles evidence as true and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.see also scott harris,d.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and where the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,we will affirm the district court only if no rational trier of fact could conclude that the facts established that repicky violated gilles constitutional rights and was unprotected by qualified immunity.see russo,at.
ii.qualified immunity 
qualified immunity protects officials from liability for civil damages as long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.a right is clearly established if t he contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.
when a defendant officer charged with violations of federal constitutional rights invokes qualified immunity to support a motion for summary judgment,a court must first consider a threshold question do the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right
