in this appeal from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,covello,we are asked to determine the scope of title vii clause forbidding an employer from retaliating against an employee who has testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in a title vii related proceeding.we previously have held that an employee who offers testimony in a title vii lawsuit squarely engages in a form of statutorily protected activity.we now determine that such protection extends to an employee who is named as a voluntary witness in a title vii suit,but who is never called on to testify.our previous interpretation of the clause and the congressional intent behind title vii lead us to this conclusion.we therefore affirm the district court determination that the employee in this case participated in protected activity for the purposes of alleging her retaliation claims.
however,we conclude that the district court erred in its summary dismissal of those claims.first,the court neglected to recognize and weigh certain adverse employment actions as relevant background evidence,and second,it impermissibly limited the suit to only those accusations explicitly raised in a retaliation charge filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.finally,we hold that the district court prematurely dismissed an allegation that the retaliatorily furnished a negative job reference.absent these errors,a factual record sufficient to withstand summary judgment exists.
therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court in part,vacate it in part,and remand for trial.
as we must,we relate the facts of this dispute in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
in august,donna jute began working for hamilton sundstrand hamilton,a corporation headquartered in connecticut that designs and manufactures aerospace products.for approximately fourteen years she worked in various hourly wage positions with the company.on january,jute was terminated along with nineteen other employees in her pay grade.hamilton asserts that jute termination was the result of a reorganization,whereas jute claims it was retaliatory.
specifically,jute contends that hamilton began to retaliate against her immediately after she was named as a witness in a title vii lawsuit the plaintiff in that case,maryanne brunton,claimed that in june she campaigned for an executive board position with the union representing hamilton hourly disparaging flyers about her were posted throughout the workplace.in response to these postings,hamilton initiated an internal investigation.apparently at both brunton and hamilton separate requests,jute provided two statements to investigators in which she attested to witnessing a female leave the denigrating flyers in a company restroom.
based on the foregoing incident,in december,brunton sued hamilton,as well as her union and its president,alleging that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment.see et.the brunton litigation progressed for approximately three years,during which time jute statements to the hamilton investigators were incorporated into the record.in addition,jute agreed to testify on brunton behalf.to that end,jute saved several vacation days to ensure that she could readily take time off from work to be deposed.moreover,during a deposition conducted on july,brunton named jute as the sole witness who had observed another employee posting the flyers in the women restroom.before jute was called to offer deposition testimony of her own,the brunton lawsuit settled.
the day after brunton july,deposition,jute claims that she heard her supervisor,natonia,angrily storming down the hall toward jute workstation.confronted jute and removed her from a team the jde team that was upgrading hamilton computer system,even though she had been working as a technician with the team for well over a year.jute suggests that this demotion was particularly suspect given that,in a formal performance appraisal,a supervisor had deemed her work with the team to be a tremendous asset,and in july the project was at a critical stage.in addition,the post with the jde team offered jute a unique opportunity for career advancement at hamilton.jute asserts,for example,that she had been promised a salaried position or a pay raise if her productivity with the team continued.
initially,jute did not suspect that her removal was traceable to the brunton litigation.in december,however,jute contacted brunton to ask whether she would be deposed sometime in early december,otherwise she was prepared to use her saved vacation days during the christmas holiday.it was during this conversation that jute learned for the first time that the case had settled,and more significantly,that brunton had named jute as a favorable witness during the july deposition.now suspicious,jute approached hamilton manager of human resources,ingrid delgado,about the situation.according to jute,delgado instructed her to find another job as the harassment was never going to stop.in this suit,jute points to delgado statement as direct proof of retaliatory animus.
in addition to the removal from the jde team,jute alleges that after brunton deposition,and over the course of two years,hamilton engaged in numerous other retaliatory acts.first,in august,hamilton informed jute that she was no longer needed to teach an evening aerobics class at hamilton,a position jute sought to supplement her income.second,in september,hamilton elected not to promote jute to a higher pay grade despite alleged earlier promise to do so.third,in september,jute served as a cutoff for promotion training,meaning that jute and employees less senior than she could receive a promotion only if they worked nights fourth,in september,jute was denied a promotion despite having completed the requisite training.fifth,in september,hamilton denied the jde team leader request that jute accompany the team on business trips sixth,in december,jute was denied a salaried position with position that might have insulated jute from layoffs aimed at hourly employees that were part of a corporate restructuring.seventh,as part of the restructuring,jute was fired in january.finally,jute claims that following her termination she was blackballed when she was not referred to international fuel cells ifc,a company related to hamilton,for future employment.thus,while other former hamilton employees with less experience than jute were interviewed and hired by ifc in the winter and spring of,ifc never contacted jute.
on may,jute filed a charge of discrimination with the connecticut commission on human rights and opportunities cchro and with the eeoc.in the charges,jute specifically alleged that hamilton retaliatorily terminated her in january denied her a salaried position in january,making her vulnerable to the impending layoff and withheld a promotion in september,although she had completed the necessary training.on october,the cchro dismissed jute charge,finding that further review was not likely to reveal a wrongful firing.separately,on december,the eeoc issued a right to sue letter.
while her administrative charges were pending before the cchro and eeoc,jute secured an interview for a position with ifc.jute claims that she was offered a job with the company in november,but that the offer was subsequently withdrawn.jute contends that the position was rescinded because of comments her former supervisor,byron yost,made during a reference check.yost apparently advised an inquiring ifc representative that he had been directed not to discuss matters pertaining to jute because she had a lawsuit pending against hamilton.technically,this comment was not true.at that time jute had only filed administrative charges with the eeoc and cchro.
two months after yost comment,in january,jute filed a complaint against hamilton alleging retaliation under title vii and connecticut state law see et.et.following numerous settlement attempts and a period of discovery,hamilton moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.in a comprehensive,page published opinion,the district court granted the request on the basis that jute failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.see jute hamilton sundstrand,d.in so doing,the district court agreed with all of hamilton arguments but one,agreeing with jute that her involvement in the brunton litigation constituted protected activity.see id.at.as for jute further involvement in protected activity,the district court noted hamilton would have been unlawful to retaliate against jute because she had filed charges with the cchro and eeoc see id.
the district court then proceeded to consider whether jute had been subjected to any adverse employment actions.it held that jute was from raising as actionable conduct those alleged adverse employment actions that occurred before july,because they amounted to discrete acts occurring more than three hundred days before the filing of the cchro and eeoc charges.see id.at.consequently,the district court ruled that it could not consider these alleged instances of adverse employment action,which formed the lion share of jute claims.id.
the court also held that it could not consider actions occurring within three hundred days of the filing of the eeoc charge unless they were specifically pled before the eeoc.id.at.on this basis,the district court refused to examine jute allegations regarding the september retaliatory refusal to authorize travel with the jde team,or the january retaliatory refusal to list her name to ifc for potential hire.see id.
based on the and rulings,the district court strictly limited itself to a consideration of the following alleged adverse employment actions the september promotion denial the january decision not to elevate jute to a salaried position the january termination and the november comments made during the ifc reference check.see id.with the evidence so narrowed,the district court held that there existed a significant lapse of time between the protected activity on the one hand,the july disclosure of jute as a witness in the brunton litigation,and the first instance of adverse employment action considered by the court on the other hand,the september promotion denial.id.the court thus reasoned that these events were temporally too far removed to satisfy title vii causal link element.id.at.
but,the district court did hold that there existed some temporal proximity between a protected activity and an alleged instance of adverse action.specifically,the court ruled that the statements yost made during ifc reference check in november were close enough in time to jute may cchro and eeoc filings to support an inference of causation.see id.nonetheless,the district court held that even these events did not present a triable issue because jute did not submit an affidavit or direct proof from an ifc representative to show that hamilton statements caused or contributed to her rejection by ifc.id.quoting sarno douglas ives,cir.the district court thus held that jute had failed to present a prima facie case of retaliation.accordingly,the claims were dismissed and this timely appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,see terry ashcroft,cir,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,see anderson liberty lobby,d.a motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless the court determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried and that the facts as to which there is no such issue warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.cronin aetna life ins,cir.in some respects then,summary judgment may be viewed as a drastic procedural weapon because its prophylactic function,when exercised,cuts off a party right to present his case to the jury.garza marine transp.lines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
title vii forbids any employer from discriminat ing against any of its employees because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in a title vii investigation,proceeding,or hearing.a.retaliation claims under title vii are evaluated under a analysis.see quinn green tree credit,cir.
first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case.that is,an employee must show participation in a protected activity that the defendant knew of the protected activity an adverse employment action and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.mcmenemy city of rochester,cir.the burden of proof that must be met to permit a title vii plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion at the prima facie stage has been characterized as minimal and de minimis.woodman,cir quoting zimmermann assocs.first capital,cir.in determining whether this initial burden is satisfied in a title vii retaliation claim,the court role in evaluating a summary judgment request is to determine only whether proffered admissible evidence would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a retaliatory motive.see donahue windsor locks bd.of fire comm rs,cir.
if a plaintiff sustains the initial burden,a presumption of retaliation arises.in turn,under the second step of the analysis,the onus falls on the employer to articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.see quinn,at.finally,as for the third step,once an employer offers such proof,the presumption of retaliation dissipates and the employee must show that retaliation was a substantial reason for the adverse employment action.see fields new york state office of mental retardation developmental disabilities,cir.in this regard,a retaliation claim follows the familiar framework developed to evaluate allegations of disparate treatment.see mcdonnell douglas green,d reed lawrence,cir.
as noted earlier,the district court determined that jute was unable to establish a prima facie case and consequently dismissed the suit.it is to the propriety of this decision that we now turn.
by being named as a potential witness,did jute participate in a title vii case 
section a of title vii provides protection for two distinct classes of employees first,those opposing discrimination proscribed by the statute and second,those participating in title vii proceedings.to be specific,the clause of a reads,in pertinent part 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of its employees because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.
a emphasis added.the district court held that jute involvement in the brunton litigation qualified as participation in a title vii related proceeding.on appeal,hamilton raises this threshold issue,arguing that jute involvement in the brunton suit was too attenuated to so qualify.we disagree.
we recently had occasion to consider the scope of a participation clause.in deravin kerik,we explained that its explicit language is expansive and seemingly contains no limitations,cir.this determination rested on the statute use of the phrase participate in any manner.id.we found that these words evinced congress intent to confer exceptionally broad protection as the word any has an expansive meaning,and thus,so long as congress did not add any language limiting the breadth of that word,the term any must be given literal effect.id.at quoting united states gonzales,d.against this backdrop,we held that an employee who involuntarily testified in an employment discrimination case about his own allegedly discriminatory conduct had participated in a title vii proceeding.id.at.
in this case we face a slightly different circumstance.here,jute volunteered to offer testimony to support another discrimination lawsuit,but she was never called on to do so.guided by our previous definition of the clause and by the need to interpret the provision in light of title vii overall remedial purpose,id.at,we draw no significant distinction between deravin and the instant case.
first,as we must,we begin with the text of the relevant statute.see robinson shell oil,d see also castellano city of new york,cir.as already stated,the clause protects an individual who has participated in any manner in a title vii related proceeding.a.the plain meaning of the term participate provides each side in the pending appeal with helpful language.on one hand,helpful to hamilton,some authorities define participation as requiring some deliberate,affirmative action.see,black law dictionary ed defining participation as t he act of taking part in something,such as a partnership,a crime,or a trial american heritage college dictionary ed defining participate as t o take part in something.on the other hand,other authorities define participation as encompassing the kind of involvement that jute had in the brunton litigation.see,xi oxford english dictionary ed defining participation as a taking part,association,or sharing with others in some action or matter webster third new international dictionary defining participate as to have a part or share in something.these latter definitions are helpful to jute having been named as a voluntary witness who had agreed to offer testimony on matters relevant to brunton case,it may be plausibly argued that jute ha d a part in or an association with the brunton litigation.thus,because the clause sweeps broadly through the phrase in any manner,a circumstance we recognized in deravin,we might be justified in resolving the matter by resorting only to the plain language of the statute.
but,we need not resolve the issue solely on this basis.we find additional support in that canon of statutory construction that allows us to consider the broader context of the statute as a whole to ensure that statutory language is defined in accordance with a statute overall purpose.see bob jones united states,d see also robinson,at.
title vii combats unlawful employment practices,and it does so principally through reliance on employee initiative.in recognition of this fact,congress enacted the clause to shield an employee from employer retaliation following the employee attempt to challenge discriminatory conduct.the supreme court has therefore opined that a primary purpose of a is to m aintain unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.robinson,at.
it would be destructive of this purpose to leave an employee who is poised to support a discrimination claim wholly unprotected.accepting hamilton argument would mean,for example,that an employer could freely retaliate against a title vii whistleblower,as long as it did so before the employee actually testified.placing a voluntary witness into this kind of legal limbo would impede remedial mechanisms by denying interested parties access to the unchilled testimony of witnesses.glover south carolina law enforcement,cir.thus,declining to extend a to an employee like jute would thwart the congressional intent underlying the clause.
based on the foregoing,and accepting all of jute allegations as true,we hold that jute is entitled to protection from retaliation by virtue of her involvement in the brunton litigation.the record before us shows that jute had collaborated with brunton,such that brunton candidly named jute as a voluntary and favorable witness.moreover,the record indicates that jute planned to testify on brunton behalf as jute testified in this case,she had saved vacation days so that she would be immediately available for deposition in the brunton litigation when finally called.gifford atchison,topeka santa fe,cir holding that there existed no legal distinction between the filing of a charge with the eeoc,which is clearly protected,and threatening to file a charge internal citation omitted sword runyon,eeoc doc,wl,at may,explaining that an employee intended use of the eeo process constituted protected activity.and there exists indirect evidence that this intention was communicated to hamilton.most convincing,jute was removed from the jde team just one day after being named as a favorable plaintiff witness.moreover,within a month,jute claims hamilton engaged in two additional retaliatory acts,the rescission of both the aerobics instructor position and a promised promotion.this chain of events would allow a jury to infer that hamilton knew about jute involvement in the brunton lawsuit.see gordon new york city bd.of,cir noting that jury could find employer knowledge of protected activity from circumstantial evidence see also woodman,at observing in title vii discrimination case that k nowledge is a fact often in criminal cases where the prosecution burden is beyond a reasonable through circumstantial evidence.
to be sure,jute participation in the brunton litigation was indirect as compared to the situation we would confront had jute actually provided deposition testimony.but,as we recognized in deravin,congress chose to provide protection by shielding an employee who participate s in any manner in a title vii proceeding.a.therefore,we conclude that congress intended the clause to protect a volunteer witness poised to testify in support of a discrimination claims 
having established that jute engaged in a known,protected activity by her involvement in the brunton litigation,we now turn to whether jute established the remainder of a prima facie case.
b.did jute establish a prima facie case 
whether jute established the remaining elements of a prima facie case under title vii principally turns on that element requiring an employee to demonstrate a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.the district court held that jute fell short in doing so because there existed significant lapses of time between jute protected activity in july and the actionable adverse employment actions,the earliest of which occurred in september.jute,d at.we hold that the district court erred in so ruling for two reasons.first,it did not consider the events that occurred before september as relevant background evidence.we hold that with proper consideration of these events supporting the actionable claims,a rational jury could find a causal link between the protected activity and the actionable adverse acts.second,the court erred in not adequately considering certain adverse acts on the ground that jute had not specifically raised them in the eeoc charge.here too,we hold that this error led the court to conclude that jute had failed to sustain a prima facie case.we address each instance of error in turn.
background evidence 
an aggrieved employee claiming retaliation must file a charge with the eeoc no later than or days after the alleged adverse act occurs,the exact timing dependent on whether a state has its own agency with authority to investigate the claim.see e.here,because jute initially instituted proceedings before the cchro and with the eeoc,the limitations period applies.id.specifically,then,as jute filed her charges on may,the limitations period allowed jute to sue only for those adverse acts that occurred on or after july.as the district court properly ruled,any discrete acts occurring before that date are not actionable.see national passenger morgan,d.jute does not contest that ruling,but instead asserts that the court impermissibly barred her from relying on the,adverse employment acts as background evidence to support the actionable claims.we agree.
when,as here,an employee allegations of retaliation extend beyond the limitations period,the circumstances surrounding the claim will determine precisely what consideration is owed to the conduct.see petrosino bell atlantic,cir.the statute of limitations requires that only one alleged adverse employment action have occurred within the applicable filing period.but,evidence of an earlier alleged retaliatory act may constitute relevant background evidence in support of that timely claim.morgan,at.see also petrosino,at.hence,relevant background evidence,such as statements by a decisionmaker or earlier decisions typifying the retaliation involved,may be considered to assess liability on the timely alleged act.see,petrosino,at characterizing earlier promotion denials as relevant background evidence internal quotation marks omitted lyons england,cir explaining that background evidence may include being shifted to enhancing jobs and promotion denials roebuck drexel,cir explaining that decisionm
