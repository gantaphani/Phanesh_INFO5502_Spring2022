this is a employment discrimination case in which plaintiff alice mercedes seeks to hold her employer vicariously liable primarily for the actions of her supervisor.the appeal is from the grant of summary judgment to del caribe,the employer.claims that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and constructively discharged as a result of sexual harassment by her immediate supervisor,a female,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,et,and puerto rico law.the district court held that the undisputed material facts permitted the conclusion that the conduct of the supervisor was boorish and unprofessional,but that the incidents were not severe or pervasive enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment,and that was not constructively discharged.crespo schering plough del caribe,d.
a jury could easily find that was subjected to incivility.but title vii is neither a civility code nor a general code.title vii requires,rather,that the level of incivility or harassment must amount to either a tangible or a constructive employment action.furthermore,the alleged harassment and the employment action must be causally related.the discrimination must be based on gender or some other prohibited category.here,complains of a general atmosphere of harassment by her supervisor that she argues was so bad it drove her out of her job and was a constructive discharge.she fails to show that the harassment she suffered amounted to a constructive discharge.she also complains that her failure to get a transfer to florida and her reassignment to a new sales territory in puerto rico were tangible employment actions.but those decisions were not made by her supervisor,but by her supervisor superiors,none of whom participated in any harassment.indeed,as to the reassignment,these upper level supervisors were being responsive to statements that she did not want to work with her supervisor.there is nothing showing a causal link between any alleged harassment and the motivation of the managers in these decisions.as a result,we affirm.
on appeal from the entry of summary judgment,this court views the facts in the light most favorable to and draws all reasonable inferences in her favor.rivera aqueduct sewers,cir.
provided the following account in her deposition.on april,she began training with schering,a pharmaceutical company,and on may,she began working as an entry level medical salesperson.she had no prior experience in the medical sales field.was initially assigned to visit doctors in the hato rey area of san juan,puerto rico,but nothing in her employment offer guaranteed her a specific sales area.hato rey has a high concentration of physicians.
mayra gonzález was promoted from being a sales representative to the position of district manager in june and became immediate supervisor in july.thus,a neophyte manager,gonzález,came to supervise a neophyte sales representative.about thirteen other employees also worked under gonzález supervision.on july,gonzález told y ou know that now i your supervisor and now you have to do what i tell you to do.gonzález also told that she should never go to gonzález boss,anita bursian,with a problem.the same day,gonzález made comments to regarding the private lives and sexual preferences of other schering employees.gonzález said that she did not get along with her,whom she said was a lesbian and treated her badly,and she discussed a schering employee who,although unmarried,had lived with and had a child with a doctor.testimony was that gonzález had many stories about.
gonzález repeatedly questioned about how she,as a rookie,had come to be assigned to the hato rey territory.at one point,gonzález told that the reason she was assigned there was that schering general manager,roberto mercade,was crazy about her looks.gonzález advised that she should become gonzález best friend in the company and should tell her everything that happened at schering.after earned a large commission,gonzález told to invite her to lunch because earned more money than she did.declined and gonzález never asked her again.
gonzález also bothered with meddlesome and prying questions about her personal life and made comments about her appearance and behavior.gonzález asked for the names of the stores where she bought her clothes and accessories.gonzález also asked for opinion about the doctors she visited and inquired whether she ever dated doctors.gonzález once told that she had always wanted to be tall and blonde like her and commented that was enviably thin.
the relationship had its ups and downs.at times friendly,gonzález was also critical of.gonzález accused of being very disorganized and said that her disorganization probably explained why she did not have a husband.gonzález also told her that she was a mediocre sales representative and stated that she was using her physical attributes,not her technical knowledge,to sell schering products.said that gonzález often looked at her in a very intimidating way.at one point,gonzález said you have never married because maybe you strange,rara gonzález commented that and maría montalvo,one of,would be able to have lunch together frequently and that she had heard that and montalvo got along very well.more than once,gonzález told that she did not appreciate the fact that she had a job as a sales representative for schering.
in august,while gonzález and were at a hotel during a schering convention,anita bursian complained about having a migraine headache.when offered to get some medication from her hotel room,gonzález asked for her bedroom keys and said that she would get the medication from room.refused to hand over her keys,and that was that.
on several occasions,complained about gonzález to anita bursian,gonzález boss.she first went to bursian sometime between october and november and told her everything.but never explained on the record what this everything was.also occasionally spoke critically to other fellow employees about gonzález and about individual incidents.
one day in october,gonzález told that she had heard that was crawling drunk at a wedding.the accusation was untrue.when said that gonzález was wrong and asked her to stop making the false statement,gonzález backed off and told that she could not take a joke.on another occasion in october,gonzález called and,in a loud voice and with a scolding tone,accused her of having a negative attitude and threatened to reassign her to a new territory.in december,gonzález informed her that she would have to work during a week that was considered a holiday period for sales representatives.called schering personnel office and was advised that gonzález could not require her to work the additional week.she did not work that week.
still,a performance development plan for,dated january,and signed by gonzález,provided positive evaluations of work.among other things,the document notes e xcellent territory analysis,e xcellent business development,e xcellent communication skills,and g ood administrative work,all reports on time.
on january,became sick with asthmatic bronchitis and took four days of sick leave from work.gonzález called at home and paged her and expressed doubts regarding her illness.on january,gonzález ordered her to fax a medical certificate evidencing her illness,even though company policy did not require the production of such a certificate until returning to work.at the end of that january,became sick with acute indigestion at schering national convention.when informed gonzález that she was ill and excused herself,gonzález replied,are you afraid of me and asked that question in a very disgusting way.later during the same convention,gonzález commented that almost never wore skirts,looked very sexy in skirts,and should wear them more often.at a pediatrician convention in february,gonzález approached from behind,hugged her,and whispered in her ear a request for a cookie from another table.
in february,told anita bursian that this was going so far,that she needed to go and that she wanted to leave this hostile environment so she needed a transfer.gave bursian and gonzález a letter for the human resources department indicating that she wanted a transfer,but they told her that she should deal with them,not with human resources.bursian and gonzález gave the numbers to call at schering offices in florida to inquire about a transfer.was interviewed in florida and was,she says,tentatively accepted for a position there.after learning of transfer request,gonzález told several times that she could not wait for the day when would leave.
on march,requested an interview with mercade,the general manager,who called a meeting for march.before the meeting,gonzález told that she should resign.five people attended the meeting,gonzález,mercade,bursian,and myrna burgos from the human resources department.testified that she told those present at the meeting 
that gonzález was harassing me,following me,calling me,staring at me,saying things to me i said everything,and when i was ready to tell them hey,this is sexual harassment,i not going to take it,gonzález interrupted and started saying that i was a poor employee they said we do have to listen to you and this is it then they left t hey never let me talk.
during the meeting,gonzález produced a job evaluation rating performance as poor.had no knowledge of that evaluation prior to the meeting.
testified that she raised the issue of her transfer to florida at the meeting and that mercade blocked the transfer,saying that nobody can leave without telling me,nobody gets to transfer.said that when mercade made that statement,bursian and gonzález became aware that they had made a mistake in not realizing that all transfers had to go through mercade.
a contemporaneous memo,dated march,from myrna burgos to the personnel file describes the march meeting as follows.burgos refers to the purpose of the meeting as to listen about complaint of harassment by gonzález.at the meeting,read a long list of incidents and comments connected with her uneasiness and her relationship with her supervisor.among primary allegations were gonzález constant threats of reassignment to a new territory,gonzález accusations of disorganization and insecurity,gonzález prohibitions against her talking directly with bursian,and gonzález meddling in her personal life.also alleged that other workers in the hato rey territory felt equally pressured but did not dare to talk about it.
the memo recites that gonzález responded by saying that did not exhibit teamwork,communication,pri d e and commitment.gonzález noted that territory changes are frequent at schering,and she complained,among other things,that did not always respond to her beeper,did not always communicate her absences,had taken vacation in excess of her accrual,arrived late,had low medical coverage,gonzález to other people and to gonzález,failed to fulfill certain administrative duties,and had not demonstrated a commitment to the company the memo notes that bursian spoke at the meeting as well,but it does not document what she said.
the memo summarizes the outcome of the meeting 
after listening to both parties and to anita bursian,we conclude that many of the situations stated have been the result of lack of positive and constructive communication among the parties,and communication of lee in the improper forums lee was reminded that her lack of compliance with administrative matters had repercussions in other departments,and that it was the supervisor duty to point out to her the areas where her performance could improve 
burgos memo also confirms that requested a new supervisor at the meeting and was told that making such a change was not customary but could be accomplished by moving her to another territory.gonzález told that she could continue to work for her.the memo notes that had repeatedly requested that she not be reassigned to a new territory,but indicates that she did accept the change in territory offered to her at the meeting.
a different memo from burgos to the personnel file memorializes a meeting between burgos and that occurred on march,the day after the meeting,at request.burgos writes 
was greatly dismayed and tearful over the result of the group meeting because it was her perception we had gotten off on a tangent on the matter of her compliance with the administrative portion of her work i asked her what it was she expected,and she told me she had been the victim of abuse on the part of gonzález,and that she expected us to reprimand gonzález 
during the meeting,burgos told that the change in territory eliminated the harassment situation she was alleging.admitted to burgos that she had failed in certain areas of her job that were pointed out during the previous day meeting.also told burgos that she was extremely lonely,had gone into a depression because of the situation with gonzález,and wanted to move to orlando where her family and friends were.the memo indicates that was anxiously awaiting a final offer from the schering office in florida.told burgos that she really wanted to leave and,if an opportunity did not come up with schering,she was going to resign anyway.
at some point,was informed that schering would not agree to her transfer to florida.mercade,apparently,made that decision.
she was told that she was being reassigned from the hato rey territory to the territory.the doctors in the new territory were mostly dermatologists.dermatologists do not usually prescribe the medications that were the mainstays of sales.was concerned that her commissions would be significantly lower because she was not going to be selling medicines that dermatologists typically prescribe.
maintains that she never agreed to a change in territory and,in fact,wanted to remain in the hato rey territory.she says that she requested a new supervisor at the meeting but did not want a new supervisor if it meant giving up her present territory.
was to become new supervisor effective april.in a memo to dated march,he outlined work duties and then added you will not be permitted any type of alter c ation and insults insubordination this includes gossiping,rumors,altercations,yelling,or negative communication toward me or any member of our division.
another march memo from to reprimanded her for failing to communicate to one of her or inability to attend a certain convention that had taken place on march.the memo stated that the march absence was not the first time you have been absent from conventions and meetings,referred to continuous absenteeism,and listed three previous meetings from which was absent.
effective april,received a percent salary increase,which was approved by gonzález.on march,a psychiatrist issued a medical certificate diagnosing with severe major depression and recommending rest from that date until may.after march,never again returned to work.on april,was sent to schering doctor,who,says,suggested that she leave the company.
on april,new supervisor,sent a letter to burgos requesting that the company take action against for comments that she made about him to burgos insinuating that he had a relationship with gonzález.burgos had informed that had said that there was something more than between gonzález and.
burgos sent a letter dated may,that listed certain company documents requested from her and stated that had ignored schering many requests to surrender those documents.the letter also reminded that she was required either to submit certification from her doctor that she was capable of continuing to drive the company car or to surrender the car.
during april and may,schering recovered from the product samples in her possession and also took back the company car.on may,burgos called and offered her three months salary and six months health care coverage if she would resign.on may,psychiatrist issued a second medical certificate,this time recommending that rest for an indefinite period of time.neither nor her psychiatrist had any idea when she would recover from depression.
on june,resigned.her resignation letter stated that she was resigning because of the voluntary and unjustified acts of schering management that have reached such a level of oppression and onerousness that they do not leave me any other alternative.claims that she never got paid for two of the months that she worked despite her requests for such payments 
in june,moved to florida she was unemployed there until april,when she began working as a medical sales representative for professional detailing.
review of the grant of schering summary judgment motion is de novo.summary judgment should only be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see anderson liberty lobby,d there is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.
seeks to hold schering liable primarily for allegedly harassing conduct by her supervisor,gonzález.the supreme court decision in burlington,ellerth,d,clarified the rules of employer liability for actions by a supervisor in a harassment case.if harassment by a supervisor with immediate or higher authority over an employee results in a tangible employment action against the employee,then the employer is vicariously liable if the harassment does not result in a tangible employment action but is sufficiently severe or pervasive,then the employer is still vicariously liable but an affirmative defense is available.id.at.thus,title vii may be violated by either explicit or constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employment.id.at.
explicit is,tangible employment significant changes in employment status,including,but not limited to,hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at.by contrast,constructive alterations must be severe or pervasive id.at.see also passenger morgan,d a hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.internal quotation marks omitted.our analysis concludes that neither suffered a tangible employment action at the hands of her supervisor gonzález nor faced sufficiently severe or pervasive harassment from her supervisor we do not reach the issue of the affirmative defense.
tangible employment action 
as we understand it,case suggests three possible tangible employment actions constructive discharge,failure to allow a transfer,and reassignment.
we start with the denial of transfer request.we assume arguendo that the thwarting of an employee application to transfer could,in some circumstances,constitute a tangible employment action.but there must be a causal link between the tangible employment action and the alleged harassment.that is,the harassing supervisor must be the one who orders the tangible employment action or,at the very least,must be otherwise substantially responsible for the action here,there is no proof that gonzález ordered or adversely influenced the denial of the transfer to florida.to the contrary,made it clear that gonzález wanted her to transfer gonzález said several times that she could not wait for to transfer.
mercade,the general manager,had the final say whether transfer requests would be approved or denied.there is no evidence that gonzález contributed to the disapproval of the transfer by mercade.in fact,own testimony indicates that gonzález,along with bursian,helped her to secure the tentative offer from the florida office by providing her with the necessary contact information.further testified that gonzález and bursian were caught when mercade said that all transfer requests had to go through him.
reassignment 
a reassignment could constitute a tangible employment action,particularly if it caused a loss of income.but again,there must be a causal link between the tangible employment action and the alleged harassment and harasser.here,there is no proof that gonzález was the one who caused to be reassigned.to the contrary,gonzález told and management at the march meeting that was welcome to continue working for her in the hato rey territory.the reassignment decision was made by mercade,with the assistance of burgos,the human resources representative,and bursian,the district manager.the decision was brought about by request that she be given a new supervisor,and was told that having a new supervisor meant also having a new territory.it was a reasonable response by management to separate the alleged harasser and harassee.the contemporaneous memorandum of the march meeting reflects that management understood that had accepted the change in territory.that now disputes that she ever agreed to the reassignment does not change the fact that there is absolutely no evidence that anyone other than made the decision or that gender discrimination motivated the decision to move her to a new territory.
constructive discharge 
primary tangible employment action argument is that the harassment by her supervisor was so unbearable that she was forced to resign and was thus constructively discharged by schering and,in turn,that such a constructive discharge is a tangible employment action.constructive discharge usually refers to harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking rule save in exceptional intolerable.reed mbna mktg,cir quoting keeler putnam fiduciary trust,cir.in reed,this court declined to adopt a blanket rule as to whether a constructive discharge constitutes a tangible employment action id.
to prove constructive discharge,a plaintiff must usually show that her working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her shoes would have felt compelled to resign.marrero goya of,cir internal quotation marks omitted see de,cir.the standard is an objective one an employee subjective perceptions do not govern.marrero,at suárez pueblo int l,cir.it is not enough that a plaintiff suffered the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely encounter in a hard,cold world.suárez,at.
not all of plaintiff evidence could be taken as evidence of sexual harassment.the comments by gonzález,a new supervisor,to the effect that plaintiff worked for her and plaintiff should not go around gonzález to gonzález boss are hardly evidence of sexual harassment.the incidents that remain,even if taken as harassment,do not rise to the level of creating an intolerable environment.
those incidents also did not amount to a discharge.among other things,the evaluation of a constructive discharge claim takes into account how the employer responded to the plaintiff complaints and whether it was likely that the harassment would continue.see marrero,at see also lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law weirich et,ed.supp.prompt remedial action that eliminates the allegedly intolerable working conditions operates as a complete defense to a claim of constructive discharge.here,once made a complaint,management moved swiftly.there was a meeting,both and gonzález were heard,and management moved away from her nemesis.this undercuts claim that she was forced to leave.
argument that schering actions during the time of her medical leave amounted to harassment and transformed her resignation into a constructive discharge does not save her claim.was on sick leave from march until june,the date of her resignation.there was nothing unreasonable or harassing in asking her to give back the company car and other equipment,inventory,and documents,or in scheduling her for an appointment with the company physician.as testified,neither she nor her treating psychiatrist had any idea when she would recover or return to work.none of schering conduct while was on medical leave created working conditions that were so difficult or unpleasant as to force a reasonable person to resign.there was no constructive discharge.
severe or pervasive harassment 
if a supervisor harassment did not result in a tangible employment action against an employee,then the employee must show that the harassment was so severe or pervasive that,in essence,it altered the terms or conditions of her employment.ellerth,at.the employer is then vicariously liable to the victimized employee unless the employer can successfully assert the affirmative defense outlined in ellerth id.at.reed,at.
all of the circumstances ar
