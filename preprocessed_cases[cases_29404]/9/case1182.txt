the issue presented is whether the civil rights act of,as amended,section may be applied to prohibit an employer allegedly discriminatory conduct arising from the overseas assignment of plaintiff,a.we review here the dismissal by the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge of claims against american international group,aig international,aig financial products,and aig trading group,collectively aig or defendants of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race brought under section.presumably because other discrimination statutes reaching the employment relationship,such as title vii of the civil rights act of,et.title vii,limit pertinent aspects of their coverage to citizens plaintiff federal law claims rest entirely on section,which protects persons.but unlike those other civil rights statutes,which have been amended deliberately to reach conduct occurring outside the united states section protects only persons within the jurisdiction of the united states,a.
based on the text and legislative history of section,we conclude,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,that congress has not extended the coverage of section beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.accordingly,we affirm the holding of the district court dismissing plaintiff section claims to the extent that those claims arise from alleged discriminatory conduct that occurred while plaintiff was living and working in south africa.we conclude,however,that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff claims insofar as he alleges discriminatory conduct that occurred while he was in the united states.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed those claims,and we remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we set forth the facts as alleged by plaintiff,mindful that on a motion to dismiss we accept all factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor.see twombly bell atl,cir.
john ofori is a black man who has been employed by aig and who maintains his permanent residence in connecticut.ofori,a,began working in aig connecticut offices in september as a research analyst.by september,ofori held the position of structurer and marketer in aig financial services division.compl.at that time,senior aig executives based in connecticut and london decided to reassign ofori to work on a temporary basis in one of the company offices in south africa.according to a confirmation of assignment letter signed by ofori on september,south africa was designated as ofori host country,while the united states remained his home country.aig promised,among other things,to a pay ofori salary in dollars,which were to be directly deposited into ofori bank account in connecticut,b cover his housing and transportation costs in south africa,c prepare all necessary paperwork pertaining to his south african employment,and d reimburse him for certain travel expenses to and from the united states.id.
ofori alleges that before and after his arrival in south africa he was singled out for discriminatory treatment on account of his race.specifically,ofori asserts that before he left the united states,aig personnel decided to send him to south africa and made arrangements with respect to his work environment in south africa.ofori workplace in south africa was allegedly situated in an office with a white colleague of questionable ethics,apart from the office where a majority of his white,colleagues worked.see id.upon his arrival,ofori allegedly was subjected to greater scrutiny than his white colleagues when attempting to obtain reimbursement for expenses,see id,blamed for poor business performance that was unrelated to his work,see id,threatened with termination after only a single poor performance review,see id,given a smaller bonus than colleagues,see id,wrongfully accused of stealing funds from the south african businessman with whom he shared an office,see id,improperly suspended from work,see id,and required to provide more documentation than his white colleagues to justify his request for medical leave,see id.
in march,ofori brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against aig and its subsidiaries,alleging that he was subjected to discrimination and retaliated against on the basis of his race,in violation of and new york state human rights law,exec.law et.nyhrl,and subsequently defamed by aig.moved to dismiss ofori claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that despite ofori many contacts with the united states,neither section nor the nyhrl applies to discriminatory conduct that took place outside the territory of the united states.
in an opinion and order dated september,the district court concluded that nothing in the text,structure,or history of section indicates that congress intended it to apply to events outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,and it is therefore presumed that congress did not intend section to apply extraterritorially.see am.int l group,civ,wl,at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court adhered to the supreme court teaching in eeoc arabian american oil company aramco,d,that courts must look to see whether language in the relevant act gives any indication of a congressional purpose to extend its coverage beyond places over which the united states has sovereignty or has some measure of legislative control,and must adopt the presumption that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,wl,at quoting aramco,at.
the district court specifically rejected ofori contention that his section claims should survive,notwithstanding that most of the allegedly discriminatory acts occurred in south africa,because the center of gravity of his employment relationship with aig was supposedly in the united states.noting that in similar contexts w here statutes do not apply extraterritorially,courts have rejected the application of a balancing of contacts test to permit jurisdiction over foreign actions with substantial contacts,the district court concluded that the fact that the alleged discrimination occurred outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states is fatal to ofori claim s under section.id.at.
following its decision to dismiss ofori section claims with prejudice,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ofori remaining state law claims.see c permitting a district court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction where the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.those claims were dismissed without prejudice to their revival in state court.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,accepting as true all facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff.twombly,at.a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.
section and employment discrimination 
section sets forth a remedy for employment discrimination that is independent of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.see johnson ry.express agency,d.specifically,section provides that a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.a reproduced ante note.in patterson mclean credit union,d,the supreme court read the version of section to prohibit racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,but not to apply to conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations,id.section was not therefore able to reach conduct such as breach of the terms of the contract or imposition of discriminatory working conditions.id.at.partly in response to patterson,see lauture int l bus.machs,cir citing,pt.ii,at,reprinted in,congress passed the civil rights act of,stat,which added the language now contained in subsections b and c of section.see id,stat.at.
subsection c explicitly applies section to private discrimination and subsection b explicitly asserts that the term make and enforce contracts includes the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.accordingly,to determine whether ofori claims fall within the scope of section,we must assess whether at the time that he allegedly was denied the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms and conditions of the contractual relationship on account of his race,b,he was,as the statute expressly requires,a person within the jurisdiction of the united states,id.a.
extraterritorial application of section 
in evaluating whether applies to ofori claims,we begin with the legal presumption that congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic,not extraterritorial,application.small united states,d see also aramco,at.we assume that congress legislates against the backdrop of the presumption against extraterritoriality.a bsent clear evidence of congressional intent to apply a statute beyond our borders,the statute will apply only to the territorial united states.united states gatlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we first look to see whether language in the relevant act gives any indication of a congressional purpose to extend its coverage beyond places over which the united states has sovereignty or has some measure of legislative control.aramco,at.alteration in original.if necessary to ascertain congress intent,we may also consider all available evidence about the meaning of the statute,including its structure and legislative history.gatlin,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the plain text of section manifests congress intent to confer on persons within the jurisdiction of the united states the same enumerated right s in every state and territory.a emphases added.far from evincing any intent on the part of congress to apply the statute beyond our borders,gatlin,at,the language of section unambiguously confirms the opposite.moreover,nothing in the structure or history of section suggests that congress intended the statute to reach discrimination against individuals outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.instead,as judge cote aptly explained,
w hat was eventually codified as section originated in as part of a major piece of reconstruction legislation in the wake of the civil war.runyon mccrary,d.see civil rights act of,ch,stat.the object of that legislation was to make all persons born in the united states citizens of the united states,and to ensure that all citizens retained the same basic rights in every state and territory in the united states as white citizens regardless of their race and color and without regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.civil rights act of,ch,stat,emphasis supplied.
wl,at footnote omitted.
four years after enacting the civil rights act of which introduced the provision that would later become section,congress the provision in the voting rights act of.that statute broadened the scope of the law to cover not merely all persons born in the united states and not subject to any foreign power,see civil rights act of,but rather,all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states,see voting rights act of.the act also retained the language referring to the provision of equal rights in every state and territory in the united states.id.
like the version of this statute,section limits its application to persons within territory.the statute not only restricts coverage to conduct taking place in our state s or territor ies,but also confines the availability of its protections to persons within the jurisdiction of the united states.
none of our sister circuits has addressed in a published decision whether applies extraterritorially,but those district courts that have considered the question have unanimously agreed that the statute does not apply outside the united states.see,universidad autonoma de guadalajara,d,de lazzari barbosa merck,no.civ,wl,at,mithani morgan chase,civ,wl,at,gantchar united airlines,c,wl,at,theus pioneer int l.
it is noteworthy that in other contexts where congress has decided to extend the application of civil rights statutes to cover conduct occurring outside the jurisdiction of the united states,it has done so through explicit legislative amendments.for instance,section of the civil rights act of,stat,amended the definition of employee for purposes of title vii and the ada to provide that with respect to employment in a foreign country,the term includes an individual who is a citizen of the united states.f,see also torrico int l bus.machs,d,the language of the amendments to the ada and title vii appl ies those statutes extraterritorially to citizens with respect to employment in a foreign country quoting f.similarly,in,congress amended the definition of employee in section f of the age discrimination in employment act of,et.adea,to mak e provisions of the adea apply to citizens of the united states employed in foreign countries by corporations or their subsidiaries,aramco,at.alteration in original quoting,at.see pub,stat,amending the definition of the term employee in the adea to include any individual who is a citizen of the united states employed by an employer in a workplace in a foreign country codified at f 
alleged discrimination in south africa 
we consider first whether the district court properly dismissed claims involving alleged discrimination that occurred while ofori was living and working in south africa.see,compl.alleging that,after his transfer to south africa,ofori was forced to work in a less desirable office than other south african employees id.from the time that he began working in south africa,ofori was singled out for particular scrutiny and ridicule.emphasis added id.ofori received his only poor performance review while working in south africa id.claiming that ofori was improperly suspended after having been wrongly accused of stealing from the businessman whose office he shared.
ofori contends with respect to these and all of his allegations that section need not be applied extraterritorially in order for him to prevail because under a center of gravity test,his employment contract placed him within the jurisdiction of the united states despite the fact that some of the events occurred overseas.br.of pl.br.at.in particular,he claims,inter alia,that the contract was formed in the united states and that the alleged discriminatory acts affecting him while he was overseas were directed by executives at aig offices in the united states.see id.at.ofori contends that the district court erroneously declined to engage in a balancing of contacts analysis with respect to aspects of his employment relationship having roots or effects within the united states.see id.at.he therefore argues that his claims,including those arising out of conduct occurring entirely while he was living and working in south africa,were improperly dismissed.these arguments are unavailing for several reasons.
first,as noted above,the plain text of section unambiguously requires that a person be within the jurisdiction of the united states,a,in order to assert rights under the statute.we can find nothing in the statutory language indicating congress intent to allow those outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states to raise section claims merely because the relevant employment contract was initially formed in the united states or because the relevant discrimination was directed by persons who were themselves in the united states.accordingly,we hold that absent a clear statement,aramco,at,of congressional intent to extend coverage beyond places over which the united states has sovereignty or has some measure of legislative control,id.at.internal quotation marks omitt
