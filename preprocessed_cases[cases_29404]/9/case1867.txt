montgomery county,maryland,opened a new,consolidated call center using software that was inaccessible to blind employees.the county did not transfer employee yasmin reyazuddin,who is blind,to the call center along with her sighted coworkers.the county also did not hire her for a vacant position there.reyazuddin challenged the county actions as violating section of the rehabilitation act of,west,or title ii of the americans with disabilities act of the ada,et.
section forbids an employer from discriminating against an employee because of her disability.it also requires an employer to accommodate an employee with a disability who can perform the essential functions of a job with a reasonable accommodation.but an employer avoids liability if it can show that providing an accommodation would constitute an undue hardship.
we find that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether reyazuddin could perform the essential job functions of a call center employee whether the county reasonably accommodated her and if the county did not,whether its failure to do so may be excused because of undue hardship.accordingly,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment to the county on reyazuddin section claims.however,we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment to the county on reyazuddin title ii claim because public employees can not use title ii to bring employment discrimination claims against their employers.
in early,as part of its million technology modernization project,montgomery county decided to consolidate its telephone numbers for offices and departments into one call center that residents could reach by dialing.the county goals for its consolidated call center dubbed were to achieve accountability,responsiveness,and efficiency.
in january,the county decided to outfit with software called siebel public sector,licensed from oracle.this software met the county goals,was compatible with other oracle software already used by the county,and was as a,as opposed to custom,product.
the siebel software can be operated in two modes or.mode is not because it is written in microsoft activex,a technology that screen reader software can not interpret.screen reader software enables users who are blind to operate a computer through keyboard shortcuts,instead of mouse clicks,and by hearing synthesized speech or using a refreshable braille display,in place of reading the screen.mode,however,is accessible because it is written in standard html and javascript,which are compatible with screen reader software.
the county license allows it to run the software in either mode.moreover,it is technologically feasible for some employees to operate the software in mode while others work in mode.doing so does not impact overall employee productivity.
the county nonetheless chose to configure the software at in mode for all employees in this mode,employees use three features the cti toolbar,smartscript,and email response that are not available in mode.
the cti toolbar integrates phone system and the siebel software.employees use the cti toolbar to make themselves available to take calls and to answer and transfer calls.smartscript generates a window containing a script for employees to read to callers,a field for typing notes about the call,and a function to transfer emergency calls to.employees then close smartscript and the service request template pops up with fields automatically filled in with the information previously typed into smartscript.
the service request form has a keyword search function that generates a list of articles to help employees answer the caller question.once employees have identified the best article,they click on the attach solution button to add it to the service request form.this in turn causes several fields in the form to populate automatically.these fields include the appropriate department the county public answer,which is a short,concise paragraph about how the c ounty handles the caller particular concern and instructions for employees on how to handle the call.
the county first asked oracle about accessibility in november,more than eleven months after purchasing the license.oracle told the county that the cti toolbar,smartscript,and email response features of the siebel software would not be accessible until mid.oracle also estimated that it would cost to make the siebel software accessible through mode,without those three features.
over the next sixteen months,the county received increasing estimates about the cost of accessibility from opus group,a subcontractor hired to configure and implement the siebel software at.the first estimate to make mode available at was.a second option to give back office employees access to assigned service requests would cost.by april,these estimates rose to and,respectively.all the while,the cti toolbar,smartscript,and email response features remained inaccessible.
since,yasmin reyazuddin has worked in the county department of health and human services,most recently as one of five information and referral aides.in that role,she answered questions from county residents who called about the department services,referrals to county programs,and the status of applications for benefits.reyazuddin,who is blind,performed her job using screen reader software.reyazuddin also used a braille embosser,which allowed her to print in braille.
reyazuddin first learned about the county plans to create in may from her.over the next sixteen months,reyazuddin and the other information and referral aides received updates on general progress.during this time,the county was determining how to staff positions.
in october,joanne calderone,manager for planning,accountability,and customer service in the department of health and human services,met with the five information and referral aides and formally told them that their unit was transferring to.the county planned to transfer reyazuddin and one other aide on november,with the three remaining aides to follow two weeks later.the other four information and referral aides are not blind.
reyazuddin expressed concern about accessibility.she also told calderone that she had scheduled leave from october to november,for a trip to india.calderone emailed this information to leslie hamm,and of,who responded that the county disability program manager,ricky wright,suggested that the date of reyazuddin detail to be delayed indefinitely or at least until she returns from leave.
one aide transferred as scheduled on november.by the time reyazuddin returned from her trip,the other three aides had also transferred to.but reyazuddin was not transferred and instead was told to return to her job site at the main administrative building for the department of health and human services.she continued to perform her duties by answering the department information line until february,when the information line was switched off and calls were transferred to.for one day,reyazuddin had nothing to do.then the county decided that would not handle manna food center referrals,which allow eligible individuals to receive food from a private,food bank.reyazuddin was assigned this task,but it was not work.
in march,reyazuddin was assigned to work in the department aging and disability unit for adult services intake for the next six months,reyazuddin supervisors struggled to find work for her.they thought her work situation was temporary until she could be transferred to.however,on october,wright informed reyazuddin that she would not be transferring to because it would be too expensive for the county to make the software accessible.wright recommend ed the reasonable accommodation of reassignment to a vacant position priority consideration in accordance with the county employees collective bargaining agreement.
from to,reyazuddin had the same salary,grade,and benefits as she did before launch.but although her supervisors pieced together tasks for her to perform,she did not have work.
in,reyazuddin and eight other applicants were interviewed for one of two vacancies at.reyazuddin was not one of the two applicants who the interviewers recommended to fill the vacancies.although not required to do so under county policy,hamm ultimately hired the recommended applicants.
reyazuddin alleges that,in,the county violated section of the rehabilitation act by failing to accommodate her disability by making software accessible and discriminating against her when it did not transfer her to along with her coworkers.reyazuddin also alleges that,in,the county violated title ii of the ada by not hiring her to fill an vacancy 
reyazuddin retained an expert,temeko richardson,to evaluate the cost of making accessible by developing a custom widget as a workaround for the cti toolbar.the custom solution would be compatible with screen reader software.richardson had previously seen this alternative at work in other call centers.her lowest cost estimate was.
the county had an expert,brad ulrich,review richardson report.ulrich noted flaws in the report and estimated that the actual cost to implement the least expensive accessibility option suggested by richardson would be.
to give these cost estimates some context,the county total budget for fiscal year was billion.budget for fiscal year was about million.by late january,the county had spent about million on.but the county estimates that has saved it million in fiscal years and.
following a period of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the county motion and denied reyazuddin.regarding the claim,the court found that a genuine issue existed as to whether reyazuddin proposed accommodation permits her to perform the essential functions of the job.reyazuddin,d at.but the court determined that the county reasonably accommodated reyazuddin by providing her with comparable employment.id.at.the court also concluded that no genuine issue existed on the county undue hardship defense and that the county prevailed on that defense as a matter of law.id.at.
on reyazuddin claim based on the county not transferring her to,the district court determined that the claim rose and fell with the claim because the county had shown as a matter of law that accommodating reyazuddin at was an undue hardship,its decision to not transfer her lacked discriminatory intent.id.at.finally,as to reyazuddin title ii claim,the court concluded that reyazuddin failed to present sufficient evidence that the county decision not to hire her for a vacant position was pretext for discrimination.id.at.
reyazuddin appealed.
we review de novo a district court summary judgment order.d.ex rel.balt.bd.of sch.comm rs,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.the pertinent inquiry is whether there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.anderson liberty lobby.the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party,with all reasonable inferences drawn in that party favor,at.the court therefore can not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.jacobs admin.office of the courts,cir.
section of the rehabilitation act mandates that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.relevant to this appeal,section defines program or activity as all of the operations of a department of a state or of a local government.id.b a.
employment discrimination claims brought under section are evaluated using the same standards as those applied under t itle i of the americans with disabilities act of.id.d.of significance here,title i prohibits employers from discriminat ing against a qualified individual on the basis of disability by not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless a covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.b a.a qualified individual is an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.id.
we consider in turn reyazuddin section and claims.
to establish a prima facie case on her claim,reyazuddin must show that she qualifies as an individual with a disability as defined in the county had notice of her disability she could perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation and the county refused to make any reasonable accommodation.a wilson dollar,cir.
even if reyazuddin establishes her prima facie case,the county avoids liability if it can show as a matter of law that the proposed accommodation will cause undue hardship in the particular circumstances.halpern wake forest.health,cir quoting airways barnett.courts have reconciled and kept distinct the reasonable accommodation and undue hardship requirements by holding that,at the summary judgment stage,the employee need only show that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face,and then the employer must show special typically circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship.barnett,at.
that reyazuddin satisfied the first two elements is undisputed,but the parties disagree on the third and fourth elements and the county undue hardship defense.
on the third element,the parties dispute whether reyazuddin proposed accommodations are reasonable and what constitutes the essential job functions of an employee.title i provides that a reasonable accommodation includes 
a making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities and 
b job restructuring,or modified work schedules,reassignment to a vacant position,acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations,training materials or policies,the provision of qualified readers or interpreters,and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
to overcome a motion for summary judgment,reyazuddin was required to present evidence from which a jury may infer that the proposed accommodation is reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases.halpern,at quoting barnett,at.a reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible.barnett,at.
to determine essential job functions,title i requires that consideration be given to the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential,and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job,this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
we agree with the district court that a genuine issue of material fact exists on this element.reyazuddin has suggested two accommodations that she says will allow her to perform the essential job functions of an employee the county could configure its siebel software to run concurrently in the accessible mode or create a custom workaround widget for the cti toolbar.
reyazuddin supported the reasonableness of these proposals through evidence from her expert,temeko richardson.richardson worked with two call centers in california and pennsylvania that were accessible by operating simultaneously in and modes.she also worked with a third call center in illinois where all employees,including one blind employee,operated in mode.and a fourth call center client in pennsylvania was accessible through a custom solution.
the county counters that its decision to configure the siebel software in the inaccessible mode,with the cti toolbar in particular,maximize s call center employees efficiency and productivity while keeping the cost of delivering government services as low as possible.appellee br.at.the record,however,is silent about the productivity of employees operating in mode,and so the county is left to speculate that employees operating without the bells and whistles of the mode configuration must be less productive.even if we were willing to credit that assumption,it does not necessarily follow that using the software configuration is an essential job function,particularly in light of reyazuddin evidence of other call centers functioning without it.
the county also argues that reyazuddin proposed accommodations would not allow her to perform the essential job function of reading maps and pdf documents,which are used to respond to most frequent call about the estimated arrival time for the next public bus.however,this contention is contrary to the deposition testimony of the county disability program manager,ricky wright,that reyazuddin certainly has the knowledge,skills and abilities to perform the essential functions of the job.moreover,when reyazuddin applied for a vacancy at in,she was interviewed after the office of human resources determined that she met the minimum qualifications.in light of this evidence,we think that a genuine issue remains as to whether reyazuddin could perform the essential job functions with a reasonable accommodation.
turning to the fourth element of the claim,reyazuddin argues that the district court erred by finding as a matter of law that the county provided a reasonable accommodation by reassigning her to comparable employment.reyazuddin,d at.we agree that the district court improperly engaged in fact finding instead of viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to reyazuddin.
an employer may reasonably accommodate an employee without providing the exact accommodation that the employee requested.rather,the employer may provide an alternative reasonable accommodation.see hankins v.the gap,cir t he employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations,and may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide.quoting eeoc interpretive guidance on title i of the americans with disabilities act,pt.app.at.title i provides job restructuring and reassignment to a vacant position as examples of reasonable accommodations.nonetheless,a reasonable accommodation should provide a meaningful equal employment opportunity.meaningful equal employment opportunity means an opportunity to attain the same level of performance as is available to nondisabled employees having similar skills and abilities,pt,at,reprinted in.
here,although reyazuddin maintained her salary,pay grade,and benefits,the county cobbled together an assortment of tasks that did not amount to employment.for example,an email from a county employee shortly before reyazuddin was assigned to work in the aging and disability unit expressed concern that her job responsibilities would be make work as opposed to real,meaningful work.in a later email,joanne calderone,manager for planning,accountability,and customer service in the department of health and human services,suggested a meeting to discuss how to provide reyazuddin with a full day of meaningful work.and a separate series of emails demonstrates a between calderone and over manna referrals,reyazuddin primary responsibility,with the work being transferred from to reyazuddin,back to,and then back to reyazuddin despite a county employee opinion that residents would be served better by having these referrals handled within.plaintiff cross motion for partial summary judgment at exhibit,reyazuddin,cv.
moreover,in her supplemental affidavit,reyazuddin stated that manna referrals her only regular task had decreased and could be done in about one hour per day.she also estimated that it takes a maximum of four to five hours per day to complete all of her work.id.
we hold that the record evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accommodation provided by the county was reasonable.see pandazides.bd.of,cir noting that reasonable accommodation is a question of fact.
as an alternative to finding that reyazuddin did not establish a prima facie case,the district court held that the county prevailed on its undue hardship defense as a matter of law.we can not agree.
an employer is not liable under section if it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business.b a.title i defines undue hardship as an action requiring significant difficulty or expense,when considered in light of the factors set forth in subparagraph b.id.a.subparagraph b,in turn,provides a list of relevant factors 
i the nature and cost of the accommodation needed under this chapter 
ii the overall financial resources of the facility or facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodation the number of persons employed at such facility the effect on expenses and resources,or the impact otherwise of such accommodation upon the operation of the facility 
iii the overall financial resources of the covered entity the overall size of the business of a covered entity with respect to the number of its employees the number,type,and location of its facilities and 
iv the type of operation or operations of the covered entity,including the composition,structure,and functions of the workforce of such entity the geographic separateness,administrative,or fiscal relationship of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.
the district court gave two reasons for its conclusion that the county was entitled to summary judgment on its undue hardship defense.first,the court criticized the estimated cost of proffered by reyazuddin expert as unsupported because it did not take into account increased costs for maintenance and upkeep.reyazuddin,d at.second,the court explained that,as a result of reyazuddin proposed accommodation,the portion of would be altered and would result in increased maintenance and more downtime,which could spill over into the customer service realm.id.we believe that the district court analysis improperly weighed conflicting evidence,did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to reyazuddin,and overemphasized one factor while overlooking the others.
at the summary judgment stage the judge function is not her self to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson,at.by concluding that the lowest estimate of cost was unsupported,the district court credited the county expert,brad ulrich,and discredited reyazuddin expert,temeko richardson.at this point,however,it is undisputed that both ulrich and richardson qualify as experts.the evidence therefore sets up a battle of the experts,which should not be resolved at summary judgment.
in addition,the district court focused almost exclusively on the cost of the accommodations,without regard to the other statutory factors.for instance,the district court analysis does not mention the number of employees at or the considerable savings the county realized from creating a centralized call center million.
the district court also did not acknowledge the county substantial personnel resources at during the configuration and implementation of the siebel software.at the project peak,four opus group consultants were working for the county on one consultant who worked hours per week for the county and spent of his time doing maintenance of the call center application testified that he was not too busy the county paid opus group per week and the county had a senior it specialist on staff who was certified as a siebel consultant.thus,the evidence is in dispute about the additional resources the county would have needed to configure,implement,and maintain the siebel software in mode or adopt another accessibility solution.
aside from cost,the district court credited the county arguments that the proposed accommodations could negatively affect the overall operation of,result in increased system maintenance and downtime,and potentially spill over to impact the overall customer service experience.reyazuddin,d at.this analysis misapplies the summary judgment standard.the evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to reyazuddin as the party,not the county.reyazuddin presented evidence of other call centers operating simult
