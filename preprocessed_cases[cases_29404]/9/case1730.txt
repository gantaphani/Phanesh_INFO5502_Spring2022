opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from a district court order overturning a state administrative law judge decision holding that a school district failed to provide a free appropriate public education within the meaning of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,for a student who had been subjected to severe and prolonged harassment by other students.we hold that the district court improperly failed to give due weight to the alj determination,and we therefore reverse.
was born in and attended public schools in the oceanport new jersey school district from kindergarten through eighth grade.in elementary school,was teased by other children who viewed him as girlish,but when began to attend the maple place middle school in fifth grade,the bullying intensified.in the words of the district court,was the victim of relentless physical and verbal harassment as well as social isolation by his classmates.app.
most of the harassment of focused on his lack of athleticism,his physique,and his perceived effeminacy.bullies constantly called names such as faggot,gay,homo,transvestite,transsexual,slut,queer,loser,big tits,and fat ass.bullies told new students not to socialize with children threw rocks at,and one student hit him with a padlock in gym class.when sat down at a cafeteria table,the other students moved.despite repeated complaints,the school administration failed to remedy the situation.
the constant harassment began to cripple.he became depressed,and his schoolwork suffered.when was in fifth grade,his mother,on the recommendation of the school psychologist,obtained private psychiatric counseling for him.the psychiatrist diagnosed with depression and prescribed medication,but there was no appreciable improvement.after grades slipped badly,maple place evaluated him and classified him as eligible for special education and related services based on perceptual impairment.the oceanport child study team cst then developed an individualized education program iep that placed in the resource room for math and gave him extra teacher attention to help with his organizational skills.the cst manager believed that poor academic work was due to the bullying rather than any cognitive deficiencies.
classification remained throughout sixth and seventh grade,and his iep was expanded to include a daily literature class and an alternative physical education class to help him with his physical skills and to avoid the locker room changing period,during which other children ridiculed his physique.the school also permitted to change classes at special times so that he would not encounter other students in the hallways and could thus avoid the harassment that customarily occurred there.in eighth grade,the harassment became so intense that attempted suicide.at the request of his psychiatrist,who told the cst manager that life and health were at stake,received home schooling for six weeks.in february and march of that year,maple place changed classification,finding him eligible for special education on the basis of emotional disturbance.
the public high school serving community is shore regional high school shore,but parents had begun to look for a different school for their son some years earlier,and they eventually became interested in red bank high school red bank,the public high school in a neighboring school district.red bank was attractive both because it did not enroll students from maple place and because it had a drama program that appealed to interests.auditioned for the red bank drama program and was accepted.parents then asked shore to place him at red bank,and the oceanport cst concurred.the cst believed that if attended shore regional high school he would experience the same harassment that had occurred at maple place because the bullies who were responsible would also be there.
shore undertook its own evaluation,relying mostly on the maple place iep and a surveillance of in his classes.despite the recommendation from the cst,shore rejected request to attend red bank and concluded that he should attend shore for ninth grade.shore apparently believed that if it granted request,it would have to grant the request of students who wished to attend red bank.shore affirmative action officer,barbara chas,contended that shore could contain the bullying by disciplining bullies and by utilizing peer and social worker mediation.shore also proposed an iep in which would attend the resource room for math and would have a supplemental course in learning skills,adaptive gym classes,and weekly counseling.based on this program,the shore authorities concluded that their school would be the least restrictive environment for see a school must provide education in least restrictive environment.
parents strongly disagreed with shore decision and unilaterally placed him in red bank for the ninth grade.initially,red bank did not create an iep for,but did provide him with a special education class in algebra and academic support.while red bank did not schedule weekly counseling sessions,it made clear to that counseling was available upon request.red bank plan was to mainstream for all his classes.when was in ninth grade,red bank created an iep for him that maintained his academic support center class,but mainstreamed him for all other classes.like shore,red bank offered a program to combat bullying that included discipline and diversity seminars.as the district court noted,thrived both academically and socially at red bank.app.
after shore rejected request to attend red bank,father filed a mediation request with the new jersey department of education.mediation proved unsuccessful,and the action was transferred to the new jersey office of administrative law for a due process hearing.before the hearing,both sides agreed to an independent evaluation by the institute for child development at the hackensack university medical center hackensack.hackensack recommended that attend a school such as red bank.
at the due process hearing,the alj heard testimony from several witnesses,including,his mother,chas,mina a member of the oceanport cst,and carol friedman a psychologist at hackensack.all of the witnesses agreed that had been subjected to unusual levels of harassment.while chas testified that she believed that shore could control the bullying,his mother,and friedman all disagreed.the alj also reviewed several documents relating to case,including his ieps and recommendations regarding placement.
the alj concluded that shore could not provide with a free appropriate public education,as required by the idea,see a,because of the legitimate and real fear that the same harassers who had followed through elementary and middle school would continue to bully him.app.the alj was particularly concerned that the bullies from area would harass him during largely unsupervised school bus rides to shore and that shore would be unable to provide for emotional needs within its very large student body.app.the alj ordered shore to reimburse for the tuition and related costs,including reasonable attorneys fees.
shore then commenced this action in the district court,naming father as the defendant,and father filed a counterclaim for attorneys fees.relying on the administrative record,the district court reversed the alj decision.crediting chas testimony,the district court found that shore offered a free appropriate public education.the court wrote 
the inability of the maple place administration to successfully discipline its students does not make shore an inappropriate placement.no school can ever guarantee that a student will not be harassed by other students however,we find that,in light of the structured disciplinary mechanism in place at shore and chas opinion regarding the supportive nature of students involved in drama there,the risk that the harassment would continue was not so great as to render shore inappropriate.

the district court did not accept the testimony of and friedman,stating that they had focused on the failure of the maple place administration to discipline the tormenters they did not address whether the shore administration would have been abl
