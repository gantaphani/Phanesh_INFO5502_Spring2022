plaintiff min jin appeals from a judgment for metropolitan life insurance metlife in the united states district court for the southern district of new york eaton,mag,following a jury trial on jin claim that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor at metlife in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,stat,as amended,et.the district court entered a verdict of no liability on the part of metlife after the jury found,in a special verdict form,that jin had been subjected to unlawful sexual harassment by her supervisor,but that the harassment did not result in a tangible adverse action affecting the terms or conditions of her employment on appeal,jin argues principally that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the definition of tangible employment action for the reasons stated below,we vacate the judgment of the district court in part,affirm in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
procedural history 
jin brought this action against metlife in june,alleging that she was sexually harassed by gregory,her supervisor,from may to june in violation of title vii in march,pursuant to c,the parties agreed that the case would be heard before magistrate judge douglas eaton.in february,almost three years after the end of discovery,metlife moved for summary judgment.in july,the magistrate judge hereafter also referred to as the district court denied metlife motion,holding that a rational jury could find that greg morabito was min jin supervisor,that he subjected her to sexual harassment which was sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and that his harassment culminated in tangible employment action.the district court pointed to evidence that morabito stuffed jin commission checks in a drawer starting in january as a potential tangible employment action.
in november,shortly after retaining new counsel,jin sought leave under fed.civ.to amend her complaint to add claims of discrimination based on sex,race and national origin and retaliation under et,new york executive law et,and the new york city administrative code et and a claim for punitive damages.in december,the district court denied jin motion for leave to amend the complaint.
in march,with a trial date less than two months away,metlife moved to stay the action and to compel arbitration.in april,the district court denied that motion,finding that metlife had waived its right to argue for arbitration.metlife appealed that ruling to this court,and in july we affirmed the district court decision.jin metropolitan life ins,cir unpublished table decision.the trial commenced in september.
b.the evidence at trial 
from the evidence presented at trial,the jury could have found the following facts.starting in,jin was employed by metlife as a life insurance sales agent at the company broadway branch in manhattan.from,jin earned over in total commissions per year.in her first full year,jin earned over and received a leadership award for her productivity.
around may,morabito assumed duties at the broadway branch,and by at least january,morabito was acting as jin manager and supervisor.from may to june,morabito engaged in a pattern of egregious conduct towards jin that included a making numerous crude sexual remarks to her,both in the office and by calling her at home b offensively touching jin buttocks,breasts,and legs on numerous occasions at the office,including when she was making sales calls at her desk and walking clients to the elevator c requiring jin,beginning in the summer of,to attend weekly thursday night private meetings in his locked office during which he would threaten her with a baseball bat,kiss,lick,bite and fondle her,attempt to undress her,physically force her to unzip his pants and fondle him,push against her with his penis exposed,and ejaculate on her and d repeatedly threatening to fire jin if she did not accede to his sexual demands,as well as threatening her with physical harm.in february,after months of submitting to the weekly sexual abuse out of fear of losing her job,jin refused to attend another thursday evening meeting with morabito.jin began working in the evenings and on weekends to avoid morabito,but he continued to fondle and harass jin when he saw her.jin subsequently requested disability benefits due to the effects of the severe harassment.that request was never granted,and jin was eventually fired by metlife in october.
at trial,jin testified that morabito also punished her for reporting the harassment to other managers in the office by denying her automatic or direct paycheck deposit privileges around june,and that,in february,morabito caused her paychecks to be withheld after she refused to attend any more thursday evening meetings.however,metlife presented evidence that morabito denied the direct deposit of jin wages in february due to her low sales production and that her paychecks were withheld because she stopped coming to work without being approved for disability leave.
c.the jury instructions and verdict 
before trial,the district court received proposed jury instructions from both parties.one of the key issues in the charge was the definition of tangible employment action,which,if found,would subject metlife to automatic liability for morabito sexually harassing conduct.jin proposed,among other things,that the withholding of her compensation should be considered a tangible employment action and,in a later written submission to the court,objected to metlife assertion that a delay in receiving payment did not constitute such action.during trial,in a conference with the magistrate judge,jin also objected to the court omission of the withheld checks from its proposed list of tangible employment actions,stating,she never did get the money s he was entitled to the paycheck at that time,your honor.metlife might have been entitled to get some money back,but she is entitled to be paid.jin renewed this objection again when the issue resurfaced after the jury asked the court to clarify the instructions during deliberations.
in her written submission,jin also objected to another of metlife proposed instructions 
because it fail ed to include as tangible employment action the driving of plaintiff from the workplace by continuous sexual harassment.morabito repeated harassment of plaintiff included such severe and extreme conduct as intimate physical touching and threats of bodily harm,ultimately forcing plaintiff to drastically rearrange her schedule so as to avoid the office during hours morabito was likely to be there.such circumstances constitute action by the supervisor causing a significant change in plaintiff employment status under burlington industries,ellerth,d.
and at the conference,jin further argued 
but if they are driven out of the office by the conduct,i mean,that is a tangible employment action.if they ca come to work anymore because it is too dangerous,that is a tangible employment action 
your honor,morabito is using his authority.he says,you have to come to these thursday meetings,you have to meet with me in my office.he is using,i am the boss.and if you are going to go into those thursday meetings,you are sexually harassed and everything else.the supervisor is doing that.why should metlife be responsible for that conduct that person ca go to work anymore.
the district court ultimately ruled against jin on the above objections,and instructed the jury as follows 
a tangible adverse action is a significant change in employment status.minor incidents that cause mere inconvenience and do not alter the actual amount of pay,benefits,duties,or prestige,do not qualify as a tangible adverse action.
for example,revoking the direct deposit of jin paychecks would not by itself be enough.holding on to her paychecks while she was out of the office would not by itself be enough.but any of the following could be enough to constitute a tangible adverse action if you find that morabito played a role in causing the decision on any of the following 
one,unjustifiably refusing to process policies sold by her,or two,unjustifiably causing her disability claim to be denied,or three,unjustifiably firing her.
it would have to be a situation where morabito played a role in causing the decision on the unjustifiable tangible adverse action.
the court gave the jury a special verdict on liability form that asked seven questions.the first six were patterned on the supreme court analysis of employer liability in burlington industries,ellerth,d,and faragher city of boca raton,d the issue of whether there was a tangible employment action,the focus of this appeal,was presented in question four.
on september,the jury unanimously answered the questions as follows 
did plaintiff prove that morabito subjected her to unwelcome sexual harassment answer yes.
did plaintiff prove that morabito conduct was so severe or so pervasive that a reasonable person would find that jin work environment was hostile or abusive answer yes 
did plaintiff prove that morabito conduct was so severe or pervasive that she personally found that her work environment was hostile or abusive answer yes.
did plaintiff prove that,after january,morabito committed an act of sexual harassment that resulted in a tangible adverse action impacting on the terms or conditions of her employment answer no.
did metlife prove that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior answer yes.
did metlife prove that jin unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by metlife answer yes.
in answering questions one through three in the affirmative,the jury found that jin had suffered sex discrimination in violation of title vii.however,the jury negative answer to question four made available to metlife an affirmative defense,discussed below,that shields employers from liability in the absence of tangible employment action.because the jury found,by answering questions five and six in the affirmative,that metlife proved that affirmative defense,the district court entered a verdict of no liability for metlife on the sexual harassment claim.jin appeals the judgment on this claim and the district court order denying her request to amend her complaint.
ii.discussion 
jury instructions 
we turn first to jin claim that the district court erred in instructing the jury on what constitutes tangible employment action.as already indicated,if the jury had found that a tangible employment action resulted from morabito harassment,metlife would have been automatically liable for morabito unlawful discrimination regardless of the jury finding that metlife proved its affirmative defense.

legal principles 
section a of title vii forbids an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of such individual sex.in ellerth and faragher,the supreme court considered the extent of an employer liability under title vii for unlawful discrimination caused by the sexually harassing conduct of a supervisory employee.
the court in ellerth first addressed the significance of the terms quid pro quo and hostile work environment,commonly used to describe types of sexual harassment cases brought under title vii.the court found the terms relevant when there is a threshold question whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination in violation of title vii.at.in a quid pro quo case,for example,title vii is violated by explicit discriminatory alterations in the terms or conditions of a plaintiff employment.such explicit alterations are established when a plaintiff proves that an action,such as a firing or demotion,resulted from a refusal to submit to a supervisor sexual demands,id.at,or that an employer demanded sexual favors from an employee in return for a job benefit.id.at.in a hostile work environment case,which involves offensive conduct in general,id.at,the alterations in the terms or conditions of employment are constructive rather than explicit therefore,the conduct must be severe or pervasive to be actionable.id.at.
however,once sex discrimination is assumed or,as in this case,found by the jury,principles of agency law,and not the labels quid pro quo and hostile work environment,are controlling on the question of an employer vicarious liability id.at.we turn to principles of agency law,for the term employer is defined under title vii to include agents.quoting b see also meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,d finding that congress intended courts to look to agency principles for guidance when determining employer liability under title vii.the court in ellerth examined several different agency principles that might subject an employer to vicarious liability for an intentional tort committed by a supervisory employee.on the facts before it,the court focused on one principle in particular when the supervisory employee was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.ellerth,at.quoting restatement second of agency d see also faragher,at.relying on aided in the agency relation principle.
the court found that in order to hold an employer liable under this aided in the agency relation standard,the aid must consist of something more than the employment relation itself.ellerth,at.although the court did not define the exact contours of what the something more would have to be,it did identify one class of cases that clearly satisfies the standard when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate.id.at.a tangible employment action,as defined by the court,constitutes a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at.
the court in ellerth explained why a tangible employment action justifies holding an employer liable for a supervisor intentional tort of sexual harassment 
when a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision,there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation.a tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm.as a general proposition,only a supervisor,or other person acting with the authority of the company can cause this sort of injury.a can break a arm as easily as a supervisor,and anyone who has regular contact with an employee can inflict psychological injuries by his or her offensive conduct.but one absent some elaborate scheme can not dock another pay,nor can one demote another.tangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor 
for these reasons,a tangible employment action taken by the supervisor becomes for title vii purposes the act of the employer.
id.at.citations omitted.
the court then tackled the question of an employer liability under the aided in the agency relation standard when a supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action.balancing numerous concerns,the court held that in this context an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.id.at.when no tangible employment action is taken,a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages.id.that defense is comprised of two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.id.this affirmative defense is not available when the supervisor harassment culminates in a tangible employment action.id.
application 
jin argues that the district court erred in defining tangible employment action for the jury.specifically,jin contends that the jury should have been allowed to consider as tangible employment actions the requirement that she submit to weekly sexual activity with morabito in order to keep her job and the withholding of her paychecks.amicus national women law center also asserts that the district court committed an additional error by using the term tangible adverse action instead of tangible employment action in the jury instructions and verdict form emphasis added.
we agree with jin that the district court defined tangible employment action too narrowly.in its instructions,the district court utilized what appeared to be an exclusive list of three harms to define a tangible employment action one,unjustifiably refusing to process policies sold by jin,or two,unjustifiably causing her disability claim to be denied,or three,unjustifiably firing her.however,the definition given by the supreme court is a tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.ellerth,at.emphasis added.by leading the jury to believe it could consider only the three enumerated harms,and not the two additional alleged actions discussed in subsections a and b below,the district court improperly narrowed the scope of possible tangible employment actions considered by the jury.
we also agree that the district court erroneously instructed the jury that a tangible employment action,in the context of jin claim,must be adverse.the use of the term adverse in that context was contrary to the plain language of both faragher and ellerth.
morabito sexual abuse 
jin argues that the jury should have been allowed to consider as a tangible employment action morabito use of his supervisory authority to require jin to submit to weekly sexual abuse.
as a preliminary matter,metlife argues that jin did not object to the jury instructions on this specific ground in the district court and that the restrictive plain error standard of review,which is even narrower in the civil context,should therefore apply.see,jarvis ford motor,cir when insufficient objection made to jury instructions at civil trial,we may review for fundamental error,which is so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial citations omitted.jin contends that she did properly object to the instructions and that de novo review applies.
as discussed in,supra,jin objected both in writing and at a conference to the failure of the jury instructions to include as tangible employment action the driving of plaintiff from the workplace by morabito regular sexual abuse.essentially,jin position in the district court was that by subjecting her to severe and extreme abuse,morabito caused a significant change in her employment status by forcing her to drastically rearrange her schedule so as to avoid the office during hours morabito was likely to be there.on appeal,however,jin principally argues that morabito significantly changed her employment status by requiring her,under threats of termination,to submit to his weekly abuse.though the two positions raise similar issues,it is debatable whether jin stat ed distinctly the grounds of the objection that she now argues on appeal,as required by fed.civ.
we will assume therefore,out of a possible excess of caution,that plain error review applies.on this view,we must first determine whether there was error at all.based on the following analysis,we find that the district court did err by excluding from its examples of tangible employment actions morabito explicit conditioning of jin continued employment on her submission to his sexual demands.
requiring an employee to engage in unwanted sex acts is one of the most pernicious and oppressive forms of sexual harassment that can occur in the workplace.the supreme court has labeled such conduct appalling and especially egregious.harris forklift systems,d.it is hardly surprising that this type of conduct a classic quid pro quo for which courts have traditionally held employers liable fits squarely within the definition of tangible employment action that the supreme court announced in faragher and ellerth.
here,jin presented evidence that morabito ordered her to submit to demeaning sexual acts,explicitly threatened to fire her if she did not submit,and then allowed her to keep her job after she submitted.essentially,according to jin,he used his authority to impose on her the added job requirement that she submit to weekly sexual abuse in order to retain her employment.
the court analysis of agency principles in ellerth illuminates why the facts at hand meet the tangible employment action threshold.see at.it was morabito empowerment by metlife as an agent who could make economic decisions affecting employees under his control that enabled him to force jin to submit to his weekly sexual abuse.another could not have so compelled jin acquiescence because a mere lacked the authority to either terminate or retain jin based on her response to sexual demands.also,that morabito as a supervisor could require jin to report to his private office where he could make his threats and carry on his abuses further supports the claim that his empowerment was as the company agent.
moreover,as the court stated in faragher,employer liability for discriminatory misuse of supervisory authority is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers.at.employers,for example,have the opportunity and incentive to screen supervisors,train them,and monitor their performance.id.this opportunity is certainly crucial when the conduct to be guarded against is the criminal assault of an employee in the employer own offices.
a equal employment opportunity commission eeoc enforcement guidance eeoc guidance,issued specifically to address ellerth employer liability,provides the following additional analysis 
if a supervisor undertakes or recommends a tangible job action based on a subordinate response to unwelcome sexual demands,the employer is liable and can not raise the affirmative defense.the result is the same whether the employee rejects the demands and is subjected to an adverse tangible employment action or submits to the demands and consequently obtains a tangible job benefit.such harassment previously would have been characterized as quid pro quo.
eeoc enforcement guidance vicarious employer liability for unlawful harassment by supervisors iv b,wl,at june.therefore,under the eeoc guidance,metlife would be automatically liable if morabito granted jin a tangible job benefit,such as the retention of her employment,based on her submission to his sexual demands.see also karibian columbia,cir,cert.denied,d citing showalter allison reed group,the obvious tangible job benefit the plaintiffs received for succumbing to the harassment was the retention of their employment.and as the agency charged with enforcing title vii,the eeoc interpretation of the statute constitute s a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.meritor,at.citations omitted.
this analysis is consistent with the clear rule of this circuit prior to faragher and ellerth that an employer is strictly liable when a supervisor conditions any terms of employment upon the employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances.karibian,at.in karibian,the plaintiff alleged that she submitted to a prolonged,violent,and demeaning sexual relationship with her supervisor in order to avoid losing her job.id.at.the supervisor had allegedly varied the plaintiff employment conditions,such as raises,hours,autonomy and flexibility,based on her responsiveness to his sexual advances and implicitly threatened to fire her if she did not accede.id.at.here,the alleged threats of termination were explicit.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant,ruling in part that the employer was not liable under a quid pro quo theory,because the plaintiff had not suffered any economic detriment.id.at.
reversing and remanding,we held in karibian that to establish a prima facie case of quid pro quo harassment,a plaintiff must present evidence that she was subject to unwelcome sexual conduct,and that her reaction to that conduct was then used as the basis for decisions affecting the compensation,terms,conditions or privileges of her employment.id.at citations omitted.because the quid pro quo harasser,by definition,wields the employer authority to alter the terms and conditions of employment,we stated that an employer is strictly liable for quid pro quo harassment.id.we then held that the district court erred when it required plaintiff to present evidence of actual,rather than threatened,economic loss.writing for the court,judge mclaughlin stated 
true,in the typical quid pro quo case,the employee who refuses to submit to her supervisor advances can expect to suffer some reprisal.accordingly,in such refusal cases,evidence of some penalty will often be available to prove quid pro quo harassment.but that is not to say that such evidence is always essential to the claim.in the nature of things,evidence of economic harm will not be available to support the claim of the employee who submits to the supervisor demands.the supervisor conduct is equally unlawful under title vii whether the employee submits or not.under the district court rationale,only the employee who successfully resisted the threat of sexual blackmail could state a quid pro quo claim.we do not read title vii to punish the victims of sexual harassment who surrender to unwelcome sexual encounters.such a rule would only encourage harassers to increase their persistence.
finally,we believe imposing an actual economic loss requirement in a quid pro quo case where the employee submits to the unwelcome sexual overtures of her supervisor places undue emphasis on the victim response to the sexual harassment.the focus should be on the prohibited conduct,not the victim reaction.
id.at,citations omitted,emphasis in original.accordingly,we held that the relevant inquiry in a quid pro quo case is whether the supervisor has linked tangible job benefits to the acceptance or rejection of sexual advances.id.at.we thus found that the defendant employer would be liable for the alleged conduct,because the supervisor made and threatened to make decisions affecting the terms and conditions of plaintiff employment based upon her submission to his sexual advances.id.at.
metlife argues that karibian is no longer good law because the new employer liability framework announced in faragher and ellerth,which focuses on agency principles and the existence of a tangible employment action,is at odds with karibian reliance on the quid pro quo terminology to impose strict liability on the employer.we disagree.despite the differences in terminology,karibian essential holding that an employer is liable in a submission case is sound even under the supreme court new liability analysis.when a supervisor make s decisions affecting the terms and conditions of plaintiff employment based upon her submission to his sexual advances,id.at,he uses his authority to effect,as the definition states,a significant change in employment status.ellerth,at.
metlife also argues that an employee acquiescence in a supervisor sexual abuse under a threat of a tangible employment action such as termination is not itself a tangible employment action because the threatened action is never carried out.metlife points to ellerth for the proposition that an unfulfilled threat is not a tangible employment action,and also relies on our decision in caridad commuter,cir,cert.denied,d,which held that a constructive discharge where plaintiff,for example,alleges that she was forced to quit due to a hostile work environment is not a tangible employment action.
however,neither ellerth nor caridad involved allegations of coerced submission to sexual abuse.plaintiff ellerth,unlike jin,was able to resist her supervisor advances,and the threat to deny her tangible job benefits in lieu of her submission was never carried out.in fact,she was promoted despite the alleged harassment and later quit.see ellerth,at.and our holding in caridad,where plaintiff quit after complaining of inappropriate physical contact and comments by and supervisors,flows logically from ellerth,where the supreme court held that no tangible employment action was alleged despite ellerth claim of constructive discharge.see caridad,at.
the key difference in this case is the claim that jin was required to submit to sexual acts and that morabito used that submission as a basis for granting her a job benefit her continued employment.this is substantially different from the type of unfulfilled threat alleged in ellerth,where no job benefit was granted or denied based on the plaintiff acceptance or rejection of her supervisor advances.in caridad,we also noted the significant distinction that c,as well as supervisors,can cause the constructive discharge of an employee.at.but,unlike supervisors,are not cloaked with the authority to grant or deny job benefits based on another submission to their demands.
indeed,in ellerth the supreme court recognized that a submission case is inherently different from a typical unfulfilled threat case.in ruling that ellerth had not alleged a tangible employment action,at,the court expressly noted that the case did not involve a submission scenario.id.at.question for review was whether a title vii claim may be stated where plaintiff has neither submitted to the sexual advances of the alleged harasser nor suffered any tangible effects on the compensation,terms,conditions or privileges of employment as a consequence of a refusal to submit to those advances emphasis added.there was also no submission issue before the court in faragher 
metlife further argues that the reaction of the victim to the alleged harassment,whether it be to submit to sexual abuse or to quit employment,does not convert sexually harassing activity into tangible employment action.but our liability analysis focuses on the supervisor conduct,not the victim reaction.as we stated in karibian,employer liability results from the supervisor use of the employee reaction to the supervisor unwelcome sexual conduct as the basis for decisions affecting the compensation,terms,conditions or privileges of her employment.at.here,morabito alleged use of jin submission as the basis for allowing her to continue working at metlife creates the tangible employment action.even if jin had not submitted,the analysis would still focus on morabito conduct.for example,if he subsequently fired her for resisting him,the termination would constitute a tangible employment action.but if she initially resisted and he did not follow through with his threat of termination,then that threat would not qualify as a tangible employment action.
furthermore,although metlife points out that a tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm,ellerth,at.emphasis added,there is no requirement that it must always do so.both faragher and ellerth include examples of tangible employment actions that involve economic benefit,such as hiring and promotion,or possibly no economic effect at all,such as undesirable reassignment and reassignment with significantly different responsibilities.ellerth,at.faragher,at.see also meritor,at.t he language of title vii is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination.durham life insurance evans,cir economic harm is not the sine qua non of a tangible employment action eeoc guidance,wl,at defining tangible employment action to include hiring,promotion,undesirable reassignment,and work assignment.
as we noted in karibian,many sexual harassment cases do involve some sort of economic harm because they are typically brought by plaintiffs who did not submit to the sexual mistreatment and thereby triggered the threatened economic harm,such as termination or demotion.however,when a victim is coerced into submitting to a supervisor sexual mistreatment,the threatened detrimental economic tangible employment action may not take plac
