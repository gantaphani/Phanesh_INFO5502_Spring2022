introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal in a case in which a former inmate in the custody of the new jersey department of corrections njdoc,now the appellant,alexandra chavarriaga,claims that correctional officers violated her constitutional rights when,without proper authorization,they took her from one place of confinement to another where they denied her potable water,clothing,and sanitary napkins and related medications and subjected her to an unlawful body cavity search.the district court on march,granted three defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant remaining claims against the other defendants,as it held that she did not demonstrate that there were issues of material fact requiring the court to deny the summary judgment motion and appellant complaint did not allege facts constituting a cause of action.chavarriaga new jersey,civ,wl,chavarriaga.
we will affirm the district court march,order granting summary judgment under.to defendants former new jersey attorney general jeffery chiesa,new jersey commissioner of corrections gary lanigan,and correctional sergeant janice brown,and,with the significant exceptions that we discuss below,we will affirm the order dismissing the action pursuant to.b as to the remaining defendants,the njdoc,john doe,john doe,john doe,john doe,jane doe,marcus wair,philip sheppard,and various unknown corrections employees.appellant sued chiesa in his official and individual capacity but she sued the other defendants only in their individual capacities the defendants other than the njdoc,chiesa,and lanigan are njdoc correctional officers.we reach our result even though only chiesa,lanigan,and brown were served with process and have been the only defendants participating in this case we also will affirm the court denial of appellant for partial summary judgment against lanigan,brown,and the njdoc and its denial of appellant motion for sanctions against the participating defendants counsel arising from what appellant considers was their obstruction of the discovery process.in addition,we will affirm the court denial of appellant motion for class action certification as moot,but do so without prejudice to appellant renewing the motion on the remand for which we are providing.finally,we will remand the case to the district court for further proceedings that can go forward only if appellant is able to amend her complaint to name real persons as defendants.

iv.background 
factual allegations 
appellant alleged in her final amended complaint,which we usually simply call the complaint,that defendants subjected her to cruel and unusual punishment and denied her equal protection and due process of law in violation of,and,the united states constitution,and parallel new jersey state law in addition,appellant claimed that defendants did not follow mandated procedures in making the body cavity search of her.when we consider these allegations,we view them in a light most favorable to appellant.appellant alleged that in and,while she was in njdoc custody,custodial personnel placed her at different times in the garrett house,a residential community release program,the new jersey state prison njsp,and the edna mahan correctional facility emcf,and that they unlawfully transferred her three times from the garrett house to the other facilities.appellant remained in njdoc custody until march,when she completed her sentence.
appellant alleged in her complaint that she was subjected to constitutional violations on three separate occasions in and,during the times that she was being transferred to the emcf from the garrett house and,while en route,the custodial personnel temporarily housed her in a cell at the njsp.indeed,she alleged that certain of the transfers in themselves denied her due process and equal protection of the law.beyond the transfers,she alleged that the first violation occurred on april,when custodial personnel first removed her from the garrett house for two alleged infractions of njdoc rules and she was held unclothed at the njsp overnight in cell south l gg,a cell that she characterizes as a psychiatric unit.but that allegation is somewhat tangential to her case as she does not focus on the events surrounding her first removal from the garrett house.
rather,the case centers on appellant allegations concerning constitutional violations from which she claims to have suffered after having been transferred from the garrett house during her second confinement at the njsp from may,to june.she asserted in her complaint that on this occasion the correctional personnel transferred her from the garrett house in retaliation for a suit she had brought against detectives in the somerset county prosecutor office arising from her claim that they used excessive force in arresting her.she claimed that defendants john doe and john doe made the second transfer on may,when they drove her from the garrett house to the njsp without lawful authority and that when they arrived at the njsp,sergeant brown,a njdoc supervisor,ordered all of her clothing removed,whereupon her clothing was taken from her.she asserted that brown assigned her to cell south l gg,where she remained unclothed and was allegedly visible from time to time to male staff and prisoners for the next three days.appellant alleged that defendant jane doe entered her cell during that period and made a painful and unjustified manual body cavity search of her rectum and vagina.appellant also alleged that the plumbing in her cell was not working and,as a result,she was not provided with potable water during this period,and that when she asked for drinking water the correctional officers told her to drink from the cell toilet bowl.further,she contends that she was not permitted to shower until the last day she was at njsp,on june.although there was a shower in the south gg unit,appellant alleged that she was forced to walk down a spiral staircase to another unit and then down a hallway,naked and shackled,in plain view of male prisoners and staff,to reach a shower.she also alleged that the officers denied her sanitary napkins and medications for migraine headaches and menstrual cramps.
appellant alleged that during a third transfer from the garrett house,the njdoc housed her again at the njsp in cell south l gg,from december,to december.she alleged that the correctional personnel made this third transfer and determined her cell placement in the njsp because of what she claimed was a meritless disciplinary complaint that had been filed against her in retaliation for her suit against the somerset county detectives.appellant alleged that the custodial personnel again deprived her of potable water during this third confinement in cell south l gg.
appellant alleged that chiesa and lanigan were well aware of some or all of the wrongdoing described in the complaint,but did nothing to punish the wrongdoers and did nothing to prevent recurrences,thereby approving of the outrageous conduct inflicted upon her and making themselves,aiders and abettors of the other individual defendants.for that reason,she claims that chiesa and lanigan violated her federal and state constitutional rights and are liable to her under,and and stat.ann.though appellant alleged that chiesa and lanigan had at least some knowledge of the wrongdoings that she described in her complaint,she did not identify their source of this knowledge.appellant also alleged that the njsp personnel did not repair the faucet and plumbing in cell south l gg because the njsp special investigations division sid wanted to reserve that cell as a torture cell for disfavored inmates like herself.appellant also alleged that certain defendants conspired to issue false disciplinary charges against her and that the njdoc wrongfully withheld sentence credits from her after the dismissal of the disciplinary charges,thereby extending her time in custody.
procedural history 
appellant initiated this action by filing a complaint seeking class action status in the superior court of new jersey against the njdoc,chiesa,lanigan,greg bartkowski,an administrator at the njsp,brown,john doe,john doe,and jane doe.on july,chiesa,lanigan,and brown,the only defendants served with process and thus the only defendants participating in this case,removed the action to the district court.appellant filed her final amended complaint on august,adding marcus wair and philip sheppard,employees in the njdoc sid,and john doe and john doe as defendants.inasmuch as neither wair nor sheppard has been served with process neither has participated in this case.appellant did not include bartkowski as a defendant in this complaint.
on august,chiesa,lanigan,and brown moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b and,alternatively,moved for summary judgment under rule.on september,appellant,in reliance on rule d,filed a motion requesting the opportunity to take the depositions of lanigan individuals who provided certifications in support of the participating defendants motion for summary judgment and an individual who she claimed provided her with therapy during her confinement at the garrett house,but these depositions never were taken and,according to appellant,the district court never passed on the motion.then,on december,appellant filed a seeking an order certifying the matter as a class action,granting her a partial summary judgment,and imposing sanctions against the participating defendants attorneys on the ground that they had obstructed the discovery process.on march,the district court entered an order making the disposition of this case that we set forth at the outset of this opinion.on april,appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the court march,order.
discussion 
a.the district court properly granted summary judgment to chiesa and lanigan.appellant failed to allege adequately a claim against chiesa and lanigan.
appellant appeals from the district court march,order granting summary judgment to chiesa and lanigan on her claims against them pursuant to,and and stat.ann.appellant alleged in her complaint that chiesa and lanigan,by their failure to protect her,made themselves,aiders and abettors of the other individual defendants.therefore,she claims that they violated her federal and state constitutional rights.
the first step in evaluating a section claim is to identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated and to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.nicini morra,cir quoting cnty.of sacramento lewis,n.next,a plaintiff must demonstrate a defendant personal involvement in the alleged wrongs.rode dellarciprete,cir.a plaintiff makes sufficient allegations of a defendant personal involvement by describing the defendant participation in or actual knowledge of and acquiescence in the wrongful conduct.id.although a court can infer that a defendant had contemporaneous knowledge of wrongful conduct from the circumstances surrounding a case,the knowledge must be actual,not constructive.baker monroe,cir rode,at.a plaintiff must portray specific conduct by state officials which violates some constitutional right.gittlemacker prasse,cir 
the district court correctly granted chiesa and lanigan summary judgment on appellant complaint because her allegations did not describe their conduct in sufficient detail to support her conclusory allegations that they had either actual contemporaneous knowledge of or any personal involvement in any violation of her constitutional rights.see rode,at.furthermore,inasmuch as the imposition of liability in an action under and the other civil rights statutes she cites depends on the plaintiff showing that the defendant had personal involvement in the alleged wrongs,appellant can not predicate defendants liability on a respondeat superior theory.see parratt taylor.the district court granted chiesa and lanigan summary judgment because it believed,although appellant contended otherwise,that she was attempting to establish that they were liable based on their subordinates alleged acts,and therefore appellant impermissibly predicated her complaint against them on a respondeat superior theory of liability 
we realize that appellant argues that,rather than relying on a respondeat superior basis for liability,she alleged that chiesa and lanigan were liable as policymakers.courts recognize that liability under may be imposed on an official with final policymaking authority if that official establishes an unconstitutional policy that,when implemented,injures a plaintiff.sample diecks,cir.however,to establish a claim against a policymaker under a plaintiff must allege and prove that the official established or enforced policies and practices directly causing the constitutional violation.id.at thus,when a policymaking official establishes a constitutionally inadequate state procedure for depriving people of a protected interest and someone is thereafter deprived of such an interest,the official has subjected that person to a due process violation.see also berlanti bodman,cir.
appellant arguments regarding policymaking liability are insufficient.appellant principal allegations were that the prison personnel deprived her of potable water at the njsp for several days on two separate occasions,subjected her to an impermissible manual body cavity search during her second confinement at the njsp,denied her clothing on two separate occasions at the njsp,and denied her sanitary napkins and medications during her second confinement at the njsp.but she did not allege in her complaint that the persons directly involved in this treatment or the other treatment of which she complains were implementing policies that chiesa or lanigan had promulgated or were following existing practices that they countenanced likely to result in the violation of inmates constitutional rights.thus,she did not allege that chiesa or lanigan established policies to deny potable water to inmates,to subject inmates to excessively intrusive body cavity searches,or to subject inmates to the other treatment of which she complains.therefore,neither chiesa nor lanigan can be held responsible on a policymaker theory of liability for the alleged violations of appellant constitutional rights with respect to the denial of water,the body cavity search,or other treatment of which she complains.see bd.of cnty.comm rs brown.inasmuch as appellant did not allege facts supporting any of her claims that could justify imposing liability on chiesa or lanigan on the basis of any theory of liability under,we will affirm the order for summary judgment on the aspects of the claims in the complaint against them under that section and parallel new jersey law.
appellant and claims against chiesa and lanigan fail for the same reasons as her claims against them.
appellant advanced conspiracy claims in her complaint pursuant to and against chiesa and lanigan,but,like her claims,they also fail as a matter of law.under,a plaintiff may bring a claim for conspiracy to violate an individual civil rights in violation of,and under a plaintiff may bring a claim based on the allegations made in support of a claim against a responsible official who does not prevent the conspiratorial acts enumerated in.but a defendant can not be liable under or unless the defendant had some awareness of the underlying violation.see clark clabaugh,cir a plaintiff must show that the defendant had actual knowledge of a conspiracy rode,at rejecting plaintiff conspiracy claim because she did not show defendant knowledge of alleged civil rights violation.inasmuch as appellant did not plead a valid claim against either chiesa or lanigan because she did not make an adequate allegation that they had knowledge of any deprivation of her constitutional rights,her and claims against them fail as well we accordingly will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to chiesa and lanigan on the counts of the complaint based on appellant and claims and her claims under parallel state law 
b.the district court properly dismissed appellant due process and equal protection claims against brown,john doe,john doe,and unnamed defendants based on her transfers among facilities.
the district court held that appellant complaint that her transfers among the three facilities violated her federal and state constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the law did not state a claim on which relief could be granted in particular,appellant alleged that brown,a njdoc supervisor,violated her due process and equal protection rights when she conspired with unidentified prison personnel to remove appellant from the garrett house and confine her in njsp cell south l gg.
due process of law protects persons against deprivations of life,liberty,or property and those who seek to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.wilkinson austin.but an inmate does not have the right to be placed in any particular prison,including halfway homes and community release programs.meachum fano,asquith dep t of,cir.a state has broad authority to confine an inmate in any of its institutions.meachum,at.at.thus,courts recognize that a state authority to place inmates anywhere within the prison system is among a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts.id.at.at.consequently,custodial personnel do not infringe an inmate liberty interests by placing her in one custodial facility rather than another.id.
our analysis leads us to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to brown on appellant complaint arising from her movement to,and placement in,various facilities,and,by extension,the dismissal of the complaint making those claims against all the other defendants.although the njdoc does have policies regarding custodial placements,these policies and the due process clause do not give an inmate a liberty interest in being housed in a particular institution or at a particular custody level.see,olim wakinekona,montanye haymes.furthermore,appellant did not plead facts,as distinguished from conclusions,explaining how her transfers among custodial facilities deprived her of equal protection of the law or violated her due process rights.therefore,even assuming arguendo that brown participated in the decisions to transfer appellant among facilities and personally determined her cell assignment at the njsp,appellant did not make legally justified allegations that could establish that brown violated her equal protection or due process rights in doing so.of course,for the reasons we have set forth,appellant due process and equal protection claims fail against all the other defendants as well.
c.the district court erred in part in analyzing appellant eighth amendment allegations.
pursuant to,appellant brought eighth and fourteenth amendment claims against brown and unnamed defendants predicated on their denying her potable water during her second and third confinements in the njsp and clothing during her first and second confinements.she also asserts that she was forced to appear without clothing before male prison personnel and inmates and was denied sanitary napkins and related medications for migraine headaches and menstrual cramps while she was menstruating.our first step in analyzing these claims is to identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated and to determine whether appellant has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.nicini,at.consequently,we begin our discussion of this point by noting that the constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons.rhodes chapman.
notwithstanding a state broad powers to determine where to place inmates,the constitution does not permit their inhumane treatment because the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which the prisoner is confined are subject to scrutiny under the eighth amendment.helling mckinney,thus,prison officials violate an inmate eighth amendment rights when they deprive her of a single identifiable human need such as food,warmth,or exercise.wilson seiter.but an inmate claim that she was subjected to such a deprivation does not rise to the level of an eighth amendment violation unless the prison official deprived the prisoner of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities and the prison official acted with deliberate indifference in doing so,thereby exposing the inmate to a substantial risk of serious damage to her future health.farmer brennan.
an inmate seeking to prove that she has been subjected to an eighth amendment violation therefore must make both an objective and a subjective showing to impose liability on a defendant.objectively,an inmate must show that the deprivation was sufficiently serious so that it reached the level of an eighth amendment violation.wilson,at.at.subjectively,an inmate must show that the defendant acted with deliberate indifference to her health or safety.farmer,at.at.but to demonstrate a defendant deliberate indifference an inmate need not show that the defendant intentionally sought to cause the inmate harm or acted with knowledge that harm to the inmate probably would result from the defendant act or failure to act.id.at.at.though purposeful conduct would show at least deliberate indifference,an inmate satisfies her burden to make that showing if she demonstrates that the defendant acted or failed to act despite having knowledge that her actions or inaction,as the case may be,would subject the inmate to a substantial risk of serious harm.id.at.at.the proof necessary to show that there was a substantial risk of harm is less demanding than the proof needed to show that there was a probable risk of harm.
as we noted above,however,in our discussion of appellant complaint against chiesa and lanigan,she can not predicate liability on her claims on a respondeat superior basis.see rode,at.to set forth a claim for supervisory liability under,an inmate must 
identify the specific supervisory practice or procedure that the supervisor failed to employ,and show that the existing custom and practice without the identified,absent custom or procedure created an unreasonable risk of the ultimate injury,the supervisor was aware that this unreasonable risk existed,the supervisor was indifferent to the risk and the underling violation resulted from the supervisor failure to employ that supervisory practice or procedure.
brown muhlenberg,cir citing sample,at.put another way,the inmate must identify the supervisor specific acts or omissions demonstrating the supervisor deliberate indifference to the inmate risk of injury and must establish a link between the supervisor,the act,and the injury.id.
appellant alleged that brown was responsible for depriving her of potable water and clothing during her confinement in cell south l gg at the njsp from may,through june,and thereby violated her eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.appellant claims that brown ordered the removal of her clothing at the beginning of this confinement at the njsp and did not provide her with clothes or other covering until the end of the stay.appellant also claims in her brief that brown,as a supervisor,knew that she was being denied potable water for the period,and that brown knew that correctional officers told her to drink from the toilet bowl when she requested drinking water.appellant br.at.she also alleged that she was forced to walk to a shower unclothed in the view of male prison personnel and inmates and was denied sanitary napkins and medications for migraine headaches and menstrual cramps when she was menstruating.in addition,appellant alleged that she was denied potable water during her third confinement at the njsp from december,to december,though she does not charge that brown was responsible for this second potable water deprivation.
on this appeal,we determine whether appellant sufficiently pleaded a cognizable eighth amendment constitutional injury so that her complaint could survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,for,unless she did,the district court did not err in granting brown summary judgment.the court reviewed appellant allegations and held that her eighth amendment claims fail to state a cognizable claim of a constitutional deprivation that would entitle her to relief,and the claims are dismissed with prejudice against defendant brown and all named and unidentified defendants in this action.chavarriaga,wl,at.but when we accept the factual allegations in appellant complaint,we conclude that the court partially erred in its analysis of her eighth amendment claims.
objective prong of eighth amendment analysis 
we assess first whether appellant allegations were sufficiently serious so that,if proven,they set forth facts constituting a violation of her eighth amendment rights.we are satisfied that appellant allegation that she was deprived of potable water for three consecutive days during her second confinement at the njsp did set forth such a claim because she alleged facts in sufficient detail that,if proven,would show that she was deprived of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities.farmer,at,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we reach the same conclusion with respect to the denial of potable water during her third confinement in the njsp even though the duration of the deprivation was for a shorter period than during her second confinement.we also conclude that appellant claims that she was forced to walk or otherwise be naked in the presence of male prison personnel and inmates enroute to the shower and denied sanitary napkins and medications for migraine headaches and menstrual cramps set forth facts that,if proven,would constitute eight amendment violations we are not dissuaded from reaching these conclusions by our recognition that,as the district court observed,f ederal courts have consistently held that isolated denials of necessities in prison for a short duration do not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.chavarriaga,wl,at.
we are of the view that appellant allegations that prison personnel intentionally denied her access to potable water for three days on one occasion and two days on another raised her allegations to a level so that rather than charging a tolerable,though uncomfortable,set of conditions,she had been subjected to a prohibited inhumane deprivation.see farmer,at.at.a complete denial of water for three days other than the water in a toilet bowl lends gravity to appellant allegations because a denial of water for that length of time especially when a prisoner is menstruating as appellant asserts that she was on one occasion poses a clear substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate.see id.at.at.we reach the same conclusion with respect to appellant njsp confinement from december,to december.thus,we hold that appellant pleaded facts with respect to the denial of water that,if true,could lead to a conclusion that she was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.see young quinlan,cir.
a denial of clothing in itself,however,though troubling,in the circumstances of this case is not a deprivation that rises to the level of the deprivation of water and consequently we are satisfied that the denial of clothing claim,except to the extent that it related to her being naked in the presence of male prison personnel and inmates,requires little discussion.it is sufficient to point out that the court in williams delo found that there had not been an eighth amendment violation where the prisoner was placed in a strip cell without clothes but was sheltered from the elements,cir.consequently,inasmuch as appellant did not make an objective showing that she suffered an eighth amendment violation merely by reason of the denial of clothing,we largely focus our analysis of her eighth amendment claim against brown to the denial of potable water.
our opinion,with respect to the denial of clothing,however,should not be overread.in this regard we point out that the supreme court in farmer,at.at,indicated that prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food,clothing,shelter,and medical care thus,we are limiting our holding with respect to the denial of clothing to the facts of this case.moreover,we exclude from our holding appellant claim that she was forced to walk down a staircase and a hallway naked in plain view of male prison personnel and inmates to reach a shower or otherwise was exposed while naked to male prison personnel and inmates.in our view this allegation asserts an eighth amendment claim because forcing her to be naked in these circumstances would be a malicious act intended to humiliate her for no legitimate penological reason.see king mccary,cir lee down,cir.
we also hold that appellant alleged facts that constituted a cause of action when she claimed that officers denied her sanitary napkins and medications while she was menstruating.clearly,that was an allegation sufficient to constitute an eighth amendment violation.see adkins cnty.of orange,d.
subjective prong of eighth amendment analysis 
when we address the subjective prong of appellant eighth amendment claim we are concerned with brown as a named and participating defendant and we consider first whether the deprivation of water can be tied to what appellant contends was brown intentional act or deliberate indifference to her health or safety during her may,to june,confinement at the njsp.see farmer,at.at labatad corr.of,cir.a prison official must be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and must also draw the inference.id.quoting farmer,at.at.liability may follow only if a prison official knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.id.quoting farmer,at.at.
we are satisfied that appellant allegations that brown intentionally denied her potable water for three days or was deliberately indifferent to the denial were insufficient to impose liability on brown because appellant did not adequately allege facts attributing the denial to brown.although the complaint pleaded that brown was one of an unspecified number of supervisors of the correctional officers who interacted with appellant,appellant did not make specific allegations concerning brown duties as a supervisor,or her interactions or communications with correctional officers in general,let alone with the officers directly involved with appellant custody.the complaint did allege that brown forced appellant to drink water from a dirty toilet bowl,but this allegation was conclusory because appellant did not plead that brown gave a direction for appellant to drink in this way.
it is clear that appellant based her complaint against brown for the denial of water on the actions of subordinate personnel,and thus appellant was seeking to place liability on brown on a respondeat superior theory or was alleging that brown was liable on some other theory merely because of her position as a supervisor.but brown position as a supervisor without more did not make her responsible for her subordinates conduct.accordingly,we can not infer from the factual allegations in the complaint that brown should have been alerted to a history of mistreatment of inmates in general or of appellant in particular.and,although appellant alleged in her complaint that she was placed in a known condemned cell that frequently was without water,that allegation does not support a claim that brown knew or should have known that appellant was deprived of water,subjecting her to a substantial risk of harm during her confinement at the njsp from may,until june.see wood beauclair,cir prison supervisors lacked knowledge of risk to inmate when supervisor had no reason to suspect mistreatment and inmate did not complain of actions to prison officials until long after the incidents occurred.
we also are satisfied that appellant did not adequately plead that brown was instrumental in requiring her to go to the shower or otherwise be naked while in the presence of male prison personnel and inmates and in not supplying her with sanitary napkins and medications.rather,though she did plead that brown directed that her clothing be taken from her,her allegations with respect to the walk to the shower or otherwise be naked in the presence of male prison personnel and inmates and the denial of sanitary napkins and medications are generalized with respect to the individuals responsible for these actions.
although appellant did not adequately plead that brown should have known that she was deprived of water for three days,we reiterate our rejection of the district court conclusion that the deprivations of potable water in this case could not be cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment.see chavarriaga,wl,at.thus,while we uphold the grant of summary judgment on the denial of potable water as well as on the naked shower walk and other naked exposures and the denial of sanitary napkin and medications claims in brown favor,we will reverse the district court dismissal of the eighth amendment claims against the unknown defendants that appellant alleged were responsible for these deprivations and will remand the case for further proceedings on these claims.
d.the district court partly erred in analyzing appellant eighth amendment allegations and related state law claims relating to her body cavity search.
appellant next claim of unconstitutional punishment challenges the legality of a cavity search in which a prison guard inserted her fingers into appellant vagina and rectum.in advancing this claim,appellant did not assert that she was deprived of any of life necessities but rather that she was subjected to a painful and unwarranted use of force.in the excessive force context,society expectations are different than in the context of prison conditions,and accordingly the test for an eighth amendment violation is different as well.hudson mcmillian.when prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm,contemporary standards of decency always are violated.this is true whether or not significant injury is evident.id.citation omitted.
the district court held that the cavity search was justifiable as a routine security measure,noting that the supreme court has held that it is constitutional to conduct a full strip search of an individual detained in the general population of a jail.chavarriaga,wl,at.but in that supreme court case,florence board of chosen freeholders,the court was concerned with whether a uniform policy of strip searching detainees held in a general jail population violated the detainees rights under the fourth amendment not the eighth amendment on which appellant relies.more importantly,the strip searches in florence involved only the visual inspection of detainees body cavities,and there we re no allegations that the detainees were touched in any way as part of the searches.id.at.indeed,in response to an amici concerns about instances of officers engaging in intentional humiliation and other abusive practices,the court recognized that there may be legitimate concerns about the invasiveness of searches that involve the touching of detainees.id.at.thus,florence does not govern here.
florence does stand for the proposition that a regulation impinging on an inmate constitutional rights must be upheld if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.at quoting turner safley,but appellant does not challenge a prison regulation in fact,she alleged that jane doe searched her body cavities in violation of the applicable regulations.the factors our court considers in applying the legitimate penological interest test further demonstrate that the test is for assessing unauthorized and malicious conduct on the part of prison guards.see sharp johnson,cir.
the district court also determined that it should defer to the judgment of corrections officials on the question of whether the cavity search was permissible,and it concluded that the search was permissible as a routine security measure.chavarriaga,wl,at.appellant plainly alleged facts that demonstrate that the cavity search was not routine for,as we already have explained,she asserted that the prison personnel made such a search on only one of the three occasions she was held at the njsp.in addition,she alleged that the search was conducted in a manner that violated applicable new jersey regulations.in this regard,the regulations provide that before such a search is made,a supervisor must have reasonable suspicion to believe that contraband will be found in the inmate body cavity.then,if there is to be a search,the prison personnel must take the inmate to the infirmary and offer the inmate the assistance of a medical provider in removing the contraband.the regulations further provide that prison personnel can not remove contraband involuntarily unless they follow a detailed set of procedures and that the supervisor authorizing the search must prepare a written report of the basis for,conduct of,and results of the search.see admin.code.according to the complaint the prison personnel disregarded these procedures in their entirety.
but the constitutional question that we face is not whether new jersey policies on cavity searches are reasonable or even whether the prison personnel followed them.rather,the constitutional question is whether appellant plausibly has alleged that jane doe maliciously searched her body cavities.see hudson,at.at.to that end,the allegation that the prison personnel did not follow the regulations gives some support to an inference that the search was malicious.we find additional support for drawing that inference because appellant alleged that the cavity search was so painful that during the search she cracked a molar in two while clenching her teeth.nevertheless,neither the district court nor the participating defendants have addressed the question of whether the cavity search violated the eighth amendment.after our consideration of the body cavity search issue,we will reverse the district court order dismissing appellant eighth amendment claims against jane doe and will remand the case for further proceedings on these claims.
notwithstanding our foregoing discussion,we hold that the district court correctly granted brown summary judgment on appellant eighth amendment body cavity search claim.in her brief,appellant attempts to implicate brown in her manual body cavity search by claiming that jane doe simultaneous digital penetration of plaintiff vagina and rectum was committed in the presence of her direct supervisor,brown.appellant br.at.yet this statement,though quite specific,was in appellant brief and not her complaint,and is of questionable significance as she goes on in her brief to indicate that brown evidently authorized and supervised the search,a comment that suggests that she only is surmising that brown was involved in the search.id.at emphasis added.in any event,appellant by making these allegations in her brief can not overcome the lack of an adequate pleading in her complaint alleging with specificity that brown was involved in the search.in fact,although appellant did allege in her complaint that brown supervised various doc personnel,she did not allege that brown supervised jane doe.although a court on a motion to dismiss ordinarily must accept the allegations in the complaint as true,it is not compelled to accept assertions in a brief without support in the pleadings.morrow,at.after all,a brief is not a pleading.we therefore will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the body cavity claim in favor of brown.
equal protection claims with respect to denial of potable water,the body cavity search,and contentions of other constitutional violations.
appellant asserts that she was denied potable water,subjected to the body cavity search,and forced to endure the other violations to which we have referred for discriminatory reasons that violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.but she does not assert that defendants discriminated against her because of her race or any other protected classification rather,she claims that defendants treated her inhumanely because they were retaliating against her because of the lawsuit she filed against somerset county detectives who she claims used excessive force in arresting her.
appellant assertions are most easily understood as being a first amendment retaliation claim.retaliating against a prisoner for the exercise of her constitutional rights is unconstitutional.bistrian levi,cir.if defendants punished appellant for exercising her right to petition the courts,they are liable for violating the first amendment.see id.but even though appellant raised the first amendment in her brief,she did not plead a first amendment claim in her complaint.therefore,there is not a first amendment claim properly before us.see mcclintock eichelberger,cir krouse am.sterilizer,cir.
instead of pleading her claim under the first amendment,as we have indicated appellant asserted in her complaint that defendants acts of retaliation violated the equal protection clause.but inasmuch as appellant did not allege that her membership in a protected group was the motivation for unfavorable treatment,the only claim available to her is that she was arbitrarily singled out for this treatment as a class of one.in order to state a claim for a class of one denial of equal protection,a plaintiff must at a minimum allege that s he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated by the defendant and that there was no rational basis for such treatment.phillips cnty.of allegheny,cir see also renchenski williams,cir analyzing such a claim in the prison context.
the district court dismissed appellant equal protection claim solely on the ground that her disciplinary infractions prompted her transfers to the njsp and therefore there was a rational basis for the transfers.appellant disputes this conclusion,noting that the second transfer was not authorized and the prison has admitted that it was made in error.moreover,appellant claims that a false accusation engineered by corrections personnel led to the third transfer.
we are satisfied that the district court mischaracterized appellant equal protection claim.though,as we held above,appellant transfers did not violate the equal protection clause,and even if there was a rational basis for transferring appellant to the njsp,she contends there was no rational basis for her treatment once she arrived there.indeed,appellant hit the perverse jackpot of being assigned to the same cell without potable water on all three occasions that she was confined in the njsp.appellant alleges that the adverse treatment to which she was subjected did not comply with official prison policies,including those relating to body cavity searches,and she contends that they rose to the level of a constitutional violation.we find support for this allegation for,as noted above,the cavity search was plainly not a routine security measure because the prison personnel made such a search only during appellant second confinement in the njsp and,so far as we are aware,not because appellant committed a disciplinary infraction or in some way led the prison personnel to believe that she was concealing contraband in her body.when considered in light of the fact that appellant had filed the suit against the detectives that we described above,her treatment may support a retaliation claim and,if so,the search was not made for a legitimate penological reason.accordingly,we believe that it reasonably could be inferred that prison personnel targeted her intentionally without a legitimate penological basis the district court erred in concluding otherwise and thus,on remand,appellant should be able to proceed on her body cavity search,denial of potable water,being forced to walk to the shower or otherwise exposed while naked in the presence of male prison personnel and inmates,and denial of sanitary napkins and medications claims on an equal protection as well as an eighth amendment basis.
appellant state law claims 
as described above,appellant asserts in her brief,though not in her complaint,that her body cavity search violated the criteria in admin.code,a regulation governing inmates body cavity searches and requiring that correctional personnel conduct body cavity searches at a facility infirmary.but in her complaint appellant made this allegation without citation to the specific regulation that she claims was violated.we nevertheless conclude that the pleading is adequate to survive a motion to dismiss,and therefore we will reverse the district court rule b dismissal of this claim as to jane doe.we,however,will not preclude a defendant substituted for jane doe from arguing that a violation of admin.code b can not give rise to civil liability as a definitive resolution on this issue should not be made in the absence of the actual defendant charged with the violation.
we have not overlooked appellant attempt in her brief to implicate brown in a admin.code violation on the basis of a different provision than subsection b.on appeal,appellant asserts in her brief that brown,as a supervisor,violated admin.code g,which provides 
t he custody staff member in charge shall prepare a written report of the results of a body cavity search that shall be made part of the inmate record and shall include,but is not limited to,the following information.a statement of facts indicating reasonable suspicion for the search.the name of the custody staff member in charge who authorized the search.
but the complaint did not make an adequate allegation against brown under admin.code g even if a violation of that provision could be actionable,as it did not allege that brown was jane doe supervisor or provide any other allegations sufficient to link brown to appellant manual body cavity search.after all,even if at some times brown supervised jane doe,brown surely was not on duty around the clock,so we can not draw an inference from the complaint that brown gave an instruction to jane doe to make the search.thus,the complaint did not adequately plead that brown was the individual who should have made a timely record of the grounds for reasonable suspicion that the search would lead to the discovery of contraband.
considering all the circumstances of the case,we are satisfied that there is no basis to hold brown liable for any violation of regulations governing searches.appellant did not make sufficient allegations in her complaint that brown was or should have been involved in the over
