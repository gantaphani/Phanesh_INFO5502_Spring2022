town of hartford,vermont the town,and town officials hunter rieseberg,todd steadman,leonard berliner,gayle ottman,ray cerasoli,richard ballou,and joseph estey,appeal from the december,judgment of the district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,granting declaratory and injunctive relief to white river amusement pub,the corporation.in a ruling on for summary judgment,the district court also disposed of the corporation remaining claims,including all claims for damages.see white river amusement pub,town of hartford,d.plaintiff has not.for the reasons set forth below,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
in september,the corporation opened the white river amusement pub the wrap,an adult entertainment business,in downtown white river junction within the town of hartford.the wrap offered nude and female dancing,as well as food and beverages.at the time the wrap commenced operations,the town had no ordinance prohibiting public nudity or nude dancing.
in the spring of,at the request of the town selectboard,the town attorney,robert manby,drafted a proposed public indecency ordinance the ordinance.manby also noted,in a letter to the selectboard,that in sbc enterprises,city of south burlington,a district court had upheld a similar ordinance enacted by the city of south burlington,based on the fact that the south burlington city council had passed a resolution indicating that it had considered the secondary effects of nude dancing when enacting the ordinance.manby therefore advised the selectboard to adopt a similar resolution when enacting the ordinance.
the selectboard considered the ordinance during two meetings in april and may.on april,the selectboard conducted a first reading of the proposed ordinance.the town manager,hunter rieseberg,gave an overview of the ordinance,summarizing its provisions.the selectboard then voted unanimously to approve the ordinance and forward it to a public hearing.the ordinance was next considered on may.rieseberg and todd steadman,chairman of the selectboard,introduced the ordinance.steadman highlighted the definitions of certain terms in the ordinance and noted that this type of ordinance had been tested in the courts.members of the public asked a few questions,and after ten minutes,the public hearing was adjourned.without any further discussion of the merits of the ordinance,the board voted in favor of its adoption.
the ordinance prohibits an individual from doing the following in a public place engaging in sexual intercourse appearing in a state of nudity fondling his or her genitals fondling the genitals of another person fondling his or her breasts or fondling the breasts of another person.nudity is defined as the showing of the human male or female genitals,pubic area or buttocks with less than a full opaque covering,or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion of the nipple or the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.a woman breastfeeding her child is specifically excepted from this definition of nudity.a public place is defined as any location frequented by the public,including business and commercial establishments,night clubs,and cabarets.
in enacting the ordinance,the selectboard did not follow manby recommendation to adopt a resolution discussing secondary effects.in addition,the selectboard did not conduct any independent analysis of the actual or potential secondary effects of public nudity in the local area.town representatives or members of the selectboard did,however,review at most three sample public indecency ordinances from other vermont municipalities.while the ordinance was under consideration,one or two members of the selectboard also discussed with their constituents the potential negative secondary effects associated with adult businesses.steadman has since explained that although he was not aware of any adverse secondary effects actually caused by the wrap,he put the ordinance on the agenda because of his desire to protect economic development opportunities within the town,and because he was concerned about the potential for the creation of negative secondary effects in areas where public nudity was occurring.
after the selectboard enacted the ordinance,the town department of planning and development services obtained studies analyzing the negative secondary effects of adult businesses.these materials were discussed during a special town meeting on september,at which certain town officials also articulated their rationale for enacting the ordinance,to combat the negative secondary effects of public nudity.the following day,the town electorate voted against the following ballot question whether the voters of the town of hartford disapprove the public indecency ordinance adopted by the selectboard on may.the ordinance therefore remained in effect.
on november,the corporation brought this action,alleging that the ordinance violated its federal and state constitutional rights.the parties for summary judgment,but while these motions were pending,on february,a fire severely damaged the building in which the wrap was housed.shortly thereafter,defendants filed an additional motion for summary judgment,arguing that the corporation claims had been mooted by the destruction of the wrap premises.in response to this motion,the corporation president,daniel garr,submitted an affidavit explaining the corporation plan and intent to continue providing adult entertainment in the town.garr explained that the corporation had a lease on the wrap premises that ran through july,with an additional five year option and a first option to purchase the premises.he noted that the corporation did not intend to terminate its lease,and that it was also assessing other locations in hartford with a view to reopening temporarily at an alternate site.
in a december,opinion,the district court concluded that the corporation claims were not moot.the court found that there was a reasonable expectation that upon the wrap,the town would enforce the ordinance,subjecting the corporation to the same substantial harm.white river,d at.with respect to the first amendment freedom of expression claims,the court applied the standard for expressive conduct,see united states,d,and found that the ordinance satisfied the first,third,and fourth factors.white river,d at.however,the district court concluded that the ordinance did not satisfy the second factor,because the town failed to demonstrate that,at the time it enacted the ordinance,it relied upon at least some evidence reasonably believed to be relevant to its interest in preventing negative secondary effects associated with nude adult entertainment,and that the evidence fairly supported its rationale for the ordinance.id.at.the court therefore concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional under both the federal and vermont constitutions.id.at,the court then rejected the corporation remaining claims.id.at.in addition,the court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants with respect to plaintiff damages claims,finding that the legislative defendants,the members of the selectboard were entitled to legislative immunity and that the remaining individual defendants,who had not been personally involved in the enactment of the ordinance,had not engaged in any constitutional deprivation of the corporation rights.id.at.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court ruling on for summary judgment,in each case construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.scholastic,harris,cir.
on appeal,defendants make two arguments.first,they contend that the destruction of the wrap premises moots plaintiff claims.second,defendants claim that the ordinance does not violate either the first amendment or article of the vermont constitution because the town acted out of concern for the negative secondary effects of public nudity.
mootness is a question of law that we review de novo.catanzano wing,cir.mootness imposes a requirement that subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings t hroughout the litigation,the plaintiff must have suffered,or be threatened with,an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.spencer kemna,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.city of erie pap,d internal quotation marks omitted.if there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated,then it becomes impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.
in this case,there is a reasonable expectation that the threatened injury will occur in the future.although the wrap premises were destroyed by a fire,the corporation has expressed a clear intent to reopen the wrap and to continue to provide the same dance entertainment,namely,exotic,expressive entertainment,performed by females,sometimes clothed,sometimes topless and sometimes completely nude.the corporation has a renewable lease on the premises,which it does not intend to terminate.as soon as the wrap reopens,the town will likely enforce the ordinance,and the wrap will therefore once again face substantial harm.see begins philbrook,cir t he regulation still stands and defendant clearly intends to enforce it against plaintiffs should the occasion demand.see also pap,at.plaintiff is still incorporated under pennsylvania law,and it could again decide to operate a nude dancing establishment in erie.or.barter fair jackson county,cir concluding that although plaintiff had not held a major event in seven years,case would be moot only if plaintiff had entirely ceased to operate,left the business,and no longer sought or intended to seek a permit.because the very act of reopening the wrap will subject the corporation to immediate legal jeopardy,the prospect of future harm is not merely a speculative contingency.bd.of license comm rs of tiverton pastore,d per curiam prospect of legal challenge being immediately revived by the reopening of the plaintiff business was a speculative contingenc y,where the underlying legal challenge involved the application of the fourth amendment exclusionary rule in civil liquor license revocation hearings.
defendants contend that the corporation may not avoid mootness by relying on a affidavit.defendants rely on deeper life christian fellowship,sobol,cir and fox board of trustees of state university of new york,cir,two cases in which plaintiffs sought to invoke the exception to mootness for harms that are capable of repetition yet evading review,harms that are too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration.see deeper life,at fox,at.in deeper life,a church brought suit challenging a school board refusal to renew a permit allowing the church to make use of a school auditorium for weekly meetings.at.after the church completed the renovations that had triggered its original need for access to the auditorium,the church submitted an affidavit explaining that it was in negotiations for the acquisition of property to be merged with deeper life headquarters and would once again require the congregation to vacate the building.at.we rejected the church attempt to preserve its claim,because we found that the affidavit did not provide compelling evidence that the need asserted was in fact imminent.id.at.in fox,students who sued the state university of new york suny graduated or left the school during the course of the litigation.at.the students then submitted affidavits indicating a very real possibility and a reasonable expectation that they would return for graduate studies within the next few years.id.at.we rejected these assertions,finding that a bare statement of intention is insufficient to escape mootness,and noting that the students expressed intention to return to the suny system is not solely within their power to accomplish as they would also have to be accepted by a school in the suny system.id.
in this case,however,the corporation does not seek to invoke the exception for harms that are capable of repetition yet evading review.furthermore,unlike deeper life and the circumstances giving rise to the claim have come to an end and the party seeks to defeat mootness through an affidavit that asserts similar conditions will recur in the relationships underlying the claim in this case have not ceased.as explained in the garr affidavit,the corporation renewable lease on the premises for its adult entertainment business is still in effect and plaintiff does not intend to terminate it.the corporation,therefore,does not assert that new,albeit similar,circumstances will occur in the future and for that reason the claim is not moot,but rather contends that the circumstances supporting the original claim continue to be in effect.in the absence of any proof offered by defendants contradicting the evidence of plaintiff possession of a renewable lease,the corporation clear intention to continue operating the wrap at the site of the lease is sufficient to demonstrate that the corporation faces a reasonable expectation of future harm.accordingly,the case is not moot.
ii.freedom of 
although nudity is not an inherently expressive condition,nude dancing of the type at issue here is expressive conduct that falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.pap,at.thus,attempts to regulate such dancing are subject to constitutional scrutiny.the parties agree that because the ordinance is a regulation,one that is not enacted for the purpose of suppressing expression,it is subject to the test for expressive conduct set forth in united states,d see also pap,at.applying when analyzing a public indecency ordinance.under,an ordinance is valid if it is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important or substantial government interest the government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the restriction is not greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest.at.the district court and the parties agree that the first and fourth factors have been satisfied in this case.the current dispute focuses on the second factor plaintiff also argues that the ordinance fails to satisfy the third factor.
a.the second factor 
we determine whether the ordinance furthers an important or substantial government interest by applying the standard the supreme court articulated in city of renton playtime theatres,d 
the first amendment does not require a city,before enacting such an ordinance,to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.
id.at.see also id.at.holding that the city was entitled to rely on the detailed findings of other cities as summarized in prior judicial opinions.
the court has applied the renton analysis in a series of divided opinions.first,in barnes glen theatre,d,a divided court upheld the state of indiana public indecency statute.applying the test,the plurality found that although the legislature intent in enacting the statute was impossible to discern,the text of the statute and the long history of public indecency statutes expressing moral disapproval of public nudity was sufficient to demonstrate that the statute furthered a substantial government interest in protecting order and morality.id.at.justice souter concurred in the judgment,but rejected the plurality reliance on moral disapproval to justify the ordinance.id.at.instead,he applied the renton standard and concluded that based on prior judicial decisions discussing secondary effects,indiana could reasonably conclude that forbidding nude entertainment would further its substantial government interest.id.at.
in pap,five justices adopted the renton standard as the relevant test.the plurality found that the city had offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate that its public indecency ordinance furthered a substantial government interest,because the city expressly relied on barnes and its discussion of secondary effec
