pursuant to d,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on may and,jeffrey davis and heather ross,forensic psychologists,provided forensic reports and testified on behalf of the government that heyer met the criteria for civil commitment.diane lytton,a forensic psychologist,provided a forensic report and testified on behalf of heyer that he did not meet the criteria for commitment.in addition,jean andrews,an expert in deafness and psychosocial issues related to deafness,also provided a report and testified on behalf of heyer.
at the hearing,heyer initially moved the court to provide him with consecutive,rather than simultaneous,interpreting.the district court denied heyer request,stating,well,it a civil case.the answer is no.we are not going to make this into a marathon.
based on the evidence presented,the district court adopted the following undisputed findings of fact.heyer is deaf and communicates through american sign language asl.throughout his youth,heyer was assaulted and molested numerous times.in,at age,heyer was convicted of terroristic threats after getting into an argument with a man who accused him of molesting his son.around the same time,heyer was also convicted of burglary and armed robbery.
in,heyer molested a boy,then tied the boy up and placed him in a hole.he was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to ten years in prison.in the several years following heyer release from prison,he was convicted of a series of misdemeanors,including offenses for public intoxication,driving under the influence,reckless endangerment,vandalism,and passing a bad check.
around,heyer was found to have approximately images of child pornography in his possession.he subsequently pled guilty to possession of child pornography.upon his release from prison for the child pornography conviction,he began sex offender treatment while on supervised release.his supervised release,however,was revoked in when he showed up at a treatment session under the influence of alcohol.
heyer also admitted to the following additional facts during a deposition which was admitted into the record.heyer admitted that while he was on probation,he looked at a lot of different websites that were,and masturbated to those images.the pictures heyer viewed included adults and children together in sexual situations he also admitted that he showed some of these pictures to redacted,a young teenage boy whom he had befriended.heyer further admitted to having engaged in sexual activity,including mutual masturbation and oral sex with redacted while redacted was a young teenager,and that such sexual activity occurred over a period of approximately years.although heyer knew that having sex with redacted was wrong,he continued the activity because i liked it and he was willing.he also told redacted that he liked having sex with other children.
in addition,heyer admitted to having had sexual contact with between eighteen and boys after he turned eighteen years old.among other child victims heyer molested was his nephew,whom he molested when the nephew was approximately six years old 
heyer also admitted to using both marijuana and cocaine while he was on probation during and that he went to sex offender treatment drunk during this time.according to heyer,he did not consider himself to be drunk previously when he was arrested for driving under the influence despite blowing a on the blood alcohol test because he was able to walk straight.
according to lytton,heyer own expert examiner,heyer admitted to the following additional facts during his interview with her.he described his adolescent years as plagued by fighting and being the victim of sexual aggression.in addition,heyer admitted that his typical pattern as a young adult was to spend his entire paycheck on an alcohol binge,and live meagerly until the next payday.
heyer further admitted that he often exposed himself to strangers in efforts to gauge their sexual interest in him,and that he would attempt to view other people private parts when in bathrooms or showers.he also admitted to some arousal to boys,around age eight,and to fondling a number of young boys,incidents for which he was not investigated or charged.lastly,during the commission of the crime in where he kidnapped and molested a boy,then tied him up and left him in a hole,heyer admitted that he buried the boy to avoid detection and then was deceptive with police,and did not provide information that would have led to the discovery of the boy.
both of the experts that testified for the government,ross and davis,opined that heyer suffered from pedophilia,as well as other mental antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse would have serious difficulty refraining from future acts of child molestation if released.lytton,who testified on these issues for heyer,opined that she did not believe he currently suffers from either pedophilia or antisocial personality disorder.she acknowledged,however,that heyer criminal history includes past behaviors that suggest he may have met such criteria for pedophilia at that time.lytton further opined that i t would be difficult to argue that heyer did not meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder in the past.
on july,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,concluding that the government had proven by clear and convincing evidence that heyer was a sexually dangerous person within the meaning of the act.specifically,the district court found that heyer currently suffers from the serious mental illness of pedophilia,and that ross and davis had provided a more convincing analysis than lytton.the court concluded that the government had met its burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that heyer suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder as a result of which he would have serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.the district court accordingly committed heyer to the custody of the attorney general pursuant to.
heyer timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,heyer contends that the district court abused its discretion in allowing only simultaneous interpretation,rather than consecutive interpretation,during the evidentiary hearing clearly erred in finding him to be a sexually dangerous person under and erred in rejecting his equal protection and due process claims.we address each argument in turn.
heyer first contends that the district court abused its discretion in allowing only simultaneous interpretation,rather than consecutive interpretation,during the evidentiary hearing.heyer asserts his claim under the authority of the court interpreters act cia.we review the district court final determination on the appointment and use of interpreters for an abuse of discretion,as the district court is in the best position to evaluate the need for and the performance of interpreters.united states sandoval,cir accord united states camejo,cir united states urena,cir.to the extent that heyer claims a hearing on this issue was required,such a claim is reviewed for plain error since he did not request such a hearing in the district court.united states olano,united states hastings,cir.
initially,we note that the cia requires only simultaneous interpretation for,unless the court rules otherwise 
the interpretation provided by certified or otherwise qualified interpreters pursuant to this section shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party to a judicial proceeding instituted by the united states and in the consecutive mode for witnesses,except that the presiding judicial officer,sua sponte or on the motion of a party,may authorize a simultaneous,or consecutive interpretation when such officer determines after a hearing on the record that such interpretation will aid in the efficient administration of justice.
k emphasis added.the statute explicitly provides that interpretation shall be in the simultaneous mode for,unless the district court rules otherwise id.the effective presumption of simultaneous interpretation will change only if the district court determines that it will aid in the efficient administration of justice.id.
in this case,the sum and substance of the district court ruling was that consecutive interpretation would not aid in the efficient administration of justice,because consecutive interpretation of the entire proceeding would have unduly delayed and enlarged the evidentiary hearing.when the district court inquired as to why heyer wanted consecutive interpretation,heyer attorney responded,b ecause the potential problem is that we could be way down the road before we realize that heyer does understand something.that single response was the complete rationale proffered for departure from the statutory presumption of simultaneous interpretation with no tender by heyer,then or now,of what a potential problem might be.moreover,at no point during the hearing did heyer or his attorney indicate to the district court that heyer did not understand the proceedings.thus,there was never any indication that the speculative potential problem,had become an actual problem.
moreover,the district court made a number of substantial accommodations to help heyer understand the proceedings the court provided both qualified and certified legal interpreters,as well as certified deaf interpreters,so that a total of four interpreters were present at all times during the hearing.an interpreter was also permitted to sit with heyer at counsel table throughout the proceeding.the district court also allowed heyer,on several occasions,to stop the proceedings if he did not understand what was going on.
further,contrary to heyer assertion,the district court was not required to hold a hearing on whether or not to grant the request for consecutive interpretation.the cia provides that the presiding judicial officer,sua sponte or on the motion of a party,may authorize consecutive interpretation when such officer determines after a hearing on the record that such interpretation will aid in the efficient administration of justice.k emphasis added.heyer made no request for a hearing in the district court,and did not object to the district court denial of the request for consecutive interpretation.accordingly,the district court decision to not hold a hearing sua sponte is reviewed only for plain error.olano,at hastings,at.to succeed,heyer must demonstrate that an error occurred,that the error was plain,and that the error affected his substantial rights.see olano,at hastings,at.even if heyer can satisfy these requirements,correction of the error remains in the court sound discretion,which it should not exercise unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.hastings,at quoting olano,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
heyer is unable to show any error here,much less plain error.it is unclear what evidence,if any,heyer would have submitted during a hearing on the matter that had not already been presented through the report of andrews,which had been filed with the district court more than five months prior to the hearing.in his briefing,heyer does not indicate any additional information that he would have submitted to the district court on this issue.further,heyer cites no case law in which any court has held that the refusal to hold a hearing on whether to grant such a motion was an abuse of discretion,much less plain error.moreover,there is no evidence that heyer suffered any prejudice from the district court failure to hold a hearing on this issue.
lastly,heyer contends that the district court based its refusal to grant consecutive interpretation on a mistake of law,which he claims is a per se abuse of discretion.heyer bases his argument on a single statement by the district court that this is a civil matter,rather than a criminal proceeding 
the court why do you want consecutive interpretation 
graves counsel for heyer because the potential problem is that we could be way down the road before we realize that heyer does understand something.
the court well,it a civil case.the answer is no.we are not going to make this into a marathon.
graves counsel for heyer thank you,your honor.
according to heyer,this statement by the district court shows that it did not understand that the cia applies to civil and criminal cases without distinction.we disagree.the district court merely indicated that,in the exercise of its discretion under k,it was less likely to grant such a request in a civil case than in a criminal case.there was no suggestion by the district court or the government that the court was without authority to grant the motion only that it chose not do so in this civil commitment case 
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in denying heyer request for consecutive interpretation.
heyer next contends that the district court clearly erred in finding him to be a sexually dangerous person under.
to obtain a commitment order against heyer,the government was required to establish three distinct facts by clear and convincing evidence that heyer has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the past,a currently suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder and as a result of the illness,abnormality,or disorder,would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released,a see also united states hall,cir.c lear and convincing has been defined as evidence of such weight that it produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction,w
