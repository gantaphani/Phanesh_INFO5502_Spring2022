background 
because this case is before us on an appeal from the grant of summary judgment,we must take the facts in the light most favorable to the party,holder,and must draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,d taylor american chemistry council,cir.
on october,ralph holder attended his son soccer game.his estranged wife,maria,also was in attendance.when it began to rain,holder approached his wife and asked her if she had a shirt for their son.when told that she did not,he asked if she could make sure that she had one next time.at this point,holder yelled at holder that he needed to keep his black mouth shut,att.at,and unexpectedly bumped him.holder instinctively pushed her away.id.holder challenged him to a fight and said that he needed to keep his hands off her and called him a black bastard,att.at.she then called the police.
officer jason morrow was the first to arrive on the scene,and he spoke with holder.she identified holder and told the officer that he pushed her.officer morrow then went over and talked to holder.while this discussion was taking place,officer derek feather arrived.
holder told officer morrow that holder had initiated a verbal confrontation that had escalated to the point where she made contact with him before he pushed her back he also informed the officers that his estranged wife true objective was to obtain a restraining order to keep him from having contact with his son.holder also told them that he and his estranged wife were involved in a bitter and protracted divorce and child custody battle,and he urged the officers to speak with nearby witnesses.
holder was arrested and charged with simple assault the determination of probable cause was made by officer morrow officer feather merely assisted with the arrest.that assistance included providing his handcuffs for use in the arrest.
after the arrest,officer feather spoke with holder and three witnesses.he received the impression that the witnesses did not want to get involved,but one of them did say that holder had been verbally aggressive to holder and,in the view of the witness,had precipitated the dispute.the other two witnesses seemed to agree.however,the witness who spoke with officer feather based his opinion only on what he had heard he had not seen anything.
the case against holder eventually was dismissed.
in his complaint,holder alleged,in addition to several supplemental state law claims,that the officers had lacked probable cause to effect the arrest,that the officers had discriminated against him on the basis of race and gender and that the officers had violated his due process rights by not interviewing witnesses and by not allowing him to conduct his own investigation the complaint named as defendants the town of sandown,sandown of police,scott currier,officer morrow and officer feather.by the time holder brought this action,however,officer morrow had left the sandown police department he never was served and therefore never became a defendant in this action.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the fourth amendment claim.the district court held that,as a matter of law,holder constitutional right to be free from an unreasonable seizure had not been violated.with respect to officer feather,moreover,the court determined that,because he had played no role in effecting the arrest,there was no basis for any liability.with respect to the town,the court determined that there was no evidence of a policy,custom or inadequate hiring and training practices that could constitute the basis of liability.similarly,with respect to the chief of police,the court held there was no evidence that he had encouraged,condoned or acquiesced in any illegal arrest.failure to take action against the officers after the fact was not sufficient to expose him to liability.
the court also granted summary judgment on the remaining federal claims and dismissed the state claims without prejudice.holder now appeals the district court ruling with respect to whether there was probable cause to effect his arrest.
ii.discussion 
an arrest is lawful if the officer has probable cause.tennessee garner,d.a police officer has probable cause when,at the time of the arrest,the facts and circumstances within the officer knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person,or one of reasonable caution,in believing,in the circumstances shown,that the suspect has committed,is committing,or is about to commit an offense.michigan defillippo,d see also beck ohio,d acosta ames dep t stores,cir rivera murphy,cir united states figueroa,cir.in determining whether the officer had probable cause,we must view the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the officer.roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir citing illinois gates,d.probable cause requires only a probability that the defendant committed the crime.see hill california,d but sufficient probability,not certainty,is the touchstone of reasonableness under the fourth amendment and on the record before us the officers mistake was understandable and the arrest a reasonable response to the situation facing them at the time.see also wilson russo,cir probable cause to arrest exists if there is a fair probability that the person committed the crime at issue.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the test for probable cause does not require the officers conclusion to be ironclad,or even highly probable.their conclusion that probable cause exists need only be reasonable.acosta,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the question of probable cause,like the question of reasonable suspicion,is an objective inquiry.see bolton taylor,cir.the actual motive or thought process of the officer is not plumbed.id.citing whren united states,d.the only relevant facts are those known to the officer.when these facts are in reasonable dispute,the must resolve the dispute.bolton,at.however,when the underlying facts claimed to support probable cause are not in dispute,whether those raw facts constitute probable cause is an issue of law that we must determine de novo.id.at citing ornelas united states,d.
holder claims that there are multitudinous material factual disputes.appellant br.at.he does not,however,further explain the disputes.his lack of specificity on this point could well constitute waiver.see king town of hanover,cir it is an established appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way.ellipsis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,we need not rely on this ground,however,because the record does not reflect a genuine factual dispute with respect to the basic material facts known to officer morrow.these raw facts,see bolton,at,gave the officers probable cause to arrest holder.our task,as well as the task of the district court,admittedly would have been easier if officer morrow police report and affidavit were a part of the record.nevertheless,reading holder affidavit along with his voluntary statement and his counsel eventual acceptance of the district court interpretation of the facts,we must conclude that holder told officer morr
