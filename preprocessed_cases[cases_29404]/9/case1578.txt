opinion of the court 
edward biliski biliski brought this civil rights action under against his former employer,the red clay consolidated school district board of education the board,and individual defendants employed by the board together,red clay,alleging that they violated his procedural due process rights in terminating his employment.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of red clay,concluding that biliski was an employee without a constitutionally protectable property interest in his job and,therefore,he could not establish a due process claim.we find it unnecessary to address whether biliski possessed a property interest in his continued employment because,even assuming that he had such an interest,the process he received comported with his rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
factual and procedural background 
biliski was employed by the red clay school district as a computer technician from march,until he was terminated effective august.during that time,he was also briefly employed as a help desk coordinator,but returned to his job as a technician.biliski was under the impression that he could only be fired for just cause,but admits that this understanding came from his,not from any documents he received from red clay.app.at.
biliski termination resulted from several performance issues that began in march.on march,ted ammann,red clay school district manager of technology,addressed a disciplinary memo to biliski,noting that he failed to meet an important deadline after being asked to do so a number of times,that he refused to undertake another task he was asked to complete,saying that it was someone else job,and that he showed a lack of respect and attention at a customer service training.app.at.this memo also states that f ailure to demonstrate an improved attitude as well as completion of assigned tasks will result in disciplinary action and that t here will be a by the end of april regarding the issues outlined above.app.at.the memo has a place for biliski signature at the bottom but is not signed by biliski.in his deposition,biliski recalled a meeting with ted ammann and cara gaudino,red clay technology coordinator and biliski direct supervisor,in which they told him they were disappointed in him or his work,but biliski claimed that he was not given a copy of this disciplinary memo.app.at.biliski also testified that he did not recall being told he had to improve his performance within a specific period of time or that failure to do so would result in discipline.
on july,ammann issued biliski a second memo regarding another missed deadline.the memo states future missed deadlines will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.app.at.biliski testified that he discussed this missed deadline with ammann and was given a copy of this memo by ammann secretary,rhonda,but biliski refused to sign it i told something like i got closed work orders and he going to make a big deal out of this one little thing.app.at.version of that conversation was that biliski became very angry and said that he was going to sign that fucking memo.app.at.biliski denied using profanity,but admitted making disparaging comments about ammann.
on august,biliski was called to a meeting with ammann and debra davenport,red clay school district manager of human resources,and was given three disciplinary memos,each dated august.the first relates to the inappropriate language and behavior he displayed when refusing to sign the earlier memo and also cites him for leaving the office that day without informing anyone of his whereabouts.it states that biliski had been told to email his supervisor when leaving and that c ursing or disparaging remarks about supervisors will lead to discipline up to and including termination.app.at.the second memo cites him for parking in a fire lane after having received an email sent to the whole team directing employees not to park there.the third memo states that when asked to unload a van of equipment several days before,biliski refused and stated,no,i not doing it.i been in the schools and it hot.app.at.the memo also informed him that his f ailure to complete assigned tasks can not sic be tolerated and continued refusal will lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination.app.at.
in his deposition,biliski testified that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the charges in the memos during that meeting when i tried to rebut what he was saying,debra davenport stopped me and said,oh,no,you do you have to listen to what he saying.app.at.however,in a verification filed in the district court,ammann claimed that biliski was given an opportunity to explain his actions,but instead just talked about issues that were unrelated to the performance problems raised.app.at.
at the end of the august,meeting,biliski was given a letter informing him that his name will be submitted to the board of education for termination and that i f approved your date of termination will be effective august.app.at.biliski admits that the meeting ended with him calling ammann a no good motherfucker,throwing a pencil at him,and being asked to leave the building.app.at.
sometime after this meeting,the deputy superintendent,diane dunmon,received a form from davenport recommending biliski dismissal.dunmon deposition testimony was that she would normally have a conversation with a supervisor about the employee potential dismissal,so she would have had conversations about biliski and seen corroborating documents.however,dunmon had no detailed recollections other than there were performance issues as i recall.app.at.as a general matter,when the administration recommended firing an employee,it presented the board with an oral report at a board meeting on the reasons for termination,but did not also submit underlying documentation.
the august,letter informed biliski that the board would decide the issue of his termination,but did not include the date of the board meeting.after he received this letter,biliski telephoned individual board members to ask them not to vote on his dismissal until they heard his side of the story.irwin becnel,president of the board,testified at his deposition that when biliski told him that he had a letter that he wanted to submit to the board,becnel advised biliski to take his letter to the board secretary who would distribute it to the board.biliski letter was photocopied and circulated to the board members for the august,meeting at which biliski dismissal was discussed.
biliski letter incorporated copies of four of the disciplinary memos he received and contained his lengthy responses to each of the disciplinary charges contained therein.biliski argued that other employees did worse things than he had done and got away with them,that he did more work than anyone else,that he was joking when he refused to unload the van equipment and did not help unload the equipment because another employee said he should not do it because of his heart condition,that he was too busy with other work to meet his deadlines,that he was so busy he completely overlooked an entire project,and that he had not read the email instructing employees not to park in the fire lane.this rebuttal letter including the attached memos is fifteen pages long.
becnel,the board president who advised biliski to submit a rebuttal letter to the board,testified at his deposition that biliski letter was discussed by the board members at the meeting.he stated as i remember biliski letter,i do recall him refuting any of the reasons the administration gave in support of his termination.app.at.the board approved biliski termination and sent him a letter dated august,notifying him that he had been terminated effective august.biliski testified that he never received this letter and that the board also never responded to his rebuttal letter.on august,dunmon received a letter from biliski,requesting a meeting about his termination,but did not respond.
on december,biliski filed a complaint against red clay in the united states district court for the district of delaware,claiming that he had a property interest in his continued employment and that his dismissal constituted a deprivation of his right to procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment actionable under.app.at.biliski sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants acts were unlawful and unconstitutional,preliminary and permanent injunctions restoring him to his job and enjoining defendant from firing him again unless the termination procedures comply with due process,and monetary damages,including but not limited to backpay,future earnings and fringe benefits,and compensation for all other injuries and losses proximately caused by the unlawful acts of defendants.app.at.
after discovery and depositions,red clay and biliski each filed a motion for summary judgment.as he does here,biliski argued that he had a property interest in his job because his employment status had been altered by a red clay policy adopted in policy,which provided that classified employees may be fired only for just and reasonable cause and after notify ing the employee in writing of the charges and provid ing an opportunity for a hearing.app.at.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of red clay,finding that biliski had no protectable property interest in his job because no statute limited his employer ability to fire him and citing delaware precedent for the proposition that unilateral expressions of company policies that do not set out a definite term of employment,such as in an employee handbook,do not alter an employee status.app.at.biliski timely appealed.
standard of review 
our review of the district court grant or denial of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same standard that the district court applied in determining whether summary judgment was appropriate.norfolk ry.basell usa,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.norfolk,at quoting abramson william paterson coll.of,cir 
discussion 
to establish liability under,a plaintiff must show that the defendants,acting under color of law,violated the plaintiff federal constitutional or statutory rights,and thereby caused the complained of injury.elmore cleary,cir.we have explained that a plaintiff,as in the case of biliski,who seeks to establish a procedural due process claim must demonstrate that he was deprived of an individual interest that is encompassed within the fourteenth amendment protection of life,liberty,or property,and the procedures available to him did not provide due process of law.hill borough of kutztown,cir quoting alvin suzuki,cir.
in this case,the district court concluded that biliski did not have a property interest in his job and,therefore,declined to reach the question of whether the process biliski received was constitutionally sufficient.on appeal,biliski argues that he possessed a constitutionally protectable property interest in his continued employment because the board adoption of the policy was clearly a legally sufficient expression of the board intention to limit its discretion to fire district employees.appellant br.at.we have held that t o have a property interest in a job a person must have more than a unilateral expectation of continued employment rather,she must have a legitimate entitlement to such continued employment.elmore,at citing bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.as a result,an employee has no property interest in his or her job sufficient to trigger due process concerns.id.quoting bishop wood,d.
the policy on which biliski relies was adopted in and states,inter alia,that no employee will be dismissed except for just and reasonable cause.red clay contends that the policy was insufficient to confer a property right because it was a unilateral employer policy that did not have the force of law necessary to alter biliski status.
despite the parties arguments in this case,we need not decide whether the policy conferred a property interest because,even assuming arguendo that biliski had such an interest,the process that biliski received comported with the requirements of due process.we may affirm a district court judgment on grounds other than those considered by the district court itself,hughes long,cir,as long as those grounds were presented to the court below,halderman pennhurst state sch,cir en banc ordinarily we do not consider matters which were not first presented to the district court.
an essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life,liberty,or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.cleveland bd.of ed.loudermill,d quoting mullane central hanover bank trust.however,i t is by now well established that due process,unlike some legal rules,is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstances.gilbert homar,d quoting cafeteria rest.workers mcelroy,d.d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.id.alteration in original quoting morrissey brewer,d.for instance,the supreme court has rejected the proposition that due process always requires the state to provide a hearing prior to the initial deprivation of property.id.emphasis and alteration in original quoting parratt taylor,d accordingly,resolution of the issue whether the administrative procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected.mathews eldridge,d citing arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring in part.
in mathews eldridge,the supreme court held that the identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.at.
in loudermill,the supreme court held that a pretermination hearing need not be elaborate,but t he opportunity to present reasons,either in person or in writing,why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.at.the tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him,an explanation of the employer evidence,and an opportunity to present his side of the story.id.at.moreover,t he formality and procedural requisites for the hearing can vary,depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings.id.at.alteration in original.in general,something less than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.id.quoting mathews,at.loudermill addresses the contours of procedural requirements in a factual scenario where the plaintiff,a tenured public employee,had been provided a hearing.at.
biliski does not argue that he was entitled to the full panoply of formal proceedings that delaware state law provides for termination of the employment of teachers.see.tit.biliski argues that he was covered by the policy which applies only to classified employees.the district court never decided whether biliski was a classified employee,an issue we also do not decide.instead,we consider whether,assuming arguendo he was entitled to due process,the process he received comported with that requirement.
we apply the framework that the supreme court established in mathews eldridge to decide whether the totality of the administrative process biliski received in connection with his termination,including the written presentation of his position to the formal,satisfied the fundamental requirement of due process,which is the opportunity to be heard at a mea
