aaron tobey alleges he was retaliated against for exercising his first amendment rights when at richmond international airport ric,transportation security administration tsa agents and ric police seized and arrested him for displaying the text of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution on his chest.seeking to vindicate his rights,tobey brought an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against the ric police and tsa agents,alleging violations of his first,fourth,and fourteenth amendment equal protection clause rights.the tsa agents moved to dismiss the claims,asserting qualified immunity.the district judge sustained the motion as to the fourth and fourteenth amendment claims,but denied the motion for the first amendment claim.the tsa agents appeal the denial to this court and are the only parties to this appeal.because we find the facts as alleged by tobey plausibly set forth a claim that the tsa agents violated his clearly established first amendment rights,we affirm the district court decision.
from the outset we must underscore that this case is before us on appeal from denial of a.b motion to dismiss.therefore,the facts set forth are from the vantage point of tobey,with all reasonable inferences drawn in his favor.see jenkins mckeithen,d republican party of north carolina martin,cir.
following the september,terrorist attacks,congress created the transportation security administration.tsa is tasked with maintaining the security of commercial air travel.tsa agents screen and search airline passengers at airports,randomly selecting certain passengers for enhanced secondary screening.under the enhanced secondary screening policies,passengers had a choice of submitting to either an advanced imaging technology ait scan or a pat down.the purpose of tsa procedures was limited to finding explosives,incendiaries,weapons or other items and screening to ensure that an individual identity is appropriately verified and checked against government watch lists.tsa management directive.
on december,aaron tobey was scheduled to fly from richmond to wisconsin to attend his grandfather funeral.tobey waited until there was a short line at the tsa screening checkpoint and then commenced the screening process by presenting his boarding pass and identification to the agent.tobey proceeded to the conveyor belt area and placed his belt,shoes,sweatshirt,and other items on the conveyor.tobey was then diverted by appellant agent smith from the standard metal detector used as the primary screening apparatus to the ait scanning unit for enhanced screening.
in anticipation that he might be subjected to enhanced screening,tobey had written the text of the fourth amendment on his chest as he believed ait scanning was unconstitutional.before proceeding through the ait unit,tobey calmly placed his sweatpants and on the conveyor belt,leaving him in running shorts and socks,revealing the text of the fourth amendment written on his chest.agent smith advised tobey he need not remove his clothes.tobey calmly responded that he wished to express his view that tsa enhanced screening procedures were unconstitutional.
at this point,agent smith radioed for assistance.as commanded by her supervisor,appellant agent jones,agent smith ordered tobey to remain in front of the ait unit.agent jones and unknown appellant agent doe then asked ric police for assistance.at no point did tobey refuse to undergo the enhanced screening procedures.nor did he decline to do anything requested of him.in fact,tobey alleges that he remained quiet,composed,polite,cooperative and complied with the requests of agents and officers.
ric police officers vann and mason arrived on the scene and immediately handcuffed and arrested tobey.none of the tsa agents informed ric police of what occurred at the screening station,nor did ric police ask.officer vann escorted tobey to a side area and informed him he was under arrest for creating a public disturbance.agent doe searched tobey belongings,removing unidentified items.officer mason then collected tobey belongings with assistance from agents smith and doe.
tobey was then taken to the ric police station where officer vann and other officers questioned tobey and threatened him with various criminal sanctions.tobey was eventually charged with disorderly conduct in a public place.see ann.the officers later released tobey after consulting with an air marshal from the federal air marshal joint terrorism task force.in total,tobey was held for over an hour.tobey boarded the plane without further incident.the commonwealth attorney for henrico county subsequently dropped the disorderly conduct charge.

on june,appellants jones and smith moved to dismiss all three claims.on august,the district court granted the motion with respects to counts one and three.in dismissing the fourth amendment claim,the court explained that tobey bizarre behavior gave rise to further police inquiry g iven the heightened security interest at airport security checkpoints it was eminently reasonable for smith and jones to seek assistance from the ric police.tobey napolitano,d.
the equal protection clause claim was dismissed because the complaint makes no reference to any other passengers who stripped off their clothes much less passengers who began stripping down and continued to do so even after being told by a tsa agent that it was unnecessary or otherwise launched a protest inside the screening area.id.at.
the district court,however,declined to dismiss tobey first amendment claim.the court held that because there is a question of whether the tsa agents in fact radioed for assistance because of the message plaintiff sought to convey or because of some other reasonable restriction on first amendment activity in the security screening area,dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity would be improper.id.at.
on october,appellants appealed the district court decision denying their motion to dismiss the first amendment claim.appellants argue that tobey did not allege a facially valid first amendment claim and even if he did,qualified immunity bars such a claim because they did not violate a clearly established constitutional right.
qualified immunity shield s officials from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.anderson creighton,d see also saucier katz,d.to determine whether tobey complaint should survive a qualified motion to dismiss,we exercise our sound discretion in following the inquiry laid out in saucier by analyzing one,whether a constitutional violation occurred,and two,whether the right violated was clearly established.see pearson,at saucier,at melgar greene,cir.we review a qualified motion to dismiss de novo.melgar,at.
as a threshold matter,before addressing whether tobey asserted a plausible first amendment violation in his complaint,we must correct an erroneous conclusion reached by the district court.reviewing the record afresh,we find that the district court erred in concluding tobey failed to plead appellants in some way caused his arrest.tobey napolitano,d at.the district court opined that tobey complaint is devoid of any facts suggesting that appellants neither of whom are law enforcement officers with the power of arrest made any such assertion or otherwise indicated to the ric police that plaintiff should be arrested.id.the district court further noted that plaintiff counsel conceded that the complaint does say directly that plaintiff arrest was at the instruction of the tsa.id.at citing tr.fortunately for tobey,he was not required to state these precise magical words in order to plausibly plead that appellants caused his arrest.the supreme court reiterated in bell atlantic twombly that a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do,d citing papasan allain,d.allegations have facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d.
as the supreme court explained,section and by association bivens anticipates that a government official will be responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.malley briggs,d quoting monroe pape,d see also berg county of allegheny,cir a government official liability for causing an arrest is the same as for carrying it out.internal quotation marks omitted.it is an undoubtedly natural consequence of reporting a person to the police that the person will be arrested especially in the scenario we have here,where tsa and ric police act in close concert.so long as tobey complaint rendered it plausible that appellants helped effectuate his arrest,the district court should have factored the arrest into its decision as to whether tobey alleged plausible bivens claims against appellants.
when looking at tobey complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,it is logical to assume that appellants had a hand in his arrest.tobey announced to appellants his desire to peacefully protest tsa screening measures,and at that point,appellants radioed for assistance.immediately thereafter,ric police seized and handcuffed tobey from behind without further inquiry.it is reasonable to infer that whatever appellants told ric police caused tobey arrest.this inference is bolstered by the fact that appellants silently stood by and watched ric police arrest tobey.the fact that appellants do not have the power of arrest does not hurt tobey,but helps him,as one can infer that appellants radioed ric police to arrest tobey as they could not do it themselves.it may bear out after further discovery that appellants radioed for assistance for innocuous reasons.it may also bear out that appellants indicated to ric police that they should arrest tobey.tobey complaint raises a plausible inference that appellants caused his arrest,and thus it was improper for the district court to find otherwise at the b phase of litigation.the district court should have considered the entire course of events up to arrest when deciding whether to dismiss tobey bivens actions against appellants.
with that said,for the purposes of reviewing the plausibility of tobey first amendment claim,we will assume that appellants liability carries through to arrest,although further discovery may prove this not to be the case.moreover,the district court reasoning as to why qualified immunity bars tobey fourth amendment claim or why tobey first amendment claim survives a b motion to dismiss has no sway on our decision,as both decisions were based in part on the erroneous conclusion that appellants can not be liable for tobey arrest.having clarified this initial matter,we can now look at the facts and allegations in tobey complaint with unfettered freshness,as required by de novo review.
for tobey first amendment claim to survive a qualified b motion to dismiss tobey must have plausibly alleged in his complaint that his constitutional rights were violated.a cognizable first amendment retaliation claim requires a plaintiff to show that plaintiff speech was protected defendant alleged retaliatory action adversely affected the plaintiff constitutionally protected speech and a causal relationship exists between plaintiff speech and the defendant retaliatory action.suarez.indus.mcgraw.cir.
a complaint need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.twombly,at internal quotation marks omitted.a rule b motion to dismiss does not resolve contests surrounding facts,the merits of a claim,or the applicability of defenses.martin,at.appellants argue tobey complaint did not adequately set forth a first amendment claim,and therefore must be dismissed.we disagree.
tobey complaint most certainly sets forth a valid first amendment retaliation claim.in his complaint,tobey alleges the appellants violated his first amendment rights by seizing him or causing his seizure,without probable cause because of the message conveyed by his silent,nonviolent expression of objection to the tsa screening policies he goes on to state that the appellants engaged in content viewpoint discrimination and deprived him of his fundamental right to engage in free speech and to engage freely in political expression as guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
these legal conclusions are well supported by the facts laid out in tobey complaint.tobey alleges that he removed his sweatpants and to reveal the text of the fourth amendment on his chest.appellants told him that he did not have to remove his clothing,but he responded that he wished to express his views that the screening process was unconstitutional.immediately after this assertion,appellants engaged ric police officers to arrest him they handcuffed and seized him with no questioning and without telling him why he was being arrested.
in short,tobey complaint satisfies all three elements of a first amendment claim as he alleges he engaged in constitutionally protected protest he was seized as a result of the protest and the temporal proximity of his peaceful protest and his arrest,unsupported by probable cause,shows appellants engaged in impermissible retaliation.trulock freeh,cir observing that the timing of the search raises an inference of retaliatory motive.the factual allegations in the complaint,viewed as a whole,have facial plausibility that allow the court to draw reasonable inference that the defendant s are liable for misconduct alleged.iqbal,at citing twombly,at.this is not a case where the complaint is merely threadbare recitals of a cause of action elements supported by mere conclusory statements.id.these factual allegations,when viewed as accurate,adequately support tobey legal assertion that he was unlawfully seized in retaliation for exercising his protected first amendment rights.
appellants contend that tobey has not pled a cognizable first amendment claim because their actions were reasonable given tobey bizarre and disruptive conduct.this argument stems from the supreme court ruling in international society for krishna consciousness,lee,in which the court held that the government can impose reasonable restrictions on speech in an airport given that it is a nonpublic forum.id.at.
even conceding that tobey behavior was bizarre,bizarre behavior alone can not be enough to effectuate an arrest.if appellants caused tobey arrest solely due to his bizarre behavior,appellants can not be said to have acted reasonably.this is especially the case given that the first amendment protects bizarre behavior.see spence washington,d per curiam woven into our constitutional freedoms is the belief in autonomy and the celebration of difference.for us to hold today that it is reasonable to cause an arrest due to bizarre behavior and nothing more would violate the most basic tenents of our constitution.
further,contrary to appellants assertions,bizarre does not equal disruptive.whether tobey was in fact disruptive is a disputed question of fact at this juncture.appellants seem to think that removing clothing is per se disruptive.we beg to differ.passengers routinely remove clothing at an airport screening station,and in fact are required to do so by tsa regulations.it is just as reasonable that tobey calmly taking off his and sweatpants caused no disruption at all,especially since he was never asked to put his clothes back on.and because we are reviewing the facts at the b phase of litigation,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to tobey.it could be perfectly true that after further factual development a court could find that appellants acted reasonably given tobey conduct.perhaps tobey took off his shirt,twirled it around his head,and ripped off his pants with a dramatic flourish,indeed causing a great spectacle.however,we can not,from this record at the b stage,make this factual conclusion.
at bottom,we are not persuaded by the appellants reasonableness argument.the question of reasonableness is a inquiry,going directly to the heart of the case.in cornelius naacp legal defense and education fund,the supreme court held that the reasonableness of the government restriction in a nonpublic forum must be assessed in the light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances,d.based on tobey complaint,it is unclear whether appellants behavior was reasonably motivated by tobey disruptive conduct or unreasonably motivated by his protected protest.what is reasonable in this context,therefore,requires greater factual development and is better decided once discovery has been conducted.see martin,at dimeglio haines,cir w here there is a material dispute over what the defendant did it may be that the qualified immunity question can not be resolved without discovery.
in a similar vein,appellants maintain that tobey can not plead a first amendment violation because the alleged misconduct was consistent with a lawful tsa response.appellants make this claim without pointing to a single regulation or law that permits seizure and arrest for the removal of an of clothing or prohibits the display of a peaceful,message of protest.
the relevant tsa regulations state that no person may interfere with tsa screening personnel in the performance of their duties,and n o person may attempt to circumvent any security system,measure,or procedure.based on the facts alleged in his complaint,tobey violated neither of these regulations.although appellants repeatedly mention tobey disruptive behavior as the impetus for the arrest,tobey specifically alleges that he did not circumvent security measures nor did he disrupt the screening process.tobey attempted to submit to the enhanced screening procedures.he never violated an express instruction of the appellants.in a sense,tobey aided in appellants search for contraband by removing his and sweatpants at this point there were very few places he could have been hiding anything.tobey was simply showing appellants what they sought to see by using the ait scanning machine.there is nothing before the court at the b phase that indicates tobey removing his sweatpants and caused any interference,disruption,or delay,in violation of any tsa regulation.
appellants seem to think the district judge finding of no fourth amendment violation controls our first amendment analysis.as stated above,however,bizarre behavior alone is not enough to effectuate an arrest.see supra.furthermore,the district court fourth amendment holding is undermined by its erroneous conclusion that appellants can not be found liable for tobey arrest.see supra.additionally,the idea that we are bound by the district court rationale violates the principle of de novo review.see melgar,at.de novo review mandates that we consider the complaint and nothing more,and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of tobey.and as a practical matter,it would be imprudent for us to base our decision on the district court fourth amendment findings given that the decision is not before us and eventually can be appealed.for us to base our holding on the reasoning of an interlocutory order would be nonsensical akin to building a house on a lot comprised of quicksand.it is illogical for us to look at the district court fourth amendment findings given that tobey still has the opportunity to appeal that decision should the district court dismissal of tobey fourth amendment claim be reversed,our holding today would be undermined.while we understand the first and fourth amendment claims are closely linked,to prejudice tobey on the basis of an interlocutory order that he has not yet had the opportunity to appeal is untenable.see baird palmer,cir t he collateral order doctrine does not confer appellate jurisdiction over an order dismissing claims against a defendant on the basis of qualified immunity,where other claims remain pending in the district court.see also.
therefore,the district court decision to dismiss tobey fourth amendment claim is inconsequential to this court finding that tobey asserted a plausible first amendment claim.again,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to tobey,we find that it is unsettled whether his behavior was in fact disruptive or that it was eminently reasonable to effectuate an arrest based on his conduct in spite of the text of the fourth amendment written on his chest thus,tobey first amendment claim properly survives the motion to dismiss.
appellants also raise the argument that tobey complaint is deficient because it does not adequately allege that his arrest was caused by the message of protest he sought to convey.to be sure,causation is a requirement of a first amendment retaliation claim.see huang bd.of governors of of,cir.as we said in huang,t he causation requirement is rigorous it is not enough that the protected expression played a role or was a motivating factor in the retaliation claimant must show that but for the protected expression the government official would not have taken the alleged retaliatory action.id.what appellants conveniently overlook,however,is that huang was before the court on appeal from a grant of summary judgment.viewing all facts as alleged by tobey as true,which is the posture we must take when reviewing a b motion,we can infer causation based on the facts,as tobey alleges the arrest was directly precipitated by his constitutionally protected peaceful protest appellants did not take action until after he informed them that he wished to display his chest in order to express his views on the constitutionality of tsa screening measures.again,it may turn out after further discovery that tobey can not meet this rigorous requirement,but without further discovery,we are unable and unwilling to speculate as to the outcome.
we are satisfied,therefore,that tobey adequately set forth a plausible claim that his first amendment rights were violated by appellants.
we must next decide whether tobey first amendment rights were clearly established.see anderson,at.when deciding whether a right is clearly established,we ask whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.henry purnell,cir en banc quoting saucier,at.
a bedrock first amendment principle is that citizens have a right to voice dissent from government policies.see mills alabama,d whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the first amendment,there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.this principle transcends forums,as the supreme court announced that nondisruptive speech such as the wearing of a or a button that contains a political message may not be airport related,but it is still protected speech even in a nonpublic forum.board of airport comm rs of city of los angeles jews for jesus,d.therefore,in a nonpublic forum such as an airport,a government official can not suppress expression merely because they oppose the speaker view.united states kokinda,d quoting perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d arkansas educ.television comm forbes,d quoting cornelius,at.
our precedent bolsters the supreme court resounding pronouncements.we have held that i t is well established that a public official may not misuse his power to retaliate against an individual for the exercise of a valid constitutional right.trulock,at citing suarez,at.we further declared that the first amendment prohibits an officer from retaliating against an individual for speaking critically of the government.id.
taken together,it is crystal clear that the first amendment protects peaceful nondisruptive speech in an airport,and that such speech can not be suppressed solely because the government disagrees with it.thus,tobey right to display a peaceful message in protest of a government policy without recourse was clearly established at the time of his arrest 
appellants argue that because there is no case detailing what is a reasonable restriction on speech in an airport screening area,tobey constitutional rights can not be said to have been clearly established.they argue the only binding precedent,krishna,states restrictions on speech at airport terminals need only satisfy a standard of reasonableness,at,and that a general standard of reasonableness does not provide sufficient guidance as to the contours of constitutional rights.see ashcroft,d the general proposition,for example,that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the fourth amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of the particular conduct is clearly established.
while reasonableness in and of itself may be an ineffective guide as to whether a right is clearly established,in this case there are clear constitutional parameters.it may be unclear as to what reasonableness entails in the abstract,but at a minimum,given precedent,we know that it is unreasonable to effect an arrest without probable cause for displaying a silent,nondisruptive message of protest which is what allegedly occurred here.appellants even conceded at oral argument that it would have clearly been unlawful for them to seize tobey if the text of the fourth amendment was printed on his.we see no reason why the same clear principle should not apply here,as tobey allegations amount to the factual equivalent.
appellants cite reichle howards,d as supporting their argument that tobey constitutional rights were not clearly established,but in doing so,miss the mark completely.in reichle,an appeal from summary judgment,the supreme court found that it was not clearly established that a plaintiff could make out a cognizable first amendment claim for an arrest that was supported by probable cause.id.at.reichle does not apply here because tobey specifically alleges that his arrest was not supported by probable cause,and probable cause or its absence will be at least an evidentiary issue in practically all cases.hartman moore,d.at this stage in the litigation,of course,we must credit tobey allegation that appellants arrested or caused him to be arrested without probable cause.he has,therefore,satisfied the requirement in hartman and reichle to plead an absence of probable cause.
appellants also cite rendon transportation security administration,cir,as controlling authority that first amendment rights in the screening area of an airport are not clearly established.this case is irrelevant to the inquiry at hand because in that case the sixth circuit grappled with the question of whether tsa regulation was constitutionally overbroad,or whether it violated the plaintiff constitutional rights as applied.in rendon,the plaintiff was being uncooperative,unruly,and using loud profanities and therefore was cited for violating tsa regulation.at.rendon is factually distinct from what we have here.tobey was peaceful,cooperative,and polite this is presumably why he was never cited for violating tsa regulations.the tsa regulations are not at issue here 
given that peaceful,silent,nondisruptive protest is protected in a nonpublic forum,like an airport that it is unequivocally clear that the government can not effectuate an arrest for the display of a message of peaceful protest and that tobey arrest in this instance was allegedly not supported by probable cause we find that tobey rights at the time of his arrest were clearly established by precedent.
while the sensitive nature of airport security weighs heavily on the court,protest against governmental policies goes directly to the heart of the first amendment.the first amendment symbolizes our profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and,and that it may well include vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.new york times sullivan,d.here,tobey engaged in a silent,peaceful protest using the text of our constitution he was well within the ambit of first amendment protections.and while it is tempting to hold that first amendment rights should acquiesce to national security in this instance,our forefather benjamin franklin warned against such a temptation by opining that those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety,deserve neither liberty nor safety.we take heed of his warning and are therefore unwilling to relinquish our first amendment protections even in an airport.
to be clear,we are not unreasonably tying the hands of appellants.there are certainly reasonable measures that they could have taken to ensure safety,such as asking tobey about his intentions fining tobey for violating tsa regulations if there was in fact one on point turning tobey away from the line if he refused to put on his shirt or most simply,asking tobey to put his shirt back on.instead,appellants jumped straight to arrest,infringing upon tobey most basic liberty interest.the question of whether tobey conduct was so bizarre and disruptive that appellants reaction was reasonable or whether tobey was targeted because of the words on his chest can not be decided at the b stage.it may be that discovery will reveal there is no genuine issue of material fact.should this be the case,appellants can move for summary judgment.see behrens pelletier,d holding that a defendant can raise the defense at both the motion to dismiss and summary judgment stage.however,at this stage of the proceeding,we are satisfied that tobey has adequately pled that appellants violated his clearly established first amendment rights.
consistent with the reasoning above,we affirm the district court denial of appellants qualified motion to dismiss of tobey first amendment claim.
i can not join the majority decision permitting a damages action to proceed against transportation security administration tsa agents who were faithfully performing one of the most essential functions in our post age protecting air passengers from the threat of air terrorism.we now view these events in the comfort of hindsight.but while some may consider plaintiff aaron tobey conduct to be cute or even funny in retrospect,it was no laughing matter at the time.
according to the facts alleged in his complaint,tobey engaged in what his own counsel and the district court both described as bizarre behavior in the area of richmond international airport,removing his shirt and pants despite being told that he did not need to disrobe.tobey napolitano,d.his complaint makes no reference to any other passengers who stripped off their clothes much less passengers who began stripping down and continued to do so even after being told by a tsa agent that it was unnecessary or otherwise launched a protest inside the screening area.id.at.
airport screening procedures should,of course,be open to debate and criticism.had this protest been launched somewhere other than in the area,we would have a much different case.but tobey antics diverted defendants from their duties for a period,a diversion that nefarious actors could have exploited to dangerous effect.defendants responded as any passenger would hope they would,summoning local law enforcement to remove tobey and the distraction he was creating from the scene.
for their reasonable efforts to allow the regular screening process to resume and to ensure passenger safety,defendants have been rewarded with the protracted burdens of a lawsuit and the prospect of significant damages liability.given the way they have been treated,i would expect other tsa agents to refrain from responding to some unknown quantum of future security threats.and who could blame them 
the majority decision is not only unwise,but also profoundly unfair.imagine having to make repeated prompt decisions all while the lives of others just might hang in the balance.now imagine being hauled into court and threatened with damages liability for those decisions,having never received sufficient notice as to the legal standards by which your conduct would be judged.such is the deprivation of due process that the majority countenances today.
there is,of course,a familiar legal doctrine designed to avert the exactions of lawsuits like tobey.for nearly forty years,the supreme court has consistently held that government officials performing discretionary functions enjoy qualified immunity from damages actions so long as they do not violate clearly established law.see,pearson callahan,d saucier katz,d harlow fitzgerald,d scheuer rhodes,d.the court has,moreover,repeatedly averred that qualified immunity is an immunity not just from liability,but from suit,and that questions related to such immunity should accordingly be resolved earlier rather than later in the game.how sad that a message crafted so plainly at the headwaters of a hierarchical judicial system has failed to find its way downstream.
one would think the supreme court admonitions on the need for some modicum of specificity in notice to defendants might actually mean something.see,ashcroft,d anderson creighton,d.and yet,by allowing tobey suit to proceed by enunciating legal principles at the highest and most nebulous level of generality,the majority deprives the doctrine of its value.one would think that the uniquely sensitive nature of a area might have figured in the majority analysis.yet it cites not one not even one case that would have afforded these agents anything resembling fair notice of what might be expected of them in the sensitive location and situation in which they found themselves.the majority says long after the fact what it believes these agents might have done,see ante at,but again it fails to reference even a single case from the supreme court,this court,or any other to support its view.if qualified immunity was not created to keep suits like this one from gathering steam,then i fail to see what utility the defense will have.i regret that a doctrine so essential to the performance of public functions has been reduced to hollow and formulaic recitations that signal only its demise.
the most unsettling aspect of this decision is that of scapegoating officials without ever apprising them of the legal standards governing their conduct.in denying the immunity,we are blindsiding others in a way we would never countenance for ourselves.judges,after all,should appreciate the difficulty of judgment.
by affording officials the latitude to make reasonable judgments,qualified immunity helps to avert two evils.subjecting officials to damages actions when the governing law is unclear would incur substantial social costs,as fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.anderson,at.but qualified immunity is not premised on a utilitarian calculus alone it also seeks to prevent the injustice of subjecting to liability an officer who is required,by the legal obligations of his position,to exercise discretion.scheuer,at.
i do understand that,like the proverbial roman tax collector,tsa screening agents are not natural objects of affection.it may seem a strange expenditure of energy strongly to defend them.yet the most unpopular persons may not be treated unfairly under law,and that is especially the case when law itself has tasked them with the unpopular function that nonetheless is necessary to the achievement of a larger social good.the good of safe air travel seems too obvious to mention.the very last way to achieve that good is to penalize without a crumb of notice those who make it possible.
a straightforward application of the elementary principles of qualified immunity leads inexorably to the conclusion that this complaint must be dismissed.for the legal standard identified by tobey and the majority as governing this case could not possibly have provided adequate notice to defendants that their alleged actions were unlawful.according to that standard,because an airport is a nonpublic forum,any regulation restricting speech therein need only be reasonable,as long as the regulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker activity due to disagreement with the speaker view.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee.this standard encompasses two prongs a reasonableness requirement and a ban on viewpoint discrimination and though the majority repeatedly conflates them in its analysis,they impose distinct requirements.considering each in turn,it becomes evident that no case law could possibly have put defendants on notice that they could not respond to tobey conduct by defusing the situation as they did.
start with the requirement that restrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum be reasonable.the majority concedes that a general reasonableness requirement does not in itself create clearly established law sufficient to defeat a defense.ante at citing.at the general proposition,for example,that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the fourth amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.this makes sense,of course,for how could an official possibly divine from a general command to be reasonable specific standards of conduct suited to the varied and often unpredictable circumstances he or she might face 
because a general reasonableness requirement is so vague,tobey and the majority must identify some case law that would have given defendants fair notice that it would be unreasonable to respond to his specific conduct by summoning local law enforcement.yet they fail to do so,ignoring the supreme court admonition that courts must not define clearly established law at a high level of generality.at,but rather must identify a constitutional right that was clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense,anderson,at.to be sure,officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.hope pelzer,d.but in the absence of some precedent addressing the scenario at issue,officials will have sufficient notice only when a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law appl ies with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question.id.at emphases added quoting united states lanier,d.what the majority fails to appreciate is that qualified immunity requires that in the light of preexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent.anderson,at emphasis added.
general propositions stripped of all sense of context may seem useful to my fine appellate colleagues,see ante at,but they are of no use at all to people who must confront specific and difficult situations.neither tobey nor the majority points to a single court decision addressing a situation even remotely similar in time,place,or manner to the one that occurred here,let alone a decision that would have made the unlawfulness of defendants actions apparent.they cite no decision involving the period before scores of passengers board airplanes,no decision involving the area of an airport,and no decision involving distracting conduct that poses a potential security threat.indeed,in the only appellate decision that even somewhat resembles this case,the court ruled for the government defendants,a ruling that would hardly have counseled defendants to have acted in a different fashion than they did.see rendon tsa,cir.the complete dearth of pertinent precedent should be dispositive of the question whether it was clearly established that defendants conduct was unreasonable it was not.
especially telling is the failure by tobey and the majority to cite a single case involving conduct that disrupts activities,as tobey conduct evidently did.the majority finds it significant that tobey complaint nowhere explicitly alleges that his behavior caused any disruption but,on the contrary,asserts that he remained quiet,composed,polite,cooperative,and complied with the requests of agents and officers.ante at.this statement,however,does not render defendants alleged actions unreasonable.first,it is belied by other allegations in the complaint.for example,as the district court noted,tobey alleges that he began stripping off his clothes inside the security screening area and continued to do so even after one defendant advised that removal of clothing was unnecessary.tobey,d at.second,while it may be true that p assengers routinely remove clothing at an airport screening station,ante at,they do not routinely doff their undershirts and bare their chests tobey deliberately and indisputably removed much more clothing than is consistent with ordinary tsa screening practices.needless to say,tobey and the majority point to no decision holding that it is unreasonable to detain someone who fails to follow tsa instructions and proceeds in a manner calculated to divert attention from the normal screening process and redirect it toward himself.
in addition,whether or not tobey caused a visible commotion in the screening area whether or not he took off his shirt,twirled it around his head,and ripped off his pants with a dramatic flourish,indeed causing a great spectacle,ante at it is a simple matter of common sense that his behavior was disruptive.see ashcroft iqbal,d determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.this inference follows ineluctably from the face of the complaint.outside a few limited contexts,such as public swimming pools,removing one shirt and pants will always attract other people attention and distract them from whatever they happen to be doing.tobey own counsel conceded as much when he described his client behavior as bizarre,an impression that the district court evidently shared.see tobey,d at plaintiff counsel conceded at oral argument that plaintiff behavior was bizarre,and that defendants were justified in summoning the local p olice for further inquiry.and tobey himself anticipated the disruption his behavior might cause,alleging in his complaint that he purposefully waited for the number of people in line to diminish in order to avoid the possibility of causing delay for his fellow passengers.
of course,the majority offers no guidance whatsoever to tsa officials as to how many people must be waiting in line before they may take even modest preventive steps.and for good reason.conduct like tobey inevitably delays the screening process for other passengers,and referring a person who engages in it to local authorities prevents the screening line from jamming up and allows for a careful assessment of any threat the person might pose.see rendon,at.such a referral was a perfectly reasonable step to take,as it provided an opportunity for further evaluation of the situation while avoiding any further potential disruptions to the screening process.
disruptions in an airport area,especially ones involving bizarre behavior like public stripping,pose safety risks.as tsa regulations recognize,c heckpoint disruptions potentially can be dangerous for a number of reasons,including a disruptive individual may be attempting to discourage the screener from being as thorough as required a screener may need to summon a checkpoint screening supervisor and law enforcement officer,taking them away from other duties and a screener encountering such a situation must turn away from his or her normal duties to deal with the disruptive individual,which may affect the screening of other individuals.tsa regulations accordingly provide that n o person may interfere with screening personnel in the performance of their screening duties.passenger safety would seem to require that tsa agents be able to focus on their screening tasks,unimpeded by boarding passengers attempting to divert their attention,whether as a means of protest or for more sinister purposes.
to deem defendants response to tobey distracting behavior not only unreasonable,but clearly so,is to posit a world in which tsa agents can afford to indulge individuals flamboyant propensities in one of the most sensitive areas of the airport.after recent plots involving commercial aircraft,it should go without saying that this is not the world in which we live.
tobey may very well have had benign motives.he may very well have posed no immediate security threat himself.but it will hardly do to countenance lengthy discovery in an attempt to discern what tsa agents could not possibly have known at the time.they had minutes to figure out what will take us months.they were not allowed simply to assume nonchalantly that tobey actions were a harmless prank.they could not possibly have known how far he would go in disrobing or what further actions he was prepared to take.they could not close their eyes to the obvious risks that his distracting behavior created for his fellow passengers safety.although no serious harm was done this time,the government need not wait until havoc is wreaked to restrict access to a nonpublic forum.cornelius naacp,d.in the absence of a single precedent instructing government officials to permit publicity stunts in highly sensitive venues like airport areas,i fail to see how defendants response was unreasonable,let alone how any unreasonableness was clearly established.
as for the prohibition against viewpoint discrimination in a nonpublic forum,tobey complaint alleges no violation of this prohibition at all let alone one that was clearly established.to be sure,he advances a conclusory legal allegation to that effect.not once in his complaint,however,does tobey plead a fact that would even suggest that defendants reacted to the viewpoint he expressed rather than to his state of undress.
tobey does not suggest that defendants spoke even one word of disagreement with his message before summoning local police.he does not plead that they tolerated nonexpressive disruption in the screening area.and most tellingly of all,as the district court noted,his complaint makes no reference to any other passengers who stripped off their clothes much less passengers who began stripping down and continued to do so even after being told by a tsa agent that it was unnecessary or otherwise launched a protest inside the screening area but who were not removed.tobey,d at.
had defendants truly committed viewpoint discrimination,one would think that tobey could point to at least one comment or one comparator,someone who engaged in similarly distracting conduct but who expressed a viewpoint different from his or no viewpoint at all and whom defendants permitted to remain in the screening area.he does point to pictorial displays of people in bathing suits and athletic shorts that were posted in other areas of the airport,but his attempt to analogize his personal behavior to pictorial displays elsewhere is singularly unpersuasive.tobey obviously experienced the events giving rise to this suit firsthand.he had every incentive to include every detail that could possibly help his case in his complaint.that he failed to plead a single telltale sign of viewpoint bias betrays just how baseless his claim really is.
what tobey complaint does plead is not viewpoint discrimination,but a perfectly reasonable response by defendants to his highly unusual and potentially dangerous stunt.how can it possibly be viewpoint bias to refer someone in a state of unauthorized public undress for further evaluation and allow the routine screening process at an airport to resume the agents here went the extra mile.before ever summoning local law enforcement,one defendant informed tobey that removal of clothing was not necessary.it is an irony to say the least that the defendants whose intrusive conduct tobey was protesting were simultaneously advising him that intrusive screening measures were not necessary.in case there were any doubt,this statement confirms that defendants were concerned not with tobey viewpoint,but with the fact that he was standing nearly naked in the worst possible place.it is sheer fancy to think that defendants had anything on their minds other than eliminating the distraction that tobey state of dishabille was causing.
but even if defendants engaged in viewpoint discrimination,as tobey improbably alleges,it was not clearly established that such discrimination was unconstitutional in the very limited setting of this case.the majority notes that it is clearly established that citizens have a right to voice dissent from government policies,ante at citing mills alabama,d that even in a nonpublic forum,government official s can not suppress expression merely because they oppose the speaker view,ante at quoting united states kokinda,d and that a public official may not misuse his power to retaliate against an individual for the exercise of a valid constitutional right,ante at quoting trulock freeh,cir.while these abstract propositions are as incontestable judicially as mom and apple pie,they fail to provide the kind of concrete guidance that could have rendered defendants alleged constitutional violation clearly established.
of course the first amendment subjects viewpoint discrimination to strict scrutiny as well it should.but the government has a compelling interest in ensuring the safety of its citizens.that interest is not abrogated when they take to the air.a narrowly tailored means of achieving that interest,moreover,will on rare occasions involve taking into account the views expressed by individuals.as justice ginsburg recently explained,because officers performing a protective function will rightly take into account words spoken to,or in the proximity of,the person whose safety is their charge,retaliatory animus can not be inferred from the assessment they ma k e of those words so long as the assessment is rational.reichle howards,d ginsburg,concurring in the judgment.consider someone who shouts in the area,all citizens have a constitutional right to carry guns on airplanes.no one denies that tsa agents could weigh the speaker viewpoint without violating the first amendment indeed,we would regard any tsa agent who failed to do so as dangerously incompetent.and when agents confront a passenger like tobey,who so dramatically expressed opposition to precautions right before boarding a flight,they confront a situation that only a naif would ignore.the passenger may turn out to be harmless,but the constitution can not possibly be construed to require tsa agents to take that gamble.
in addition,tobey must prove that defendants alleged viewpoint discrimination caused his seizure.see suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir.tobey complaint,however,alleged a violation of the fourth amendment as well as the first,and for many of the reasons noted above,the district court rightly dismissed tobey fourth amendment claim,describing defendants decision to summon local law enforcement as eminently reasonable.tobey,d at.this conclusion should have led it to dispose of tobey first amendment claim as well.for just last term,the supreme court held that,notwithstanding the first amendment general prohibition against retaliatory arrests,the more specific right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable cause is not clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,reasoning that any inference of impermissible causation is severely undermined by the existence of probable cause.reichle.at majority opinion.
the same conclusion applies here the causation element of tobey first amendment claim is undermined,if not vitiated,by the fact that defendants actions were reasonable under the fourth amendment.in light of reichle,then,it was not clearly established that these same actions violated the first amendment.
the majority responds by pointing to tobey allegation that defendants actions were not supported by probable cause.see ante at.the problem with this argument is that neither tobey nor the majority cites a single case holding that probable cause is the relevant standard governing the decision by an official who does not have arresting authority,such as a tsa agent,to refer someone to another official who does.and any confusion regarding the appropriate fourth amendment standard only bolsters the conclusion that defendants alleged constitutional violation was not clearly established.for the majority to hold otherwise,it must ignore conflicting precedents and expect lay tsa agents to have imposed on the spot a degree of coherence on first and fourth amendment jurisprudence that has eluded serious students of constitutional law.qualified immunity exists to forestall precisely this result.
unable to muster a single case so much as suggesting that defendants conduct was either unreasonable or impermissibly based on viewpoint,the majority instead attempts to find clearly established law in abstract principles snatched from disparate areas of first amendment doctrine.first,the majority appears to embrace tobey pronouncement that individuals possess first amendment rights at airports.see ante at citing bd.of airport comm rs jews for jesus,d.of course they do.but that lofty proposition is not at issue in this case.the question,rather,is how these rights apply in the special context of security screening.by woodenly invoking any first amendment precedent that happens to involve an airport,tobey and the majority ignore the fact that this case concerns not the airport in general,but the area in particular,as well as the pressing security concerns that are uniquely relevant there.the supreme court airport cases simply do not speak to this special context and thus could not have given defendants notice that their response to tobey conduct may have been unconstitutional.
second,the majority cites spence washington,d per curiam,for the proposition that the first amendment protects bizarre behavior.ante at.that is not what spence said.rather,spence held that what might otherwise seem like bizarre behavior may in fact be protected symbolic speech where a n intent to convey a particularized message was present,and where in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.spence,at.even when these conditions are met,however,the government may,consistent with the first amendment,reasonably respond to any separately identifiable conduct in which the speaker engages.cohen california,d.that was the case here.tobey did not simply wear a bearing his message,but rather engaged in the separately identifiable conduct of removing his shirt and pants.as noted earlier,tobey own complaint makes clear that it was this conduct that provoked defendants response.moreover,spence had absolutely nothing to do with airport security screening.it concerned the display,from an apartment window,of an american flag with an appended peace symbol,and to claim it provided specific guidance in the wholly different context here is an acrobatic leap that my friends in the majority should have the prudence to resist.
the majority attempts to mitigate the injustice of its ruling by noting that defendants still might receive such immunity at the stage.see ante at.small consolation that.the multiple admonitions that fall on deaf ears today hardly assure a receptive audience tomorrow.among those admonitions are the supreme court repeated instructions that qualified immunity is an immunity from suit,not just damages,and that it must therefore be recognized before the considerable costs of litigation accumulate.see,hunter bryant,d per curiam siegert gilley,d mitchell forsyth,d.whatever the eventual outcome of this suit might be,defendants are left to suffer the immediate consequences,the very consequences that any immunity,to be effective,is designed to alleviate.
tobey suit fails for another,independent reason,and in rejecting this reason,the majority manages to flout a second body of supreme court precedent.in a recent line of decisions,the court has held that a plaintiff must allege enough factual content in his complaint to render his legal claim for relief plausible on its face in order to survive a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.iqbal,at bell atl.twombly,d.tobey complaint falls well short of this requirement,for it conclusorily asserts that defendants engaged in viewpoint discrimination without pleading so much as a single factual allegation that supports this conclusion.in short,by announcing a rule that every complaint survives a motion to dismiss,the majority proceeds as if twombly and iqbal were purely advisory.
the rules of pleading assume particular importance in the context of a damages action against a public official,especially one alleging that the official acted with an impermissible motive.as the supreme court explained even before iqbal,b ecause an official st
