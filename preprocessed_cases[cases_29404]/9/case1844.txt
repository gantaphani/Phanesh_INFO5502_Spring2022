in,michael anthony dilworth was a pretrial detainee at north carolina new hanover county detention facility.while awaiting trial,dilworth spent a total of days in disciplinary segregation as punishment for two disciplinary infractions,one arising from an altercation with another prisoner and one from an altercation with correctional officers.dilworth was not afforded a hearing in connection with either of his placements in disciplinary segregation.
dilworth sued various detention facility officials under,arguing that the imposition of disciplinary segregation without a hearing violated his procedural due process rights.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,reasoning that due process requirements were satisfied by dilworth opportunity to file a written appeal after he was placed in disciplinary segregation.we disagree,and hold that as a pretrial detainee,dilworth was entitled to a hearing before he was punished.as the defendants concede,no such hearing was afforded,and we therefore direct that judgment be entered for dilworth on his due process claim.
dilworth also raised an excessive force claim against the two officers involved in his second fracas.again,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,on the ground that the record showed the officers had acted in good faith and without a culpable state of mind.as the parties agree,a subsequent supreme court decision has made clear that excessive force claims by pretrial detainees are governed by an objective standard,rather than the subjective one applied by the district court.accordingly,we remand for consideration of dilworth excessive force claim under the proper standard.
dilworth was held in the new hanover county detention facility as a pretrial detainee.a pretrial detainee is someone who has been charged with a crime in dilworth case,failing to appear in court as ordered but not yet tried.though dilworth had not been adjudged guilty of any crime,he could be detained pending trial in order to ensure his presence at that proceeding.see bell wolfish.
during his pretrial detention,at on the afternoon of may,dilworth was involved in a physical fight with another inmate.officer charles thomas,the supervising guard,immediately placed the unit on lockdown while he summoned assistance.less than an hour later,at,thomas filed an inmate disciplinary report describing the incident and stating that he had taken the disciplinary action of placing dilworth in segregation for days.by,the watch commander on duty,lieutenant robert johnson,had reviewed and approved that penalty.
dilworth maintained that he had been disciplined in error,as he was not the aggressor in the fight but had only protected himself.on may,he filed a written appeal pursuant to the detention facility disciplinary procedures.on may,two days later and twelve days after dilworth initial placement in segregation,administrative review officer fales dismissed the appeal,finding that a videotape of the incident did not make clear who started the fight or how.dilworth ultimately was released from segregation on june.at no point during his time in disciplinary segregation was dilworth afforded a hearing.
shortly after his release,dilworth was involved in a second altercation,this one involving officers cookson and trott.the incident ended with cookson using physical force to restrain dilworth,throw ing multiple knee spears to his legs and multiple punches to his head,and with trott assist ing cookson in taking dilworth to the floor.internal quotation marks omitted.how the incident began is disputed according to the officers,force was required because dilworth refused to comply with orders and resisted an effort to handcuff him according to dilworth,cookson rushed him after the two exchanged verbal insults.this incident,too,was captured on video tape,but although dilworth requested the video in a motion for production of documents filed with the district court,there is no indication that the tape was turned over to dilworth or viewed by the district court.
again,dilworth was placed in disciplinary segregation for days.again,no hearing was provided.within five hours of the july,fight,trott had filed an inmate disciplinary report calling for days in segregation as a disciplinary action,and lieutenant johnson had reviewed and approved the sanction.dilworth once more contested his sanction,and this time,he filed a grievance seeking a hearing at which he suggested he would present witnesses supporting his account of events.and dilworth again filed a written appeal of the disciplinary action,which was again dismissed by fales,who emphatically rejected the request for a hearing i am not required to recommend a disciplinary hearing if grounds for such do not exist.emphasis in original.dilworth served the entirety of his day sentence.
in november,dilworth filed this pro se action under.he alleges,first,that detention facility officials including johnson and fales violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by failing to provide adequate procedural safeguards and,particularly,a hearing in connection with his two disciplinary sanctions.second,dilworth claims that cookson and trott used excessive force against him,also in violation of the fourteenth amendment.
the defendants moved for summary judgment on both claims,and the district court granted their motion.as to procedural due process,the district court held that because dilworth was a pretrial detainee,he could not be placed in segregation as a punishment for a disciplinary infraction without due process.internal quotation marks omitted.due process was satisfied here,the district court reasoned,because dilworth was provided with notice of the charges against him and permitted to file a written appeal of his disciplinary sanction.on that basis,the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants.
on dilworth excessive force claim,the district court applied a subjective standard,holding that dilworth was required to establish that officers cookson and trott had used force maliciously and sadistically to cause harm,rather than in a effort to maintain discipline.internal quotation marks omitted.because no reasonable juror could find that the officers had a sufficiently culpable state of mind,the district court concluded,the defendants were entitled to summary judgment.internal quotation marks omitted.
dilworth timely appealed.
we review a district court award of summary judgment de novo.jehovah clarke,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if no material facts are disputed and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.henry purnell,cir.en banc quoting ausherman bank of am,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin with dilworth contention that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to the defendants on his procedural due process claim.the due process question presents two related but distinct inquiries whether dilworth placement in disciplinary segregation implicated a liberty interest triggering procedural due process requirements and,if so,whether the procedures afforded dilworth satisfied those requirements.see wolff mcdonnell,applying procedural due process analysis to denial of prisoner credits slezak evatt,cir.applying procedural due process analysis to prison classification system.we hold that the disciplinary actions taken against dilworth necessitated compliance with procedural due process standards,and further hold that those standards were not satisfied here.
at the first step of the procedural due process inquiry,we must determine whether dilworth placement in disciplinary segregation implicates a protected liberty interest and thus warrants procedural safeguards.see sandin conner.the district court answered that question in the affirmative,holding that pretrial detainees like dilworth may not be placed in disciplinary segregation without due process.on this point,we agree with the district court.
by definition,pretrial detainees have not been convicted of the crimes with which they are charged.for that reason,the supreme court held in bell wolfish,they retain a liberty interest in
