on appeal,the eeoc argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the magistrate judge improperly reviewed the sufficiency of the eeoc investigation rather than whether there was an investigation.we agree.under title vii,courts may review whether the eeoc conducted an investigation,but not the sufficiency of an investigation.the eeoc conducted an investigation in this case.accordingly,we vacate the district court summary judgment order and remand the case for further proceedings.
