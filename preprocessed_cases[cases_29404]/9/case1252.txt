background 
this is an employment discrimination case.dawn dawson,a lesbian female,who does not conform to gender norms in that she does not meet stereotyped expectations of femininity and may be perceived as more masculine than a stereotypical woman,claims that she suffered discrimination on the basis of sex,sex stereotyping,sexual orientation in violation of federal,state,and municipal law.see title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law et new york city human rights law nychrl,admin.code,title.dawson former employer,bumble bumble,describes itself as a prestigious,hair salon in manhattan,known for its innovative hair cutting techniques.
dawson was hired by bumble bumble in early as a hair assistant.dawson describes the duties of this position as including assisting hair stylists in all aspects of their jobs,keeping their work areas in the salon clean,escorting clients to different areas of the salon,shampooing clients hair,and clients hair.
in addition to her duties as a hair assistant,dawson was simultaneously enrolled in bumble bumble training program for hair stylists.as described by bumble bumble,the program is a rigorous one 
an assistant must successfully complete,in succession,the salon basic class,the basic scissor class,the basic razor class and spend some time in the advanced razor class.
assistants in the basic cutting and razor classes are required to bring four models to each class.during class,the assistants practice consultation skills with each model and shampoo,cut and their models hair.an assistant models must have the right kind of hair in terms of length,texture and style for the particular haircut on which the assistant is working,or the assistant will not be able to successfully perform the required haircut.assistants must also properly use bumble haircutting techniques when performing the four haircuts.in order to move beyond the salon basic cutting class,assistants must complete to the satisfaction of their teachers four different haircuts the bob,the graduated bob,long layers and short layers and demonstrate positive attitudes during their classes.
dawson alleges in her complaint that she was confident that she would be able to graduate from the hair assistant training program to a stylist in an expedited fashion.we do not see,however,that dawson disputes bumble bumble contention that o nly about of the total number of assistants at the salon at any given time typically complete the educational program and that it generally takes these successful candidates at least two and sometimes three years to complete the program.
the district court observed that the bumble bumble salon is an unconventional workplace,a heterogenous environment that strives for the avant garde and extols the unconventional.dawson bumble bumble,d.the district court also found that the salon employees embody many lifestyles and sexual preferences and reflect varying physical appearances,overall looks,and different manners of hair,dress and clothing.id.at.bumble bumble itself contends that i f there is a norm for bumble employees,it is the norm of.thus,bumble bumble asserts that the salon regularly employs sexually individuals,including a transsexual,an openly bisexual education coordinator,numerous other openly gay employees,and both male and female gay employees,including lesbian employees with very androgynous looks.the district court found it to be particularly significant that connie voines,the manager of the salon and the individual who ultimately decided to terminate dawson,is a transsexual who at the time of the events in question,was transitioning from appearing male to appearing female.dawson,d at.
dawson does not seriously contest the depiction of the bumble bumble salon as an environment in which conformance to gender norms was something less than a prerequisite for continued employment.when asked at her deposition if the salon employed nonconformists other than herself,dawson replied it like,you know,i do think hairdressers are conformists anyway,so i would say the whole lot of them.further,dawson testified that she was not at all reticent about her lesbianism while working at the salon,but rather discussed my life like anybody else would discuss their life and you know and i was hidden about who i was.dawson also stated that she was a willing participant in the banter that took place among the salon employees,and that she would sometimes refer to herself as a dyke.more generally,she stated that lesbian jokes were brought up and you know,i like myself,i happy,so if this is light and funny,i with that.
the issue on which the parties disagree sharply is the quality of dawson performance as a hair assistant and as a participant in bumble bumble training program.dawson alleges in her complaint that her work was consistently praised by connie voines by other stylists,and clients and that several individuals who evaluated her work progress in the training program gave her positive feedback.
dawson was terminated on july.according to bumble bumble,dawson firing was the result of poor performance on the job and in the training program 
dawson performance at the salon was erratic sometimes she performed well and with an enthusiastic attitude other times,she did not.over time,her performance on the salon floor and in the educational program declined until it was unacceptable.for example,dawson performance in the basic cutting class was inadequate to advance to basic razor.
dawson also demonstrated significant performance deficiencies on the salon floor.several clients complained that she had been rude or abrupt with them or rough with their than with any other assistant.similarly,several stylists complained that she was hostile or disrespectful.
by,the level of dissatisfaction with dawson work had become extreme.in june,ralph formisano,a senior stylist,registered serious complaints to voines about dawson performance as his assistant.formisano complained that he frequently could not find dawson when he needed assistance with his clients,and that she was disrespectful and rude to him and his clients.
voines spoke to dawson and gave her a last chance.she assigned dawson to assist stylists nancy morandi and sharon morrissey.soon thereafter,morandi registered complaints similar to formisano.indeed,dawson was so unhelpful that morandi informed voines that she did not want to work with dawson any longer,even if that meant working with no assistant at all.
appellee br.at internal citations omitted.
dawson contends,however,that her failure to advance in bumble bumble training program and her termination are the result of discriminatory animus.as to the training program,dawson alleges that it was repeatedly made clear to her that females rarely attained the position of hair stylist.specifically,dawson asserts that on one occasion when she asked voines to place her in an editorial styling class,voines stated,how many women do you see doing editorial they only want men with accents.dawson also points to an affidavit from amy strober,another hair assistant,in which strober states that when she asked to be assigned to a styling class,voines said,do you know how many famous female editorial stylists there are there is one.
with respect to her work on the salon floor as a hair assistant,dawson alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment in that s he was constantly harassed about her appearance,that she did not conform to the image of women,and that she should act in a manner less like a man and more like a woman.dawson alleges that a range of invective was directed at her by fellow bumble bumble employees two stylists,howard mclaren and raymond mclaren,repeatedly referred to her in front of colleagues and clients,by the name donald a stylist named ralph formisano once stated that she was wearing her sexuality like a costume,implying that she did not conform to gender norms and appeared to be a lesbian and a fellow hair assistant named deniz uzunoglu once loudly proclaimed to her,in extremely vulgar and threatening terms,that he thought she needed to have sex with a man.
in addition,dawson asserts that the mclarens stated to educators in bumble education department that they wanted to fire her because of her dyke attitude.finally,dawson alleges that her termination took place as follows 
on or about july,voines informed dawson that she was terminated because she seemed unhappy and because of the way she dressed and wore her hair.when dawson asked for clarification,voines stated that she could not send her to new jersey or any place outside new york city.she added,people wo understand you you frighten them.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,granted bumble bumble motion for summary judgment with respect to all of dawson title vii,nyshrl,and nychrl claims.it held that dawson could not assert a claim for discrimination based on sexual orientation because such claims are not cognizable under title vii,dawson,d at,and although they are cognizable under nyshrl and nychrl,the evidence was insufficient to establish that dawson suffered intentional discrimination based on her sexual orientation,id.at even assuming that sex stereotyping may give rise to a sex discrimination action,dawson claims of sex stereotyping derive not from gender stereotypes,but rather from stereotypes based on sexual orientation,and thus are not cognizable under title vii,id.at no reasonable jury could conclude that bumble denial of advancement opportunities to dawson or her termination were motivated by intentional discrimination based on her gender,and bumble proffered reasons for its decision were not pretextual,id.at and the incidents of sexual harassment that dawson alleged were not sufficiently severe or pervasive as to constitute a hostile or abusive work environment under title vii,id.at.on appeal,dawson challenges each of these grounds for granting summary judgment.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.jetter knothe,cir.the analysis according to which we consider whether dawson has raised a triable issue of fact with respect to her claims under title vii is 
in order to survive a motion for summary judgment,a title vii plaintiff must satisfy a test.see mcdonnell douglas green,d reeves sanderson plumbing,d.ordinarily,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he is a member of a protected class he is competent to perform the job or is performing his duties satisfactorily he suffered an adverse employment decision or action and the decision or action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination based on his membership in the protected class.see farias instructional,cir.if the plaintiff succeeds,a presumption of discrimination arises and the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse decision or action.id.if the defendant proffers such a reason,the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case drops out of the analysis,and the defendant will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff can point to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination.james racing ass n,cir.the plaintiff must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons but were a pretext for discrimination.reeves,at.
mario p c food markets,cir.this analysis is also applicable to dawson claims under the nyshrl and the nychrl.see weinstock columbia,cir.we first consider whether dawson has brought any claim cognizable under title vii that raises a triable issue of material fact 
title vii termination claim.
as already noted,dawson defines herself in her complaint as a lesbian female,who does not conform to gender norms in that she does not meet stereotyped expectations of femininity and may be perceived as more masculine than a stereotypical woman.in her brief on this appeal,dawson further explains that she is in three distinct,but somewhat interrelated protected classes because she is a woman,she does not conform to gender norms in that she appears more like a man than a woman,and she is gay.the district court,however,observed that because the borders between these classes are so imprecise,it is not eviden t exactly what conduct by bumble dawson claims as the gravamen of the claims she asserts on sex or gender grounds,as opposed to what actions she bases on sexual orientation or sexual stereotyping.dawson,d at.the district court further opined that 
dawson claims of sexual discrimination,as she articulates them in the complaint and elaborates in her deposition,possess a somewhat protean quality,such that it is hard to grasp or pinpoint precisely what conduct she accuses of offending whatever behavioral norms she asserts govern the circumstances.at various times in her pleadings and testimony,she asserts that she was disparately treated because of the way she looked,because she was a woman,because she was not a man,because she was a lesbian,because she was a lesbian who did not conform to gender norms.
we find ourselves in full agreement with these assertions.both in her complaint and in her briefing on this appeal,dawson has significantly conflated her claims.as a result,it is often difficult to discern when dawson is alleging that the various adverse employment actions allegedly visited upon her by bumble bumble were motivated by animus toward her gender,her appearance,her sexual orientation,or some combination of these.the following excerpt from her deposition testimony,in which dawson states the reasons why she believed she had been terminated,is indicative of the problem 
because of the way i look m y visual presence was not acceptable.and the constant remarks about me being a lesbian made it clear that they were none too happy with that.
i s it fair to say that one of the things you saying is that you believe you were discriminated against because of your sexual orientation 
q is it fair to state that another thing that you complaining about in this action is that you were discriminated against because you a lesbian who looks a certain way 
such confusion as to the sources of the discriminatory animus allegedly visited upon dawson complicates her claims under title vii because t he law is in this circuit and in all others to have reached the question that title vii does not prohibit harassment or discrimination because of sexual orientation.simonton runyon,cir.thus,to the extent that she is alleging discrimination based upon her lesbianism,dawson can not satisfy the first element of a prima facie case under title vii because the statute does not recognize homosexuals as a protected class.
realizing that discrimination based upon sexual orientation is not actionable under title vii,dawson avails herself of the gender stereotyping theory of title vii liability according to which individuals who fail or refuse to comply with socially accepted gender roles are members of a protected class.as will be considered in more detail below,this theory rests upon the premise that in enacting title vii congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.price waterhouse hopkins,d internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,s ex stereotyping by an employer based on a person gender behavior is impermissible discrimination.smith city of salem,ohio,cir.that is,individual employees who face adverse employment actions as a result of their employer animus toward their exhibition of behavior considered to be stereotypically inappropriate for their gender may have a claim under title vii.
when utilized by an avowedly homosexual plaintiff,however,gender stereotyping claims can easily present problems for an adjudicator.this is for the simple reason that s tereotypical notions about how men and women should behave will often necessarily blur into ideas about heterosexuality and homosexuality.howell north cent,d.like other courts,we have therefore recognized that a gender stereotyping claim should not be used to bootstrap protection for sexual orientation into title vii.simonton,at.see also lex larson,employment discrimination ed.it is not uncommon for plaintiffs to fall short in their title vii pursuits because courts find their arguments to be sexual orientation or other unprotected allegations masquerading as gender stereotyping claims.kristin bovalino,how the effeminate male can maximize his odds of winning title vii litigation,syracuse,counseling gay plaintiffs bringing claims under title vii to emphasize the gender stereotyping theory and any connection the discrimination has to homosexuality.
the point is well illustrated in simonton.that case involved a male postal worker whose homosexuality was known to his fellow employees.simonton complaint alleged that he was subjected to an abusive and hostile work environment by reason of his sexual orientation.the abuse he allegedly endured was so severe that he ultimately suffered a heart attack.at.after holding that title vii did not outlaw discriminatory treatment based upon animus toward homosexuals,id.at,we next considered the plaintiff assertion of a gender stereotyping claim.we declined to reach the merits of this claim,however,because 
simonton has failed to plead sufficient facts for our consideration of the issue.we do not have sufficient allegations before us to decide simonton claims based on stereotyping because we have no basis in the record to surmise that simonton behaved in a stereotypically feminine manner and that the harassment he endured was,in fact,based on his with gender norms instead of his sexual orientation in the circumstances,we think the wisest course is to defer consideration of the merits of such an argument to another case in which it comes to us after being properly pled and presented to the district court.

similarly,district courts in this circuit have repeatedly rejected attempts by homosexual plaintiffs to assert employment discrimination claims based upon allegations involving sexual orientation by crafting the claim as arising from discrimination based upon gender stereotypes.see martin new york state dep t of corr,d,the torment endured by martin t he,the lewd conduct and the posting of profane pictures and graffiti are all of a sexual,not gender,nature.samborski west valley nuclear,wl,at june,stating in dicta that although being called a lesbian may be based not on a perception of true sexual orientation,but rather as a means of denigrating a person because of sexual stereotype,plaintiff gender stereotyping claim is somewhat undermined to the extent that it rests upon being called a lesbian trigg new york city transit,wl,at july,rejecting gender stereotyping claim because plaintiff amended complaint is rife with references to sexual orientation,homophobia,and accusations of discrimination based on homosexuality,aff without opinion.cir kay independence blue cross,wl,at.may,holding that gay male plaintiff has shown that he was subjected to adverse treatment because of his perceptions that he was a miss prissy or less than a real man.as such,there is affirmative evidence that the harassment was related to perceptions about kay masculinity,rendering the conduct gender stereotyping actionable under title vii.heller columbia edgewater country club,d,lesbian plaintiff stated title vii claim by alleging discrimination based upon her failure to conform to supervisor stereotype of how a woman ought to behave.heller is attracted to and dates other women,whereas cagle believes that a woman should be attracted to and date only men.
with these cases in mind,we proceed to consider our recent decision in back hastings on hudson union free school district,cir.in that case,we reviewed a district court grant of summary judgment to a public school district that contended that it had denied tenure to a school psychologist because of her poor job performance.the psychologist asserted,however,that the real reason she was let go was that the defendants presumed that she,as a young mother,would not continue to demonstrate the necessary devotion to her job,and indeed that she could not maintain such devotion while at the same time being a good mother.id.at.we thus noted that the case presented the question of whether stereotyping about the qualities of mothers is a form of gender discrimination.id 
we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to the school district and found instead that the school psychologist had raised a sufficient issue of issue of fact as to whether her tenure denial was the result of her superiors belief that a woman could not be both a good mother to young children and a dedicated school psychologist.we noted allegations of a range of comments indicative of this belief,including allegations that her superiors 
wondered whether my apparent commitment to my job was an act.they stated that once i obtained tenure,i would not show the same level of commitment i had shown because i had little ones at home.they expressed concerns about my child care arrangements,though these had never caused me conflict with school assignments.
back claims that in march,brennan and wishnie reiterated that her job was not for a mother,that they were worried her performance was just an act until i got tenure,and that because i was a young mother,i would not continue my commitment to the work place.on april,brennan and wishnie purportedly repeated the same concerns about her ability to balance work and family,and told back that they would recommend that she not be granted tenure they reportedly also stated they wanted another year to assess the child care situation.
in considering whether comments such as these were sufficient to make out a title vii claim,we relied upon the supreme court decision in price waterhouse.in that case,a female accountant who had been denied promotion to partnership drew attention to the fact that employment evaluations completed by her superiors were rife with criticisms of her tendency to act in what was seen as a masculine manner.thus,it was suggested that she overcompensated for being a woman by acting in a macho fashion,and that she should walk more femininely,talk more femininely,dress more femininely,wear,have her hair styled,and wear jewelry.at.the court held that this might amount to impermissible discrimination because an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman can not be aggressive,or that she must not be,has acted on the basis of gender,in a manner that might violate title vii.id.at.the court explained that 
we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group,for in forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex,congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.an employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible catch out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they do not.title vii lifts women out of this bind.
id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in back,we similarly concluded that the school psychologist had sufficiently alleged that she had also been placed in a catch situation because her superiors adherence to a stereotypical perception as to how a mother of young children should behave preclu
