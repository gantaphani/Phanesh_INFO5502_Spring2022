defendant deborah brown appeals from a conviction,entered in district court for the northern district of new york mordue,for mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the united states department of health and human services hhs.she argues that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge against a black venire member on the basis of race,in violation of batson kentucky,d.in the alternative,she contends that the prosecutor contravened batson principles,and those of subsequent cases,by basing that same challenge on the prospective juror religion.she did not raise this latter claim during jury selection,as she was required to do,and it is therefore subject to plain error review.with respect to defendant batson claim,we affirm,since she has not shown that the prosecutor explanation was pretextual.with respect to the defendant batson claim,we affirm,because she has not demonstrated plain error.

the batson objection and response 
during jury selection prior to trial,the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge against one of three in the venire.brown trial counsel made a timely batson challenge,asserting that the prosecutor had impermissibly struck the potential juror on the basis of her race.the prosecutor did not explicitly concede that the defense had made a prima facie showing of discrimination,but he did offer a race neutral explanation.he stated that the potential juror in question,a diane underwood,explained to the jury that she very active in local and i guess regional church.he went on to note that o ne of mattie brown supporters who is going to be here through the trial i guess was identified by her as someone that she knows from meetings,and i just feel that that connection would subtlely or unsubtlely bias her in favor of the defendants and so that my basis for my objection to her.
the prosecutor proffered reason related in part to an exchange between the court and underwood,which occurred earlier during voir dire.the relevant portion follows 
court okay.all right.can you think of anything i should ask you that has not been asked 
underwood i wanted people that are in here today,in the back,are they a part of this 
underwood i a member of the churches of god in christ jurisdiction number a nd the elder back there,i do know him personally,but i know he an elder in that jurisdiction.
court okay.now is that going to affect your ability to serve,be a fair juror 
underwood oh,no.
court i do know if he going to testify or not,but,you know of him.
underwood i know that he attends,he an elder there,i do know him personally.
court all right.thank you 
after the prosecutor gave his initial explanation for striking familiarity with this church counsel responded by observing that she unequivocally stated it would have any effect on how she would be as a juror in this case.the prosecutor then offered a second reason for the strike underwood avid participation in church affairs.underwood had told the court that in her spare time,she liked to g o to church.and during the prosecutor own questioning of the venire members,underwood had explained that she traveled twice a year from syracuse to rochester for state meeting s,and had indicated that she also attended national meetings in memphis.based on these responses,the prosecutor said 
i also find that,also just for the purposes of making a record,juror number,miss saliba,i striking her in part because she married to a pastor and my general feeling as a prosecutor,that people who are very active in church groups sometimes find it very difficult to judge others and so i think my strike of miss underwood is consistent with my other strike.
upon hearing this second reason,the district court interjected that the book of john contains the admonition let not you who sinned cast the first stone,something like that.neither lawyer responded to the district court citation of scripture,nor did defense counsel object to this second reason for striking underwood.instead,he continued to focus on the first reason,arguing that she never indicated that she knew the pastor and that she recovered herself very well by stating she would have no trouble being impartial.the prosecutor responded to these arguments by returning to underwood church activities again,i not challenging her for cause.i go to church with a number of ladies like underwood and saliba and they wonderful women.if i had an illness in the family,they be the first person i call on the phone that does mean i want them to sit on a criminal jury.
at that stage,the district court overruled defense counsel batson challenge,concluding that the prosecutor had laid a sufficient basis for why he exercised that peremptory.neither the court nor defense counsel ever directly addressed the prosecutor explanation regarding the venire member participation in church affairs.thus,while defense counsel had raised a batson challenge during jury challenge which was ultimately never offered a batson challenge.
in a motion for a judgment of acquittal a new trial,defendant mattie brown reasserted her batson claim,and,for the first time,offered a batson objection as well.deborah brown also filed motion papers,but did not raise any batson claim.during oral argument on the motions,however,defense counsel for deborah brown made several arguments in connection with the batson challenge.three are worth some discussion.
first,deborah brown asserted that the government had no factual basis for concluding that the man recognized by underwood was actually a supporter of mattie or deborah brown.her defense counsel surmised during oral argument that the prosecutor must have assumed a connection between the pastor and the defendants because all three of them were black.the prosecutor responded by observing that one of the assistant attorneys in our office is a man of color from the utica area who recognized him as a pastor from that area and i do think it is unreasonable to assume that a pastor from the utica area who shows up in the audience may be a supporter.the judge indicated that he had drawn a similar inference i was under the impression that he was also there as a supporter of mattie brown.
second,defense counsel argued that the prosecutor concerns about underwood involvement in her church were simply an afterthought,and therefore pretextual.the prosecutor insisted that he had stricken the juror for both reasons,and had offered the additional reason to show that he was not singling out black venire members,but rather treating all potential jurors equally.
third,deborah brown counsel stated that batson and its progeny do not permit the use of peremptory challenges to strike venire members because of their religious beliefs,and that underwood had been impermissibly struck on the basis of her religion.the government responded by noting that defense counsel had failed to raise a batson challenge during jury selection,and hence that any inquiry on review must apply plain error review.moreover,according to the government,because the second circuit had never conclusively decided the issue,the error in question could not possibly have been plain.defense counsel,in response,asserted that the trial court had prevented the defendants from fully articulating their batson discharging the browns from their obligation to object.
the decision below 
the district court rejected both the race and batson challenges and denied the motions.first,judge mordue concluded that he had correctly followed the prescribed inquiry when the challenge was raised that is,he had determined that defendants had not carried their burden of showing intentional racial discrimination and allocated credibility to the prosecutor explanation finding it to be sufficient.he also found that the record demonstrate d that defense counsel had ample opportunity to speak before the court ruled.finally,after finding that no relevant objection had been made at trial,the court applied a plain error standard to the challenge.in a footnote,the court concluded that,b ecause the law is unclear on whether peremptory strikes are proper,any failure by the court to sustain defendant objection on the basis of religion could not be plain error.
discussion 
on appeal,we are presented with two questions.first,did the prosecutor exercise a peremptory challenge against a black venire member on account of her race second,did the court below commit plain error in upholding the prosecutor exercise of that same strike,when it was explicitly based,at least in part,on the venire member participation in religious activities we consider each of these questions in turn.
defendant objection 
in batson,the supreme court set forth a test to determine whether a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.first,the defendant must establish a prima facie case of discrimination.second,the prosecutor must offer an explanation for the strike that is,on its face.third,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried her burden of proving that the government proffered reason was pretextual,and that the strike was indeed motivated by purposeful discrimination.at.
whether or not the defendant properly established a prima facie case is not before us,because o nce a prosecutor has offered a explanation and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination,both of which occurred in this case,the preliminary issue becomes moot.hernandez new york,d.moreover,it is clear that the prosecutor offered reasons for exercising the challenge that were at least facially,in satisfaction of the second prong.thus,the critical question here is whether the reason or reasons given by the government were pretextual.and the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with the opponent of the strike.purkett elem,d.
although deborah brown did not raise the batson challenge in her motions papers,the government does not argue on appeal that she failed to preserve this particular objection as a consequence,we review the trial court disposition of her claim under the standard we normally apply in batson cases.once a trial judge finds that a prosecutor has exercised his peremptory challenges without discriminatory intent,that finding may not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.united states franklyn,cir.this is so in large part because a court determination will often turn on the judge observations of prospective jurors and the attorneys during voir dire and an assessment of their credibility.mccrory henderson,cir see also barnes anderson,cir the credibility of an attorney offering a explanation is at the very heart of that analysis.
brown argues that both of the prosecutor proffered reasons for the strike were pretextual,and that the district court finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.the defendant characterizes the prosecutor reference to underwood religious activities as an afterthought.on her view,the prosecutor identified the venire member familiarity with the pastor seated in the courtroom as the basis for my objection to her,and only when challenged did he supplement that explanation with a second reason based on her participation in church affairs.this alone,according to brown,is enough to establish pretext.moreover,she asserts,the prosecutor did not strike two white venire members with expressed ties to their who sang in a church choir and one whose wife ran a church daycare center.
we are not convinced.the prosecutor immediately gave his second reason as an elaboration on his original one.hence,the trial judge could readily have read it as an alternative rationale,rather than as an afterthought.moreover,even though the prosecutor did not strike two churchgoers,he did strike a white woman,the wife of a pastor,because her answers reflected avid participation in church activities.under a clearly erroneous standard,we can not conclude that the prosecutor was incapable of distinguishing between people with more,from those with less,of a connection to their churches.and we certainly can not say that the district court clearly erred in finding that the prosecutor had done just that 
we therefore affirm its ruling that the striking of underwood was and.
defendant objection 
standard of review 
the defendant also challenges the prosecutor peremptory strike on the grounds that it was impermissibly based on the venire member religion.she argues that the prosecutor intentionally removed underwood from the panel because of her affiliation with a christian church,and that doing so violated batson 
in answer,the government first points out that brown did not make a batson objection during jury selection.it adds that her failure to do so prior to completion of the voir dire constitutes forfeiture of the right,absent extraordinary circumstances.see franklyn,at a lawyer must challenge an adversary use of peremptory challenges before the completion of jury selection,in part so that the court can i contemporaneously assess the adversary conduct and ii remedy any improper conduct without having to repeat the jury selection process.emphasis added see also mccrory,at holding same.
the defendant disputes forfeiture,asserting that her trial counsel raised a general batson objection,that he gave the court an opportunity to cure the error,and that any further objection would have been fruitless we disagree.defendant attempts to make her challenge encompass her religion based claim do not avail.her trial counsel was obligated to state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection,and to do so at the time.see galarza keane,cir a party must raise his or her batson challenges in a manner that would allow a trial court to remedy the problem at trial see also united states indiviglio,cir specific instructions are required to give the judge an opportunity to correct the error and thus to avoid the necessity of further proceedings.this he did not do while brown counsel explicitly leveled a charge of racial discrimination during jury selection,he failed to object or even to respond to the prosecutor explanation based on the venire member religious affiliation.
it follows that brown can not show,with respect to the religion issue,that the trial court had been clearly apprised of the possibility of error and had disagreed,or had been given an opportunity to correct the error and had declined to do so.fogarty near ins.brokerage,cir.as a general rule,when a litigant has failed to lodge a timely objection,we may still consider her appellate arguments,but we will do so under a plain error review standard.see,united states nelson,f orfeiture,or failure timely to assert a right,permits appellate review for plain error under.b.rule b provides a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.b.
it is not clear,however,from our recent cases,whether an unpreserved batson objection permits appellate court review for plain error.the answer to this question turns on how we characterize the untimely challenge is it waived or forfeited intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted extinguishes an error and obviates plain error review.forfeiture the failure to make the timely assertion of a right,not.see united states kon,cir.in mccrory,both words are used,which appears to leave open the question and no other case in this circuit resolves the matter none has applied plain error review in this context,and none has foreclosed such review,although cases do tend to adopt the waiver terminology.a majority of other circuits,however,review untimely batson objections for plain error.see,united states stafford,cir applying plain error review in a case similar to this see also hidalgo fagen,cir failure to raise batson objection in trial court results in appellate court review for plain error gov t of forte,cir w e may notice on appeal the use of the peremptories as plain error under rule b.but see james bowersox,cir noting in dicta that plain error review does not apply to untimely batson challenges.
despite the waiver language in our recent cases,we believe that forfeiture is the more appropriate label brown certainly failed timely to object,but it is not apparent from the record that she intentionally relinquished a known right.ultimately,however,we need not determine whether plain error review obtains in batson cases generally,or in this case specifically.for the government agrees that plain error review is proper here,thereby relinquishing the argument that brown has waived,as opposed to forfeited,her objection.see atkins new york city,cir noting that litigants can waive the waiver point.there is,therefore,no question that we review defendant batson objection for plain error.
plain error 
to establish plain error,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting olano,at.if these three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.quoting olano,at.internal quotations marks and citations omitted see united states gore,cir deploying olano test.
in the batson context,it is normally the case that the only complicated question is whether the second prong is is,whether the error at issue is plain.for if we decide that the district court approval of a challenge based on religion is error under the first prong,the third and fourth prongs of the olano test are also generally met.the asserted right in question is that to equal protection of the laws,and the remedy for a violation is reversal.there is therefore usually little question that any batson error we find would affect a defendant substantial rights the violation of which would result in manifest injustice.united states keppler,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for the same reason since no court can countenance a violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution any such error would seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
what then does it mean for an error to be plain the most obvious example of plain error is a trial court decision in direct contravention of governing case law.but it is not always necessary for the party alleging plain error to cite a circuit or supreme court precedent precisely on point.plain error review is considerably more flexible.
thus,a n error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.united states gordon,cir citing johnson,at.emphasis added,cert.denied,d.what is more,the plainness of the error can depend on legal principles as much as legal precedents.we can,in certain cases,notice plain error in the absence of direct precedent,or even where uniformity among the circuits,or among state courts,is lacking error is plain if it is so egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge and prosecutor derelict in permitting it,despite the defendant failure to object.gore,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also united states thomas,cir en banc quoting gore such instances will typically involve review of a potential constitutional error.see united states handakas,cir.we apply the plain error rule less rigidly when reviewing a potential constitutional error.quoting united states easter,cir,cert.denied,d.
moreover,we will be more inclined to deem an error plain where it is clear from the record that failure to object below was not the result of a strategic decision.bayless,at cir noting that a plain error finding is more likely where there is no possibility of strategic manipulation,but rather mere inadvertence or incompetence of trial counsel where failure to object below resulted in an incomplete record or inadequate findings,however,our review for plain error will be more rigorous.see mccrory,at noting the difficulty of reviewing peremptory strikes after the fact,given that challenges are often based on subtle,intangible impressions 
the current doctrine on challenges 
against this background,we turn to the current law on challenges as applied to the case before us.the supreme court has not yet passed on whether peremptory challenges are unconstitutional.see davis minnesota,d denying certiorari to appeal from minnesota supreme court decision declining to extend batson to religion.but see id.at.thomas,joined by scalia,dissenting indeed,given the court prior decisions,no principled reason immediately appears for declining to apply batson to any strike based on a classification that is accorded heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.nor has this court.in united states berger,cir,appellants argued that batson should logically apply to a challenge allegedly based on a juror religion.but after noting that the supreme court has not explicitly extended batson to peremptory challenges,and the lower courts are divided on the question,we concluded that we had no need to reach this question because the government had stricken the venire member for a familiarity with the dispute in the case.id.thus,berger expressly left the question open.
only one circuit has decided the issue on the merits.in united states dejesus,cir,the third circuit drew a distinction between a strike motivated by religious beliefs and one motivated by religious affiliation.without determining the permissibility of the latter,the court held that strikes based on beliefs are valid and proper.see also id.at accepting the government argument that the challenged venire members unusual amount of religious activity suggested strong religious beliefs,which could prevent them from convicting the defendant.the seventh circuit addressed the same question in united states stafford,cir,but did not resolve it because the court found no plain error.see id.stating in dicta that i t would be improper and perhaps unconstitutional to strike a juror on the basis of his being a catholic,a jew,a muslim,but it would be proper to strike him on the basis of a belief that would prevent him from basing his decision on the evidence and instructions,even if the belief had a religious backing 
state courts have not been unanimous in their disposition of this issue.since the supreme court decided,in alabama ex rel,d extending batson to gender,that batson is not confined to race,a few state courts have declared invalid strikes based on religious affiliation.see state purcell,holding that batson encompasses peremptory strikes grounded upon religious affiliation or membership state hodge,holding that batson extends to religion,but to the extent that the state attorney had excused a juror for certain views that could impair his ability to decide the case rather than simply religious affiliation,the peremptory challenge would stand people martin,th,d,dist same the texas court of criminal appeals,on the other hand,held that peremptory challenges are not constitutionally improper.in casarez state,the court subjected the use of such strikes to strict scrutiny,but found the state asserted interest in impartial juries compelling e xcluding prospective jurors on the basis of their religious affiliation does promote fairness and impartiality on the jury.and it does so without denigrating the dignity of any individual veniremembers.id.at.casarez built on an earlier,opinion by the minnesota supreme court,which similarly declined to extend batson to challenges based on religious affiliation.see state davis,i t is difficult to distinguish,in challenging a juror,between an impermissible bias on the basis of religious affiliation and a permissible explanation.
given the foregoing cases,the government argues that even a strike made strictly on the basis of religious affiliation i strike this venire member because she is christian or muslim,would not be plain error.because there is no specific supreme court or second circuit holding on point,the government says,that should be the end of the inquiry.but this view ignores the purposes,and the attendant flexibility,of plain error review.and,while there is no direct holding,nor uniformity across a range of other circuits,certain principles articulated in recent second circuit and supreme court cases,could nonetheless establish the plain constitutional infirmity of at least some types of peremptory challenges.
in united states nelson,decided after berger,we confronted the question of religious discrimination in jury selection,cir.in rejecting the validity of race and acts of the trial judge to ensure diverse representation on the noted that it is beyond peradventure that the racial and religious reconstruction of the jury that occurred in nelson could not constitutionally have been achieved at the instigation of the parties.id.at emphasis added.there can be no doubt,we stated,about the serious nature of the violation of equal protection that occurs when a person is excluded from a jury on the basis of his race or religion.id while the government is correct that these statements were dicta,they reflect important considerations that lie at the heart of batson and its progeny and offer guidance on the issue before us today.
first,the defendant has the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to criteria.batson,at.second,this maxim is not limited to discrimination on the basis of race.thus,in alabama,the supreme court held that the equal protection clause bars peremptory challenges based on gender,and strongly suggested a similar prohibition on strikes based on any other classification receiving heightened or strict scrutiny under the clause,d and it stated further that litigants and jurors have a general equal protection right to jury selection procedures that are free from group stereotypes rooted in,and reflective of,historical prejudice.id.at.third,such strikes are impermissible because we can not countenance unconstitutional prox ies for juror competence and impartiality.id.at.and the state mere assertion of a need to preserve fair and impartial juries will not save strikes based on group affiliation from invalidation.id.at.we shall not accept as a defense to peremptory challenges the very stereotype the law condemns.quoting powers ohio,d.
the supreme court has eloquently applied these principles in the race and gender contexts.we believe that they apply as plainly to jury selection based solely on a venire member religious affiliation.see overton newton,cir batson must be read as not only prohibiting certain specific actions,but also as creating a broad standard or principle that the courts must,in reason,follow.religion,like race and gender,is an impermissible consideration in government.diesel town of lewisboro,cir proscribing government employment decisions based on impermissible considerations such as race,or religion internal quotation marks omitted see also united states armstrong,d t he decision whether to prosecute may not be based on an unjustifiable standard such as race,religion,or other arbitrary classification.internal quotation marks omitted.and religious classifications,concededly,trigger strict scrutiny.see friedman rogers,d indicating that such scrutiny applies to classifications drawn upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race,religion,or alienage see also of the presiding bishop of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints amos,d 
exercising peremptory strikes simply because a venire member affiliates herself with a certain religion is therefore a form of group stereotype rooted in,and reflective of,historical prejudice,at.such strikes,like those based on race and gender,cause harm to the litigants,the community,and the individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from participation in the judicial process.id.at.that harm flows directly from the government participation in the perpetuation of these invidious group stereotypes and the inevitable loss of confidence in our judicial system that discrimination in the courtroom engenders.id.
in nelson,we noted in dicta our clear belief,shaped by the foregoing principles,that parties can not be permitted to strike a juror simply based on his religion.we reaffirm that here.thus,if a prosecutor,when challenged,said that he had stricken a juror because she was muslim,or catholic,or evangelical,upholding such a strike would be error.moreover,such an error would be plain.given the relevant principles,as stated in batson and,it would be sufficiently obvious,and given the stakes,sufficiently egregious,to meet the second prong of the olano test.
the reason given for the peremptory challenge in this case,however,is not so simple.it is far from clear what the prosecutor meant by people very active in church groups.nor can we immediately discern his rationale for inferring that such people have trouble judging others.what is clear is that,like saliba,the wife of a pastor who also suggested that she was deeply involved in the work of her church,underwood stood out from other venire members because of her religious activities,not her membership in a christian congregation.the prosecutor focus on activism,rather than belief or affiliation,is reflected in his decision not to strike at least two other venire members who identified themselves as christians,but did not express the same degree of participation in religious activities.
differentiating among prospective jurors on the basis of their activities does not plainly implicate the same unconstitutional proxies as distinctions based solely on religious identity.the prosecutor may well have believed that people active in church groups engage in charitable pursuits,public service activities,and support groups.thus,he described underwood and saliba,during jury selection,as the first people i call on the phone if i had an illness in the family.and he might well have thought that these good works,in turn,would likely increase their sympathy for people in distress,including criminal defendants.
this may be a dubious inference,but that does not make it an unconstitutional one.avid participation in secular charitable enterprises can give rise to the same inference that individuals who devote themselves to aiding the alienated elements of our society,for whatever reason,are more likely to be sympathetic to defendants.as a result,one would expect a prosecutor,who held such a view,to strike the religious activist in one case,while in the next case,and on the same assumption,to strike a secular activist.consider the analogous case in which a prosecutor strikes a black community organizer who is committed to various social causes,including racial justice,on the ground that such organizers often have or develop strong opinions on issues relevant to the trial at hand.if the court determines that the prosecutor would,for the same reason,strike a white community organizer committed to the same causes,then the peremptory challenge is not based on a batson suspect ground.united states thomas,cir support for the notion that there was purposeful discrimination in the peremptory challenge may lie in the similarity between the characteristics of jurors struck and jurors accepted.where the principal difference between them is race or,in the instant case,religion,the credibility of the prosecutor explanation is much weakened.internal quotation marks omitted.we can not,in view of this,conclude that permitting the striking of a religious activist was,without more,plainly erroneous,if erroneous at all.
of course,the possibility remains that the prosecutor was primarily driven by the assumption that particularly active churchgoers are more likely to hold certain religious beliefs.but we can not say that it was plain error to conclude that he was not.we can not do so,in part,because of the defendant failure to raise any objection based on religion to the prosecutor explanation.indee
