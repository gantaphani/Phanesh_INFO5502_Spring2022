frank ruggiero alleges that he was subjected to excessive force by corrections officers on multiple occasions during his incarceration at orange county correctional facility occf.he did not file a formal grievance as to any of these incidents.ruggiero filed this action alleging constitutional violations while he was confined at the willard drug treatment campus willard for violating his parole.the united states district court for the southern district of new york stephen robinson,judge granted motion for summary judgment on the basis that ruggiero had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act,stat.plra or the act.ruggiero argues on appeal that this requirement did not apply to him because,when he filed his complaint,he was not a prisoner in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility.a.ruggiero argues further that,even if he was required to exhaust,his failure to do so is excused because he reported his mistreatment during an interview with investigators looking into an assault on another inmate and he was not provided in a timely fashion with the inmate handbook that explains the grievance procedures at occf.
background 
ruggiero describes several incidents in which he says correctional officers at occf employed excessive force against him between june and may.at a point soon after the june incident,he hired counsel to represent him.
in the course of investigating an august incident involving an altercation between ruggiero and another inmate,officers from the sheriff department interviewed ruggiero in september.ruggiero told these officers about some of the mistreatment he complains about in this case,and the officers asked him if he would like to be placed in protective custody.ruggiero tentatively declined the offer,informing the officers that he wanted to consult his attorney before deciding.
after talking to his attorney,ruggiero accepted the officers offer to transfer him to another part of occf.instead of a transfer within occf,ruggiero was transferred to riker island.he unsuccessfully opposed this transfer by seeking an injunction against the transfer in state court,alleging that the transfer was a retaliatory act for his complaints about mistreatment to the investigators.ruggiero alleges that,upon his return to occf about a month later,he was subjected to further harassment,threats,and mistreatment.
there is no dispute that,at all relevant times,there was an inmate grievance procedure in place at occf and that ruggiero never filed a grievance related to any of the mistreatment of which he complains.the inmate grievance procedure is contained in the inmate handbook that is provided to each inmate upon arrival at occf.despite signing a form indicating his receipt of an inmate handbook on five separate occasions from august until october,ruggiero claims that he was not provided with a copy of the handbook until march.
in may,ruggiero was released on parole from occf,but in october,he violated his parole and was confined to willard,a secure drug treatment facility,where he remained until march.while at willard,ruggiero filed the complaint in this suit.
the district court granted summary judgment to based on ruggiero failure to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the plra.ruggiero county of orange,d.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,anderson recore,cir,affirming when,construing all evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
in,as part of the plra,congress enacted a provision intended to invigorate the exhaustion prescription for prisoners.porter nussle,d.section of the plra,a,provides that 
n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
this exhaustion requirement applies to claims such as ruggiero as well as other complaints about general conditions of prison life.porter,at.at the time of the alleged abuses claimed by ruggiero,this circuit did not require exhaustion of claims related to single instances of mistreatment.nussle willette,cir,rev,porter nussle,d.but in february porter made it clear that claims such as ruggiero were subject to the exhaustion requirement.ruggiero complaint was filed a year later.
whether exhaustion is required for one who is confined at a drug treatment facility 
on appeal,ruggiero does not contest either that he was a prisoner as defined in or that he was confined at willard when he filed his complaint.he argues,however,that willard does not qualify as any jail,prison,or other correctional facility because drug treatment centers are expressly exempt from the definition of correctional facility under new york state law.
section of new york correction law defines a correctional facility as including a ny place operated by the department of corrections and designated by the commissioner as a place for the confinement of persons under sentence of imprisonment.correct.law a.only mental institutions are excluded from this broad definition.id.b.section specifies that the definitions contained within it apply throughout new york correction law unless expressly stated.id.so under section,it is not at all clear that willard would not qualify as a correctional facility according to new york law.
ruggiero,however,points to section c in article of new york correction law,which provides that drug treatment campuses are exempt from the definition of correctional facility.id.c.article governs the establishment of correctional facilities,the commitment of individuals to the department of corrections,and the custody of inmates.id.to.for these purposes,it is understandable that new york would want to differentiate between various types of facilities.but it does not necessarily follow that the exclusion is applicable to the entirety of new york correction law.as noted,section explicitly states that its definitions apply throughout the correction law absent an express statement to the contrary.and because section,at least arguably,can not reach more broadly than the article in which it is contained,ruggiero contention based on that provision that willard is not a correctional facility under new york law is open to question.however,for this appeal we will assume that under new york state law willard is not a correctional facility.
turning to federal law,section of the plra does not define what is meant by any jail,prison,or other correctional facility.we have no inclination,however,to look to new york state law for this meaning.there is no indication that congress intended state law to govern the question or that the plra exhaustion requirement should vary from state to state.the act is intended to eliminate unwarranted interference with the administration of prisons,woodford ngo,d,to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits,porter,at,and to afford corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case,id.at.these overarching goals are universal they do not change from state to state.nor do they logically depend on how particular facilities are characterized under various state laws.the definitions of correctional facility under different state laws are unrelated to the purposes underlying the plra and therefore do not determine whether the exhaustion requirement applies in any given institution.
two other courts of appeals have read the phrase any jail,prison,or other correctional facility in expansively.see witzke femal,cir alexander boyd,cir.in witzke,the seventh circuit,faced with our question,whether a prisoner confined at a drug treatment facility was required to exhaust administrative remedies,answered it in the affirmative for reasons we find persuasive.in setting out the various types of institutions that trigger the exhaustion requirement,congress did not specify a narrow list of instituti
