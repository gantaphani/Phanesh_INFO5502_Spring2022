williams expulsion from the center did not interfere with his right to freedom of movement.
williams argues that his expulsion from the center violated his right under the fourteenth amendment to be free from a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.in order to establish a due process violation of this nature,williams must show that he has a liberty interest which has been interfered with by the state and that the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were not constitutionally sufficient.kentucky dep t of corrections thompson,d internal citations omitted see also shakur selsky,cir.liberty interests may arise from two due process clause itself and the laws of the states.thompson,at.quoting hewitt helms,d.williams maintains that he has a liberty interest arising from the first due process engage in intrastate travel and free movement in support of his position,williams relies principally on ramos town of vernon,a case involving a challenge to a curfew ordinance,in which this court observed that t he right to intrastate travel,or what we sometimes will refer to as the right to free movement,has been recognized in this circuit,cir.williams urges that this right to free movement includes the right to gain admittance to the center.when the town expelled and barred him from the center,it did so,in williams view,without providing adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard.
