background 
until it closed its doors in july,beechwood restorative care center was a skilled nursing facility operated by a partnership between olive chambery and her son brook.like all new york nursing homes,beechwood was regulated jointly by doh and hcfa.
in,brook chambery and doh began clashing over regulatory matters.when doh denied beechwood application to add two beds in,chambery challenged the denial in an article petition doh backed down and requested that the proceedings be dismissed.when doh identified two deficiencies in the course of surveys of the beechwood premises in,chambery challenged the deficiencies in an informal dispute resolution process afforded by federal regulation doh backed down and the deficiencies were withdrawn.beechwood restorative care center leeds,d.in november,three more deficiencies were alleged by doh,one of which was withdrawn after chambery lodged a challenge.id.in,chambery commenced an article proceeding challenging doh procedures for the transfer and discharge of residents from nursing homes the proceeding was ultimately resolved by a consent order in march.id.at.according to the chamberys,this pattern of challenged deficiencies continued through,escalating in frequency and seriousness.id.at.
beginning in,chambery opened a new front.as the district court characterized it,chambery began sending a voluminous series of letters and other papers to doh and other state officials protesting various aspects of doh policies and practices,and advocating a number of changes.id.at.thus,from through,chambery engaged in a campaign with doh to either enforce or eliminate a requirement that nursing home operators sign medicaid access agreements in order to make major changes to their facilities.id.at internal quotation omitted.chambery contended that this requirement was onerous and unnecessary,and that it conferred competitive advantage on operators who signed the agreements without intending to comply.id.at.
in early,surveys of beechwood conducted by doh identified new deficiencies,classified at the more serious,a pattern of violations constituting immediate jeopardy to residents.doh recommended to hcfa that beechwood be terminated as a medicare and medicaic provider unless those deficiencies were removed within eighteen days.new surveys,conducted by doh on may,and again on june,identified no deficiency,but charged deficiencies at the,actual harm with potential for more than minimal harm,though no immediate jeopardy.doh later notified the partnership that hcfa was prepared to terminate beechwood as a processor of medicare and hcfa ultimately did.for its part,doh commenced an administrative hearing on june,to consider whether to revoke the facility operating document required to operate a nursing home under new york law.see spiegel whalen.
the thrust of the complaint in this action is that all these measures were taken by doh to humiliate the chamberys and ruin their business as punishment for chambery exercise of his first amendment right to stand up to the regulators,challenge them in proceedings,and criticize their requirements and procedures.
an administrative law judge alj conducted an evidentiary hearing on doh claim that the partnership operating certificate should be revoked,and issued a report upholding most of the charges,finding that 
beechwood neglected some residents in several significant aspects of care,such as failing to notify a resident physician of significant changes in the resident condition.
beechwood had failed to timely notify a resident physician regarding a potentially serious or life threatening illness 
beechwood failed to fulfill its obligation to provide appropriate care and monitoring for a particular resident,and that the record wa s devoid of documentation as to the last hours of the resident life 
beechwood failed to take adequate measures to prevent or treat some residents pressure sores.
one beechwood resident was subjected,without any reasonable explanation,to an indwelling catheter in place for almost days instead of beechwood following a physician order of to days.
beechwood took insufficient steps to safeguard residents who were at risk of falling.
a number of beechwood residents were not provided adequate pain control,and in several instances physicians orders were not carried out.
the alj rejected beechwood allegations of improper motive,finding that doh took numerous steps in its attempt to keep beechwood open beechwood failed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by doh to rectify the problems with the facility and the plans of correction submitted by beechwood to doh consisted in large part of denials of events that were found,attacks on the messengers surveyors and a barrage of information not relevant or consequential to the cited deficiencies,while in fact no correction was taking place.the alj emphatically rejected beechwood allegations of regulatory bias or ill will.
consistent with the recommendation of the alj,doh issued an order revoking chambery operating certificate and imposing a penalty.
the chamberys inquired of doh as to how beechwood could be transferred as a nursing home to a third party,a transaction which would require transfer of the establishment approval that gives the medical facility the right to exist.spiegel,at.doh general counsel appellee henry greenberg responded in a february,letter to beechwood lawyer,advising that since the operating certificate of beechwood has been revoked and the facility closed,there was no establishment approval to be transferred,and noting that any potential buyer who wished to use the premises as a nursing home would be required to go through the normal authorization procedures for such facilities,but advising that such authorization was unlikely at that time.id.at.the beechwood property found no buyer,entered foreclosure,and was sold at public auction in march.
the complaint in this action,served thereafter,named seventeen doh defendants and two federal hcfa defendants,and alleged,inter alia i section claims for first amendment retaliation and denial of equal protection,based on the revocation of beechwood operating certificate ii a section claim for denial of procedural due process,asserting that doh annulled beechwood establishment approval without the required notice and opportunity for hearing and iii a bivens claim against the hcfa defendants.id.at.the district court dismissed all claims on summary judgment.id.at.appellants appeal the grant of summary judgment as to the first amendment,equal protection,and due process claims 
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants.see anthony city of new york,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and appellees are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
first amendment retaliation 
appellants principally claim that doh,in retaliation for brook chambery many complaints,protests,and lawsuits,conducted repeated surveys of beechwood,trumped up allegations of deficiencies,and enlisted the help of hcfa officials,all culminating in the revocation of the chamberys operating certificate and that this violated appellants right against retaliation for speech protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.
to survive summary judgment on a section first amendment retaliation claim a plaintiff must demonstrate that he engaged in protected speech,and that the speech was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse decision taken by the defendant.see hynes squillace,cir.it is undisputed that brook chambery complaints,protests,and lawsuits are protected speech.franco kelly,cir describing right to petition government for redress of grievances as guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments.the district court ruled that the claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel because in the state administrative hearing concerning doh request to revoke the chamberys operating certificate,the alj considered and rejected the partnership arguments that doh was driven by an improper motive.see beechwood,at.in the alternative,the district court ruled that appellants failed to produce sufficient evidence of any improper motive.id.at.we disagree on both grounds.
issue preclusion 
in a section action,the preclusive effect of state administrative findings is governed by new york law.kosakow new rochelle radiology,cir.under new york law,a prior decision has preclusive effect as to any issue that inter alia both was necessarily decided in the first action,and is decisive in the later action.see jeffreys griffin,kaufman eli lilly,see also town of deerfield fcc,cir.
the alj finding that doh was unbiased was made as part of an evaluation of doh credibility.that decided necessarily by the be decisive of the present case,which requires a showing of bias.
appellants concede that the alj necessarily decided the sufficiency of the state evidence of violations.sufficiency on that score,however,does not defeat beechwood present claim,because a plaintiff can prove first amendment retaliation even if the measures taken by the state were otherwise justified.see,leather eyck,cir denying summary judgment on first amendment selective prosecution claim where plaintiff was convicted of underlying offense see also waters churchill,d plurality op.denying summary judgment where defendants would have been justified in firing plaintiff for certain statements but there remained a question as to defendants actual motivation cornell coop.extension,cir denying summary judgment where employer could have terminated plaintiffs on account of disruptiveness of speech but there was a material issue as to whether,even if such disruption occurred,plaintiffs were in fact not dismissed because of the disruption,but because of the content of their speech.
the issue of bias was considered and decided by the alj,who found beechwood claim of a conspiracy to be a total,complete and ridiculous fabrication without a shred of evidence or support.but the issue was considered in the context of the partnership challenge to the credibility of doh personnel.in so doing,did the alj decide the issue necessarily 
this is a showing that the state,as proponent of collateral estoppel,has the burden to make,jeffreys griffin,and must clearly establish,colon coughlin,cir.
an issue that is necessarily decided must have been both actually decided as it was here and necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits which is not so clear at all.see leather,at wilder thomas,cir.we are not persuaded that the alj discussion and rejection of the partnership allegations of improper doh motives was necessary in that sense.the decisive issue before the alj was whether beechwood has demonstrated a pattern of poor resident care,as well as a failure to take corrective action.the alj conscientious discussion of motive concerns the credibility of evidence presented by doh and while that may have impacted the alj findings of violations,the state has not shown to us that the alj credibility findings were so influential as to be actually decisive of the ultimate question concerning the quality of resident care the charges against the partnership might have been sustainable even if they were animated by bias and retaliation.the state,which shoulders the burden on this point,has made no showing as to the scope of the alj jurisdiction,or as to whether a finding of improper motive or adverse credibility would have made a the alj ultimate determination.we therefore conclude that issue preclusion does not bar litigation of the first amendment retaliation claim.
relying on scott coughlin,cir which held that an agency is entitled to summary judgment on a first amendment retaliation claim if it can show that it would have taken exactly the same action absent the improper motive doh argues that the surveys undertaken,the deficiencies found,and the resulting revocation of the operating certificate,were statutorily required.however,even if the surveys were mandated,and even if the state must commence revocation proceedings once it has determined that certain classes of deficiencies exist,pub.health law,the identification,characterization,and classification of the actual deficiencies found are within the state discretion,and are therefore subject to a claim of improper motive.
merits doh officials 
beechwood produced sufficient evidence of retaliatory motive to survive summary judgment.suspect close sequence of protest and circumstantial evidence,along with evidence that the offensive was.but much of this circumstantial evidence is likewise consistent with a zealous adversarial posture arising from the regulatory mission.see blue koren,cir granting summary judgment where plaintiff produced no direct evidence of retaliatory motive.among the other evidence cited by the partnership is the reaction of two doh administrators to the news that the federal government would revoke beechwood provider agreement they rejoiced with exclamations of amen hallelujah and hot diggity dawg followed by exclamation marks.a sense of triumph and satisfaction could,however,be as consistent with a job well done as with an improper motive.
there is direct evidence,however,that the state hostile pursuit of the partnership was motivated by an intent to punish the partnership for exercising first amendment rights of speech and petition rather than distinctly in addition antagonism that arises between a regulator and the regulated a relationship easily inflamed by difficult personalities.one affidavit related a statement by a doh surveyor admitting that the partnership troubles with doh were caused by brook chambery previous lawsuits against doh and sanford rubin doh regional director,and that doh and rubin were going to get chambery for it.another affidavit recounted an exchange at a conference in which a doh deputy director lamented that the closing of beechwood was a horrible situation that i hope to never go through again.we had to close that facility for all the wrong reasons.a gloating from defendant rubin to doh personnel is fairly explicit a nother advantage on our side is that hcfa claims it will back us all the way they too have been harassed by chambery.the chickens are coming home to roost.
this is evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that the doh was campaigning against the partnership as retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights.we therefore vacate and remand as to the first amendment claim 
merits hfca officials 
as to defendants kelly and daniel,the federal hcfa appellees,there is insufficient evidence.a federal actor may be subject to section liability where there is evidence that the federal actor was engaged in a conspiracy with state defendants,see,kletschka driver,cir.in this case,beechwood points to evidence that kelly and daniel were supportive of doh effort to revoke the operating certificate,and were invested more generally in the effort to shut down beechwood.there is the from state defendant rubin that hcfa will back us all the way,as well as one side of an correspondence in which state defendant leeds states w e have been working with hcfa on this one and hcfa has
