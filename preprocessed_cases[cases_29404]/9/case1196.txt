don juan britt,a state prisoner incarcerated at the sing sing correctional facility in ossining,new york,brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against various new york state department of correctional services and correctional facility officials.he alleged that the defendants violated his rights under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution by failing to protect him from assaults by other inmates.britt further alleged that the defendants conspired to violate his civil rights.he also asserted several claims.the case proceeded to trial,and a jury found glenn goord and william connolly liable to britt for conspiracy to violate his civil rights under and for negligence under new york law.the jury assessed both compensatory and punitive damages against goord and connolly.
subsequently,the district court lawrence mckenna,judge granted goord and connolly motion to dismiss britt negligence claim.the court also ordered a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.the court denied goord and connolly renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,however,rejecting their claim of qualified immunity and their contention that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for the jury to find them liable to britt under section.
goord and connolly now bring an interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on qualified immunity grounds.goord and connolly also urge us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the district court decision that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support liability under section.we conclude that we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal insofar as the appellants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of the jury answers to questions posed on a special verdict sheet,but we also conclude that the appellants argument is without merit.we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to decide the remainder of the appeal.we therefore affirm the district court order in part and dismiss the remainder of the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
background 
on october,while serving a state sentence for a felony conviction at sing sing correctional facility in ossining,new york,don juan britt was assaulted by another inmate,who slashed britt head,neck,and back.trial,at.he was rushed to agnes hospital,where he received multiple stitches to close his wounds.id.at.upon his return to sing sing,he was placed in protective custody but was allegedly attacked at least once more by another inmate.id.at.on december,britt prison cell was allegedly set on fire by a person or persons unknown.trial,at.
on march,britt,acting pro se,brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking compensation for his injuries.an amended complaint followed on april.
on april,after britt had obtained counsel,he filed a second amended complaint.in it,he alleged that the defendants had violated his eighth amendment rights by failing to protect him from assaults by other inmates.second am.compl.he also alleged that the defendants had conspired to violate his civil rights,id,and asserted several claims,id.subsequently,the district court dismissed britt claims against all defendants other than glenn goord,commissioner of corrections,william connolly,deputy superintendent of sing sing,and jacqueline hood,a corrections officer.see britt dep t of,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on april,the case proceeded to a jury trial against the three remaining defendants in their individual capacities on five of britt claims that the defendants were liable to him under for violating the eighth amendment under for conspiring to violate the eighth amendment under new york law for intentional infliction of emotional distress under new york law for negligence and under new york law on a theory of respondeat superior.
at the close of evidence,the district court dismissed britt respondeat superior claim.the defendants moved,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,for judgment as a matter of law on all of the plaintiff remaining claims,arguing that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support them.see trial,at.the district court reserved decision.see id.at.
on may,the jury returned a verdict in favor of hood on all claims,but found goord and connolly liable to britt under section and for negligence under new york law.the jury assessed compensatory damages against goord and connolly in the amounts of and,respectively,and punitive damages in the amounts of million and million,respectively.the jury decided in favor of goord and connolly on all other claims.

in a memorandum and order dated january,the district court dismissed britt negligence claim.britt connolly,civ,slip op.at,filed under seal.the court denied the remainder of the defendants motions except that for remittitur as to the jury punitive damages award.id.at.the court concluded that punitive damages should not exceed in the case of defendant goord and in the case of defendant connolly and ordered a new trial on the issue of punitive damages unless britt agreed to remit all punitive damages in excess of those amounts.id.at,when britt declined to do so,the district court ordered a new trial on that issue.
goord and connolly appeal from that portion of the district court order denying their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on qualified immunity grounds.goord and connolly also contend that we should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the district court decision that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to find them liable under section.
discussion 
denial of qualified immunitya.standard of review 
to the extent that we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court denial of qualified immunity,we review the district court decision de novo.palmer richards,cir.we apply the same standard in reviewing the district court denial that the district court was required to apply.provost city of newburgh,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.jarvis ford motor,cir.quoting.a,cert.denied,d.
qualified immunity doctrine 
the doctrine of qualified immunity offers protection for government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.mcclellan smith,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d alteration incorporated.
c.the appellants argument 
the appellants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of the jury answers to the first three questions posed by the special verdict sheet.in response to the question,with respect to plaintiff claim that each of the defendants violated his constitutional rights in connection with the october,assault,how do you find as to each defendant,for plaintiff or for the defendant,the jury found for all the defendants.verdict sheet,dated may,at.in response to the same question in connection with the december,fire,the jury also found for all the defendants.id.at.in response to the question,with respect to plaintiff claim that each of the defendants conspired to violate his constitutional rights,how do you find,for plaintiff or the defendant however,the jury found for the plaintiff against goord and connolly.id.at.
goord and connolly contend that because britt conspiracy claim under section is premised upon the same alleged constitutional injuries as his section claim,by answering in the negative when asked whether the defendants violated britt constitutional rights in connection with the october assault question one or the december fire question two,the jury found no injuries in this case.appellants br.at.they argue that the section verdict therefore can not stand as a matter of law because a finding of liability under section requires not only that a conspiracy exist but also that the conspiracy result in a constitutional deprivation or an injury,see and the jury here,they assert,found no such deprivation or injury.goord and connolly contend that they are therefore entitled to qualified immunity because the threshold question of the qualified immunity analysis whether the conduct of which the plaintiff complains violates federal law,see sadallah city of utica,cir was conclusively determined in their favor.appellants br.at.
before reaching the merits of the appellants argument,although britt has not raised the issue,we are obliged to assess whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.goldberg cablevision,cir.
appellate jurisdiction 
in general.because the district court has not yet entered a final judgment,this appeal is interlocutory.
ordinarily,only final judgments may be appealed under.but under the collateral order doctrine,interlocutory appeals may be taken from determinations of claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.
rohman city transit,cir quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d see also sira morton,cir citing,inter alia,mitchell.
not every collateral order denying a claim is immediately appealable,however.rohman,at.in johnson jones,d,the supreme court decided that a federal court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to decide an interlocutory appeal from a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity to the extent that the denial involves only a question of evidence sufficiency.id.at.the court noted that its determination in mitchell that a denial of qualified immunity could be considered an appealable final judgment rested upon the view that a claim of immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff claim.id.at.quoting mitchell,at.for this reason,the johnson court explained,the mitchell decision referred specifically to a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.id.at.quoting mitchell,at.emphasis added in johnson see also behrens pelletier,d noting that determinations of evidentiary sufficiency are not immediately appealable merely because they happen to arise in a case salim proulx,cir what we may not do is entertain an interlocutory appeal in which a defendant contends that the district court committed an error of law in ruling that the plaintiff evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue.in short,t o be appealable immediately,the denial must present a legal issue that can be decided with reference only to undisputed facts and in isolation from the remaining issues of the case,munafo metro.transp,cir quoting johnson,at,and must not pose the sufficiency question over which johnson made clear we have no interlocutory appellate jurisdiction.
appellate jurisdiction in this case.in deciding whether we have appellate jurisdiction,we note at the outset this appeal rather unusual procedural posture.
typically,an interlocutory appeal from a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity is brought after the district court denies the claim at the pleading stage,see,pena deprisco,cir,or upon denial of the defendant motion for summary judgment,based on the plaintiff,or an agreed upon,version of the facts,see,bizzarro miranda,cir.here,instead,the appellants appeal from a denial of their claim of qualified immunity.as the first circuit observed in a similar context,t his atypical history means that we are in the somewhat unusual position of considering the qualified immunity question when the case has already been tried.wilson city of boston,cir.to be sure,this unusual posture does not affect the viability of the qualified immunity defense.id.but the appellants do not make the arguments that are ordinarily the basis for a claim of qualified immunity,namely that the conduct attributed to them is not prohibited by federal law,that the plaintiff right not to be subjected to such conduct was not clearly established at the time of the conduct,or that the appellants actions were objectively legally reasonable in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time they were taken.see sadallah,at instead,they argue that the jury answers to the first two questions posed on the special verdict sheet render a finding of liability under section impermissible.this case is in that regard apparently unique 
nonetheless,insofar as the appellants argument raises a legal issue that can be decided with reference only to undisputed facts and in isolation from the remaining issues of the case,munafo,at quoting johnson,at,and does not raise the sufficiency question over which johnson ruled we have no interlocutory jurisdiction,we conclude that an interlocutory appeal here is appropriate and that we have appellate jurisdiction.the retrial of the case against the appellants as to punitive damages is pending.in johnson,the supreme court observed that one of the principal reasons for permitting an interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity in the summary judgment setting is to vindicate the defendant right,if he or she is entitled to such immunity,not to be subjected to a trial.t he mitchell court held that without immediate review,a summary judgment order denying qualified immunity to a defendant was,in a sense,effectively unreviewable,for review after trial would come too late to vindicate one important purpose of qualified immunity namely,protecting public officials,not simply from liability,but also from standing trial.johnson,at.quoting mitchell,at.in the case before us,although it is too late to protect the appellants from standing trial,it is not too late to vindicate their right,if they are entitled to immunity,not to undergo a second one on the issue of damages.
we conclude,however,that the appellants qualified immunity argument fails on the merits because the appellants read the jury verdict sheet without referring to the jury charge.it is a fundamental proposition that a jury is presumed to follow the instructions of the trial judge.united states pforzheimer,cir see also lnc,westminster bank,cir the district court instructions were quite clear and we must presume the jury to follow its instructions,cert.denied,d.
in its instructions to the jury regarding britt section claim,the district court explained that it must be prove n that as a result of the conspiracy,the plaintiff was either injured in his person or property or deprived of a right of a citizen of the united states.see trial,at the district court also stated that the third question on the verdict sheet pertained to this claim.see id.at.
we therefore presume that in finding the appellants liable to britt under section,the jury found that the evidence presented at trial demonstrated not only the existence of a conspiracy,but also that as a result of the conspiracy,the plaintiff was either injured or deprived of any right of a citizen of the united states.id.at.thus,the appellants argument that the jury answers to the first three questions on the verdict sheet establish that the jury concluded that there
