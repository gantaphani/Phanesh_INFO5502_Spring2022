background 
for purposes of matican appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we take his allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.jenkins city of new york,cir.
on the evening of september,matican purchased crack cocaine from a drug dealer he knew as mike,who had supplied him with drugs on a number of prior occasions.undercover nypd officers then arrested matican and took him to a precinct house in bayside,queens.while matican was in a holding cell,defendant zimmerman approached him and offered to make the arrest go away if matican would agree to help the officers arrest mike.matican was interested in the offer but expressed concern for his safety if mike made bail.matican testified that zimmerman responded,do worry,robert,we will look after you.we will protect you.matican agreed to cooperate based on zimmerman promise.
according to matican,zimmerman then instructed matican to arrange a drug buy with mike the following evening in front of the bayside jewish center,a frequent location for prior drug transactions between matican and mike.the police would be waiting with two cars and four officers in each car.when mike executed his customary illegal in front of the jewish center,matican would identify the car from the safety of a darkened athletic field across the street,and the police would pull over mike as if for a routine traffic stop.defendant schneider asked matican what quantity of drugs mike would be carrying when matican replied that mike would have or bags of crack,schneider replied,i f he has that many bags,he is not going to even make bail.after the plan was formulated,the officers released matican with a desk appearance ticket.
the following evening,matican met the officers at the prearranged location and paged mike to arrange a large drug buy.mike arrived and matican identified his car,as planned.according to matican,the officers then cut mike off with two police vehicles,pulled him from the driver seat,and pinned him against his car.the officers searched mike person and car,discovered drugs,and arrested him.matican remained hidden and unseen in the darkened field.
mike,whose real name was steven delvalle,was found to be in possession of bags of crack cocaine,two bags of marijuana,and about in cash.delvalle was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance,as well as various moving violations.a criminal check performed at the precinct revealed that delvalle had six prior arrests,including arrests for possession of a handgun and assault with a box cutter.on september,delvalle was released on bail.matican was not informed of delvalle arrest history,his release,or his real name,and he alleges that had he known these facts,he would have moved to california to live with his brother.
matican never contacted delvalle again after the sting operation.he acknowledges that he discussed his participation in the sting with his parents and a close friend,and that at least one other person knew about his role.on december,delvalle approached matican on a street in queens.delvalle said,you ratted me.why did you rat me he slashed matican face twice with a box cutter,then fled.delvalle was arrested several days later he eventually pled guilty to one count of attempted assault and one count of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance,and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
matican filed his suit in the eastern district in november,stating causes of action under and new york common law.defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted summary judgment on the claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.matican city of new york,d.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to matican,the nonmoving party,and drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in his favor.doro sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
matican asserted the following causes of action a claim under that the officers violated his right to substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment by failing to protect him from delvalle assault a claim against the city for failing to train its officers to protect confidential informants from harm and claims sounding in state law against all defendants asserting that the officers behaved negligently,and that the city is vicariously liable for their actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.
the first two claims depend on a single threshold question did the officers actions violate matican constitutional rights if they did not,then the city can not be liable to matican under,regardless of whether the officers acted pursuant to a municipal policy or custom.city of los angeles heller,d per curiam.furthermore,if matican has no valid claim under against any defendant,it is within the district court discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the pendent claims.see kolari new,cir citing c we therefore begin with the threshold question of whether the officers conduct infringed matican constitutional rights.
among the liberties protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is a right to be free from unjustified intrusions on personal security.ingraham wright,d.but in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d,the supreme court observed that nothing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.id.at.as a result,the court held that the clause generally confer s no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.id.at.
we have recognized two exceptions to this general principle,rooted in the supreme court analysis in deshaney.first,the state or its agents may owe a constitutional obligation to the victim of private violence if the state had a special relationship with the victim.see ying jing gan city of new york,cir citing deshaney,at.second,the state may owe such an obligation if its agents in some way had assisted in creating or increasing the danger to the victim.dwares city of new york,cir citing deshaney,at,overruled on other grounds by leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d.
even if matican claim falls within one of these two exceptions,and the officers behavior violated a constitutional obligation,matican faces a further hurdle he must show that the officers behavior was so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.county of sacramento lewis,d.this requirement screens out all but the most significant constitutional violations,lest the constitution be demoted to a font of tort law.see
