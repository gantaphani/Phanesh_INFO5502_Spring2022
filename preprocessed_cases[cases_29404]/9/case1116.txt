bernhard porzig seeks vacatur of a modified arbitration award.the award was the result of porzig success in an underlying arbitration proceeding in which porzig had alleged intentional age discrimination in violation of state and federal laws.on appeal,porzig asserts that the award he received for attorney fees was issued in manifest disregard of the law.we find that a portion of the award in this case was issued in violation of the federal arbitration act and that additional significant portions were issued in manifest disregard of the law based on the convergence of multiple factors implicating the integrity of the award.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court,and remand to that court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
porzig was hired as vice president of central bank sales by dresdner securities,a subsidiary of dresdner bank,in december.as a condition of his employment,porzig was required by the nasd,the industry organization,to sign and execute a standard form containing an agreement to arbitrate any future disputes.porzig agreed he would arbitrate any dispute,claim or controversy that may arise between himself and his firm that is required to be arbitrated under the rules,constitutions,or of the nasd.the nasd regularly required such agreements as a condition of employment.see id.at.according to this agreement,the arbitration was to be conducted in accordance with nasd code of arbitration procedure.
in january of,porzig was fired.initially,he filed an action against the defendants dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc and dresdner bank dresdner in the southern district of new york making a claim under the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.upon motion by dresdner,the district court stayed the action because the dispute was subject to the arbitration provisions of the agreement porzig had signed upon entering employment.thereafter,the parties submitted their dispute to a three member arbitration panel panel at the nasd.
the panel concluded that age was a factor in dresdners decision to terminate porzig employment.the panel awarded porzig in compensatory damages,plus of interest,and in punitive damages.contrary to statutory requirements the panel did not award porzig attorney fees or costs and,in fact,assessed against porzig in forum,filing,and arbitrators fees hereinafter the original award.
porzig appealed the original award to the southern district of new york,seeking a modification to provide him an award of attorney fees and costs and to vacate the panel assessment against him of the various fees.the district court jones,concluded the arbitrators had acted in manifest disregard of the law with respect to attorney fees,finding there had been ample evidence to support the conclusion that the arbitrators were made aware of the applicable law but either refused to apply it or ignored it altogether.the court remanded the case to the panel to determine the reasonable attorney fees to which porzig was entitled and to fashion a new award.although in its initial order the district court denied porzig motion to vacate or modify the award as to costs,it subsequently granted his motion when it reconsidered its decision on that point.concluding on the motion to reconsider that the arbitrators had in fact disregarded the law with respect to costs just as they did with respect to attorney fees,the court vacated the original award as to costs and instructed the panel also to modify the award and assess the in costs against defendants,not porzig.
on remand,porzig submitted to the panel a fee application that consisted of an attorney affirmation and a memorandum of law.the application included detailed billing records outlining each fee request delineated on a spreadsheet that set out the date of the service,a description of the service,the time spent,and the rate charged,documenting a total of in attorney fees and in costs.the billing records included entries for the representation attorney michael had provided before the district court successfully arguing porzig right to receive attorney fees and costs.porzig explicitly informed the panel that he was entitled to attorney fees to compensate him for the time his attorney spent preparing the fee application and for litigating the fee claim.in support of this position,he cited gagne maher,cir,aff on other grounds,d,which clearly states that attorneys are to be recompensed for time spent litigating attorney fees.
for their part,dresdner filed an affidavit in opposition to porzig fee application arguing contrary to law,see blanchard bergeron,d,that porzig contingency fee arrangement with should set the maximum limit on the amount porzig can recover under the statute.to that end,dresdner requested the panel require porzig to disclose the details of his fee agreement with his counsel to help the panel determine the new award.dresdner suggested,also contrary to law,see b hagelthorn kennecott,cir,that in circumstances such as porzig,an award of attorneys fees may be unnecessary to achieve the purposes of the statutory provision.they indicated to the panel that porzig attorney fee application should be substantially reduced,if not denied in its entirety.emphasis added.while dresdner did not specifically deny porzig accurate recitation of settled law establishing porzig right to collect fees and costs for the time spent litigating his right to those fees,dresdner statement that porzig contingency fee should set the maximum limit on his recovery clearly precludes fees expended to recover attorney fees.dresdner also requested reimbursement of in fees accrued in connection with the removed federal action porzig brought initially.porzig filed papers opposing that position.
in response to the parties motions,the panel issued an order requesting that provide the panel with copies of all fee agreements between him and porzig.porzig requested the panel reconsider that request or,at minimum,require dresdner counsel billing and expense records for comparison of fees.the panel denied both of porzig requests.porzig ultimately submitted the information regarding his fee contract with,which allowed percent of any recovery by settlement or otherwise and stated that porzig would be responsible for any expenses and disbursements which may be incurred,as well as a retainer fee.the affidavit submitted with the fee agreement concluded the attorney fees,costs,and net disbursements from his representation of porzig amounted to,plus the retainer fee,for a total of.
the panel issued its modified arbitration award hereinafter modified award on may.the modified award granted porzig application in part,ostensibly awarding for attorney fees and in costs.it stated 
defendants are jointly and severally liable for and shall pay to respondent counsel,the sum of for reasonable attorneys fees which sum includes interest from the date of the award of damages to respondent in the above matter,and an additional sum of,the reasonable amount of costs and disbursements,for a total amount of.
porzig counsel,shall remit to respondent porzig the sum of,which has represented as constituting all attorneys fees,costs,disbursements,and expenses retained by him out of the panel award,or otherwise paid to him by porzig.
porzig again appealed to the district court from that modified award,requesting the court vacate that award with respect to attorney fees and again remand the issue to the panel with instructions that it use the lodestar method of calculation to determine the reasonable fees,direct dresdner to submit evidence of their attorney billing and expense records,vacate the modified award with respect to its instruction to attorney to reimburse porzig paid contingency fee,and modify that award to ensure all forum,filing,and arbitrators fees and expenses are paid by defendants.the district court denied porzig motion,and porzig appealed to this court seeking essentially the same relief 
ii.analysis 
porzig argues principally that the modified award reflected once again the panel manifest disregard of the law.the dresdner defendants in turn contend that under the limited standard of review,there is no basis to vacate or modify the modified award.

this court has repeatedly recognized the strong deference appropriately due arbitral awards and the arbitral process,and has limited its review of arbitration awards in obeisance to that process,see,halligan jaffray,cir noting the strong judicial support of the use of arbitration as a device to resolve disputes.the value of arbitration lies in its efficiency and as a process for resolving disputes outside the courts,and its tendency to foster a less acrimonious process.see dirussa dean witter reynolds,cir national broadcasting,bear stearns,cir.to encourage and support the use of arbitration by consenting parties,this court,therefore,uses an extremely deferential standard of review for arbitral awards.see duferco,at.
a decision of an arbitrator,however,is not totally impervious to judicial review.the faa provides four statutory grounds for vacatur in situations that involve,generally,impropriety on the part of the arbitrators in addition,a court may vacate an award if it exhibits a manifest disregard of the law.goldman architectural iron,cir quoting dirussa,at.our review under the doctrine of manifest disregard of the law is highly deferential and such relief is appropriately rare.duferco,at.an arbitral award may be vacated for manifest disregard only where a petitioner can demonstrate both that the arbitrators knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether,and the law ignored by the arbitrators was,explicit,and clearly applicable to the case.wallace,at internal quotation marks omitted.

that said,in our review of this case we find several issues that cause us great concern.we examine them in more depth below,but,generally,the following factors cloud the presumption of validity of the award the district court concluded the original attorney fee award was issued in manifest disregard of the law and vacated the award the same panel on remand acted without authority with respect to a portion of the award porzig accurately explained to the arbitrators the controlling law with regard to attorney fees,while the defendants advanced several misstatements of law to the one on the very point of law on which the district court had found manifest disregard the panel did not explain how it came up with a fee award virtually identical to the contingent fee.taken individually,in all likelihood,such circumstances would not have overcome the deference owed to the panel award.taken together,however,these circumstances create,if not the perfect storm,then a disturbance ample enough to give us pause.upon careful reflection,and mindful of the importance that the arbitration process plays in dispute resolution today and the narrow lens through which we examine such awards,we conclude the award here was issued partially in violation of the enabling statute and partially in manifest disregard of law and must be vacated.
order to return fees to client 
the mere fact that an arbitral panel may have interactions with both a party and the party lawyer based on the lawyer representation of the client before the panel does not give the panel a long arm to exercise jurisdiction over the relationship.see at t,commc ns workers of,d arbitrators must not be allowed to impose obligations outside the contract quotation marks and citation omitted.a paramount question for reviewing courts is whether the arbitral panel has acted within the bounds of its authority.see concourse assocs.fishman,cir per curiam noting in collective bargaining context that the award must draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,since the arbitrator is not free merely to dispense his own brand of industrial justice internal quotation marks omitted local,drug,hospital,health care employees union brooks drug,cir the scope of authority of arbitrators generally depends on the intention of the parties to an arbitration,and is determined by the agreement or submission.quotation marks and citation omitted.the authority of the arbitral panel is established only through the contract between the parties who have subjected themselves to arbitration,and a panel may not exceed the power granted to it by the parties in the contract.see a banco de seguros del estado mutual marine office,cir see also brook peak int l,cir the power of arbitrators is dependent on the provisions under which the arbitrators were appointed.internal quotation marks omitted.the arbitrator is constrained foremost by this principle that a party can not be forced to arbitrate any dispute that it has not obligated itself,by contract,to submit to arbitration.see united steelworkers mead,cir.where the arbitrator goes beyond that agreement between consenting parties,it acts inherently without power,and an award ordered under such circumstances must be vacated.a.
porzig attorney was not before the arbitration panel in any manner other than as porzig counsel porzig was not before the panel with respect to his relationship with his attorney and neither porzig nor attorney had agreed to arbitrate a dispute,if in fact there was one,over their fee contract.the panel here was plainly without jurisdiction to order porzig lawyer to pay back to his client the specified contingency fee.that portion of the modified award must be vacated see a brooks drug,at.
reasonable attorney fees 
in ascertaining the amount of reasonable attorney fees to which a successful claimant is entitled,arbitration panels use the same fee calculation methods as the the lodestar analysis by which the decision maker considers all of the variables courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of the attorney fees.see arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood ass county of albany,see also hensley eckerhart,d discussing fee calculation blum stenson,d same.the presumptively reasonable fee analysis involves determining the reasonable hourly rate for each attorney and the reasonable number of hours expended,and multiplying the two figures together to obtain the presumptively reasonable fee award.see arbor hill,analyzing reasonable fee methodology fletcher,cir.courts are regularly called upon to conduct a reasonable fee analysis even though a lawyer may have taken the case on a contingent fee.see,blanchard bergeron,d luciano olsten,cir dominic consol.edison of new york,cir.generally when reviewing analyses of reasonable attorney fees,we have the benefit of being able to examine the methodology used by a district court to ensure that court applied the law correctly.while arbitral panels may,but are not required to,explain their reasoning,when the circumstances that exist in this case are,where a court has already taken the rare and extreme step of vacating the original award for being issued in manifest disregard of law,wh
