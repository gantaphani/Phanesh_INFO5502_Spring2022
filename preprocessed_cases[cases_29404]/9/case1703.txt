opinion of the court 
alvin rob emory brought suit against his longtime employer,astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp astrazeneca,alleging disability discrimination in the form of failure to promote and failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et.moving for summary judgment,astrazeneca urged that emory substantive claims of discrimination need not be addressed because emory,as a threshold matter,was not disabled under the ada.the district court agreed and granted astrazeneca motion on that basis.we disagree.because a proper analysis of emory claims shows that he has established,at the very least,a genuine issue of fact as to his impairments substantially limiting effect on his ability to perform manual tasks and learn,we will reverse and remand the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of astrazeneca.
background 
emory,who was born with cerebral palsy,has worked as a custodian at astrazeneca and its predecessor companies for more than years.he is the only employee at the newark,delaware plant,his assigned facility,who commenced working as a custodian and still holds that position more than years later.during the course of his employment,emory has applied for several permanent jobs with astrazeneca,but claims that,without accommodation,he has not been qualified for any of them because of his physical and mental impairments.appellant brief at.
among the physical impairments emory endures as a result of his cerebral palsy are permanent partial paralysis on his right side,and a right hand,arm and leg he describes as deformed.stephen rodgers,a board certified independent medical examiner and occupational and pain management specialist,recently evaluated emory and found that the percentages of permanent impairment are right upper and right lower.rodgers of,at.
as a child,emory was treated at the crippled children program of the alfred dupont institute of the nemours foundation,where he received physical,occupational,and speech therapy.the records reflect that emory used hand splints,as well as corrective shoes and braces throughout much of his childhood.as a schoolboy,his evaluating physician concluded that emory has difficulty with bilateral dressing skills such as lacing.on activities requiring unilateral skills,he is slow but can work independently.he is able to remove his clothing with a minimum of assistance but he is unable to put them on independently.functional eval.at.
though cerebral palsy left emory with some use of his right side,he can not lift anything heavy,or open and close his right thumb,which interferes with activities that involve the use of both hands as well those requiring gripping or dexterity.as a result,emory can not tie his shoes or a tie,roll his sleeves,close buttons,or put on a belt.in addition,among other tasks,he is unable to cut his fingernails or toenails,screw the top on a toothpaste tube,cut his own meat,open a jar,pull heavy dishes and pans in or out of the oven,change diapers,carry his children up the stairs,hold a pen or pencil in his right hand,or perform certain basic household chores and repairs.
to deal with the effects of these limitations,emory continued to receive treatment at nemours into adulthood,where he often discussed his employment and the obstacles faced there.for example,as memorialized by a therapist,he recounted his attempt at promotion in late 
rob stated that he understood his limitations in his trunk,hip,and forearm rotation were responsible for the difficulties he was experiencing at his last attempt at job promotion.he knew he could not do the work,but had refused to give up during the trial period he spent five days training for a new position but was denied the job.he said he fatigued considerably during each two hours of continuous lifting and rotating,resulting in decreased coordination,slowness,carelessness,forgetfulness,tripping,and fine motor incoordination.
dupont eval.at.the therapist concluded that i t was clear that his difficulty was with shoulder,forearm and wrist rotations as well as trunk and hip rotations which were impairing his ability to perform the task at the speed required.id.at.in all,emory bid unsuccessfully for approximately ten internal promotions over a period in many instances,his unaccommodated physical inabilities and limitations rendered him incapable of performing the jobs he sought.
in addition to these physical inabilities,emory also experiences mental limitations stemming from his cerebral palsy.as a result,he was placed in special education classes from an early age.he ultimately obtained a diploma from this track though,as a tenth grade student,emory word recognition and math skills were at a second grade level.in,also while a tenth grader,emory registered a full scale score of in,he registered a score of and most recently,in,emory scored a full scale of,placing him in the borderline range of intellectual performance and in the percentile of the general population.on a hopkins verbal learning test,emory showed a deficient learning curve.additional tests administered in revealed that in reading,arithmetic and spelling,emory tested at or below out of adults in his age group.id.at.
as have his physical impairments,emory claims that such mental limitations have hindered his advancement at astrazeneca.rather than reading test questions for himself,he needs to have the questions read aloud for him.even verbal instructions often leave emory confused.his quest to attain a mechanic position at astrazeneca is illustrative.in,emory first sought a mechanic position but was unable to pass the required bennett mechanical comprehensive test.he failed not only that year,but time and,and.mechanic test scores at.in,a doctor on emory behalf requested that he receive tutoring for the exam,that the exam be taken orally and extra time allotted.astrazeneca complied with only the second request to take the exam out loud.but even with oral recitation of the questions,emory again failed.
emory can not learn new skills from a training manual,rather,he must learn via a or combination visual and verbal approach,but still at a pace substantially slower than his colleagues.as observed of emory by an occupational therapist at the nemours foundation 
visual figure ground is moderately to severely impaired praxis motor planning,math computations,size and number estimations,he can not determine if bottles of a certain size fit into a specific box even after repeated trials,reading skills,visual memory,and auditory processing also seem below expectations,rob frequently does not hear what is being said to him several times he began speaking before the therapist finished talking and then did not respond to questions asked.
dupont eval.at.therefore,even a combined verbal and approach does not guarantee emory a successful learning experience.
notwithstanding the frequent professional frustrations wrought by his limitations,emory has,since adolescence,consistently endeavored to challenge himself and to participate in various civic and community activities.though he could not lift a gurney,climb a ladder to rescue someone,operate a fire hose without assistance,or on his own,emory became a volunteer firefighter as a teenager.he explained that the fire company did want to see a person that was willing to try fail.and they let me do what i was capable of doing.then i would ask for extra help as i needed.emory dep.at.emory also joined the shriners but,physically limited in his ability to march in sync with other members,instead developed a character incorporating his own impairments known as stumbles the clown who performs with the shriners circus.
as an adult,emory has volunteered to join a team responsible for mediating local disputes at the center for justice in wilmington,delaware he described the disputes as concerning family,friends and neighbors.id.at.and,most recently,emory,who was hired to perform cleaning work for the newark temple,formed rob cleaning service.he and his partner share cleaning duties and,besides the temple,have one other contract.
despite undertaking various other commitments,emory remained undeterred in his pursuit to advance at astrazeneca.after numerous failed attempts at advancement,in,he assumed a temporary role as acting second shift supervisor following the promotion of another employee.that assignment lasted almost two claims that,during that two year period,he was frequently criticized for math errors,spelling and grammar mistakes,and the length of time it took him to complete administrative tasks.when he asked his supervisors if he could use a calculator to add and subtract overtime and work hours and offered to buy it himself,he was refused on the ground that it would embarrass him because everyone should know basic subtraction and adding.emory dep.at.one of these same supervisors routinely referred to emory as rainman in reference to the autistic character in the movie by the same name.
yet still,in an effort to improve his performance in the second shift supervisor position,emory approached hr director hampel and asked for an assessment at sylvan learning center.he was refused.he later asked for and received from astrazeneca a block of time for easter seals computer training.his instructor at easter seals,phyllis gourdin,issued a report to astrazeneca with recommendations that software be installed on emory computer and that additional instruction on grammar,spelling and writing be afforded.no action was taken on these recommendations.following a reorganization of the maintenance department in,emory,who believed he was the to the job after having performed it for close to two years,was passed over for the permanent second shift supervisor position.
emory filed a joint charge of discrimination with the delaware department of labor ddol and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging violations of the ada and delaware handicapped persons act,et.the ddol investigated the charge and found that emory was a qualified individual with a disability under both federal and state law.emory later filed a complaint in the district court alleging discrimination in the form of failure to promote and failure to provide reasonable accommodations he claimed that he was disabled under the meaning of the ada because his impairment s have substantially limited him in the major life activities of walking,learning,and performing manual tasks 
district court proceedings 
in the district court,astrazeneca sought summary judgment against emory.though astrazeneca had not contested emory status as a qualified individual with a disability before the ddol,astrazeneca took the position before the district court that emory limitations were not substantially limiting so as to render him disabled under the ada.astrazeneca denied that emory evidence of impairment even presented a question for the jury.
the district court determined,as a matter of law,that emory was not disabled for purposes of the ada and granted astrazeneca summary judgment on this basis.specifically,the court found that the manifestations of emory cerebral palsy did not limit him in the major life activities of performing manual tasks or learning with respect to the performance of manual tasks,the district court stated,although emory has some limitations in his ability to grip,carry and manipulate objects and needs assistance in accomplishing some household chores,childcare duties,and activities involving his right side,his limitations are not substantial or severe.dist.op.at.the court found significant evidence regarding emory civic ability to perform as a clown,counsel families as a mediator,and assist his community as a firefighter.id.it noted that while he may perform some of his daily activities in an unconventional manner as a result of his impairments,he is not substantially limited in his ability to perform those activities.id.
as to learning,the district court noted that emory does indeed have learning impairments,id.at,and is limited in his literacy and computational skills,but determined that those impairments could not be considered substantially limiting,again,primarily because of the challenges emory was courageous enough to undertake and,in some instances,overcome.the record indicates that emory graduated from high school and updated his computer skills through occupational training.emory passed the certification requirements to become both a family mediator and a fireman,and he has consistently earned positive performance evaluations during his years of employment with astrazeneca.dist.op.at.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction under.our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same standard that the district court should have applied.see abramson william paterson coll.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d abramson,at.
applicable law 
the ada prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals who suffer a disability.the statute defines disability,in part,as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.a.the parties here agree that cerebral palsy is an impairment.and,emory has identified those major life activities in which he claims to be substantially limited,which include the performance of manual tasks and learning.astrazeneca,however,denies that emory limitations are substantial.
though s ubstantially in the phrase substantially limits suggests considerable or to a large degree,toyota motor,williams,d,the supreme court has made clear that t he act addresses substantial limitations on major life activities,not utter inabilities,bragdon abbott,d emphasis added.see also fiscus stores,cir we also read the supreme court to hold that a substantial limitation of a major life activity does not mean impossibility or even great physical difficulty rather,substantial limitation is weighed in a broad,practical sense.when evaluating substantial limitation,courts must consider a plaintiff ability to compensate for his disability through mitigating measures,albertson,kirkingburg,d,but the essence of the inquiry regards comparing the conditions,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform the major life activity at issue with those under which an impaired plaintiff must perform,taylor phoenixville sch,cir.
the eeoc interpretive guidelines echo,and expound upon,these precepts 
the term substantially limits means 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or 
ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.the eeoc guidelines further counsel that the following factors should be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited 
i the nature and severity of the impairment 
ii the duration or expected duration of the impairment and 
iii the permanent or long term impact,or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.
it bears noting that the eeoc has filed a amicus curiae brief in this case imploring us to recognize that conscientious application of the law demands reversal of the district court conclusion that emory has not adduced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding his status as disabled under the ada we agree with the eeoc contention that to affirm this conclusion in the face of ample evidence concerning the substantial impact emory impairments have on his ability to perform routine functions of daily life would deprive victims of the ability to challenge discriminatory acts,and thereby undermine the ada purpose.the statute was passed because congress found the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilitie
