in we held that prison inmates in a temporary release program must receive a hearing prior to revocation of their release status.tracy salamack,cir per curiam.the district court,whose reasoning we adopted,found that plaintiffs satisfied both prongs of the test that determines whether the due process clause requires a hearing.first,the prisoners demonstrated that they had suffered a grievous loss of liberty within the meaning of morrissey brewer,d.tracy salamack.next,as meachum fano,d,requires,plaintiffs showed a right or expectation rooted in state law that protected them against the loss.tracy.at.
despite this precedent,defendants revoked simon anderson,temporary release status in without giving him notice and without allowing him to attend the subsequent hearing.anderson sued,and defendants moved for dismissal based on qualified immunity.although the district court recognized that we had recently reaffirmed tracy in kim hurston,cir,it held that defendants were entitled to prevail because at the time they revoked anderson temporary release,sandin conner,d,placed tracy s continuing validity in doubt.
we disagree,finding that sandin did not place tracy in doubt because sandin reaffirmed the key principles underlying morrissey and thus tracy.
background 
anderson is an inmate in the custody of the new york department of correctional services docs.in may,anderson began to participate in docs temporary release program.for most of the period of anderson participation in work release,he worked for the neighborhood defender service of harlem.on june,docs confined anderson to the restriction unit at lincoln correctional facility lincoln.eight days later,corrections personnel served anderson with a misbehavior report based on an allegation of cocaine use.on june,a superintendent hearing was held on june,lincoln temporary release committee held a hearing and revoked anderson temporary release status.anderson did not receive notice of this hearing and was not present.anderson contested the revocation in a proceeding brought pursuant to article of the new york civil practice law and rules.new york state supreme court justice emily jane goodman held that docs failure to allow anderson to be present at a hearing before revoking his temporary release status required her to vacate the temporary release committee decision.anderson williams,misc d,she further directed that the committee hold a hearing within ninety days.id.on september,anderson returned to the temporary release program.
on february,anderson filed a civil rights complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.he seeks damages for the fifteen months he spent in prison after his temporary release status was revoked.after anderson filed an amended complaint,the defendants,all of whom are docs officials or employees,moved for dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.defendants urged four bases for dismissal anderson had not yet served the individual defendants with copies of the amended complaint he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the issue of whether anderson had a liberty interest in his temporary release status and anderson did not allege goord personal involvement in any wrongdoing.
in a report and recommendation filed august,magistrate judge henry pitman recommended that the district court grant defendants motion.although the magistrate judge rejected defendants service and exhaustion of remedies arguments,he found that anderson had not adequately pleaded goord personal involvement and that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.anderson goord,wl,may.the judge qualified immunity determination followed from his conclusion that sandin conner,d,cast doubt on an inmate liberty interest in temporary release status,a doubt that was removed only by our decision in kim hurston,cir.id.at.
the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation in its entirety,anderson,wl,at,and this timely appeal followed.anderson questions only that part of the district court judgment that finds the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.following oral argument,we appointed pro bono counsel and asked both parties to submit supplemental briefing on qualified immunity.we gratefully acknowledge the skillful efforts of pro bono counsel on anderson behalf.
discussion 
qualified immunity principles 
when,as here,the district court resolves a qualified immunity issue on a motion to dismiss,we review the court determination de novo,accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint,and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.johnson newburgh enlarged sch,cir.
defendants are entitled to qualified immunity if either a the defendant action did not violate clearly established law,or b it was objectively reasonable for the defendant to believe that his action did not violate such law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a right is clearly established if the law is defined with reasonable clarity,the supreme court or the second circuit has recognized the right,and a reasonable defendant would have understood from the existing law that his conduct was unlawful.young county of fulton,cir.the question is not what a lawyer would learn or intuit from researching case law,but what a reasonable person in the defendant position should know about the constitutionality of the conduct.mccullough wyandanch union free,cir.
defendants concede that inmates had a clearly established right to a hearing prior to revocation of temporary release from,when we decided tracy salamack,until june,when the supreme court decided sandin conner.they also concede that this right again became clear after our decision,kim hurston.because defendants claim is that what once was clear in this circuit was made unclear by an intervening supreme court decision,we must decide whether sandin placed tracy in any reasonable doubt.bass coughlin,cir per curiam holding that supreme court decisions allowing prison officials to meet less exacting standards when a prisoner interest in marrying,or attending religious ceremonies,or maintaining the length of his hair is to be balanced against interests of rehabilitation and prison security did not undermine this court holding that prison officials must provide a prisoner a diet that is consistent with his religious scruples.
ii.the origins of tracy 
tracy took root from morrissey brewer,d,and meachum fano,d.tracy salamack,aff as modified,cir per curiam.in morrissey,the supreme court found that the liberty of a parolee,although indeterminate,includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a grievous loss on the parolee and often on others.morrissey,at.the court emphasized that a parolee,unlike a prisoner,is free to seek gainful employment and to be with family and friends.id.weighing the interests of the state in returning a parolee who has violated the conditions of parole to prison against the parolee liberty interest,the court determined that the parolee must be accorded several rights before his parole status was definitively revoked.morrissey,at.these rights included 
a written notice of the claimed violations of parole b disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him c opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence d the right to confront and adverse witnesses e a neutral and detached hearing body such as a traditional parole board and f a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.
morrissey was followed by wolff mcdonnell,d,in which the court considered a statutory scheme that gave prisoners a right to accrue credit against their sentences.wolff,at.prisoners could lose this thus the probability of a shortened for serious misbehavior.id.because the statute created a liberty interest of real substance in credits,the court held that loss of the credits must be preceded by notice and a hearing.id.at.
two years later,the court held that not every grievous loss visited upon a person by the state is sufficient to invoke the proced
