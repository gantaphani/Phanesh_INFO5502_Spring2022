appellant air transport association of america air transport,the principal trade and service organization of the united states airline industry,appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn,granting summary judgment to appellees and dismissing its complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the new york state passenger bill of rights the pbr,sess.laws,ch.codified at exec.law b d bus.law to.air transp.ass of am.cuomo,d.we hold that the pbr is preempted by the express preemption provision of the airline deregulation act of the ada and therefore reverse.
background 
following a series of incidents during the winter of in which airline passengers endured lengthy delays grounded on new york runways,some without being provided water or food,the new york legislature enacted the pbr.the substantive provisions of the pbr state as follows 
whenever airline passengers have boarded an aircraft and are delayed more than three hours on the aircraft prior to takeoff,the carrier shall ensure that passengers are provided as needed with 
a electric generation service to provide temporary power for fresh air and lights 
b waste removal service in order to service the holding tanks for restrooms and 
c adequate food and drinking water and other refreshments.

air transport filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the pbr is preempted by the ada and violates the commerce clause of the constitution.appellant air transport moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment sua sponte to the appellees,holding that the pbr was not expressly preempted by the ada because it is not related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier,air,d at quoting b internal quotation mark omitted,and was not impliedly preempted because congress did not intend for the ada to occupy the field of airplane safety,id.at.we granted air transport motion for an expedited appeal.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.sec kern,cir see also drake lab.of am.holdings,cir a determination regarding preemption is a conclusion of law,and we therefore review it de novo.
the supremacy clause,const.art.vi,cl,invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.hillsborough county automated med,d quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.preemption can be either express or implied.express preemption arises when a federal statute expressly directs that state law be ousted.ass of int l auto.mfrs.abrams,cir.implied preemption arises when,in the absence of explicit statutory language,congress intended the federal government to occupy a field exclusively,or when state law actually conflicts with federal law.english,d.more specifically,preemption is implied when the pervasiveness of the federal regulation precludes supplementation by the states,where the federal interest in the field is sufficiently dominant,or where the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it reveal the same purpose.schneidewind anr pipeline,d omission in original quoting rice santa fe elevator.congress has enacted two statutes that potentially bear on the subject matter of the pbr the ada,stat.and the federal aviation act of the faa,stat.we begin with the former.
since the existence of preemption turns on congress intent,we are to begin as we do in any exercise of statutory construction,with the text of the provision in question,and move on,as need be,to the structure and purpose of the act in which it occurs.mcnally port auth.of in re wtc disaster site,cir alteration in original quoting state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.the ada express preemption provision states as follows 
except as provided in this subsection,a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.
b.the exceptions to which this provision refers are not applicable in this case.thus,the pbr is preempted if it is related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.we conclude that it is.
air transport complaint asserts a claim under the supremacy clause and a claim that the pbr violates b.importantly,b does not provide an express private right of action,and we have held with regard to its predecessor statute,which is substantively identical,that no private right of action can be implied.air lines,port auth.of,cir airways,hope,cir.air transport therefore can not sue for a violation of the statute.
nevertheless,air transport is entitled to pursue its preemption challenge through its supremacy clause claim.the distinction between a statutory claim and a supremacy clause claim,although seemingly without a difference in this particular context,is important and is not a trifling formalism 
a claim under the supremacy clause that a federal law preempts a state regulation is distinct from a claim for enforcement of that federal law a claim under the supremacy clause simply asserts that a federal statute has taken away local authority to regulate a certain activity.in contrast,an implied private right of action is a means of enforcing the substantive provisions of a federal law.it provides remedies,frequently including damages,for violations of federal law by a government entity or by a private party.the mere coincidence that the federal law in question in this case contains its own preemption language does not affect this distinction.
air lines,at.moreover,contrary to amici suggestion,air transport preenforcement challenge presents no problem of unripeness or other barriers to justiciability.see morales trans world airlines,d citing ex parte young.
congress enacted the ada in,loosening its economic regulation of the airline industry after determining that maximum reliance on competitive market forces would best further efficiency,innovation,and low prices as well as variety and quality of air transportation.id.at.alteration and omission in original quoting app.a.to ensure that the states would not undo this deregulation with regulation of their own,congress included an express preemption provision.see also id.at.holding that the ada expressly preempted the application of state deceptive business practice laws to airline fare advertisements because such regulation related to air carrier prices.recognizing this goal,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the breadth of the ada preemption provision.see am.airlines,wolens,d id.at.stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part morales,at.see also rowe motor transp.ass n,d ginsburg,concurring noting the breadth of the preemption language in the federal aviation administration authorization act of,whose preemption provision,c,is in pari materia with that of the ada.
although this court has not yet defined service as it is used in the ada,we have little difficulty concluding that requiring airlines to provide food,water,electricity,and restrooms to passengers during lengthy ground delays relates to the service of an air carrier.this conclusion draws considerable support from the supreme court recent unanimous opinion in rowe construing c identically worded preemption provision.in rowe,the court addressed a maine law imposing,among other obligations,a requirement that retailers shipping tobacco products to customers within the state use a delivery service that provides certain forms of recipient law enacted,according to the state,to further its interest in preventing minors from obtaining cigarettes.the rowe court reiterated its conclusions from morales in construing the ada 
that s tate enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to carrier rates,routes,or services are
