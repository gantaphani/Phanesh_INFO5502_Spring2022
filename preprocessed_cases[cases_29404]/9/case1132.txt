in a case of mistaken identity,christopher russo russo was arrested and imprisoned for the armed robbery of an amoco service station and convenience store in bridgeport,connecticut.two hundred and seventeen days after his one day after the prosecutor viewed,for the first time,amoco videotape of the state requested a nolle prosequi,and the charges against russo were dismissed.
russo brought this action pursuant to,against the city of bridgeport the city and four city police department jeremy depietro depietro,officer john rosa rosa,detective christopher borona borona,and sergeant john sherbo sherbo collectively,the officers or the individual.he claimed,inter alia,that,in violation of the fourth amendment,the officers and the city subjected him to false arrest and false imprisonment.he also claimed that the city and the individual violated his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights by keeping him incarcerated for a long time after his arrest,despite his protestations of innocence and the availability of exculpatory facts and evidence.
the district court granted summary judgment to the city and to all the individual.we affirm in part,and vacate and remand in part.
background 
on august,an armed,unmasked person robbed an amoco auto service station in bridgeport.the cashier described the criminal as a white male in his late,between and tall,of medium build with a very short,blond crew cut.the crime was recorded on videotape by a security camera officer rosa went to the scene of the incident.
officer depietro,who was assigned by sergeant sherbo to investigate the robbery,obtained the videotape of the robbery on august.after using a machine to freeze still photographs of the criminal,depietro prepared a mug shot photo array by matching the assailant facial characteristics to faces in the police photo identification database.russo picture was included in this,and the amoco cashier identified russo as the robber,stating that he was one hundred percent sure of his identification.based on this evidence police obtained and executed a warrant for russo arrest.on september,russo was charged with robbery.
unable to afford the bail that was set,russo remained in custody for more than seven months,until april,when the charges against him were dismissed.the dismissal happened because the videotape taken by the surveillance camera showed that both sides of the perpetrator left arm and one side of the forearm,and one side of the perpetrator right forearm,were free of any tattoos.russo,by contrast,had prominent tattoos on his forearms,hands,neck,and legs,and,as noted in the arresting officer report,they were there at the time of his arrest on september.
indeed,in an earlier,arrest report on file with the bridgeport police department,individual rosa documented the existence of king tut,and tribal art tattoos on russo two forearms,in addition to other tattoos on russo upper arms and legs no evidence in the record or argument by the government suggests that russo lacked arm tattoos on the date of the robbery or had somehow managed to mask them from the victim or the video camera view 
in addition to the distinctiveness of his tattoos,russo physical characteristics were different in important respects from those of the amoco robber,as described by the cashier.at the time of russo arrest for that robbery,russo was listed by the police as being a white male,tall,of medium build,who weighed pounds and had brown hair,but was balding.he was,therefore,younger,taller,balder,and with different colored hair than the person whom the victim had described to the police.
construing the evidence in the light most favorable to russo,the following events occurred during the period of russo custody.upon his arrest on september,russo was taken for interrogation by individual depietro and borona,whom he had never met before.the officers questioned russo about the robbery for two hours,seeking his confession.the officers informed russo that they had video surveillance of him committing the robbery,and they showed him a photographic still that had been ripped or folded to show only the robber head.russo protested that he could not be the person in the photograph because of the shape of the criminal head,nose,and hairline.he also told the officers to watch the videotape to see whether the perpetrator had body tattoos the officers left the interrogation room and returned a while later holding a magnifying glass and a ruler.they then informed russo that the videotape showed a perpetrator with tattoos.russo,nevertheless,refused to plead guilty to the robbery.
after the questioning,depietro came to russo holding cell one or two additional times seeking a confession in exchange for giving russo access to the hospital methadone program the officers kept on dismissing the issue of his tattoos.russo also continued to press the other differences between his and the perpetrator face and insisted that this showed his innocence 
from the day of the robbery through a date after november,depietro,who was the lead investigating officer on the robbery,had possession of the videotape.depietro and borona stated that they viewed the videotape,and testified that they did not notice tattoos on the perpetrator.individual defendant sherbo,the sergeant who had assigned depietro to investigate the robbery,attested that he did not watch the videotape,because,in his view,the eyewitness identification confirmed the assailant identity and made it unnecessary to view the surveillance footage.there is no dispute that after the date of the interrogation,there was no further contact between russo and depietro and borona.
after learning of the videotape through the questioning,and on the officers the robber had tattoos of the same size and location as he did,russo told his appointed attorney and later his retained counsel that he wished to prove his innocence by seeing the tape of the robbery in order to compare his own tattoo imagery to that of the perpetrator.at russo first court appearance for arraignment and on september,russo appointed public defender did not raise the issue of the videotape to the judge.
at a hearing before the state court,likely to have occurred in early october,the prosecutor successfully countered russo lawyer request that the court compare russo tattoos to those of the perpetrator on november,russo counsel moved for the production of any exculpatory material,and it is undisputed that the videotape was not produced at this time.on december,russo trial attorney issued a written letter in which he specifically asked to view the tape.
on november,an investigator for the office of the state attorney visited the bridgeport police department property room to obtain the videotape.the investigator found that the tape was missing.sometime after november,the investigator obtained the tape from officer depietro,who had it locked in a drawer of his desk.later,the state investigator watched the tape and determined that he could not see the perpetrator clearly.on january,he requested a laboratory enhancement of the footage,which he received on january.
later,at an unknown date before april,russo trial attorney was finally allowed to watch the tape.immediately thereafter,he told the state investigator that the person on the tape could not be his client.the videotape was not actually surrendered to the defense until russo was released in late april.
the state attorney was aware of russo fairly vivid tattoos on his arms as well as on his neck from the time he first received the case.yet,because russo face resembled the robber in photo stills taken from the videotape,his office claimed to have been convinced that russo was the perpetrator until one day before seeking dismissal of the case.finally,on april,due to defense counsel continuing insistence on russo innocence,the prosecutor actually watched the videotape.the following day,after checking with a probation officer to verify that russo tattoos predated the crime,the state requested a nolle prosequi.
at the hearing to request dismissal of the prosecution,the state attorney noted that often the less said is better,but he stated 
so,i had a sit down with a couple of investigators yesterday to actually view the videotape in the thought that perhaps the videotape gave somehow somewhat of a better view of the perpetrator than the stills that had been developed from the videotape.that,in fact,happened.the videotape shows both sides of the perpetrator left arm and one side of the forearm,and one side of the perpetrator right forearm.and there very clearly are no tattoos on any of those.
the court dismissed the case.
as recognized by the district court,the bridgeport police department had exclusive custody of the videotape evidence from august,until at least november,a period of days.construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the record indicates a time the police interrogation on september,and the earliest date on which the tape may have been obtained from which depietro and borona were on notice of russo claim of innocence based on his tattoos.the state attorney himself did not watch the videotape as moving picture footage,rather than frozen stills,until more than seven months after russo arrest.
naming the city and the individual officers who conducted his arrest and investigation as defendants,russo filed a civil rights action in state court.the action was removed to the federal district court on october.russo there filed a second amended complaint which asserted a failure to train and supervise by the city,as well as false arrest and unreasonably lengthy detention by the city and by the individual defendants.the complaint alleges that both the city and the individual lacked probable cause for russo arrest,demonstrated reckless and malicious indifference to russo claims of innocence,and failed to meet their statutory obligation under connecticut law to disclose exculpatory evidence.in addition to his count,russo claimed false arrest,false imprisonment,negligent infliction of emotional distress,and intentional infliction of emotional distress under state law.
by a brief endorsement order and final judgment dated july and july,the district court granted summary judgment to all the defendants.the court found that russo federal constitutional rights had not been violated,and,having dismissed russo federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over russo state claims.
at oral argument,the district judge expressed his sympathy for russo given the length of his wrongful incarceration,but he found no fourth or fourteenth amendment violations.he stated that probable cause for russo arrest had been established,and that this fact precluded false arrest and false imprisonment claims under.with respect to russo due process claims,the district court did not make specific factual findings about the timing or scope of the state investigation of the crime or videotape evidence.he did conclude,however,that the evidence was insufficient to show that the videotape was legible enough to exonerate russo prior to the tape enhancement in january.the court went on to reject,as a matter of law,the argument that when the person whose sic been arrested provides an explanation as to why they not guilty,the police officers violate that person constitutional rights when they do go out and investigate the claims made by the person who been arrested.having found no violation of russo federal constitutional rights by the individual defendants,the district court rejected the claims against the city without discussion.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party.hoyt andreucci,cir quoting bourdon loughren,cir.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment only if,taking all of plaintiff evidence as true and drawing all inferences in plaintiff favor,we find that no reasonable juror could conclude that russo has established that the defendants violated his constitutional rights under circumstances subjecting them to liability under.see amnesty am.town of hartford,cir.c.
ii.deprivation of constitutional rights 
as in any case on summary judgment,we first determine whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the defendants conduct violated a constitutional right,saucier katz,d see also farrell burke,cir quoting same,and only thereafter consider whether qualified immunity shields individual defendants.russo argues constitutional tort liability arising under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.he asserts that his lengthy detention and the withholding of the videotape from state investigators constituted violations of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures and of his right to due process 
a.the fourth amendment claim based on false arrest and false imprisonment 
russo first claim relies on theories of false arrest and false imprisonment.in analyzing claims alleging the constitutional tort of false arrest,we have generally looked to the law of the state in which the arrest occurred.davis rodriguez,cir examining connecticut law to assess a plaintiff false arrest claim see also,jaegly couch,cir considering new york law.this follows our normal practice with respect to claims.see davis,at.
in a false arrest action,connecticut law places the burden of proving an unlawful arrest on the plaintiff.beinhorn saraceno,davis,at.and,in connecticut,a false arrest claim can not lie when the challenged arrest was supported by probable cause.beinhorn.at,at.interpreting an analogous rule under new york law in the context of federal civil rights actions,our court has uniformly rejected fourth amendment false arrest claims premised on lawful arrests supported by probable cause.see escalera lunn,cir weyant okst,cir singer fulton county sheriff,cir.in the present case,the district court properly found that there was no disputed issue of material fact that russo arrest was supported by probable cause the positive identification by the gas station cashier.
the more vigorous dispute between the an equally issue under connecticut whether russo detention supported an independent claim for false imprisonment.as in the case of false arrest,we look to connecticut state law principles to determine the validity of russo federal civil rights claim based on false imprisonment.see huang johnson,cir.
under connecticut law,f alse imprisonment,or false arrest,is the unlawful restraint by one person of the physical liberty of another.outlaw city of meriden,quoting green donroe.in outlaw,the connecticut appellate court stated that the applicable law for false arrest and false imprisonment is identical,and therefore there is no cause of action for false imprisonment if the plaintiff was arrested pursuant to a facially valid warrant.id.at describing the continuity of this rule across years of case law see also lo sacco young,stating that a claim for false imprisonment may not lie where the arrest of the plaintiff is legally authorized love town of granby,wl,at.july.
the district court dismissal of russo claims for false arrest and false imprisonment is therefore affirmed 
b.the claim based on an unreasonably prolonged detention 
the heart of russo second claim is that his prolonged by the individual alleged mishandling of exculpatory evidence and failure to turn that evidence over to the prosecuting attorney which,in turn,prevented the prosecutor from complying with his duty to give the exculpatory evidence to the his fourteenth amendment right to be free from deprivations of liberty without due process of law.as he did before the district court,russo argues that the officers willfully mishandled and suppressed two items of exculpatory evidence the arrest file showing russo prominent tattoos and the moving footage of the surveillance videotape demonstrating that the perpetrator was not tattooed.in addition,russo asserts municipal liability by the city of bridgeport on the theory that a failure to train and supervise these officers led to the deprivations of russo constitutional rights.
individual defendants 
to hold individual depietro,borona,sherbo,and rosa liable in their personal capacity,russo must show that their conduct violated his constitutional rights and that their actions were taken under color of state law.see hafer melo,d eagleston guido,cir.to make such a personal claim,russo need not establish a connection to governmental policy or custom.hafer,at.
to prevail on this claim,russo must establish that he has a right to be free from continued detention stemming from law enforcement officials mishandling or suppression of exculpatory evidence,that the actions of the officers violated that right,and that the officers conduct shocks the conscience,county of sacramento lewis,d.in addition,even if russo proves these elements,he can not prevail against the individual defendants if the officers establish that they are entitled to qualified immunity.
in the following subsection a,we address the three elements of this claim and conclude that russo has made out a prima facie case with respect to officer depietro and detective borona.in doing so,we clarify that this type of claim,which has in the past been treated as one based on substantive due process,should be examined under the fourth amendment instead.in subsections b and c,we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate as to sergeant sherbo and officer rosa.given these conclusions,subsection d examines whether officer depietro and detective borona are entitled to qualified immunity.
officer depietro and detective borona 
undisputed evidence shows that both depietro and borona had responsibility for investigating the amoco robbery,with borona accompanying depietro to the service station on the date of the crime.similarly,that evidence establishes that depietro took control of the surveillance tape on the date of the robbery,viewed the tape,prepared photographic stills from the tape,served as the affiant in the warrant for russo arrest,obtained that warrant,and retained the original videotape in his desk drawer through a date that was after november.
beyond that,the testimony in the case diverges.but read in the light most favorable to russo,as it must be,the record evidence shows the following.depietro and borona questioned russo and pursued discussions in which they necessarily for the first time,as such attributes were on record in police russo distinctive physical characteristics,and specifically of his tattoos.they watched the unenhanced surveillance tape,and they represented to russo that they could see the perpetrator arms.then,while concealing the tape,they falsely insisted that it showed a man with tattoos like his.rather than following police rules on the storage of evidence and the processing of exculpatory evidence,depietro put the tape in his drawer,thus impeding the state attorney access to the footage.as a result,and despite russo repeated attempts to focus attention on the tape,it took more than six months for that tape to reach russo counsel,and more than seven months before russo was released from prison.
the question of whether such conduct amounted to a deprivation of russo constitutional rights is similar to one posed to the supreme court in baker mccollan,d,in which a plaintiff was arrested pursuant to a valid warrant actually intended for his brother id.at.the plaintiff remained incarcerated for eight his protests of innocence and the availability of exculpatory the police compared his photograph to that of the wanted man and released the innocent arrestee.id.at.the plaintiff brought an action pursuant to alleging that the sheriff had failed to institute proper identification procedures in violation of the plaintiff due process rights.as in russo case,the plaintiff claims were based on law enforcement conduct after the plaintiff was incarcerated pursuant to a valid warrant.
in baker,the supreme court held that the plaintiff it found was a depriv ation of his liberty for a period of days pursuant to a warrant satisfying fourth amendment not,in the circumstances of that case,give rise to a constitutional claim.id.at.the court stated,however obviously,one in plaintiff position could not be detained indefinitely in the face of repeated protests of innocence even though the warrant under which he was arrested and detained met the standards of the fourth amendment.id.at.such protection derived from his constitutional right to a speedy trial.id.citing united states marion,d.but,going beyond this sixth amendment right,the court suggested that such a prolonged detention could also be understood in terms of the fourteenth amendment right to due process of law 
we may even assume,arguendo,that,depending on what procedures the state affords defendants following arrest and prior to actual trial,mere detention pursuant to a valid warrant but in the face of repeated protests of innocence will after the lapse of a certain amount of time deprive the accused of liberty without due process of law.
id.at.quoting const.amend.xiv,see also wright smith,cir quoting same.the court made clear,however,that the plaintiff detention three days over a new year weekend amounted to no such deprivation.baker,at.
in a concurring opinion,justice blackmun reinforced the court due process discussion.he explained that,as he saw it,the majority opinion did not foreclose the possibility that a prisoner in plaintiff predicament might prove a due process violation by a sheriff who deliberately and repeatedly refused to check the identity of a complaining prisoner against readily available mug shots and fingerprints.id.at.blackmun,concurring.in other words,the due process clause might well reach conduct more shocking than that of the defendant in baker.and,justice blackmun read the court opinion to conclude only that every claim of innocence need not be investigated independently,and that defendant intent was relevant to the existence of a constitutional violation.id.
following baker,the eleventh circuit recognized a fourteenth amendment due process right to be free from continued detention after it was or should have been known that the detainee was entitled to release.see cannon macon county,cir.in cannon,a sheriff deputy arrested an innocent woman whose name was similar to that of a fugitive and ignored the arrestee protestations of innocence.id.at.the deputy failure to take any steps to identify the plaintiff as the fugitive,the court held,provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that the deputy acted with deliberate indifference towards the plaintiff due process rights.id.at.similarly,the ninth circuit applied baker recognition of a due process interest to a detention of a plaintiff arrested on valid warrants intended for his twin brother.see fairley luman,cir.the court held that the plaintiff had a liberty interest in being free from a incarceration without any procedural safeguard in place to verify the warrant he was detained on was his and in the face of his repeated protests of innocence.see also sanders english,cir holding that the failure to release a pretrial detainee after police officer knew or should have known that plaintiff had been misidentified gives rise to cause of action under 
and our own court has recognized the due process protection suggested in baker.thus,in satchell dilworth,we considered the claims of a plaintiff who,following completion of a criminal sentence,had been illegally rearrested and incarcerated for days based on misleading and incomplete,if not deliberately false,information provided by state correctional services,cir.the plaintiff,we stated in satchell,might be able to prevail on his due process claims if he could demonstrate that any of the defendants intentionally concealed or conspired to conceal evidence of the plaintiff completion of his sentence.id.at.
today,we hold that the right mentioned in baker and enunciated in the above cited cases protected russo from a sustained detention stemming directly from the law enforcement officials refusal to investigate available exculpatory evidence.the bridgeport police officers retained sole custody of the videotape stored it in an improper a full days after russo alerted them that examining the pictures of the perpetrator for tattoos could exonerate russo.they did this after intentionally misstating that the robber had tattoos.moreover,their failure to perform the simple task of checking the tape resulted in all of russo incarceration.
we must clarify the source of this right,however.although justice blackmun in several circuits including our own in suggested that the right was rooted in substantive due process,we now conclude,in light of more recent guidance from the supreme court,that the right should instead be analyzed under the fourth amendment.in graham connor,d,decided almost ten years after baker,the supreme court stated that w here a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior,that amendment,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing these claims.albright oliver,d plurality opinion quoting graham,at.and more recently,in county of sacramento lewis,d,the high court noted that rochin california.a case on which justice blackmun had relied in baker was decided long before graham connor and today would be treated under the fourth amendment,albeit with the same result.sacramento,at.
russo he presents as being based on substantive due comfortably under the coverage of the fourth amendment.we have observed that w hen the accused is physically detained following arraignment,there can be no question that he has been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment.murphy lynn,cir see also county of sacramento,at.a fourth amendment seizure occurs when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted oliver,at.plurality opinion the framers considered the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty and drafted the fourth amendment to address it.and while we have generally looked to the law of the state in which the arrest occurred in analyzing claims based on the fourth amendment,davis,at emphasis added,the scope of the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable seizures is,of course,not limited to state law.
thus,since the fourth amendment provides a more explicit textual source of constitutional protection,in light of graham,the fourth amendment,rather than substantive due process,should serve as the guide for analyzing these claims.graham,at.fontana haskin,cir c laims arising before or during arrest are to be analyzed exclusively under the fourth amendment reasonableness standard rather than the substantive due process standard quoting reed hoy,cir.
we therefore treat russo claim as being based on the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable seizures.and,doing so,we conclude,in light of the length of time of russo wrongful incarceration,the ease with which the evidence exculpating was in the officers have been checked,and the alleged intentionality of depietro and borona behavior,that russo has sufficiently alleged that he was unreasonably seized.in other words,the evidence russo has proffered suffices to prevent summary judgment on russo claim of a fourth amendment violation by depietro and borona.
in baker,the supreme court expressly recognized that the lapse of a certain amount of time is an element in assessing the existence of a constitutional encroachment.baker,at.indeed,in one of the precedents relied on in baker,the court had stated that t he consequences of prolonged detention may be more serious than the interference occasioned by arrest.pretrial confinement may imperil the suspect job,interrupt his source of income,and impair his family relationships.gerstein pugh,d see baker,at.citing gerstein.and the baker court noted that the short duration of the plaintiff detention was central to the court denial of the plaintiff claims.see id.at.accord davis hall,cir cannon macon county,cir coleman frantz,cir.the total detention here,or even the detention between russo arrest and depietro yielding of the tape to the prosecutor,plainly was prolonged rather than short and carried constitutional implications.
whether depietro and borona watched the tape before falsely telling russo that the robber was tattooed,or failed to follow up on russo claims of innocence by refusing to watch the tape at all,their conduct easily fits the hypothetical presented in justice blackmun baker concurrence that the standard for liability announced by the court would reach an officer who refused to check the identity of a complaining prisoner against readily available mug shots and fingerprints.see baker,at.blackmun,concurring emphasis added.an officer duty to investigate specific,claims of innocence in a reasonable time period clearly covers reviewing a surveillance camera video record of a crime,when,as here,it was an easily available piece of physical evidence.
we have said that a substantive due process claim requires more to trigger liability,a police officer action must shock the conscience.county of sacramento,at.that is,it must be arbitrary in the constitutional sense,pierson,cir quoting collins city of harker heights,d.and,given our the supreme court admonition in treat russo claim under the fourth amendment,the shock the conscience requirement must now be understood as a crucial feature going to the unreasonableness of the seizure.
the state of mind of a government defendant is an integral aspect of any shock the conscience standard.thus,we have read county of sacramento to mean that while a purpose to cause harm might be required in a situation such as a chase,deliberate indifference but not support a finding of liability in situations where the government owes a special duty of care to those in its charge,at.
here,russo was in state hence in the charge of the the relevant proceedings.moreover,a reasonable jury could find that depietro actively hid the exculpatory evidence.as such,his conduct is of a different order from that of the defendant in baker,where inadvertent omission,rather than an affirmative wrongdoing,led to the detention.see at.see also whitley seibel,cir distinguishing baker and finding liability because of defendant police officers improper behavior.in addition,by falsely describing the content of the videotape,depietro and borona attempted to evoke a confession from him by misrepresenting the very evidence of russo innocence that was available to them.this act,combined with their failure to investigate the tape to see if the tape was in fact exculpatory,would readily support a jury finding of either intentional violation of,or deliberate indifference to,russo constitutional rights.see cannon,at holding that a defendant failure to verify that an arrestee was the fugitive sought on the arrest warrant raised a question of fact as to defendant deliberate indifference toward the plaintiff due process rights.and,depietro failure to follow police procedures with respect to the storage of the exculpatory evidence adds further evidence on the basis of which a jury could find deliberate indifference to russo incarceration and to his asserted innocence.
the evidence of shocking conduct on the part of depietro and borona was sufficient to preclude a grant of summary judgment in their favor on the merits of russo unreasonable seizure claim.
sergeant sherbo 
sherbo,for his part,took depietro oath for russo arrest warrant application,assigned and supervised depietro investigation,and made the determination that it was unnecessary to view the tape personally.sherbo may not be held liable simply because one or more of his subordinates committed a constitutional tort.he may be found liable,however,for any deliberate indifference to the rights of others by his failure to act on information indicating unconstitutional acts were occurring or for his gross negligence in failing to supervise his subordinates who commit such wrongful acts,provided that the plaintiff can show an affirmative causal link between the supervisor inaction and his injury.poe leonard,cir.but no evidence was proffered that sherbo was on notice of russo claim of innocence.as a result,no deliberate indifference by sherbo to russo rights has been shown.similarly,sherbo conclusion that the robbery victim positive identification precluded the need for watching the in no sense a
