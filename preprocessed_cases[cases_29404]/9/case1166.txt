this appeal presents a new twist on a familiar issue what requirements must a prisoner meet before he can maintain a claim under that challenges sanctions imposed pursuant to a prison disciplinary proceeding the case law is clear that when a prisoner challenge either to the process or the result of a prison disciplinary proceeding necessarily implies the invalidity of a sanction that affects the duration of his sentence,such as the deprivation of credits,the prisoner may not maintain an action under unless he has shown that the sanction or the procedures that led to it,if the procedural defect at issue was critical to the imposition of the sanction have been overturned through administrative channels or by a state or federal court.it is also clear that when a prisoner challenge involves a sanction that affects only his conditions of confinement,this favorable termination requirement does not apply and a prisoner may maintain an action under without showing that the sanction or the procedures that led to it have been previously invalidated.
what is not clear,however,is whether a prisoner who was subject to a single disciplinary proceeding that gave rise to two types of that affected the duration of his custody and the other that affected the conditions of his,without needing to satisfy the favorable termination rule,maintain a action aimed solely at the second type of sanction.we now resolve this open question and hold that,in mixed sanctions cases,a prisoner can,without demonstrating that the challenged disciplinary proceedings or resulting punishments have been invalidated,proceed separately with a action aimed at the sanctions or procedures that affected the conditions of his confinement.but we also hold that he may only bring such an action if he agrees to abandon forever any and all claims he has with respect to the sanctions that affected the length of his imprisonment.
on may,jose peralta,an inmate in the custody of new york state department of correctional services docs,was accused of cutting another inmate several times with a weapon.a disciplinary hearing was scheduled to adjudicate the matter.defendant sandra vasquez,a corrections counselor with docs,was assigned to assist the appellant in the hearing.defendant brian jones,the assistant superintendent at fishkill correctional facility,where peralta was being detained at the time of the incident,conducted the hearing on june.jones found peralta guilty and imposed a penalty of five years of confinement in the special housing unit shu,five years loss of packages,commissary,and telephone privileges,and five years loss of credits.the appellant appealed to donald selsky,the director of special disciplinary programs,who modified the penalty to months of shu confinement and a month loss of packages,commissary,and telephone privileges,in addition to a month loss of credits.
having exhausted his appeals within the prison,peralta filed an article petition challenging the decision in new york supreme court,see consol,which transferred the case to the appellate division,second department.a judge of the appellate division granted peralta leave to file as a poor person but declined to waive the filing fee.when peralta failed to pay the filing fee,which he stated he could not afford,his case was dismissed.his appeal to the new york court of appeals of the decision dismissing his case was denied.
peralta,proceeding pro se,then filed the instant action under,alleging that the disciplinary hearing violated his constitutional rights.in his amended complaint,filed at the direction of the district court mukasey,peralta claimed that defendants vasquez,jones,and selsky denied him adequate assistance,witnesses,and a fair and impartial hearing officer and,in doing so,deprived him of substantive and procedural due process and protection against cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the fourteenth and eighth amendments these defendants moved to dismiss the case on the ground that peralta could not prevail on his claim without first establishing that the disciplinary hearing or the resulting sanctions had been invalidated in a state or federal proceeding,and that this had not occurred.in response,peralta argued that,because he sought damages only for those sanctions affecting his conditions of confinement and not for the loss of his credits,he could maintain his claim despite not having demonstrated that the sanctions or hearing had been invalidated 
the district court jones,granted the defendants motion.the district court acknowledged that,unlike many cases in which a prisoner challenges the result of prison disciplinary hearings through a action,the plaintiff here sought damages only for his confinement in not for the loss of credits.it also noted that neither the supreme court nor this court had addressed the issue of whether a prisoner may proceed separately with his claim as to those portions of his sentence which affected only the conditions of his confinement.nevertheless,it found that allowing a plaintiff to split his claims under the circumstances in this action would be.it therefore held that a who challenges only the conditions of confinement imposed pursuant to a disciplinary proceeding that also resulted in the loss of credits must,like a plaintiff who challenges both types of sanctions,demonstrate that those sanctions or the disciplinary hearings giving rise to them have been invalidated before he can proceed with any claim

we review the district court dismissal of the complaint de novo,and accept all material factual allegations therein as true.twombly bell atl,cir.
this case implicates the overlap between and the federal habeas corpus statute.the intersection of these two statutes,and the prerequisites for bringing a claim under each of them,has given rise to a series of cases in the supreme court and in this court examining when a prisoner challenging the imposition of various types of punishment,and seeking different remedies,may rely on to pursue relief.
in the initial case,preiser rodriguez,d,the supreme court established that habeas is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner seeking an earlier release.there,state prisoners who had been deprived of credits as a result of internal disciplinary proceedings brought an action under.they sought injunctive relief to compel the prison to restore those credits,and,as a result,gain them immediate release.id.at.the court held that the prisoners could not maintain their action under because when a prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment,and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment,his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.id.at.conversely,preiser concluded that a action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner who is making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his prison life,but not to the fact or length of his custody.id.at.
over twenty years later,in heck humphrey,d,the court considered when a prisoner,who sought money damages but not an earlier release for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction,could pursue a claim under.the in that case claimed that the county prosecutor and state police investigator had obtained his criminal conviction by engaging in unlawful acts.id.at.the court held that heck action was not cognizable because although on its face it sought only monetary damages,the basis for the damages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the conviction.in that situation,heck can be said to be attacking the fact or length of confinement,id.at.quoting preiser,at.alteration in original.accordingly,it adopted what is known as the favorable termination rule 
i n order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federa
