opinion of the court 
colleen donlin sued philips electronics north america corporation for employment discrimination after it failed to hire her as a employee.the case was tried before a jury and donlin was awarded in compensatory damages.philips appealed,raising various challenges to liability and damages.donlin filed a.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the jury finding of liability and remand for further proceedings with regard to damages.
philips hired donlin as a temporary warehouse employee at its mountaintop,pennsylvania distribution center in may.because of fluctuations in demand for philips products,the mountaintop facility occasionally hired temporary employees to fill and prepare orders for shipment.like many of the temps at the mountaintop facility,donlin applied for a position in the plant,but was not hired.after deciding not to hire donlin as a employee,philips ended donlin temporary assignment in january,citing a decrease in sales volume.
donlin sued philips for gender discrimination and retaliation pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,et,seeking compensatory and punitive damages.the district court granted philips summary judgment on donlin retaliation claim,but her gender discrimination claim proceeded to trial.at the conclusion of donlin,philips moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.philips renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law after putting on its defense.this time,the district court denied philips motion on liability grounds,but granted philips judgment on donlin claim for punitive damages.
the case proceeded to the jury on the issue of liability as well as compensatory damages in the form of back pay and front pay the jury rendered a verdict in donlin favor on liability and recommended in back pay and in front pay,for a total of.the jury advisory verdict on front pay was based on the premise that donlin would have worked for more years until retirement.
following briefing,the district court heeded the advice of the jury on the issue,but modified its award by reducing it to account for only years of damages,finding that calculating damages for a period was too speculative.the final front pay award was,for a total of in compensatory damages.
at the conclusion of the proceedings,philips filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,which the district court denied.philips now appeals,asserting errors with regard to liability,damages,and attorney fees,and donlin.we have jurisdiction under.
we begin with philips contention that the liability verdict can not stand because the jury instructions were flawed.specifically,philips asserts that the district court mischaracterized its rationale for deciding not to hire donlin as a permanent employee.because philips objected to the jury instructions at trial,we review this claim for abuse of discretion.cooper distrib.amana refrigeration,cir.we must determine whether,taken as a whole,the instruction properly apprised the jury of the issues and the applicable law.dressler busch entm t,cir.
in determining liability,the trial court analyzed donlin employment discrimination suit under the familiar framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.donlin first had to make out a prima facie case of discrimination.id.at.the burden then shifted to philips to present a nondiscriminatory reason for declining to hire her.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.donlin then had to demonstrate that the reasons claimed by philips were pretextual.see fuentes perskie,cir.
philips contends that the district court jury charge distorted step two of the mcdonnell douglas framework by mischaracterizing its nondiscriminatory reasons for choosing not to hire donlin.the district court instruction to the jury provided,in relevant part 
i instruct you that philips lighting has given in this case what is generally accepted as a nondiscriminatory reason for its failure to hire donlin.they told you that their decision was based on her record of attendance,production,and accuracy as compared to all the other applicants that they considered for the same job.i instruct you,members of the jury,that if you disbelieve philips explanation for its conduct,then you may not,but you may very well find that donlin has proved intentional discrimination.
emphasis added.
philips zeroes in on the word accuracy,claiming that it should not have been included in the instruction because it was not a relevant factor in the company hiring decision.because the instructions did not accurately summarize the company reasons for choosing not to hire donlin,philips argues,the jury was invited to find that philips rationale for not hiring donlin was pretextual since philips never claimed that donlin was inaccurate.
philips tacitly accuses the district court of pulling the issue of accuracy out of thin air,contending that its witnesses consistently described the company hiring factors as only attendance,productivity,and quality of work.this argument is belied by the record.in response to a question regarding which factors were important when hiring a temporary worker for permanent employment,donlin shift supervisor,duane wright,agreed that the company considered production,attendance,and accuracy to be of paramount importance.additionally,at various stages of the trial,the jury heard testimony regarding picking errors,which occurred when an employee failed to correctly collect products for an order such errors can fairly be described as involving accuracy.
by taking issue with the district court use of the word accuracy,philips claims reversible error by latching on to one word in a jury charge.we are not persuaded.we begin by noting that a mistake in a jury instruction constitutes reversible error only if it fails to fairly and adequately present the issues in the case without confusing or misleading the jury.united states ellis,cir.we can not say that the use of the single word accuracy so altered the jury thinking as to give such a misimpression in this case.indeed,there is a logical connection between an employee accuracy and her quality of work and productivity.as a temporary warehouse employee,donlin filled and prepared orders for shipment.if she could not prepare orders accurately,the quality of her work would suffer.to suggest otherwise is overly semantic.accordingly,we find that the district court met its responsibility to provide the jury with a clear articulation of the relevant law.see united states goldblatt,cir.
the trial judge is permitted considerable latitude to summarize and comment upon the evidence,provided that the jury is neither confused nor misled.am.home assur.sunshine supermarket,cir hickey united states,cir.jury instructions are to be read as a whole,united states flores,cir,and it is wrong to suggest that the word accuracy so infected the instructions as to confuse or mislead the jury.viewing the jury instructions in their entirety and in context,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion.therefore,we will affirm donlin liability verdict against philips 
having determined that the district court did not err regarding liability,we turn to the more complicated issue of damages.
as a threshold matter,philips contends that the district court damages analysis was flawed because it rested on the admission of improper testimony.specifically,philips avers that the district court erred under rule of the federal rules of evidence in allowing donlin to provide specialized or technical testimony regarding her compensatory damages.as to back pay,the district court allowed donlin to testify not only about her actual earnings,but also about her estimated lost earnings and pension benefits.with regard to front pay,donlin testimony detailed the number of years she intended to work and the annual salary differential between philips and the other companies where she was employed.in addition,donlin estimated her future pension value,performed a probability of death calculation,and reduced her front pay award to its present value.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings,including whether opinions are admissible under rule,for abuse of discretion.see united states leo,cir however,we will only reverse if we find the district court error was not harmless.see becker arco chem,cir.
rule governs opinion testimony by lay witnesses 
if the witness is not testifying as an expert,the witness testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are a rationally based on the perception of the witness,and b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.
subsection c was added in to eliminate the risk that the reliability requirements set forth in rule will be evaded through the simple expedient of proffering an expert in lay witness clothing.advisory committee notes for the amendments hereinafter notes to amendments see also united states garcia,cir the purpose of subsection c is to prevent a party from conflating expert and lay opinion testimony thereby conferring an aura of expertise on a witness without satisfying the reliability standard for expert testimony set forth in rule.as a result,lay testimony must result from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life,as opposed to a process which can be mastered only by specialists in the field.notes to amendments.
this does not mean that an expert is always necessary whenever the testimony is of a specialized or technical nature.when a lay witness has particularized knowledge by virtue of her experience,she may if the subject matter is specialized or the testimony is based upon the layperson personal knowledge rather than on specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.see notes to amendments.at the same time,we have consistently required that lay testimony requiring future projections of a business or operation come from someone who has intimate and thorough knowledge of the business gathered from either a lengthy tenure or a position of authority.for instance,in lightning lube,witco,cir,we allowed a company founder and owner to testify regarding his lost future profits and harm to the value of his business.id.at.though the testimony concerned a specialized field and involved predictions about future business performance,we found that the witness had adequate personal knowledge in light of his experience with the business contracts,operating costs,and competition.in re merritt logan,cir principal shareholder of business properly testified concerning business projections where he was intimately involved with the investments and management of the business,kimball int l,cir company licensed public accountant was allowed to testify regarding lost profits based on his personal knowledge of company balance sheets.the advisory committee notes to the amendment to rule specifically address lightning lube and note that its holding remains undisturbed by the amendment.
we have extended lightning lube personal knowledge exception to plaintiffs testifying in employment discrimination suits.in maxfield sinclair international,cir,we allowed a plaintiff alleging age discrimination to testify as to his projected earnings and to reduce those earnings to present value.id.at.the facts of maxfield are significantly different from donlin case,however,because the plaintiff worked for the defendant company for nearly years.given his significant employment history,we recognized that maxfield would be able to base his request for front pay upon his former earnings without making any projection in earnings for which expert testimony was required.id.in contrast,donlin was only a temporary employee of philips for a term of less than one year and did not develop knowledge of the company salary structure,advancement opportunities,pay raises,or employment patterns.therefore,her testimony can not be considered within her personal knowledge and she does not qualify for the personalized knowledge exception.
in crediting donlin testimony,the district court relied principally on paolella,cir.there,paolella sued under delaware law for wrongful discharge after he was fired for complaining about his company illegal billing practices.see id.at.the jury found in his favor and awarded in back pay and in front pay.id.at.the company contended there was insufficient evidence to support the jury front pay award and argued that paolella did not offer expert actuarial testimony to support his claim.id.at.paolella had been terminated in early,and presented evidence of his salary from to,as well as his earnings for.id.we found that based on this information,the jury could reasonably calculate a front pay award according to the district court instructions.id.at.accordingly,we held that we do not believe the absence of expert testimony renders the jury calculation improper.id.
though paolella might seem analogous to donlin case,the district court reliance thereon is problematic for two reasons.first,paolella predated the amendment to rule.that amendment added a new requirement for c regarding technical or specialized we must question the vitality of paolella in light of the additional requirement.
second,the testimony offered in paolella is distinguishable from donlin case.the only front pay testimony given in paolella related to straightforward evidence of the plaintiff salary as well as an estimate that the plaintiff would work for another years,until age there was no indication paolella required the witness to undertake complicated tasks such as calculating,assessing amortization rates,estimating pay raises,discounting to present value,or calculating earnings potential in a pension portfolio.
in that regard,our more recent holding in eichorn v.at t,cir,is more on point.there,a group of employees sued claiming a violation of their pension rights after their employer merged with a larger company.id.at.the plaintiffs failed to produce an expert witness on damages and instead relied on a report and testimony from plaintiffs counsel son.id.at.the witness made various like those made by when plaintiffs would have retired how their salaries would have increased in the merged company what choices the plaintiffs would have made with respect to pension benefits and the life expectancy of each plaintiff.id.at.we acknowledged that pursuant to lightning lube and maxfield,expert testimony is not always required to prove damages in cases where projected future earnings are part of the calculation,id.at,but explained that rule requires a lay witness to have a reasonable basis grounded either in experience or specialized knowledge for arriving at the opinion that he or she expresses,id.at.because the witness was testifying based on neither experience nor personal knowledge and the calculations required were sufficiently complex,we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in barring the lay testimony.id.
in accordance with eichorn,we find that the district court should have barred portions of donlin testimony requiring technical or specialized knowledge.donlin admitted that she was not a professional,nor a finance major or forensic economist.under the lightning lube exception,donlin testimony regarding facts within her personal knowledge such as her current and past earnings was appropriate.but,much of donlin testimony went beyond those easily verifiable facts within her personal knowledge and instead required speculation for which she lacked the necessary training.for instance,in calculating her front pay,donlin speculated that philips would provide a annual pay raise in fact,the company did not provide an increase of more than in the years immediately prior to the trial.additionally,having no experience with retirement benefits,donlin misinterpreted philips definition of pensionable earnings and erroneously assumed a flat per year on pension earnings based only on an example in the philips pension manual.after admitting that she had never performed a discounting calculation prior to the day before trial,donlin testified that she received instructions from her lawyer the night before regarding the proper discount rate finally,donlin misapplied the life expectancy charts and therefore did not properly account for the probability of her death.
in sum,donlin testimony crossed the line into subject areas that demand expert testimony.specifically,we find that donlin testimony regarding the pension component of her back pay damages was improper on the issue of front pay,donlin lay testimony was inappropriate with regard to her estimate of the annual pay raises at philips,her estimated pension value,and the discounts she made for the probability of death and to find the present value of the award.because this testimony was of a specialized or technical nature and was not within donlin personal knowledge,the district court abused its discretion in allowing her to offer it.a trial judge must rigorously examine the reliability of a layperson opinion by ensuring that the witness possesses sufficient specialized knowledge or experience which is germane to the opinion offered.asplundh div.benton harbor eng g,cir.here,the district court erred in that regard.
furthermore,it is readily apparent that this error was not harmless.see hirst inverness hotel,cir.because donlin improper testimony constituted a significant share of the damages evidence presented at trial,we can not find that it is highly probable that the erroneous admission of her testimony did not contribute to the damages award.see advanced,arden med,cir.accordingly,we will vacate the judgment of the district court in this regard and remand for further proceedings.the district court may choose to hold a new trial,or,if it believes donlin has had a full and fair opportunity to present the case,see weisgram marley,d,it may enter judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.given the district court knowledge of witnesses,testimony,and issues,neely martin eby constr,d,we believe the district court is better positioned to make that judgment.see weisgram,at.
in light of our decision to remand for further proceedings,we will address the remainder of philips arguments to provide guidance to the district court.
first,philips contends that donlin should not be entitled to compensatory damages because she found better employment after philips refused to hire her.we must address both back pay and front pay.
back pay is designed to make victims of unlawful discrimination whole by restoring them to the position they would have been in absent the discrimination.see loeffler frank,d.section g of the civil rights act of,which governs back pay awards in title vii cases,provides 
if the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice,and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.
back pay is not an automatic or mandatory remedy,but one which the courts may invoke at their equitable discretion.albemarle paper moody,d see also waddell small tube,cir.when a plaintiff finds employment that is equivalent or better than the position she was wrongly denied,the right to damages ends because it is no longer necessary to achieve an equitable purpose the plaintiff at that point has been restored to the position she would have been in absent the discrimination.see ford motor eeoc,d.
philips contends that back pay damages are not required because donlin obtained employment with another company,romark logistics,eight months after her employment with philips ended.donlin worked at romark logistics from september until august before voluntarily leaving to take a position at mission foods.her employment at mission foods continued through the trial.philips asserts that donlin work at romark restored her to the position she would have been in absent the alleged discrimination,and her back pay should terminate at the time she was rehired 
in light of the facts found by the district court,we disagree because philips understates the requirements for an award of back pay and,as a result,comes to a legal conclusion that is inconsistent with the district court findings of fact.those findings of fact are no longer valid,however,because the numbers used by the district court were based on improper testimony.our analysis is nonetheless illustrative and should guide the district court on remand.
from a legal perspective,the fact that donlin found a job is insufficient by itself to demonstrate that she reestablished herself in the workplace such that she should be ineligible for back pay damages the law requires that she find new employment that is better or substantially equivalent.ford motor,at.substantially equivalent employment affords virtually identical promotional opportunities,compensation,job responsibilities,and status as the position from which the title vii claimant has been discriminatorily terminated.booker taylor milk,cir.
the district court found,as a matter of fact,that donlin would have made working for philips from the time of her termination until the time of trial and that she lost pension earnings in that same period in the amount of for a total of.damages memorandum at.during that same time period,the district court found that donlin actual earnings were.id comparing the two figures,the district court concluded as a matter of law,that donlin suffered a back pay loss of based on the difference between the amount she earned from her discharge until the time of trial and the approximate amount she would have earned had she remained at philips.id.
philips asserts that donlin received greater compensation than she would have received had she been hired by philips because she worked overtime hours in her new job and received a greater annual pay raise than the raises given by philips.id.the district court undisputed factual findings at the first trial do not comport with this conclusion,however.instead,they indicate that donlin earned less in her new job,even taking into account her overtime compensation and pay raise these facts supported a finding that the two jobs were not substantially equivalent.if the evidence on remand supports a similar finding,the district court should again conclude as a matter of law that donlin can only be made title vii awarded sufficient back pay to make up the difference.
though back pay makes a plaintiff whole from the time of discrimination until trial,a plaintiff injury may continue thereafter.accordingly,courts may award front pay where a victim of employment discrimination will experience a loss of future earnings because she can not be placed in the position she was unlawfully denied.see maxfield,at.front pay is an alternative to the traditional equitable remedy of reinstatement,squires bonser,cir,which would be inappropriate where there is a likelihood of continuing disharmony between the parties or unavailable because no comparable position exists.see blum witco chem,cir goss exxon office,cir.because the award of front pay is discretionary,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.see in re cohn,cir feldman phila.hous,cir.
the jury recommended a award of to cover the difference in donlin salary and pension earnings for years,adjusted to account for the probability of death and discounted to present value.the district court modified that award,limiting front pay damages to years,which totaled.despite this reduction,philips asserts that the district court award of front pay was erroneous in two respects.
first,philips claims that donlin should not be entitled to front pay because she mitigated her damages by reestablishing herself in the workforce before trial.philips cites ford motor for the proposition that damages are inappropriate where they would catapult the plaintiff into a better position than they would have enjoyed in the absence of discrimination.at.as we have explained,however,the district court found that donlin was not in the same position she would have been in had philips hired her as a employee.instead,the district court concluded that her salary would have been higher had she been hired and remained at philips when a defendant front pay objection is predicated upon the same objections regarding mitigation of damages which we have rejected with regard to back pay,we reject the front pay argument as well.see goss,at.
second,philips asserts that an award of front pay based on a period was inappropriate because it involved speculation regarding market conditions,donlin future earnings,and her length of employment.the district court agreed with this argument in part when it reduced the advisory jury award of front pay from years to years.damages memorandum at an award of front pay until retirement at age,a year period,would be too speculative.philips contends that the time period is still too long,noting that the mountaintop facility where donlin was employed is subject to unpredictable market adjustments in demand and the availability of exclusive contracts with major can not be accurately estimated for years.
because a claimant work and life expectancy are pertinent factors in calculating front pay,anastasio schering,cir,such an award necessarily implicates a prediction about the future.dillon coles,cir.accordingly,we will not refuse to award front pay merely because some prediction is necessary.green usx,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,reinstated in relevant part,cir.instead,we allow the district court to exercise discretion in selecting a date for an equitable front pay remedy subject to the limitation that front pay only be awarded for a reasonable future period required for the victim to reestablish her rightful place in the job market.goss,at.
in goss,the plaintiff complained that the district court cut off her front pay after just four months,arguing that front pay should be extended because she was unlikely to earn as much money in her new sales job.at.goss earnings were and her commissions were likely to be lower in her new position given her lack of familiarity with her new employer products.id.accordingly,goss argued that her front pay should be extended even though she found new employment.id.we disagreed,finding that the question whether goss would be less successful in her new job required unreasonable speculation regarding future market conditions and the company success.id.therefore,we declined to lengthen the front pay damages period.id.at.
in green,however,we distinguished goss and imposed a front pay award for a class of plaintiffs asserting discrimination in the hiring process of a pennsylvania steel company.at.because the plaintiffs presented evidence for the period immediately following trial,we found that calculating front pay damages based on a period was a reasonable compromise and not wild speculation because it would help offset future harm that would certainly be caused by past discrimination.id.emphasis in original.
though the damages period granted by the district court exceeds that awarded in green,we note that there will often be uncertainty concerning how long the period should be,and the evidence adduced at trial will rarely point to a single,certain number of weeks,months,or years.more likely,the evidence will support a range of reasonable periods.within this range,the district court should decide which award is most appropriate to make the claimant whole.see,whittington nordam group,cir reed lawrence,cir 
such an exercise of discretion may result in an award different from what one or both of the parties would prefer.this possibility is caused by the inexactness of predictive evidence for front pay,and our standard of review abuse of discretion grants considerable leeway to district courts to grant an award that best serves title vii remedial purpose.
we have not yet spoken precedentially regarding the precise length of time that is appropriate for an award of front pay.indeed,in one case,a award of x years may be appropriate,while on different facts,a award for that same term of years would be inappropriate.these decisions are left to the sound discretion of the district court and every case must be considered on its particular facts.we note,however,that other courts of appeals have affirmed awards of years or more.see,meacham knolls atomic power,cir affirming a district court award of front pay for years to victims of age discrimination,vacated on other grounds sub nom kapl,meacham,d pierce atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir front pay award did not constitute an abuse of discretion hukkanen int l union of operating eng rs,hoisting portable local,cir same.additionally,we note that in blum,we held that awarding front pay until plaintiffs projected retirement in eight years did not require unreasonable speculation.at.we see no reason why a front pay award for eight years would be proper,but an award for years constitutes an abuse of discretion.this is especially true here,where an advisory jury recommended front pay for years.
accordingly,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded donlin front pay for years.
philips next argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of compensatory damages in light of donlin subsequent employment decisions.in september,eight months after philips declined to hire her,donlin found employment at romark logistics where she worked for nearly two years.in august,donlin voluntarily left romark for a position at mission foods because it was closer to her home.philips contends donlin transfer to a job at mission was inconsistent with her duty to mitigate damages and the district court erred by forcing philips to suffer the decrease in donlin wages in the form of increased compensatory damages.this argument is inconsistent with the record.
damages are reduced under title vii for interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against.g emphasis added.the availability of an equivalent or better job terminates the ongoing ill effects of the defendant discriminatory action,so the right to damages ends when such an opportunity becomes available.ford motor,at.to hold otherwise,the supreme court reasoned,would requir e a defendant to provide what amounts to a form of unemployment insurance id.at.the burden falls on the defendant employer to prove a failure to mitigate by demonstrating that substantially equivalent work was available,and that the claimant did not exercise reasonable diligence to obtain it.le,at.
our sister circuit courts of appeals have held that one must make reasonable efforts to mitigate her loss of income,and only unjustified refusals to find or accept other employment are penalized.nlrb arduini,cir.an employee need not seek employment which involves conditions that are substantially more onerous than her previous position.nlrb madison courier.notably,the employee is not required to accept employment which is located an unreasonable distance from her home.id.at.it is well settled that a claimant has not failed to make a reasonable effort to mitigate damages where she refused to accept employment that is an unreasonable distance from her residence.rasimas.dep t of mental health,cir.
philips argues that donlin commute to romark was not unreasonable and that many of the employees donlin worked with at philips commuted even farther.because the commute to romark was not unreasonable,philips contends,donlin failed to mitigate her damages by voluntarily accepting a position at mission.we disagree because simple math reveals that donlin decision to work closer to home did not constitute a failure to mitigate.when donlin left romark,she was making per hour,but when she moved to mission,she was making on
