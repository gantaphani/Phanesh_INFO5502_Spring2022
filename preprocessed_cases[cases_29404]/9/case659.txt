on december,jerome jarrett fled the scene of a minor traffic accident and was subsequently apprehended by shadow,a police dog controlled by yarmouth police officer peter mcclelland.shadow bit jarrett at least twice on the leg in the course of corralling him before officers arrived to take the suspect into custody.jarrett filed claims against officer mcclelland and robert chapman,the yarmouth chief of police alleging that mcclelland used excessive force in releasing shadow,and that chief chapman tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified,unreasonable and excessive force regarding mcclelland use of a dog to attack and bite.jarrett also brought suit against the town of yarmouth,seeking to hold the municipality liable under a monell theory,see monell department of soc.services of city of new york,d,for promulgating a dog apprehension policy that deprived him of his constitutional rights.
after a bifurcated trial,a jury returned verdicts against both officer mcclelland and chief chapman the defendants now contest the verdicts on appeal,arguing that the court erred in denying their request for qualified immunity,and raising a host of evidentiary challenges.after careful review,we find that jarrett suffered no constitutional injury.accordingly,we vacate the judgments against mcclelland,chapman,and the town of yarmouth.
in the early morning hours of december,yarmouth police officer gerard britt observed the defendant sitting in his car in a motel parking lot off of route.officer britt then saw jarrett quickly exit the motel parking lot and drive off in the opposite direction on route.britt radioed to fellow officer richard white,and the two officers unobtrusively tracked jarrett,who was driving in excess of sixty miles per hour.several minutes later,jarrett exited into another parking lot off of route.officer white followed jarrett off the exit while officer britt continued up the road and entered the parking lot from the opposite end.the parties dispute what happened next.the appellants claim that officer britt,now driving toward jarrett,activated his lights and signaled for jarrett to stop.yet jarrett continued driving directly toward britt,who swerved abruptly and narrowly avoided a collision.jarrett insists that britt never activated his lights and that there was no.both parties agree,however,that jarrett proceeded to drive into an adjoining parking lot,where he ran into a cement post.jarrett then exited the vehicle,scaled a nearby fence,and fled into a residential neighborhood.
at this point,two additional yarmouth police officers joined the chase.officer cheryl nugent gomsey had clocked jarrett driving over the speed limit while being followed by officers white and britt on route,and also observed him hit the cement post and escape over the fence.officer mcclelland,the officer for the yarmouth police,was also radioed to the scene by officer white,who reported mistakenly,as it turned out that he recognized jarrett as a suspect in a prior armed robbery.officer gomsey arrived at the scene shortly after jarrett fled from the parking lot,and teamed with officer mcclelland and his dog shadow to track and apprehend jarrett.
after helping shadow over the fence,officer mcclelland placed him on his customary lead and followed closely behind as the dog tracked jarrett.officer gomsey continued the pursuit at some distance behind mcclelland and shadow so as not to contaminate the scent.for approximately twenty minutes shadow led the officers along a circuitous route through the residential neighborhood until mcclelland spotted jarrett standing in the middle of the road,approximately fifty yards away.officer gomsey had fallen too far behind to see mcclelland,shadow,or jarrett,but she heard mcclelland yell three times stop,police,or i send the dog.mcclelland testified that after he issued these warnings,jarrett accelerated and disappeared around a corner.only then,according to mcclelland,did he release shadow with instructions to locate jarrett and hold him.
shadow is trained to execute the bite and hold technique upon release,meaning that he will bite and maintain his hold upon a suspect until the handler orders him to let go.accordingly,a suspect who struggles with a dog trained to bite and hold may be bitten several times if the dog loses his grip and is forced to his hold.yet the undisputed evidence at trial indicated that the vast majority of jurisdictions within the united states employ policies.an alternative technique,not widely adopted,is the circle and bark method.a dog trained to circle and bark will circle his target,barking,until his handler arrives.the dog will bite only if the target then attempts to move outside the circle.
because shadow was trained to bite and hold,officer mcclelland knew with a high probability that if shadow was released,he would bite the fleeing suspect.in fact,within thirty seconds of his release,shadow apprehended jarrett by biting him on the leg.shadow was only out of mcclelland sight for those thirty seconds as soon as mcclelland found shadow he commanded him to release jarrett,and shadow complied.an ambulance arrived within five minutes and transported jarrett to a hospital,where he received stitches for cuts on his lower right leg.for the next two weeks jarrett received daily medical treatment for his injuries one year after the incident he still complained of pain and an inability to stand.
not surprisingly,jarrett recounts a different version of events.at trial,he testified that after finishing his shift at work,he picked up a car that he had recently purchased.he claimed not to have noticed the police officers trailing him on route,and further testified that he pulled off the road into the parking lot because he was experiencing brake problems and trying to find a place to slow down.jarrett admitted seeing police lights shortly before hitting the cement post,but insisted that he never saw a police cruiser heading toward his car.according to jarrett,he fled after hitting the cement post because i was driving illegally for one.and i knew that if i got arrested,i was going to end up going to jail.indeed,the record indicates that prior to the events in question,a warrant for jarrett arrest was issued after he failed to appear at a surrender hearing on a separate matter.however,both parties agree that the police officers pursuing jarrett on december were not aware of this outstanding arrest warrant.
after jumping the fence,jarrett testified that he slipped and fell down,at which point he heard someone yell stop.he rose to his feet,and again heard someone yell,stop,or i let the dog go.jarrett claims that he stopped running and put his hands in the air.soon thereafter,however,shadow jumped on his back and bit him twice on the leg in response to verbal commands issued from someone jarrett could not see.jarrett was ultimately apprehended by officers mcclelland and gomsey and charged with several misdemeanor offenses operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license leaving the scene of an accident operating an uninsured motor vehicle and failing to stop for a police officer.he was also charged with several civil infractions operating an unregistered motor vehicle failing to yield at an intersection speeding and operating a motor vehicle with defective equipment.
on december,jarrett filed section claims against the town of yarmouth and five yarmouth police officers in the district court of massachusetts.jarrett complaint alleged inter alia that officer mcclelland act of releasing shadow constituted excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment,characterizing shadow as an instrument of potentially deadly force.jarrett sought compensatory and punitive damages from mcclelland for his alleged use of excessive force,and punitive damages from chief chapman for tolerating a pattern and practice of excessive force by officer mcclelland.
the case proceeded to a jury trial,which the court divided into two phases.in the first phase of the trial,the jurors considered jarrett excessive force claim against officer mcclelland.they ultimately returned a verdict for jarrett,finding by a preponderance of the evidence that officer peter mcclelland used excessive force on jerome jarrett on.however,the jury only awarded jarrett one dollar in compensatory damages and no punitive damages.although,as noted above,the town of yarmouth was not mentioned in either the jury instructions or on the verdict form,the jury,unprompted,appended to their verdict a recommendation that the town of yarmouth be required from this time forward to retrain current units to use the find and bark method.following the verdict,mcclelland and chapman moved for judgment as a matter of law,renewing the argument that they were entitled to qualified immunity.
the judge denied the motion,and the trial moved into its second phase,where the jury considered jarrett claim for punitive damages against chief chapman.after hearing the evidence,the jury completed the verdict form for phase ii.in response to the first question did defendant peter mcclelland act in accordance with the town of yarmouth sic policy and procedure when he released the dog on december,the jury answered yes.as noted,the jury had earlier concluded in phase i that officer mcclelland used excessive force in apprehending jarrett on the night in question.see supra.these two findings,coupled with the jury admonition that the town should retrain its dogs to use the find and bark method,suggest that the jury found the town of yarmouth bite and hold policy to be unconstitutional.the jury ultimately awarded jarrett punitive damages in the amount of all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the plaintiff attorney.the defense objected,and the court ordered the jury to attach a specific dollar amount to their verdict.after further deliberation,the jury came back with a figure of,and the trial court entered judgment for jarrett in the amount of for phase i,and for phase ii.
mcclelland and chapman subsequently filed motions for judgments as a matter of law,and,in the alternative,sought new trials under federal rule of civil procedure b.the motions articulated two grounds for relief the two officers were entitled to qualified immunity,and the evidence did not support the verdict in either phase of the trial.the district court denied these motions,and the defendants appealed.
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,jarrett argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the trial court failed to enter a final appealable judgment or order.specifically,he points to the district court failure to make any formal disposition of his claims against officer gomsey,officer britt,officer white,and the town of yarmouth.according to the appellant in a case such as this one where an appeal is taken from an order or judgment disposing of claims against less than all defendants,the appeal is premature and must be dismissed.
our jurisdiction is limited to all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.united states leichter,cir quoting emphasis added.we have previously observed that a final decision is ordinarily one which disposes of all the rights of all the parties to an action.in re licht semonoff,cir.on numerous occasions,however,the supreme court has stressed that should be construed practically rather than technically.see firestone tire rubber risjord,d referring to a tradition of giving a practical rather than a technical construction cox broad.cohn,d.applying this pragmatic approach,at least two circuits have concluded that a federal district court decision is appealable under section even if it does not formally dispose of claims that were abandoned at trial.see vaughn mobil oil,cir american nat.bank trust of chicago bailey,cir,cert.denied,d.the fifth circuit remarked in vaughn that it was inclined to fasten finality upon a judgment that reflects the intention of the judge to dispose of all the business before him or her.at.hence,a n order that effectively ends the litigation on the merits is an appealable final judgment even if the district court does not formally include judgment on a claim that has been abandoned.id.at citations omitted.here,jarrett does not contest that his claims against gomsey,britt,and white were abandoned below.accordingly,the district court failure to enter judgment for the three officers is a technical defect that does not undermine our appellate jurisdiction.firestone tire,at.
jarrett also claims,however,that the court failed to enter a verdict on jarrett municipal liability claim against the town of yarmouth.we disagree.the district court properly entered judgment against officer mcclelland and chief chapman,both of whom were sued in their individual and official capacities.jarrett himself argues that w hen an individual is sued in his official capacity,the lawsuit is in reality a claim against the entity.see brandon holt,d,cir an official capacity suit is,in reality,a suit against the governmental entity,not against the governmental actor.as a general rule,therefore,a court entering judgment against municipal officers in their official capacities is entering judgment against the municipality as well.superficially,however,the facts of this case present an additional complication.while jarrett sued the officers in both their individual and official capacities,the jury award of punitive damages in phase ii appears to resolve only jarrett claim against chief chapman in his individual capacity.see biggs meadows,cir an indication that a suit has been brought against a state actor personally may be a request for punitive damages,since such relief is unavailable in official capacity suits.
upon closer examination,the jury award of punitive damages on the phase ii verdict form does not undermine the finality of the district court decision with respect to the town.the proceedings below clearly reflect jarrett intent to resolve the monell municipal liability issue by soliciting the jury response to question one on the phase ii verdict form did peter mcclelland act in accordance with the town of yarmouth policy and procedure when he released the dog on december,the second question on the phase ii verdict form has the plaintiff proved by a preponderance of the evidence that chief chapman permitted and tolerated a pattern and practice of unjustified,unreasonable and excessive force by officer mcclelland with respect to the latter deployment of shadow was then intended to resolve chapman liability in his individual capacity for faulty supervision,and the punitive damages awarded related only to chapman in his individual capacity.
the jury affirmative response to question,coupled with its earlier finding in phase i that officer mcclelland used excessive force to apprehend jarrett,established a basis for imposing liability on the town for promulgating an unconstitutional precise disposition that jarrett sought for his monell claim.by entering judgment on both verdicts,the district court terminated litigation on the merits with respect to mcclelland,chapman and the town,see vaughn,at,thereby establishing a final,appealable decision.accordingly,finding no merit in jarrett jurisdictional claims,we proceed to address the alleged constitutional violation.
b.the alleged constitutional violation 
the primacy of the constitutional question in the qualified immunity inquiry 
after the jury issued its verdict against chief chapman in phase ii of the bifurcated proceedings,mcclelland and chapman moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing inter alia that the verdicts against them could not stand because the two officers were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied their motions,and mcclelland and chapman now argue on appeal that these rulings were in error.a district court denial of qualified immunity is a legal question that we review de novo.davis rennie,cir.in saucier katz,d,the supreme court offered the following general guidance to courts reviewing qualified immunity determinations a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right this must be the initial inquiry.id.at.
