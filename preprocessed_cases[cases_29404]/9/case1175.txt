yves gautier petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of immigration judge ij michael rocco that denied his application for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina,and,respectively,and for relief pursuant to the convention against torture cat and its implementing regulations.in re yves gautier,no.a,aff g immig.buffalo.we vacate and remand because the ij erred in a number of respects,including failing to take account of testimony showing that the harm suffered was on account of political opinion misapplying bia and second circuit precedent regarding the meaning of the statutory term persecution requiring physical evidence of the abuse claimed to have suffered without explaining why he believed such evidence was reasonably available and discounting portions of testimony because of use of false identification documents without explaining what weight he assigned to this factor and without distinguishing between the use of false documents to flee persecution and to attempt to enter the united states illegally.
background 
is a native and citizen of cameroon.in,he attempted to enter the united states illegally,through canada,but was apprehended and detained at the border.he filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the cat,in which he stated that he feared returning to cameroon because he had been persecuted there on account of his political opinion.he claimed to have suffered persecution because of his involvement with the social democratic front of cameroon sdf,a leading political opposition party.at his hearing,testified to having been detained and beaten by cameroonian authorities on multiple occasions.specifically,he described the following incidents in his testimony.
in january,was arrested and detained for one day because of his participation in a demonstration against the government arrest of a prominent cameroonian writer.in november,he was arrested for protesting against a curfew and was beaten repeatedly with a cane on the soles of his feet.in,he was again arrested,this time during a student demonstration,and was held for two days.
in,was arrested at gunpoint by the cameroonian secret police and detained for between three and five days after they caught him distributing political flyers.the police told him that he had been arrested because he was in violation of the security of the state.was taken to the police station,where the police handcuffed him,chained his legs and beat him on the soles of his feet with the flat side of a machete for about four hours.every half hour or so,the police stopped beating him and made him jump on gravel in the yard outside the police station while singing songs in praise of paul biya,the president of cameroon.he was beaten multiple times during his detention and deprived of food and water.
after his release,borrowed a cousin french passport and fled to canada.once in canada,he went directly from the airport to an immigration office,where he applied for refugee status using his real name.while he was in canada,his brother was detained for several weeks by cameroonian authorities.shortly after his release,brother died after developing abdominal pains application for refugee status was eventually denied,and he was ordered to leave canada.he left on january,and returned to cameroon,where he attended his brother funeral.
when arrived at the airport in cameroon,he was asked by a police officer what he had been doing in canada.he admitted that he had applied for refugee status there.the police officer accused him of dirty ing our name,giv ing cameroon a bad reputation,and took him to a room where he was held for about minutes and forced to sign a document that he was not allowed to read and that he later learned was a warrant for his own arrest.a police officer told him not to continue his political activities.the police confiscated his passport,but did not detain him further at that time.
in the weeks following his return to cameroon,the police came to his home at least twice looking for him and left him summons forms ordering him to appear at the police station.they also broke down the door to his room and took books,papers and magazines addressing political subjects.at this point,effectively went into hiding,staying away from his home.in april,however,he attended a political meeting,and when he left,he and another political activist,samuel etouke,were arrested.
the police took and etouke to the police station.the station compound had a high bar suspended on two pillars.the officers made etouke,who at this point was naked,climb onto a bench so that his arms were level with the bar.they then cuffed his arms to the bar and removed the bench so that he was suspended in by his arms.while he was in this position,the officers beat him on the back and buttocks with a wire and rubber instrument for ten to fifteen minutes.the officers then turned to,who also was naked,and did the same.for about two hours,they took turns beating and etouke in this position.afterwards,the officers locked them in a cell,in only their underwear,with no food or water.the police kept and etouke in this cell for five or six days and beat them each day in the same manner.was taken to the police commissioner,who said that he had recommended that the officers continue to beat and that was going to spend a few years in jail.
after five or six days,the police transferred to the new bell central prison.etouke was sent to a hospital with a broken arm and untreated diabetes,and he died there.on first day at new bell,he was given a bucket of water mixed with urine and told to shower with it.otherwise,was not mistreated during his three months in prison.he was released after his mother bribed a prison guard.
once released,he traveled to nigeria,and then to canada,using another person french passport.after arriving in canada,he sent the french passport back to the person who helped me with it.he then stole and used a canadian identification card to attempt to enter the united states,where he planned to apply for asylum,but american border officials recognized his documents as fraudulent and detained him.testified that he used the stolen documents,rather than simply asking for asylum at the border,because he was unaware of how the asylum process worked in the united states.in august,he pled guilty to a charge of attempt ing to enter the united states by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact.a.
while in detention,applied for asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief,claiming that he had suffered persecution on account of political opinion.in support of his application,submitted proof of his identity and nationality,sdf membership cards dating back to,the police summons forms issued before his most recent arrest and letters from his wife and mother corroborating his story.on november,after a removal hearing,the ij denied application because he concluded that the evidence had submitted was insufficient to compel a finding that he had been persecuted on account of his political opinion 
the ij offered a number of reasons for this conclusion.as to the two arrests and the arrest,the ij found that there was no evidence that the arrests were motivated by a desire to punish the respondent on account of political beliefs,and had offered no evidence of permanent or serious injury amounting to persecution.regarding the arrest and beating,the ij found that there was no evidence that the cameroonian authorities were aware of political views when they arrested him or that they questioned him about his views during his detention,and had failed to proffer physical evidence of abuse consistent with the alleged mistreatment or other evidence of medical treatment for alleged injuries.moreover,the ij noted the following other facts that undercut claim cameroonian authorities had not searched for while he was in canada mother and sister had not been threatened or harmed because of him and his testimony regarding his brother death did not compel the conclusion that his brother was killed as claimed or that any political opinions held by him were attributed to.finally,as to the april incident,the ij concluded that had not established political persecution because his credibility was undermined by the fact that cameroonian authorities summoned him for a prosecutorial purpose,not to persecute him for his political opinion,and only arrested him when he failed to appear,and dishonesty and untruthfulness and his use of fraudulent documents.
on june,the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion pursuant to e and filed this timely petition for review.
discussion 
to establish eligibility for asylum,which is available at the attorney general discretion,an applicant must establish that he or she is unwilling or unable to return to his or her native country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of one of five protected grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.a see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.persecution is the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ on the basis of a protected statutory ground it encompasses a variety of forms of adverse treatment,including threatening violence and physical abuse,but does not include mere harassment.ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir internal quotation marks omitted.unlike asylum,withholding of removal under the ina is nondiscretionary,and to establish eligibility an applicant must make the more stringent showing that his or her life or freedom would more likely than not be threatened on account of a protected ground if he or she were removed.b a see ramsameachire,at.to obtain withholding of removal under the cat,an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed.
where,as here,the bia summarily adopts or affirms an ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision directly.see twum ins.cir.we review de novo ijs findings concerning the legal sufficiency of the evidence,as they present questions regarding the application of law to fact.ins,cir.moreover,using an inappropriately stringent standard when evaluating an applicant testimony constitutes legal,not factual error,and we review de novo whether such a standard has been used.cao he lin dep t of justice,cir quoting,at citation omitted emphasis in original.we review ijs factual findings,however,under the substantial evidence standard,sustaining all findings that are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole,at quoting diallo ins,cir see b b providing that administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
despite errors in an ij decision,we will not remand if it would be futile to do so.xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir.remand would be futile if we can confidently predict that the ij would reach the same decision absent the errors that were made.id.at quoting cao he lin,at.that is,to deny review in the face of errors,a court must have confidence that an proceeding would yield the same result.see li zu guan ins,cir.
here,the ij rejected claim of political persecution.he never made a specific adverse credibility determination.instead,from what we can discern,the ij appears to have analyzed in turn the various incidents of abuse to which testified and concluded,on different grounds,that the and arrests the arrest,detention and beating and the april arrest,detention and beating did not constitute political persecution.this opinion tracks the organization of the ij decision.we find that the ij reasoning as to each incident of alleged persecution was flawed in multiple respects.because we can not confidently predict that the ij would reach the same result absent these errors,we remand to the bia.
i.the and arrests 
the ij appears to have accepted as true testimony regarding the and arrests.he concluded,however,that had not demonstrated a connection between these incidents and his political views and that in any event the harm claimed to have suffered did not rise to the level of persecution.as a finding of fact,we review the first conclusion for substantial evidence,at.we review the second conclusion,which involves the application of a legal standard to established facts,de novo.id.we address these conclusions in turn.
whether the harm was on account of political opinion 
testimony regarding the and arrests clearly indicates a connection between his political activities and his mistreatment at the hands of cameroonian authorities.as to the first incident,testified that he was arrested because he was participating in a demonstration against the arrest of a prominent writer.as to the second incident,he claimed he was arrested for demonstrating against a curfew.regarding the incident,he testified that he was arrested during a student demonstration.thus testified that his mistreatment in each instance was the direct result of his political activities.the ij conclusion that had failed to show that the arrests bore any connection to his political views fails entirely to take account of testimony and therefore is not supported by substantial evidence.see ivanishvili,at i n the face of the substantial testimony and corroborating documentation petitioner submitted to the ij regarding her persecution,we find it remarkable,not to mention frustrative of judicial review,that the ij did not in any way analyze or weigh that testimony.
whether the alleged harm amounted to persecution 
the ij also found that the and arrests and detentions did not rise to the level of persecution.in reaching this conclusion,the ij stated that on the occasion allegedly was mistreated he offered no evidence of permanent or serious injury amounting to persecution.we review de novo whether the ij applied the correct legal standard for persecution claims,see,at,and conclude that the ij erred.the bia does not require an applicant claiming persecution to demonstrate permanent or serious injury.see in re,bia finding that the applicant had suffered persecution,even though he had not suffered any permanent or serious injuries,where he was physically attacked three times,his apartment was broken into and his possessions destroyed and stolen,he received threatening fliers and his son was beaten at school and forced to undress in front of classmates.we have explained that persecution encompasses a variety of forms of adverse treatment,including threatening violence and physical abuse or forms of harm.ivanishvili,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original.we have further stated that evidence of physical abuse and violence at the hands of government agents or private actors who behave with impunity in the face of government reluctance to intervene,if credible,may preclude a finding that the conduct is mere harassment that does not as a matter of law rise to the level of persecution,for violent conduct generally goes beyond the mere annoyance and distress that characterize harassment.ivanishvili,at.thus,the ij apparent requirement that show permanent or serious injury was in error.
there was an additional fundamental error in the ij analysis.in assessing the question of whether mistreatment amounted to persecution,the ij considered the and incidents separately from the and incidents.incidents alleged to constitute persecution,however,must be considered cumulatively.see poradisova gonzales,cir holding that an ij must consider events cumulatively to determine whether past persecution has occurred in re,at same.a series of incidents of mistreatment may together rise to the level of persecution even if each incident taken alone does not.
in this case,alleged mistreatment including four beatings during a arrest a arrest in multiple beatings and other forms of abuse during a arrest in a brief detention at the airport in during which he was forced to sign an arrest warrant without being allowed to read it a in which his property was seized multiple beatings in during each of six days that was held at a police station and a prison term that began with his being forced to bathe with a bucket of water mixed with urine on remand,the ij should assess whether these incidents,taken together,constitute persecution under bia precedent.because remand is required by the ij application of an erroneous legal standard and his failure to consider cumulatively allegations,we do not reach the question of whether we would sustain a finding that these incidents,if believed,did not constitute persecution.
ii.the arrest,detention and beating 
the ij found testimony regarding his arrest,detention and beating equally unconvincing to compel a finding of eligibility for asylum because had failed to show any connection between the mistreatment and his political views and because he had not proffered physical evidence in support of his claim.both of these bases are erroneous because they fail adequately to account for testimony and rest on the ij impermissible speculation.
the ij concluded that had offered only a vague and speculative statement that the authorities were aware of his views and offered little evidence to elaborate on the basis of his detention or the substance of any questioning.as with his treatment of the earlier incidents,the ij provided only this conclusory statement to explain why he thought testimony did not establish a connection between his political opinion and the mistreatment he suffered.in recounting the facts of the case,the ij himself noted that was arrested by security personnel while distributing leaflets announcing an opposition boycott of the elections because of voting irregularities.testified that he was told during his detention that he was in violation of the security of the state and was made to sing songs in praise of the president.this testimony draws a direct connection between the alleged mistreatment and political activity.
the ij also stated that had not presented evidence that the authorities ever questioned him about or even knew of his claimed political activities or opinions.testimony makes clear,however,that he was arrested in connection with the distribution of political leaflets,which belies the ij statement that the evidence does not show that the authorities were aware of political views.moreover,the ij assumption that the authorities would have interrogated about his political beliefs is speculative the ij offered no basis for believing that the authorities arrested because they sought information.the ij conclusion thus reflects both a failure to analyze or weigh testimony adequately,see ivanishvili,at,and impermissible speculation,see,at noting that factual findings based on flawed reasoning do not satisfy the substantial evidence standard.
the ij also faulted for failing to provide either corroborating documentation in the form of physical evidence of abuse consistent with the alleged mistreatment or other evidence of medical treatment for alleged injuries.the ij apparently believed that the injuries suffered as a result of being detained and beaten on the soles of his feet would have left physical scars or required medical treatment.for the following reasons,the ij implicit conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence.
we have held that a n applicant may be required to provide any reasonably available documentation to corroborate the elements of her claim,or explain why such documentation is unavailable,and an ij may rely on the failure to do so in finding that the applicant has not met her burden of proof.kyaw zwar tun ins,cir.we review an ij finding that corroborative evidence was reasonably available under the substantial evidence standard,reversing only where a reasonable trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.b b.we may remand where the ij has not relied on substantial evidence in the record in finding that documentation was reasonably available.jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir see kyaw zwar tun,at.
as to failure to provide physical evidence of abuse,the ij never indicated why he believed that such scarring on his be available.did not testify that he had scars from the incident,nor did his testimony suggest it.rather,he testified that his feet were swollen after the beatings,which does not clearly indicate that he would retain scars after the fact.in the absence of some evidence suggesting that would have had scars if he had been mistreated as he claimed,the ij erred in faulting for failing to present physical evidence of abuse 
indeed,courts have realized that some persecutors may deliberately choose a form of abuse that is painful and terrifying but does not leave physical manifestations.durgac gonzales,cir noting human rights reports that turkish security officials deliberately avoid leaving scars abdulrahman ashcroft,cir unanimous concurring opinion stating that the panel could easily conceive of beating that by design do not leave scars.the methods of abuse described by on the immobilized soles of the feet with a machete,interspersed with injunctions to jump around on gravel,and beating while the victim is suspended by the wrists from a fit this pattern.it was speculative for the ij to assume that scars were necessary either to corroborate account or to establish a level of abuse amounting to persecution.
as to failure to provide medical records corroborating his account,the ij seems to have assumed that necessarily would have received medical treatment for his injuries.specifically testified,however,that after the beating i should have received some medical care,but i did receive any.to the extent that the ij assumed that would have sought medical attention after his release from custody,the ij engaged in impermissible speculation.the ij implicit finding that evidence of medical treatment was reasonably available therefore is not supported by substantial evidence.for this reason and the others discussed,the ij conclusion that the incident did not constitute political persecution is erroneous.
iii.other facts undercutting claim 
the ij concluded that other facts in the record undercut claim of persecution.although this part of the ij decision immediately follows his treatment of the incident,its relationship to that previous discussion is unclear.the ij may have believed that these other facts undermined claim of persecution only with regard to the incident,or he may have thought that they undermined claim more generally.given this uncertainty,we treat this aspect of the ij decision separately from the incident.regardless of the significance the ij attached to these other facts,they reflect impermissible speculation and a misunderstanding of the record,and it was error for the ij to rely on them.
these other facts were the lack of evidence that the cameroonian authorities searched for in cameroon while he was in canada,the fact that wife and mother had not been threatened or harmed by cameroonian authorities because of political activities,and that had not presented convincing evidence regarding the cause of his brother death or that he was persecuted because of his brother political views.it is unclear from the ij decision what relevance he assigned to these other facts the entire discussion could have borne on credibility or could have represented a determination that objective risk of future persecution is not significant.we consider these other facts in turn.
first,as to the ij observation that cameroonian authorities did not look for while he was in canada or after his last departure from cameroon,testimony shows that he was mistreated by government authorities in each instance closely following his participation in political activities.nothing in the record shows that the authorities ever looked for him except in response to such activities.it was therefore speculative to attach any significance to the authorities inaction while was out of the country and,necessarily,not engaged in political activities.
second,although it is true that there is no evidence that either mother or his wife have been harmed or threatened because of his political activities,the ij failed to consider that,according to testimony,they were two members of his family who were not politically active.it is unclear why the ij believed that they would be persecute
