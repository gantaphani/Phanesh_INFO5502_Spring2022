this is an appeal from the dismissal on res judicata grounds of a second action,arising from a june altercation between the,lisa silva,and two police officers at a nightclub in new bedford,massachusetts.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
silva filed suit in august of against the two new bedford officers who arrested her during the nightclub incident.the district court denied silva motion to amend her complaint to add the city of new bedford the city as a defendant.the suit ended in a settlement prompted by an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.see silva gibney,cv rgs.silva i.silva did not appeal the denial of her motion to amend.
within a few weeks after judgment was entered in silva i,silva filed a second suit based on the nightclub incident,naming the city as the defendant silva ii.the district court dismissed the case based on the doctrine of claim preclusion.silva ii,d.silva appealed.
we review the district court decision under the de novo standard,accepting as true the facts alleged and drawing all reasonable inferences in silva favor.ramallo.printing,el dia,cir.because the city relies on the preclusive effect of a federal judgment,silva i,we apply federal law of claim preclusion.id.federal claim preclusion law bars a plaintiff from litigating claims in a subsequent action that could have been,but were not,litigated in an earlier suit airframe,raytheon,cir.in the context of the defensive use of claim preclusion,the defendant must show that the earlier suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits,the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits are sufficiently identical or related,and the parties in the two suits are sufficiently identical or closely related.id.internal citations omitted.
silva does not challenge the district court conclusion that the rule judgment in silva i constitutes a final judgment with preclusive effect.silva ii,d at.silva argues,nevertheless,that the judgment in silva i settled her claims against the police officers only,not her claims against the city.because the city was not a party to silva i,the settlement in silva i did not resolve,directly,silva claims against the city.for purposes of claim preclusion,however,the question is whether the judgment in silva i bars silva claims against the city because she could have,but did not,bring those claims in silva see airframe,at.we accept the unchallenged ruling that the judgment in silva i is a final judgment for purposes of claim preclusion.
in support of her appeal,silva argues that her causes of action in silva ii,against the city,lack the required relationship with the causes of action against the police officers in silva i.she also argues that the city and the police officers are not sufficiently related as parties in the two actions to support claim preclusion.
causes of action 
in considering whether the causes of action in two suits are sufficiently related to support claim preclusion,we apply a transactional approach.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.the transactional approach does not focus on the labels or sources for the plaintiff causes of action but instead considers whether the underlying factual bases for the causes are related in time,space,origin or motivation airframe,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in other words,we will find the required relationship if both sets of asserted in the earlier action and those asserted in the subsequent from a common nucleus of operative facts.breneman ex rel,cir quoting gonzalez banco cent,cir.
according to her complaints,silva claims in both silva i and silva ii arose from an incident that occurred on june,at a nightclub in new bedford,massachusetts.that night,silva drove to the nightclub to pick up her mother,who had not been permitted to enter the club.by the time silva arrived,her mother told her that the club had called the police.two new bedford police officers,timothy gibney and william sauve,arrived soon after silva did.silva argued with the officers about whether her mother had been given permission to enter the club,which devolved into physical contact.the officers charged silva with disorderly conduct and took her to the ash street jail.silva suffered a sprained wrist,bruises to her right arm,and a sore back.
silva filed suit on august,bringing claims against officers gibney and suave under and and the massachusetts civil rights act and bringing common law claims of false imprisonment,assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,malicious prosecution,aiding and abetting,and civil conspiracy.on november,silva moved to amend her complaint to add a claim under the massachusetts tort claims act against the city.in the motion,silva explained that on july,she served a presentment letter on the city,stating negligence claims arising from the nightclub incident that were actionable under the massachusetts tort claims act.silva represented that the response time expired on january,which allowed her to bring her claim against the city.
the district court denied the motion,stating it is simply too late in the proceedings to permit a new defendant and a new theory of liability to be injected into the case.silva i.the parties filed their settlement agreement on march.judgment entered on march.
silva filed a new action on april,silva ii.the statement of facts in her new complaint is nearly identical to the statement of facts in the silva i complaint.silva added allegations in silva ii that the officers arrested her negligently,because of the city negligent training and supervision of its police officers with respect to the constitutional free speech limitations on the new bedford municipal code.she further alleged that her arrest was based on an accepted standard custom,procedure,or policy of the city of new bedford police department.silva brought claims against the city under the massachusetts tort claims act and and.
silva claims against officers gibney and sauve in silva i arose from the officers conduct during and following the incident at the nightclub on june.her claims against the city in silva ii arose from the same conduct of the police officers during and following the same incident.although silva brought her claims under different theories,the factual basis for the claims is the same the officers actions during and following the incident at the nightclub on june.silva additional allegations in her complaint against the city,to support her claim of municipal liability,do not affect the identicality of the underlying transaction for both complaints.therefore,the causes of action in both suits are sufficiently related to support claim preclusion.
as we explained in airframe,claim preclusion does not require privity between parties in the two suits.at.instead,claim preclusion applies if there is privity or if the new defendant is closely related to a defendant from the original was not named in the previous law suit id.quoting negr√≥n fuentes ups supply chain solutions,cir.other courts have concluded that a sufficiently close relationship existed based on employment and agency to support claim preclusion.see,mccoy michigan,fed.appx,cir adams cal.dep t of health,cir russell sunamerica,cir citing cases.
in this case,the defendants in silva i,officers gibney and sauve,were new bedford police officers.as such,they were employees of the city and were acting within the scope of their employment during the nightclub incident that gave rise to the claims in the two cases.silva claims against the city are based on the officers actions.therefore,the officers and the city are sufficiently closely related for purposes of claim preclusion.
further,silva provides no good reason to allow her claims against the city.to the extent that silva argues she was unable to add the city as a defendant in silva i due to the procedure required under the massachusetts tort claims act,the record does not support a suggestion of unfairness.
the nightclub incident occurred on june.to bring a claim under the massachusetts tort claims act,silva first was required to present her claim in writing to the city and then wait for the city to deny the claim or for
