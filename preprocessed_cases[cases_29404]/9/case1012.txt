judith burg,a dog owner,appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut hall,dismissing on summary judgment her section complaint against a canine control officer.the district court held that issuance of a,summons requiring a later court appearance,without further restraint,does not constitute a fourth amendment seizure.we agree,and affirm.
background 
defendant colleen gosselin,a canine control officer in the connecticut town of east hampton,received a complaint about burg dog.six days later,on october,gosselin issued a summons to burg at her home,requiring burg to appear in court at a later date.it is not clear whether the dog was trespassing or barking but burg alleged offense,if a first offense,was an infraction burg was not handcuffed,removed from her home,restricted from leaving her property,or restricted from travel.
sometime after november,burg was arrested for failure to appear,handcuffed,and taken into physical custody gosselin was not present at the time of this arrest.
burg asserts that the underlying charge against her eventually was dismissed.on august,burg sued gosselin in her individual capacity pursuant to,on the ground that gosselin issuance of the summons on october,constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.gosselin moved for summary judgment.in a telephone conference on february,the district court orally granted summary judgment on the ground that,as a matter of law,a,summons does not constitute a fourth amendment seizure on february,the district court granted final judgment for gosselin.burg timely appealed.
discussion 
whether a mere summons constitutes a fourth amendment seizure is a difficult issue and one that has not yet been resolved in this circuit.dorman castro,cir emphasis in original per curiam.

a section claim requires a showing that the plaintiff was deprived of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.section claims of deprivations of liberty related to criminal prosecutions implicate the fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure of the person.see albright oliver,singer fulton county sheriff,cir t he fourth amendment is the proper source of constitutional protection for claims,such as malicious prosecution,that implicate a person liberty interest in respect of criminal prosecutions and,in particular,one pretrial liberty.accordingly,a plaintiff asserting such a claim must show some deprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of seizure.singer,at.
in a concurrence in albright,justice ginsburg opined that restrictive conditions of pretrial release on a felony charge constitute a fourth amendment seizure 
a person facing serious criminal charges is hardly freed from the state control upon his release from a police officer physical grip.he is required to appear in court at the state command.he is often subject,as in this case,to the condition that he seek formal permission from the court at significant expense before exercising what would otherwise be his unquestioned right to travel outside the jurisdiction.pending prosecution,his employment prospects may be diminished severely,he may suffer reputational harm,and he will experience the financial and emotional strain of preparing a defense.
a defendant incarcerated until trial no doubt suffers greater burdens.that difference,however,should not lead to the conclusion that a defendant released pretrial is not still seized in the constitutionally relevant sense.such a defendant is scarcely at liberty he remains apprehended,arrested in his movements,indeed seized for trial,so long as he is bound to appear in court and answer the state charges.he is equally bound to appear,and is hence seized for trial,when the state employs the less means of a summons in lieu of arrest to secure his presence in court.

in murphy lynn,cir,a defendant accused of offenses that included two felonies was released,but was ordered not to leave the state of new york pending resolution of the charges against him,thereby restricting his constitutional right to travel outside of the state,and was obligated to appear in court in connection with those charges whenever his attendance was required culminating in some eight appearances during the year in which his criminal proceeding was pending.murphy,at.we ruled that these restrictions imposed on murphy constituted a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.id.
in the wake of murphy,the district courts in this circuit have divided on whether a summons requiring a later court further to a fourth amendment seizure 
we hold that the issuance of a,summons requiring a later court appearance,without further restrictions,does not constitute a fourth amendment seizure.this summons does no more than require burg to appear in court on a single occasion,and operates to effectuate due process.there is no restriction on travel,which mattered in murphy.moreover,in murphy,there were eight court appearances,not the single appearance required by the summons issued by gosselin.the number of appearances may bear upon whether there was a it is hard to see how multiple appearances required by a court,or for the convenience of the person answering the summons,can be attributed to the conduct of the officer who issues it.williams smith,cir requiring the personal involvement of the defendant in a section action and determining that t he filing of a false misbehavior report does not,of itself,implicate the prison guard who filed it in constitutional violations which occur at a subsequent disciplinary hearing.finally,burg alleged offense was an infraction,and the summons thus does not impose the burdens,identified by justice ginsburg,that are imposed when a person fac es serious criminal charges.albright,at ginsburg,concurring.
other circuits that have considered this issue have uniformly determined that such a summons at least one that requires no more than a single court appearance does not constitute a fourth amendment seizure.
the first circuit held that a bsent any evidence that the plaintiff was arrested,detained,restricted in his travel,or otherwise subject to a deprivation of his liberty before the charges against him were dismissed,the fact that he was given a date to appear in court is insufficient to establish a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.britton maloney,cir.the court explained 
the plaintiff merely received a summons in the mail.he was never arrested on the charges at issue.nothing in the record indicates that he had to post a bond or to limit his travel before the ultimate hearing in which those charges were dismissed for want of prosecution.although the plaintiff contend ed that the summons alone constituted a seizure because it threatened him with arrest if he failed to appear i n our view,the supreme court fourth amendment jurisprudence belies the plaintiff claim that he was seized.the use of force is certainly not required to effect a seizure.a mere show of authority can suffice.terry ohio,d.but terry can not be read to mean that the issuance of a summons any more than a testimonial subpoena or a call to jury duty would constitute a seizure simply because it threatens a citizen with the possibility of confinement if he fails to appear in court.
the third circuit,in dibella borough of beachwood,cir,arrived at the same conclusion.in so doing,dibella distinguished an earlier case,gallo city of philadelphia,cir,in which the plaintiff was arrested,posted bond,and then was prohibited from traveling outside pennsylvania and new jersey,required to contact pretrial services on a weekly basis,and required to attend all court hearings.dibella explained that a summons and attendance at trial did not qualify as a fourth amendment seizure
