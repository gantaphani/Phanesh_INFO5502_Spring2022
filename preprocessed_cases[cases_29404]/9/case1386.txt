this appeal in a title vii case primarily concerns the recurring issue of whether a record that includes evidence supporting a plaintiff prima facie case and permitting an inference that an employer proffered justification for adverse employment action was pretextual sufficed to support a jury finding of discrimination.associates financial services afsc and its affiliated companies collectively the defendant appeal from the november,judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york arthur spatt,district judge,entered on a jury verdict in favor of deborah zimmermann,awarding her back pay and compensatory and punitive damages.afsc challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish liability,the propriety of a missing evidence jury instruction,and the permissibility of punitive damages.on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances shown by the record,we affirm.
zimmermann duties.afsc hired zimmermann in april as an assistant of business development director bdd.afsc markets financing services to dealers the term afsc uses for retailers like or pc warehouse,who then offer the services to their customers.willing customers of an dealer can have their purchase financed by afsc,who will pay the dealer an item purchase price and collect monthly payments from the customer.afsc operates hundreds of branches to administer the installment payments.
the bdd job is to sign up dealers for afsc programs.during the period relevant to this litigation,there were fourteen bdds,each with his or her own geographic region.zimmermann region encompassed the northeastern united states,and was one of the busiest.she had decades of experience selling financial services to dealers before joining afsc,and was recruited from one of afsc competitors by brad noel and senior steve diubaldo.
the bdds were supervised by the operations of retail sales finance ovp.when zimmermann started with afsc,the ovp was noel.a month later,michael gundy became her supervisor,and remained so for the next eleven months.zimmermann worked out of her home,faxing weekly progress reports to the ovps.
in april,afsc began offering a revolving credit plan,called a charge,in which a dealer provides its customers with a reusable charge card for purchases at the dealer store.at the same time,afsc hired stephen haslam as the new ovp.under the previous installment payment financing program called atp,bdds commonly used branch managers to initiate discussions with dealers.for the program,haslam expected bdds to take a more role,contacting dealers themselves in the first instance.zimmermann testified that she had long found working through branch managers clumsy,and that even under the old atp program she had contacted dealers on her own.
haslam talked to the bdds on the phone,organized teleconferences in which bdds would engage in and discuss marketing strategies,and distributed a dun bradstreet report to the bdds.haslam expected bdds to cold call dealers on the dun bradstreet list.haslam asked the bdds to send him appointment lists,solicitation call reports,and pipeline reports each week.from zimmermann he received handwritten summaries of her appointments and calls from the previous week,and her anticipated work during the next week.
zimmermann discharge.zimmermann worked for haslam for fewer than two months,during which time she took about two weeks of vacation.on haslam day,he fired zimmermann.
haslam discharged her at a meeting in dallas to which she was summoned zimmermann testified that when she asked haslam to explain why she was being fired,he insisted that it had nothing to do with her performance,but explained instead that she did have a good relationship with diubaldo,one of her supervisors.however,in diubaldo deposition,which the jury heard,he testified that he did not speak with haslam about zimmermann prior to her firing.
zimmermann last payroll entry lists inferior performance as the reason for her firing.haslam testified that zimmermann was not producing results under the a charge program the evidence was conflicting,but the jury was entitled to credit zimmermann testimony that she had a record of success,signing at least to.zimmermann had exceeded her goals for the second quarter of by a modest amount about six percent,earning a performance bonus of.zimmermann had also signed,or was close to finalizing,two large dealers to the system.
the texas meeting was the first time zimmermann had met haslam.she had never received any warnings or criticism of her performance from haslam or any other supervisors prior to being fired.
when haslam signed on as ovp,three of the fourteen bdds were women.zimmermann,aged when she was discharged,was replaced by stephen mitchell,a slightly younger male.a week after firing zimmermann,haslam recommended the termination of another of the three female bdds,hughes,whom afsc later transferred to an affiliated company.during the relevant time,no male bdds were fired 
lack of documentation.a notable aspect of this case is that afsc failed to offer a single item of documentary evidence to support its assertion that it fired zimmermann for inferior performance.haslam testified that he had no such evidence,claiming that he had thrown out all of the documents relating to the bdds.haslam testified that he threw out zimmermann documents days after firing her.he also acknowledged that he did not contact the other bdds many of whom were still employed by afsc at the time of trial to see if they had retained their copies of any of these documents.he was evasive when asked how many of the bdds attained their goals in the second quarter of,what any of those goals were,or how many sales the bdds achieved,essentially testifying that he could not remember.haslam also testified that he no longer had any of his training documents from the period in question.finally,haslam testified that sales volume figures were kept at afsc headquarters in salt lake city,and that he would occasionally access these figures to track bdds productivity,but he said that he did not generate any of these documents for litigation.
zimmermann kept copies of her own weekly and monthly reports,as well as her bonus statements,and submitted these into evidence.her counsel repeatedly emphasized during summation the defendant failure to produce evidence.the court gave the jury a missing evidence instruction,which we consider below.
litigation.zimmermann filed a charge with the eeoc,alleging that she was terminated because of her sex and age.after receiving a letter,she filed a timely action against afsc in the eastern district of new york.the complaint alleged that haslam and afsc discriminated against zimmermann on the basis of creed,national origin,age,and sex,in violation of title vii and state discrimination law.the complaint also contained state tort claims.
zimmermann abandoned the creed and national origin claims before trial and dropped the tort claims at the close of her case.in addition,after both sides presented their cases,the court granted the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the age discrimination claim,but denied its motion as to zimmermann sex discrimination claim and her request for punitive damages.
the court permitted the sex discrimination claim to go forward because three out of the bdds were women,and they initially discharged two,and the evidence of your nondiscriminatory reason is very,very shaky.the court agreed to include a missing evidence instruction,permitting the jury to infer that missing evidence in the defendant control would have been unfavorable to it.the court justified the instruction because here you have a situation where your client destroyed every single record.after the jury verdict,judge spatt noted that this is the only case that i have presided over where the defendant has no records this woman or her performance.
the jury returned a verdict for zimmermann on the sole remaining claim of gender discrimination,awarding in back pay,in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.the court reduced the back pay by the amount the jury concluded zimmermann had failed to mitigate and reduced the punitive damages to the relevant statutory cap of,see.after awarding attorney fees,costs,and interest on the back pay award,the court entered judgment for the plaintiff in a total amount of.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence of gender discriminationa.prima facie case 
the defendant first disputes that the plaintiff met her burden of presenting a prima facie case sufficient to oblige it to explain its adverse action.see reeves sanderson plumbing products,d.specifically,the defendant contends that the plaintiff failed to meet the requirement of showing that adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.graham long island,cir.this argument is unavailing.we have characterized the evidence necessary to satisfy this initial burden as minimal and de minimis,see,byrnie town of cromwell,cir delta air lines,cir,and the mere fact that a plaintiff was replaced by someone outside the protected class will suffice for the required inference of discrimination at the prima facie stage of the title vii analysis,see tarshis riese organization,cir cook arrowsmith shelburne,cir.
inference of discrimination from prima facie case and pretext 
the evidence in this case plainly permitted the jury to infer that the defendant proffered reason for her work pretextual.therefore,the issue as to the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the record as a whole,including whatever reasonable inference the jury could draw from the proffer of a false reason for the discharge,permitted the required ultimate finding of discrimination.reeves instructed that the combination of evidence establishing a prima facie case and evidence showing that a proffered explanation was pretextual is neither always to be deemed sufficient,reeves,at,nor always to be deemed insufficient,id.at.reeves recommended a approach,urging a reviewing court to consider a number of factors including the strength of the plaintiff prima facie case,the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,and any other evidence that supports the employer case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.id.at.
reeves recognized that in some circumstances a defendant could prevail as a matter of law even after a plaintiff showing of pretext and offered two scenarios as examples.one is where the record conclusively revealed some other,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer decision,id.at.see also woods friction materials,cir suggesting example of pretextual reason for a discharge conclusively shown to have been proffered to hide the real employee disclosure of employer embezzlement.a second is where the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.reeves,at.justice ginsburg expressed the view that circumstances in which plaintiffs will be required to submit evidence beyond evidence establishing a prima facie case and evidence permitting a finding that a proffered explanation was false in order to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law will be uncommon.id.at.ginsburg,concurring.
since reeves,the case law has been developing as to what sort of a record will permit a plaintiff who presents evidence of a prima facie case and evidence of a pretext to have a jury consider the ultimate issue of discrimination and what sort of record will entitle a defendant to judgment as a matter of law.the fifth circuit appears to understand reeves to mean that a prima facie case and evidence of pretext take a case to a jury in the absence of unusual circumstances that would prevent a rational from concluding that the employer reasons for failing to promote her were discriminatory and in violation of title vii.blow city of san antonio,cir emphasis added see also evans city of bishop,cir noting that the supreme court in reeves emphasized the importance of jury fact finding and reiterated that evidence of the prima facie case plus pretext may,and usually does,establish sufficient evidence for a jury to find discrimination.emphasis added.the fourth circuit has observed that if the plaintiff proves a prima facie case and pretext,her claim must go to a jury unless there is evidence that precludes a finding of discrimination.rowe marley,cir.
our circuit has not read reeves quite so favorably to title vii plaintiffs.without insisting on unusual circumstances or evidence precluding a finding of discrimination,as the fourth and fifth circuits have done,we have simply ruled in several cases that a record that included evidence of a prima facie case and evidence permitting a finding of pretext did not suffice to permit a finding of discrimination.see slattery swiss reinsurance america,cir james new york racing ass n,cir schnabel abramson,cir.the task,as outlined in these decisions,is to examine the entire record and,in accordance with reeves,make the assessment as to whether a finding of discrimination may reasonably be made.slattery noted that the supreme court has indicated that only occasionally will a prima facie case plus pretext fall short of the burden a plaintiff carries to reach a jury on the ultimate question of discrimination but that such occasions do exist.slattery,at citing reeves,at.
apart from the inference reasonably to be drawn from the defendant pretextual justification for the discharge,zimmermann evidence of discrimination,beyond her prima facie case,is slight.she emphasizes that of the three female bdds,haslam endeavored to fire two,succeeding with zimmerman and eventually being overruled internally as to,who was rehired in a different position we have previously cautioned against attributing much if any significance to the fact that another member of the protected class was discharged along with the plaintiff,see mccarthy new york city technical college,cir,especially where the numbers involved are small,see also pollis new school for social research,cir.however,zimmermann numerical evidence is stronger than that in mccarthy in that haslam was seeking to discharge two of the only three female bdds who were employed,and stronger than that in pollis in that haslam acted within a span of just a few weeks 
turning to the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,reeves,at,we note that the plaintiff evidence is extremely substantial and the defendant effort to meet it is woefully inadequate.to the extent that the defendant proffered zimmermann alleged poor performance as the reason for her discharge,she provided ample evidence of good performance and the complete absence of any negative evaluations.in addition,she testified that when haslam fired her,he said that the discharge had nothing to do with her performance.moreover,the defendant not only failed to present evidence from zimmermann personnel file indicating any complaints about her job performance,it also acknowledged that records that would show her productivity and that of other bdds had been destroyed.
the rationale haslam gave when he discharged allegedly poor relationship with equally unsupported the supervisor in question had not spoken with haslam about zimmermann prior to haslam firing her.
as the supreme court noted in reeves 
proof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,and it may be quite persuasive.in appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose moreover,once the employer justification has been eliminated,discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation,especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision.
at.citations omitted.whether or not we would have drawn an inference of discrimination were we the,we agree with judge spatt,after our review of the entire record,that in the particular circumstances of this case the jury was entitled to do so.
