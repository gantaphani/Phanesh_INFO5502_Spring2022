plaintiff appellant matthew christiansen sued his employer,supervisor,and others affiliated with his company collectively,defendants under the americans with disabilities act of ada,et,title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and state and local law alleging that he was discriminated against at his workplace due to,inter alia,his hiv positive status and his failure to conform to gender stereotypes.the united states district court for the southern district of new york failla,dismissed christiansen federal claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state and local claims.see christiansen omnicom,supp.in its decision,the district court concluded that simonton runyon,cir,and dawson bumble bumble,cir,holding that title vii does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,precluded christiansen title vii claim.christiansen,supp.at.christiansen primarily appeals this aspect of the district court decision.
christiansen,an openly gay man who is hiv positive,worked as an associate creative director and later creative director at ddb worldwide communications group,an international advertising agency and subsidiary of omnicom group.christiansen complaint alleged that his direct supervisor engaged in a pattern of humiliating harassment targeting his effeminacy and sexual orientation.according to christiansen,in the spring and summer of,his supervisor drew multiple sexually suggestive and explicit drawings of christiansen on an office whiteboard.the most graphic of the images depicted a naked,muscular christiansen with an erect penis,holding a manual air pump and accompanied by a text bubble reading,i so pumped for marriage equality.at.c at.another depicted christiansen in tights and a low cut shirt prancing around.at.a at.a third depicted christiansen s torso on the body of a four legged animal with a tail and penis,urinating and defecating.at.b at.later in,christiansen supervisor circulated at work and posted to facebook a muscle beach party poster that depicted various employees heads on the bodies of people in beach attire.at.christiansen head was attached to a female body clad in a bikini,lying on the ground with her legs upright in the air in a manner that one coworker thought depicted christiansen as a submissive sissy.at at.
christiansen supervisor also made remarks about the connection between effeminacy,sexual orientation,and hiv status.the supervisor allegedly told other employees that christiansen was effeminate and gay so he must have aid s.at.additionally,in may,in a meeting of about people,the supervisor allegedly told everyone in the room that he felt sick and then said to christiansen,it feels like i have aids.sorry,you know what that like.at.at that time,christiansen kept private the fact that he was hiv positive.
on october,christiansen submitted a complaint to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc detailing the harassment described above.after receiving a notice of right to sue from the eeoc,christiansen filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on may.shortly thereafter,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.in their motion to dismiss,defendants argued,inter alia,that christiansen claim under title vii was a sexual orientation discrimination claim rather than a gender stereotyping claim and was thus not cognizable under simonton runyon,cir,and dawson bumble bumble,cir.
the district court agreed.in its decision,the district court described at length difficulties in distinguishing sexual orientation discrimination claims from gender stereotyping claims,specifically noting that negative views people hold of those with certain sexual orientations may be based on stereotypes about appropriate romantic associations between men and women.see christiansen,supp.at.having reviewed the decisions of other district courts addressing this issue in the wake of simonton and dawson,the district court concluded that no coherent line can be drawn between these two sorts of claims.id.at.nevertheless,the district court recognized that the prevailing law in this circuit and,indeed,every circuit to consider the question is that such a line must be drawn.id.although the district court considered several references to effeminacy in the complaint,it concluded that,as a whole,christiansen complaint did not allege that he was discriminated against because he did not conform to gender stereotypes,but because he was gay.id.at.as a result,the district court held that christiansen claim was a sexual orientation discrimination claim that was not cognizable under title vii pursuant to simonton and dawson and dismissed the claim under rule b.id.at.

title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his or her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a.on appeal,christiansen argues,supported by various amici,that we should reconsider our decisions in simonton and dawson in light of a changed legal landscape and hold that title vii prohibition of discrimination because of sex encompasses discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.because we are bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court,united states wilkerson,cir,it is ordinarily neither appropriate nor possible for a panel to reverse an existing circuit precedent,shipping of india jaldhi overseas pte,cir.we thus lack the power to reconsider simonton and dawson.
however,we disagree with the district court conclusion that christiansen failed to plausibly allege a title vii claim based on the gender stereotyping theory of sex discrimination articulated in price waterhouse hopkins,which is also binding on this panel.in price waterhouse,the female plaintiff,a senior manager at an accounting firm,was described as macho and masculine and informed that to improve her chances for partnership,she should walk more femininely,talk more femininely,dress more femininely,wear make up,have her hair styled,and wear jewelry.at,internal quotation marks omitted.after her office declined to nominate her for partnership,she sued under title vii alleging sex discrimination.id.at.six members of the supreme court held that adverse employment action rooted in sex stereotyping or gender stereotyping was actionable sex discrimination.id.at plurality see also id.at white,concurring id.at,concurring.
here,as noted above,christiansen complaint identifies multiple instances of gender stereotyping discrimination.his complaint alleges that his supervisor described him as effeminate to others in the office,at,and depicted him in tights and a low cut shirt prancing around,at.a at.the complaint further alleges that the muscle beach party party poster,depicting christiansen head attached to a bikini clad female body lying on the ground with her legs in the air,was seen by at least one coworker as portraying christiansen as a submissive sissy.the district court acknowledged these facts but concluded that because christiansen complaint contained fewer allegations about his effeminacy than about his sexual orientation,the allegations about his effeminacy did not transform a claim for discrimination that plaintiff plainly interpreted and the facts support as stemming from sexual orientation animus into one for sexual stereotyping.christiansen,supp.at.the district court also opined that permitting christiansen title vii claim to proceed would obliterate the line the second circuit has drawn,rightly or wrongly,between sexual orientation and sex based claims.id.at.
the district court decision draws attention to some confusion in our circuit about the relationship between gender stereotyping and sexual orientation discrimination claims.some district courts in this circuit have viewed simonton and dawson as making it especially difficult for gay plaintiffs to bring gender stereotyping claims.maroney waterbury,cv jch,wl,at,see also estate of thousand islands cent.sch,supp,the critical fact under the circumstances is the actual sexual orientation of the harassed person.such cases misapprehend the nature of our rulings in simonton and dawson.while simonton observed that the gender stereotyping theory articulated in price waterhouse would not bootstrap protection for sexual orientation into title vii because not all homosexual men are stereotypically feminine,at,it acknowledged that,at a minimum,stereotypically feminine gay men could pursue a gender stereotyping claim under title vii and the same principle would apply to stereotypically masculine lesbian women.simonton and dawson do not suggest that a masculine woman like the plaintiff in price waterhouse,at,has an actionable title vii claim unless she is a lesbian to the contrary,the sexual orientation of the plaintiff in price waterhouse was of no consequence.in sum,gay,lesbian,and bisexual individuals do not have less protection under price waterhouse against traditional gender stereotype discrimination than do heterosexual individuals.simonton and dawson merely hold that being gay,lesbian,or bisexual,standing alone,does not constitute nonconformity with a gender stereotype that can give rise to a cognizable gender stereotyping claim.
the gender stereotyping allegations in christiansen complaint are cognizable under price waterhouse and our precedents.christiansen alleges that he was perceived by his supervisor as effeminate and submissive and that he was harassed for these reasons.furthermore,the harassment to which he was subjected,particularly the muscle beach party poster,is alleged to have specifically invoked these stereotypically feminine traits.simonton,at.the district court commented that much more of the complaint was devoted to sexual orientation discrimination allegations than gender stereotyping discrimination allegations and that it thus might be difficult for christiansen to withstand summary judgment or prove at trial that he was harassed because of his perceived effeminacy and flouting of gender stereotypes rather than because of his sexual orientation.even if that were christiansen burden at summary judgment or at trial and we do not hold here that it is it is not our task at the motion to dismiss stage to weigh the evidence and evaluate the likelihood that christiansen would prevail on his title vii gender stereotyping claim.instead,we assess whether he has state d a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at quoting twombly,at.we hold that he has 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court dismissal of christiansen title vii claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the judgment of the district court in all other respects.
to ascertain whether title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits sexual orientation discrimination,we begin with the text 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his or her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex 
a.christiansen and amici advance three arguments,none previously addressed by this court,that sexual orientation discrimination is,almost by definition,discrimination because of sex.they argue first that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination because of sex because gay,lesbian,and bisexual individuals are treated in a way that would be different but for their sex.second,they argue that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination because of sex because gay,lesbian,and bisexual individuals are treated less favorably based on the sex of their associates.finally,they argue that sexual orientation discrimination is discrimination because of sex because gay,lesbian,and bisexual individuals are treated less favorably because they do not conform to gender stereotypes,particularly stereotypes about the proper roles of men and women in romantic relationships.i find persuasive these arguments,which reflect the evolving legal landscape since our court decisions in simonton runyon,cir,and dawson bumble bumble,cir,holding that sexual orientation discrimination claims are not cognizable under title vii.concluding that it was constrained by the law as it then was,the simonton court expressly decried the appalling persecution,at,that simonton endured because of his sexual orientation,stating that such persecution was morally reprehensible whenever and in whatever context it occurs.id.for the reasons that follow,i write separately to express my view that when the appropriate occasion presents itself,it would make sense for the court to revisit the central legal issue confronted in simonton and dawson,especially in light of the changing legal landscape that has taken shape in the nearly two decades since simonton issued.
sexual orientation discrimination as traditional sex discrimination 
first,sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination for the simple reason that such discrimination treats otherwise similarly situated people differently solely because of their sex.a person is discriminated against because of sex if that person is exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.oncale sundowner offshore,quoting harris forklift,ginsburg,concurring.as the supreme court has alternatively explained,an action constitutes sex discrimination under title vii if the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which but for that person sex would be different.city of los angeles,dep t of water power manhart,emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.whatever evidentiary route the plaintiff chooses to follow,he or she must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,but actually constituted discrimina tion because of sex,oncale,at emphasis omitted,and title vii prohibition must extend to discrimination of any kind that meets the statutory requirements,id.at emphasis added.
sexual orientation discrimination meets this test.as the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has observed,sexual orientation can not be defined or understood without reference to sex,baldwin foxx,decision,wl,at july,because sexual orientation is defined by whether a person is attracted to people of the same sex or opposite sex or both,or neither.for this reason,the eeoc has concluded that s exual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination because it necessarily entails treating an employee less favorably because of the employee sex.id.to illustrate,the eeoc gives an example 
a ssume that an employer suspends a lesbian employee for displaying a photo of her female spouse on her desk,but does not suspend a male employee for displaying a photo of his female spouse on his desk.the lesbian employee in that example can allege that her employer took an adverse action against her that the employer would not have taken had she been male.that is a legitimate claim under title vii that sex was unlawfully taken into account in the adverse employment action.the same result holds true if the person discriminated against is straight.assume a woman is suspended because she has placed a picture of her husband on her desk but her gay colleague is not suspended after he places a picture of his husband on his desk.the straight female emplo
