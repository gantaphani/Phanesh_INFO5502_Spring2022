background 
factual history 
in setting forth the following facts,we draw all inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment in the proceeding below,which in this case was the michael sista sista.sista was employed by cdc ixis north america,cdc,an investment bank,between and.in march,sista was promoted by cdc at the behest of his direct supervisor,adil nathani nathani,to a managerial position in the structured credit group.in this capacity,sista held supervisory authority over a number of employees.sometime in the spring of,nathani asked sista to integrate kemal mehta mehta into the group as one of sista subordinates.after mehta joined the group,sista complained about his performance,but nothing was done to address sista complaints.
on may,sista telephoned the cdc office while away on a business trip.pursuant to cdc policy,the telephone conversation was recorded because it related to cdc trading desk.after speaking with mehta,sista spoke to another of his subordinates,paul monaghan monaghan.mehta overheard part of the conversation between sista and monaghan,though neither sista nor monaghan was aware of mehta presence.during a discussion of a transaction on which mehta was working,sista informed monaghan that they would get another of sista subordinates to beat mehta up on the details.mehta took offense at this remark,believing that it reflected sista determination not to let him participate constructively in certain transactions of the structured credit group.accordingly,mehta reported the conversation to nathani.
on may,sista met with nathani.according to sista,nathani asked him whether he had threatened mehta or arranged to have his subordinate beat the shit out of mehta.sista denied the allegations.nonetheless,nathani informed sista that he was demoted and that sista ran the risk of being terminated.nathani also told sista that he intended to meet with ramine rouhani rouhani,nathani boss,to discuss whether to terminate sista employment.nathani could have,but did not,recommend sista termination to rouhani.sista later acknowledged that what he had said about mehta was inappropriate and that he was sorry.
after his demotion,sista became depressed.the week after the demotion,sista stayed home from work and slept.monaghan called to speak to sista at home but spoke to sista wife instead.monaghan intimated to her that if sista wanted to keep his job,he should return to work.on may,sista again met with nathani.sista notes of the meeting indicate that sista told nathani that he wanted to speak with the human resources department regarding a mental health issue that was not impacting his ability to originate deals with his colleagues but it was having an impact on his family life.nathani told sista,that i fits sic a benefits issue all you have to figure out is who the provider is,who do you an hmo.sista notes reflect that nathani would provide him with a list of physicians.after sista informed nathani that he would seek psychiatric help,nathani stated that if sista condition impacted his ability to perform or if he perceived that sista condition had such an impact,sista transactions would be reassigned.sista transactions were not immediately reassigned.
according to sista,nathani did not provide the list of physicians,but instead told the human resources department not to help sista.in a may,internal memorandum from kimberly sullivan sullivan to cdc director of human resources,lawrence laier laier,sullivan stated that nathani is now concerned that hr would tell sista who to see professionally and based on what transpired through counseling would potentially damage cdc if brought to any kind of lawsuit.sista contacted a psychiatrist,william richardson,on his own.on june,he met with richardson,who diagnosed him as suffering from a possible major depressive disorder and prescribed antidepressant medication.sista did not tell anyone at cdc that he received a prescription for antidepressant medication.
on the morning of june,sista met with laier and secretly taped their conversation.sista informed laier that he had been to a psychiatrist because of his demotion.sista was very agitated and shouted accusations about cdc pulling tapes of his telephone conversations and violating his privacy.sista demanded to know if there was an intention to transition him out.sista also asked for an official investigation concerning the circumstances of his demotion.after this meeting,sista called his wife on a telephone line and stated that he blew up and yelled during the meeting and that he did not know what was going to happen now.after this meeting laier called nathani and cdc general counsel,albert zakes zakes,to report on his conversation with sista.the three arrived at a joint decision to encourage sista to take time off.
that afternoon,zakes called sista to a meeting that nathani and laier attended.sista secretly recorded this meeting also.laier said that sista was extremely emotional,that he did not believe at this point that sista was able to see things in an objective and factual way,and that cdc was prepared to work with sista.he advised sista i f you would like some vacation time off,just take some time to putter around the house if you like to request family and medical leave act time,we will do that.
according to sista,as the meeting progressed,he could not control his mounting agitation because of his demotion,the circumstances surrounding his demotion,his perception that his job security and livelihood were in jeopardy,and the denial of access to the conversation of his comments about mehta.as he had done in his earlier meeting with laier,sista shouted and cursed during this meeting.while continuing to shout,sista threatened nathani.specifically,sista threatened if you pulled more than one tape,i swear to christ i swear to christ i comin for you.immediately after this outburst,nathani exclaimed personal threat.sista responded no,n o from a professional basis,i went to personnel.laier informed sista that he was being placed on paid leave of absence.laier also told sista that he would not be permitted to return to work at cdc unless he had a physician note.
after sista threat,laier had sista building pass deactivated and his access to cdc server blocked.he also instructed cdc facilities personnel not to permit sista to enter the building.nathani remained in zakes office for approximately two hours until laier confirmed that sista had left the building.despite these other precautions,no one required security personnel to escort sista from the building indeed,they allowed him to remain and leave of his own accord.laier also met with mehta and another cdc employee and told them that sista was potentially violent,had already threatened someone,and had mentioned both their names in an agitated way.
that night,sista became depressed and attempted suicide by severing the artery in his left wrist.the next day,sista wife informed laier that sista had cut himself and the physicians were keeping him.laier told sista wife that her husband was on paid leave and that he would forward her some forms to be filled out.sista was hospitalized for approximately one week.
thereafter,laier sent sista a letter dated june,reciting that a s a result of the june threat,and your other behavior,we asked you to leave the premises and to take a paid leave of absence.the letter requested that sista fill out enclosed forms for fmla leave and further stated that i n light of your recent behavior and your threat to another member of the company,we can not let you return to work until we receive a letter from an appropriate medical professional in the mental health field indicating that you are able to perform in an appropriate manner in the workplace.sista signed and returned the forms in late june,informed laier that he was still under a physician care,and stated that he did not agree with the tone or the content of laier letter.
sista met with richardson on june,and was given a prescription for depakote,a drug intended to help with temper,anger control,and management of one emotions.richardson prescribed depakote because it was his understanding that sista was angry with his supervisor,nathani.sista had not at that time revealed to richardson the threat he made to nathani nor that he was on leave because of that threat.
by undated letter,which sista received on august,laier told sista that his fmla leave would end on august,and that he had until that date to provide a letter from his treating physician indicating that sista was able to return to work.the letter further stated that sista job was being held open at cdc until august,but if sista was unable to return to work by that date,sista job would no longer be held open and he would be removed from the payroll.sista alleges that he complied with all of the conditions necessary for reinstatement at the end of his fmla leave.he kept laier apprised of his intentions and desire to return to work at the conclusion of the fmla leave.he provided cdc a letter,dated august,in which richardson stated that anthony michael sista is cleared to return to work august,the day sista fmla leave expired.
on august,sista emailed laier,asking when and where to report on august.on august,sista again emailed laier,asking for a response to his previous email.laier replied by email that same day,requesting a more substantial and substantive statement from richardson that will allow cdc to conclude that you may safely return to work.laier also suggested that sista should take some accrued vacation days and prepare to return to work on september.by that time nathani,who was on vacation,would have returned.when nathani returned from vacation,he informed laier and rouhani that he felt he was in danger because sista had physically threatened him.according to nathani,because sista never apologized or recanted the threat,his return would be disruptive to the structured credit group.rouhani agreed that sista should be terminated.
after several conversations and communications between counsel for the parties,sista employment was terminated,effective november.sista received his full salary and benefits during his fmla leave time,payment for two weeks of vacation time,and additional salary for the period from september to november.
ii.procedural history 
sista filed the instant action on may,and filed an amended complaint on june.in his amended complaint,sista claimed i discriminatory termination in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et ii violation of the family and medical leave act of fmla,et iii discrimination on the basis of race,color,ethnic background,and national origin,in violation of and title vii of the civil rights act of,et.title vii iv discrimination on the basis of disability,in violation of the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.v discrimination on the basis of race,color,and national origin,in violation the nyshrl,exec.vi discrimination on the basis of race,color,and national origin,in violation of the new york city human rights law nychrl,city admin.code vii discrimination on the basis of disability,in violation of the nychrl and viii defamation.after discovery,all moved for summary judgment.at oral argument on that motion,sista informed the court that he was abandoning all discrimination claims against except for his ada and fmla claims and the related state and municipal law claims,and the district court therefore granted summary judgment to as to those other discrimination claims.the district court further determined that motion for summary judgment would also be granted as to sista defamation claim because sista had not opposed the motion as to defamation.
in relation to his ada claim,the district court determined that sista could not make out a prima facie case under the ada because as a matter of law he can not show that he was otherwise qualified to perform his job at the cdc.the district court noted that sista threatening words were violent and concluded that his conduct violated cdc policy and render ed him not otherwise qualified.alternatively,the district court determined that sista could not disprove cdc reason for termination sista actions provided a reasonable basis to terminate his employment sista behavior was simply conduct which an employer could legitimately determine was inappropriate and unacceptable in the workplace.the district court also dismissed sista pendent claims under the nyshrl and nychrl on the same alternative grounds.
in relation to his fmla claim,the district court first determined that involuntary leave is not actionable under the fmla.the district court then determined that the right to reinstatement after fmla leave is not absolute.citing to this court decision in hale mann,cir,the district court determined that,because sista could legitimately have been fired for his actions before taking fmla leave and because there was no evidence of termination in retaliation for taking fmla leave,sista could not make out his claim.
the district court also denied a motion made by sista during the discovery process for leave to amend his amended complaint,pursuant to.a,to add retaliation claims under title vii,the ada,nyshrl,and nychrl against all except mehta.the district court determined that there was no evidentiary basis for a retaliation claim.
finally,the district court denied motion for attorneys fees and costs.the district court found that sista race discrimination claims,though weak and ultimately abandoned,were not so frivolous as to warrant an award of attorney fees and costs to under christiansburg garment eeoc,d.
judgment was entered february.sista timely filed a notice of appeal on march.timely on march.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

ii.ada claims 
sista first claims that,in terminating his employment,cdc discriminated against him in violation of the ada.the ada prohibits discrimination against any qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to,inter alia,discharge from employment.a.ada employment discrimination claims are subject to the familiar analysis established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case the employer must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a legitimate reason for the discharge and the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext.heyman queens vill.comm.for mental health for jamaica cmty.adolescent program,cir.
to establish a prima facie case under the ada,a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that his employer is subject to the ada he was disabled within the meaning of the ada he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job,with or without reasonable accommodation and he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability.giordano city of new york,cir.in this case there is no question that cdc is subject to the ada,nor is there any question that termination is an adverse employment action.below,cdc and sista disputed whether sista was disabled within the meaning of the ada.the district court did not address that issue,determining instead that sista was not otherwise qualified and therefore unable to establish a prima facie case.for purposes of this appeal,we assume,arguendo,that sista is disabled within the meaning of the ada and,like the district court,focus on the meaning of otherwise qualified.
relying on various authorities,the district court determined that sista could not prove that he was otherwise qualified as a matter of law because his threats and physical violence against himself had violated cdc policy.see,palmer circuit court of cook county,cir valentine standard poor,d francis runyon.the district court reasoned that where an employee poses a direct threat,defined as a significant risk to the health or safety of others that can not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation,that employee is not otherwise qualified to perform his or her job.see noco motor fuel,cir.
the poses a direct threat defense is established by the statutory scheme of the ada.the ada provides 
it may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards,tests,or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be and consistent with business necessity,and such performance can not be accomplished by reasonable accommodation,as required under this subchapter.
a.the term qualification standards may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.b emphasis supplied.as used in this context,t he term direct threat means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that can not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.the poses a direct threat defense requires an individualized assessment of the employee present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge on the best available objective evidence.r.when conducting such an individualized assessment,the factors to be considered include t he duration of the risk t he nature and severity of the potential harm t he likelihood that the potential harm will occur and t he imminence of the potential harm.id 
when the district court found that sista had threatened nathani and had blown up and yelled at laier in violation of cdc policy,the district court was articulating a legitimate reason for cdc subsequent termination of sista,not a basis for finding that sista poses a direct threat as defined by the ada.the poses a direct threat defense is not applicable when an employee actually makes a threat,despite the common use of the word threat poses a direct threat is a term of art under the ada,reserved for circumstances not presented by this case,at determining that a convenience store clerk with epilepsy did not pose a direct threat to herself or others where the employer had not identified any time at which she failed to perform her duties or caused harm to others because of her affliction hamlin charter tp.of flint,cir determining that an assistant fire chief could not perform fire fighting duties because of a medical condition,but that no threat was posed because such duties were not an essential function of his job mauro borgess med,aff,cir granting summary judgment to an where an surgical technician posed a direct threat to patients.
as the eeoc asserts in its amicus brief a n employer may discipline or terminate an individual who,because of disability,makes a threat against other employees if the same discipline would be imposed on a employee engaged in the same conduct.see also eeoc enforcement guidance on the americans with disabilities act and psychiatric disabilities,at question,fep manual bna,march,available at http last visited february.under these circumstances,no individualized assessment,see r,is necessary because the employee is not being terminated for posing a direct threat as defined by the ada,but rather for making a legitimate,reason for accordance with the standard mcdonnell douglas analysis.moreover,rules established by the eeoc make clear that the poses a direct threat defense is meant to be applied in cases alleging discriminatory application of qualification standards as opposed to cases in which a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment,which may be justified by a legitimate,reason.a,b.here,sista does not claim that cdc policies against employee misconduct and threats in the workplace constitute qualification standards,tests,or criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities rather,the gravamen of sista claim is that he suffered disparate treatment at the hands of cdc when he was fired for being disabled.accordingly,the poses a direct threat defense has no applicability in this case.
in accordance with the foregoing,we apply the rule established in owens new york city housing authority,cir.in owens,this court stated mcdonnell douglas requires only a minimal showing of qualification to establish a prima facie claim.a plaintiff only needs to demonstrate that she possesses the basic skills necessary for performance of the job.owens,at internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.this court went on to explain the analytical distinction between i qualification for a job and ii disqualification arising from a legitimate,reason for an adverse employment decision 
we have no doubt that misconduct may certainly provide a legitimate and reason to terminate an employee.this misconduct is distinct,however,from the issue of minimal qualification to perform a job.an individual may well have the ability to perform job duties,even if her conduct on the job is inappropriate or offensive.accordingly,the finding of misconduct here can not preclude the plaintiff from showing her qualification for employment as required by mcdonnell douglas.
in thornley penton,cir,this court clarified owens,noting that t he point of our ruling was that misconduct did not necessarily correspond to the question of satisfactory performance id.at.we further explained that owens did not depart from our holdings that a plaintiff complaining of discriminatory discharge shows qualification by demonstrating satisfactory job performance,in accordance with the particular employer criteria for satisfactory performance,as some other courts had erroneously read it to.id.at.
the misconduct at issue in owens was gross insubordination.id.here,cdc contends that it terminated sista for a different type of threat made against his immediate supervisor.although the district court is correct that sista actions provided a reasonable basis to terminate his employment and that sista behavior was simply conduct which an employer could legitimately determine was inappropriate and unacceptable in the workplace,these considerations go to the employer ability to rebut a prima facie case in the second stage of the mcdonnell douglas framework,not to the showing of the prima facie case itself.the issue of threats comes into play only after the prima facie requirement has been met.
we believe that this between posing a threat and making a the necessary balance between protect ing disabled individuals from discrimination based on prejudice,stereotypes,or unfounded fear,at at internal quotation marks omitted,and permitting employers to protect themselves and their employees and customers from potentially violent employees,see palmer,at the ada does not require an employer to retain a potentially violent employee.such a requirement would place the employer on a razor jeopardy of violating the ada if it fired such an employee,yet in jeopardy of being deemed negligent if it retained him and he hurt someone.this approach ensures that this court,like every other court to have taken up this issue,does not read the ada to require that employers countenance dangerous misconduct,even if that misconduct is the result of a disability.moreover,this approach to ada discrimination cases corresponds to the rest of this court mcdonnell douglas jurisprudence.in owens and thornley,we specifically recognized that mcdonnell douglas requires only a minimal showing of qualification to establish a prima facie claim.owens,at.we think that our construction of the phrase otherwise qualified is preferable to that set forth by our sister circuits.see williams motorola,cir holding that an employee inability to work with others insubordination,and threats of violence rendered her not otherwise qualified within the meaning of the ada palmer,at cir holding that an employee threats of physical violence rendered her not otherwise qualified under the ada.
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that sista was not otherwise qualified to reassume his position at cdc because he pose d a direct threat to his.although we can not state definitively whether sista made a prima facie showing under the ada or related state and municipal laws without determining whether sista mental illness qualified as a disability,we need not address these questions to the extent that the district court was correct in holding that cdc had a legitimate basis for terminating sista.
we now turn to the question of whether sista has produced evidence that would tend to show that the proffered reason was merely a pretext for discrimination,which may be demonstrated either by the presentation of additional evidence showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence,or by reliance on the evidence comprising the prima facie case,without more.heyman,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.to support the claim that he was fired on account of his mental illness rather than his past threat to a,sista points to cdc repeated invitations to return to work in the fall of with the permission of a doctor,its failure to seek an alternative diagnosis of sista medical condition before firing him,and its failure to take certain safety precautions at the time when sista was placed on involuntary leave in the spring of.upon our review of the record,however,we hold that sista arguments in this regard are insufficient to raise any genuine issue of material fact,see,and therefore did not warrant a jury trial.
first,regarding sista arguments about the suspicious timing of cdc belated decision to terminate his employment,we hold that no reasonable jury could conclude that cdc provision of three months paid leave for further opportunities to express remorse or accept responsibility for his past the sincerity of its stated explanation for terminating sista in the fall of.second,cdc was in no way obligated to pursue alternative diagnoses of sista condition,and if anything,its failure to do so merely confirms that its decision to fire sista did not depend on any perception of his mental state.third,the record reflects that cdc took several safety precautions in the spring of,including instructing security personnel that sista was not to be permitted entry into the building.because sista can point to no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that he was terminated on account of his mental illness rather than his past behavior,we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment and dismissing sista ada claims.
finally,sista asserts that the district court erred by rejecting the possibility that cdc had mixed motives for terminating him.see raskin wyatt,cir in cases,we use the different analysis set out in price waterhouse hopkins,d plurality opinion i f the plaintiff establishes that a prohibited discriminatory factor played a motivating part in a challenged employment decision,the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision anyway.the types of indirect evidence that suffice in a pretext case to make out a prima facie even to carry the ultimate burden of not suffice,even if credited,to warrant a price waterhouse burden shift.raskin,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.evidence potentially warranting a price waterhouse burden shift includes,inter alia,policy documents and evidence of statements or actions by decisionmakers that may be viewed as directly reflecting the alleged discriminatory attitude.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis in raskin.t o warrant a burden shift,the plaintiff must be able to produce a smoking gun or at least a thick cloud of smoke to support his allegations of discriminatory treatment.raskin,at.sista can not meet that burden here.
upon our review of the record,we agree with the district court that sista failed to present any direct evidence of discriminatory animus based on his disability and therefore was not entitled to a price waterhouse burden shift.accordingly,we affirm the determination of the district court,granting summary judgment to cdc as to sista ada claim.
iii.fmla claims 
the fmla gives eligible employees an entitlement to twelve workweeks per year of unpaid leave b ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a d the fmla provides that at the end of an employee leave the employee has the right to return to the position he held before the leave or its equivalent,see,though this right is not absolute,see b if the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition,including the continuation of a serious health condition,the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the fmla.sarno douglas ives,cir the fact that sarno was not restored to his position at the end of that period did not infringe his fmla rights because it is also undisputed that at the end of that period he remained unable to perform the essential functions of his position.the fmla creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages against any employer including a public agency in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction should that employer interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of fmla rights.nevada of human resources hibbs,d internal citations omitted.sista has based his fmla claim on two separate arguments.we deal with each in turn.
involuntary leave 
sista argues that he was involuntarily placed on fmla leave,in violation of his rights under that act.the district court,citing a handful of unpublished decisions from various district courts,determined that involuntary leave is not actionable under the fmla.sista asserts that,although an employer may be able to impose fmla leave on an employee,it may only do so where the employee has a serious medical condition that would qualify the employee for such leave,citing to the same cases relied upon by the district court.sista claims that his suicide attempt was a direct result of his anguish over cdc imposition of the fmla suspension.whether involuntary leave is actionable under the fmla is an issue of first impression in this court.
the fmla says nothing about an employer ability to force an employee to take such leave,and such forced leave,by itself,does not violate any right provided by the fmla.et establishing certain rights,including,inter alia,to take leave,to restoration of position,and to maintain a civil action.the fmla does not create a right to be free from suspension with or without p
