this appeal concerns the proper allocation between new york state and the city of yonkers city of expenses of complying with court orders for the desegregation of public schools in yonkers.also at issue is the proper allocation of revenues received from the federal government and whether certain aspects of the district court recent remedial orders exceed the court discretion.the state of new york appeals from several orders of the district court for the southern district of new york leonard sand,district judge.the city and the yonkers board of education ybe.we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
background 
procedural history 
in,the united states commenced this action in the southern district of new york against the ybe and the city,alleging unconstitutional segregation of the yonkers schools.the naacp later intervened as a plaintiff.in,judge sand found that the schools were segregated,and that the segregation was the result of intentional segregation.see united states yonkers board of education.yonkers i in,judge sand approved the educational improvement plan eip i recommended to him by the monitor.see yonkers branch yonkers bd.of.yonkers ii.yonkers i and yonkers ii were affirmed.see united states yonkers bd.of,cir yonkers iii.eip i recommended school closings,magnet schools,voluntary busing,and student and staff reassignment.the city and the ybe immediately began implementing this plan.
in,the ybe amended its answer to add the state as a defendant and against the state,alleging the state complicity in the segregation.after extensive motion practice,the district court began holding a trial in in three parts to decide whether vestiges of segregation remained after implementation of eip i whether the state was liable for these vestiges and what remedy,if any,would be appropriate,in addition to eip first,in,the district court found that desegregation had been achieved with respect to enrollments,but that vestiges of segregation remained,and required a remedy.see united states city of yonkers.yonkers iv second,in,the district court decided that the state knew about segregation and failed to take corrective measures,but that this nonfeasance was an insufficient basis for liability the claims against the state were dismissed.united states city of yonkers unnumbered.we reversed,ruling that the state could be held liable for nonfeasance,but we did not review the propriety of the vestiges finding itself.see united states city of yonkers,cir yonkers v.this reversal led to the third part of the inquiry judge sand had contemplated in.
in,the district court held a trial on remedy for the state liability,with an updated inquiry into the vestiges finding.judge sand found that vestiges of segregation persisted,in the form of low teacher expectations and insufficiently teaching techniques and curriculum.he then approved the monitor eip ii programs as a remedy for these vestiges.see united states yonkers bd.of,yonkers vi yonkers vi also approved a split between the city and the state for eip i costs for fy ending june,and determined that the state should receive only partial credit against its fy liability for its magnet school aid to yonkers.see id.at.the state appealed yonkers vi,seeking review of the vestiges finding,the eip ii remedy,and the denial of full credit to the state for state magnet school aid in fy.during the pendency of that appeal adjudicated in yonkers vii,the state did not seek a stay,and eip ii was implemented.
between the district court decision in yonkers vi and this court decision in yonkers vii,the district court took five actions,reflected in separate opinions and orders that are among the subjects of the pending appeals now consolidated before this panel.these opinions and orders created a general framework for dividing costs between the city and the state through,assessed the city and the state the costs for eip i and eip ii for fy and fy,and disallowed the state claims for certain credits.the five actions are 
first,a june,opinion and an implementing july,order.judge sand captioned this order the eip funding order,but the parties refer to it and the opinion on which it is based as the formulaic funding order or ffo,and we will use their terminology.the ffo maintains the principle provisionally implemented for fy in yonkers vi for the interval from to.however,in recognition of the city current financial difficulties,the ffo requires the state to pay higher percentages in the early years and the city to pay higher percentage in the later years,achieving the split on a cumulative basis.this opinion and order are appealed in and in.
second,a november,order,which approved the monitor october,recommendation to deny the state partial credit for a federal magnet school grant for fy.this order and similar rejections of a partial credit for federal magnet school grants for subsequent years are appealed in,and.
third,a february,order,the eip ii modification order,which approved certain modifications to eip ii sought by the ybe,adding certain programs and removing others.this order is appealed in.
fourth,an april,order,the fy funding order,which directed the state to pay to cover eip i costs for fy eip ii had not yet started.although yonkers vi had given the state a partial credit for its annual magnet school aid against its eip i liability for fy,this order denied the state any credit for state magnet school aid for fy,a practice that has been repeated in subsequent fiscal years.the state also received no credit for any of yonkers federal magnet school aid.this order is appealed in.
fifth,an april,order,the fy funding order,which directed the state to pay as its share of anticipated unpaid eip costs for fy.because eip ii was launched in fy,these costs included eip ii costs for the first time,in addition to ongoing eip i costs.as in fy,the state received no credit for state or federal magnet school aid.this order is appealed in.
after these opinions and orders were entered,this court on june,decided yonkers vii,initially reported at.notwithstanding the intervening orders dealing mainly with fy and beyond which are the principal subjects of the pending appeal,the review in yonkers vii was limited to issues raised by yonkers vi,including judge sand vestiges finding,his eip ii remedy,and his apportionment of fy eip costs.yonkers vii held that the finding of vestiges was erroneous and vacated the eip ii remedy.see id.at.we upheld the decision to apportion eip i costs evenly between the parties for fy and to deny full credit for state magnet school aid for fy.see id.at.the naacp petitioned for rehearing,and at this point the state sought for the first time,and obtained on august,a stay of implementation of the eip ii remedy.on rehearing,on november,we vacated our original opinion in yonkers vii and remanded the case to afford judge sand the opportunity to identify specific vestiges of segregation that might justify the eip ii remedy.see yonkers vii,amended opinion.we also vacated eip ii,noting that 
there has been no adequate showing that eip ii is responsive to the only ill that counts for purposes of this litigation de jure segregation and its.measures such as networked computers in classrooms and are more properly characterized as general educational enrichments rather than remedies for prior segregation.
id.at.the amended opinion reconfirmed the allocation of eip i costs for fy.see id.at.
prior to deciding the vestiges issue and the consequent justification for eip ii on remand,the district court issued an opinion on april,adopting the monitor april,recommendations.these recommendations determined the final amounts owed by the state and the city for fy costs which included eip ii costs incurred prior to our august,stay of eip ii expenditures and apportioned eip i costs for fy.the monitor also recommended,and judge sand approved,adding a universal program to eip i for fy this program had previously been part of the eip ii remedy vacated by yonkers vii.this opinion also rejected the state request for credit to reflect state categorical funding and partial credit for federal aid obtained independently of the city.on april,the district court entered an order,the funding order,which directed the state to pay as its share of unpaid eip costs for fy.this order and the prior april opinion are appealed in.
in november,after the appeals in the pending case had been filed and consolidated,judge sand ruled with respect to the remand in yonkers vii.see united states yonkers bd.of,d yonkers viii.judge sand found vestiges of discrimination in practices related to academic tracking,disciplinary practices,administration of special education,pupil personnel services,and services for students with limited proficiency in english.he also found that eip ii is no longer a feasible option,since it was not directed to current conditions.judge sand referred the case to the monitor to hold proceedings and to determine a revised remedy.the issues raised by yonkers viii are not part of the instant appeal,although yonkers viii developments will bear on our treatment of issues raised by the earlier orders.
on this appeal,the state claims that state magnet aid and other state categorical aid should be credited against the state eip i liability for fy,and that federal magnet school and reduction aid should partly be credited against the state eip i liability for the same fiscal years that the state should get a credit for eip ii expenses for fy charged to the state in the district court april,order that the ffo should be modified and that the universal program should not have been shifted from eip ii to eip i for fy.the parties essentially agree that the eip ii modification order should be vacated,since eip ii was vacated by yonkers vii.
discussion 
credit for state magnet school aid against eip i expenses 
in,the state contends that the fy funding order was erroneous because it failed to give the state credit for magnet school aid that the ybe was receiving from the state pursuant to a statewide magnet aid program.this claim is also asserted in as to the fy funding order and in as to the fy funding order.these magnet school grant credits would be worth between and million annually.the state argues that since one purpose of the state magnet school program is to combat segregation,the state aid is essentially a voluntary contribution to eip i.the state contends that judge sand rejection of its credit claim violates the law of the case and exceeded the court discretion.
background of the magnet aid credit claim 
the contentions with respect to law of the case and the merits of the state claim for magnet school credit will be illuminated by review of how the issue has been treated in the decisions preceding the orders now on appeal.the problem of credits for state magnet aid first came up in allocating the financial burdens for fy.the monitor struggled with the question of whether state magnet aid should be counted as remedial,and thus creditable against the state eip burden,or whether it was merely an attempt by the state to equalize basic aid to education.yonkers vi.at appended monitor opinion.on the one hand,magnet aid is often granted to advance racial integration,and state magnet aid for yonkers had gone up dramatically over the last years,and was much higher than the amounts received by comparable cities.yonkers had been asking the legislature for more money to implement remedies,so the increase in magnet aid was arguably intended for this purpose.on the other hand,the magnet aid increases could also be seen as attempts to use magnet aid merely to compensate for yonkers low funding levels,compared to other cities.moreover,state law imposed transition caps on the amount by which changes to the basic operating aid formulas could increase any school district operating aid from year to year,and because the transition cap in fy had prevented yonkers from collecting million in operating aid that would otherwise have flowed automatically,it was arguable that magnet aid was being used to make up for basic funding inequities notwithstanding the cap.
the monitor concluded that both factors were at work 
e vidence exists to indicate that the state categorical aid to yonkers in the form of magnet program grants may be intended to serve at least two purposes magnet program support and an ad hoc,discretionary effort spawned by annual budget negotiations to compensate for generally accepted flaws in the state basic funding formula for education.
id.to divide the state magnet aid into the portion intended for desegregation efforts and the portion intended for general operating aid purposes,the monitor thought that the portion for general operating aid purposes should be assumed to be the amount of funds that the city lost because of the transition cap.for fy,the cap prevented yonkers from receiving million of general education aid.therefore,of the million in state magnet aid,only ultimately determined to be million was considered to be magnet aid,for which the state received credit.id.at.the monitor emphasized,however,that this approach would not necessarily be used in future years,noting that there was no state oversight ensuring that the aid would be spent in any particular way,and that the aid was discretionary with the legislature and could be reduced or withdrawn at any time.id.at.the district court approved the issue is not one of the subjective intent of the legislature but rather what the objective facts show to be the effect of the state funding,the method by which the amount of funding is determined,the lack of any assurance of continuity and of any specific direction as to the application of such funding.id.at district court opinion.
eight months later,in the opinion underlying the formulaic funding order the district court suggested a complete rejection of magnet aid credit and established the principle that only eip costs were to be shared by the state,rather than some percentage of the whole ybe budget,as the monitor had recommended.judge sand noted that this approach would encourage the city and the ybe to treat as many expenditures as possible as eip i expenditures,creating categorization problems.anticipating that the magnet issue would arise,the ffo opinion said that time would illuminate the problem,but also said that it was the court assumption that the state will make its determinations concerning the grants of state aid independently of eip i and eip ii contributions and that there is no need for this item to be included in the equation.
a few months later,state magnet aid credit was denied entirely in the funding order confirming the state share of fy costs,one of the orders now on appeal.the monitor recommended denying credit,but noted for the future that any significant increase s in state discretionary aid might raise fairness issues and result in credits for the state decreases in such aid could result in a finding that the state was not maintaining effort as required by the ffo the monitor also noted that the court future burden apportionment process should not intrude upon nor be adversely affected by the regulatory,political,and economic forces which shape the logic of state aid.the district court concluded that it did not yet have an adequate factual basis for definitive resolution of the issue.the court nonetheless adopted the monitor recommendation for fy.the state therefore received no credit for magnet aid for that year.
after the district court issued this ruling,we rejected the state argument that it should have gotten full credit for state magnet aid in fy.yonkers vii,at.however,even though we were actually upholding a partial credit to the state for fy,we rejected the state claim in broad terms 
a related issue is the state argument that it makes a substantial annual contribution through magnet school aid as the state does in other large school districts,and that any required state contribution to eip i should be offset by the magnet school contribution,which has a remedial tendency and purpose.the district court refused to reduce the state liability for eip i by the amount of the magnet aid,a decision the state argues is unfair and an unwarranted intrusion into state sovereignty.we conclude that it was not an abuse of the court broad discretion to deny the state credit for payments it has already made to yonkers through magnet school grants.in making its decision,the court did not the subjective intent of the legislature,as the state argues,but instead determined that this money did not have the effect of funding the ordered remedy.we do not find that conclusion to be clearly erroneous.
law of the case 
against this background,each side contends that our decision in yonkers vii establishes law of the case in its favor on the issue of the proper state credit for magnet school aid.the state points out that,although it sought review of the district court refusal to credit the entire million of magnet school aid,no party challenged the state entitlement to a credit for the amount by which the state magnet payment exceeded the amount of operating aid funds the city lost because of the transition cap,and our decision in yonkers vii affirmed the resulting credit of million.the city of yonkers and the ybe respond that we rejected the state claim for credit,citing our statement that it was not an abuse of the district court broad discretion to deny the state credit for payments it has already made to yonkers through magnet school grants.yonkers vii,at.
neither side persuades us that the law of the case has been established for this appeal.although we upheld the district court discretion to deny magnet aid credit while simultaneously affirming the allowance of a partial credit,we were reviewing the funding order for fy.we will take appropriate guidance from the views expressed in yonkers vii,but that decision is not technically law of the case for funding allocations in later years,either to assure the state at least a partial credit or to assure yonkers that there will be no credit.
c.the merits of the state credit claim 
as we indicated in yonkers vii in discussing a credit for fy funds,the state entitlement to credit turns on whether the money has the effect of funding the ordered remedy.as the monitor and the district court have recognized,it is not easy to determine whether some state funds are paying for the remedy.at one extreme,the state would clearly be entitled to a credit if the legislature appropriated new money explicitly to pay the state share of any desegregation money.at the other extreme,there would be no valid claim if the state simply sought a credit for some portion of the funds that yonkers received as its share of the comprehensive operating aid that the state extends to all communities,based on student attendance and school district wealth if the state received a credit for some of the dollars routinely paid as general formulaic aid just because those dollars were available to be spent by yonkers on eip items,the state would not be doing anything to remedy its equal share of liability.moreover,yonkers could always contend that fungible state dollars were paying for costs.the issue is far less clear when the state appropriates money for a categorical magnet school program that serves both to enhance the quality of education generally and to promote racial diversity,thereby lessening the effects of past segregation,whether or not intentionally.
ideally,the district court would try to determine precisely how many state dollars were sent to yonkers to remedy past segregation,so as to entitle the state to a credit.unfortunately,that inquiry will rarely yield a clear answer.too many variables prevent certainty,including the different motivations of the legislators in appropriating funds for a particular program,the for funding eligibility,the way the program is administered,the purposes of the program,and its likely and actual effects.faced with such a perplexing inquiry,a district court,exercising its broad discretion to fashion a desegregation remedy,see green county school board,d yonkers vii,at,may reject a claim for state credit unless it is clear that the state is providing the aid almost exclusively to remedy past segregation.the fact that the aid,while enhancing educational quality,coincidentally promotes racial diversity does not require a district court to consider the payment as funding for a desegregation remedy,although a decision to award the state a full or at least a partial credit in such circumstances would likely be within the court discretion.
where liability has been established,the risk of uncertainty in calculating damages falls upon the wrongdoer,see story parchment paterson parchment paper.western geophysical of america bolt associates,cir,and this rule suggests that a tortfeasor must have compelling evidence to sustain an appellate challenge to an apportionment of costs among tortfeasors.we accorded the district court broad discretion as to apportionment in yonkers vii and do so here as well,even though that court has concluded that the partial credit allowed for magnet school payments in fy should no longer be allowed.
ii.state credit for other categorical state aid 
in,the state seeks review of the district court decision,expressed in its opinion of april,and reflected in the fy funding order,to deny the state credit for state categorical grants made under four statewide aid programs.these grants to yonkers supported universal in fy and fy,class size reduction in fy,extended day programs in fy and fy,and technical grants in fy.the monitor calculation of sums due from the state apparently denied the state the requested credits,although very little was said on the subject.he noted that the broad issue of credit for state legislative aid to education had not been resolved by the district court and that state aid to education seems to be waxing more consonant with the design of the desegregation remedy.neither the district court april,opinion approving the monitor fy recommendations nor the ultimate fy funding order explicitly reckoned with the state claim for categorical grant credits.
although we would have preferred some articulation of the district court reasons for disallowing these categorical grant credits and will require such explanation if the issue recurs in the future,we will assume that the court regarded the state claim for credits for these grants as standing on the same basis as the claim for credits for the state magnet school grants.like the magnet school grants,these categorical grants serve both to enhance education generally and to promote some objectives of eip i,but the relationship to the latter purpose is not so direct as to require the district court to regard them as desegregation grants entitling the state to credit.
iii.state credit for federal magnet school aid 
in,and,the state contends that judge sand erred in the treatment of million in federal magnet school aid currently being awarded to the city each year in grant money available only to school systems that are implementing or desegregation.see.in october,the monitor recommended denial of the state motion for a credit for half the federal magnet school aid for fy he reasoned that it was fair to let the city keep the money since it was the city that had applied for it,and since a rule provided maximum incentive to explore outside sources of funds.in november,judge sand adopted the monitor recommendation and reasoning 
the state renews on appeal its claim to benefit equally with yonkers from the federal magnet school grants,which,unlike the state magnet school grants,are targeted solely to school districts implementing desegregation remedies.the state argues that giving yonkers the entire benefit of the federal grant departs from the formula,is unfair to the state since only cities can apply for these federal funds,and fails to recognize that yonkers will retain a substantial incentive to seek outside funding even if it derives only a percent benefit.whatever the force of these arguments,they are not so compelling as to require their acceptance by the district court.the court acceptance of the monitor reasoning for denying the state claim was within the court discretion.
iv.state credit for federal class size reduction aid 
in,the state seeks the credit for one half of the that yonkers received for fy as its share of the million that new york received from the federal government under a catego
