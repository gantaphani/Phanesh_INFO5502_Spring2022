setting the stage 
estrella medina rivera medina appeals from a summary judgment dismissing her title vii case against mvm.medina husband omar cajigas quiñones cajigas and their conjugal partnership also appear as plaintiffs and appellants.their rights,however,derive from hers,so we can ignore them for now and treat her as if she were the only though our decision is binding on all parties,naturally.medina offers a number of reasons why the ruling can not stand.exercising de novo review,soto padró pub.bldgs,cir,we conclude that none persuades.but before getting into all that,we summarize the key facts as favorably to medina as the record will allow,id.at,keenly aware that we can not accept conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation,medina muñoz reynolds tobacco,cir accord ahern shinseki,cir.
in january medina took a job as a,detention officer with mvm,a private firm that provides security services,unarmed guards and other personnel on a contract basis to the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice,among others.having no set schedule,medina worked when and as needed mornings,afternoons,or evenings,filling in for detention officers who could not make their shifts.sometimes she worked only one day a week,probably because mvm used a seniority system for doling out work to detention officers,and she was near the bottom of the seniority list roughly out of the or so persons in her position had more seniority than she.also affecting her work hours was the fact that she started taking afternoon classes at the university of puerto rico in august.
medina and her mvm colleagues worked with ice agents,but she and her mvm were supervised by mvm,not by ice.anyway,sometime before late october oddly,the record does not say exactly when,medina told one of her supervisors,rubén velázquez ferrer velázquez,that an ice agent she did not say who had gotten her phone number off a list posted at an ice control room and was bothering her with calls.bothering,that is the word she used in her deposition,though she later used harassing in her affidavit.hoping to end the calls,medina asked velázquez to take her number off the list.velázquez said that he could not do that i ca take that out,medina quoted velázquez as saying because mvm and ice rules required that detention officers phone numbers be kept in that room.but do worry,he added,because he would run this by one of his bosses,elba navarro calderón navarro.mvm insists that no such conversation occurred between the two.but we must resolve any genuinely disputed facts in medina favor.see galloza foy,cir.
fast forward to october.medina and detention officer isabel orengo muñiz orengo were guarding a female detainee and her daughter at a hotel.ice agent ramón ortiz showed up,tasked with taking the mother and daughter to a hospital for.becoming visibly nervous,medina turned to orengo and asked why him orengo then escorted the mother and daughter to the transport van,at ortiz request.alone with medina in the hotel room,ortiz grabbed her and started kissing her against her will.he touched her all over.she tried to push him off her but could not.he stopped when orengo got back.
the next day,medina told navarro about her frightening encounter with ortiz.she also revealed for the first time that before this incident ortiz would sometimes move very close to her,tell her she smelled good,and try to hug her.this,apparently,had been going on for months.navarro spoke up,saying that when velázquez had talked to her about the situation,she suspected that ortiz might have been the caller.navarro denies saying this,we are told.again,though,at this stage of the lawsuit all reasonable doubts must be resolved against mvm.see id.
springing into action,navarro passed medina complaints through mvm administrative channels that very day.word came back that ortiz was to keep away from medina.on october,medina told an mvm manager that she was afraid to return to work,particularly since ortiz was a ice agent.medina then took a bereavement leave.a little later by october,ortiz was gone,transferred to a different office in a different city.
as part of the contract between mvm and ice,all detention officers had to complete a hour refresher training course,one part of which involved a training seminar on sexual harassment.mvm julio pizarro andino pizarro ran the program.during a seminar in december,pizarro zeroed in on medina and asked her to define sexual harassment.a nervous and embarrassed medina did not want to answer.but pizarro kept at her,demanding to know her definition.sensing her anxiety,a tried to answer for her.is your name estrella medina pizarro asked him sarcastically.when medina started to cry,another colleague attempted to define the term.is your name estrella medina pizarro shot back.finally medina exclaimed,sexual harassment was when one person forces another to sexually humiliate another against her will,like pizarro had just done.
after exhausting her administrative remedies,medina,together with her husband and their conjugal partnership,sued mvm under title vii,et,alleging sex discrimination in the form of harassment,plus retaliation for challenging the harassment mvm eventually moved for summary judgment on all claims,and a magistrate judge recommended that the motion be granted.over medina objections,a district judge accepted the recommendation and entered judgment accordingly.and it is this judgment that medina now appeals to us.
a summary judgment primer 
because plenty of cases spell out the standard in splendid detail,see,rockwood skf usa,cir,we just hit the highlights repeating some of what we said above.giving a fresh look to the judge ruling,we resolve doubts and draw reasonable inferences in medina favor.see,stop shop supermarket blue cross blue shield of,cir casas office,mita copystar,cir.but medina can not rely on speculation to avoid summary judgment.see ahern,at medina muñoz,at.and we need not accept her version of events if it is blatantly contradicted by the evidence.see scott harris,d accord statchen palmer,cir emphasizing that incredible assertions by the nonmoving party need not be accepted.in the end,we will affirm the grant of summary judgment if but only if the record evidence depositions,sworn statements,admissions,reveals that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that mvm is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,see.a,c which is a fancy way of saying that no reasonable jury could find for medina,see farmers ins.exch.rnk,cir.
with this backdrop in place,we turn to the particulars of this case,laying out more facts as needed.
analyzing the issues 
this appeal turns principally on issues of federal law,which is a complex and evolving area.see rodríguez machado shinseki,cir per curiam.we can,however,simplify things a bit by focusing only on what is necessary to decide this dispute.and that is what we will do.
sex discrimination 
title vii prohibits,among other things,discrimination that changes the terms or conditions of employment.see a.and sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination,the supreme court tells us by committing or tolerating sexual harassment against an employee,an employer has effectively altered the terms or conditions of the victim job.see,burlington,ellerth,d.one type of sexual harassment the kind medina alleges involves bothersome attentions or sexual remarks so severe or pervasive that they create a hostile work environment.id.at.ortiz was not an mvm employee like medina.but because,as we have just said,employers must provide their personnel with a workplace,they may be on the hook for a nonemployee behavior under certain conditions one of which being that they knew or should have known about the harassment and yet failed to take prompt steps to stop it.see,rodríguez hernández miranda vélez,cir see also lockard pizza hut,cir collecting cases,including rodríguez hernández lex larson,employment discrimination ed discussing,among other things,e,an eeoc guideline dealing with the standard.
medina argument is straightforward enough.she does not fault mvm response after she complained about ortiz assault after all,ortiz was gone within days of the incident.rather she protests the way mvm handled things after she mentioned the harassing calls.distilled to its essence,her argument goes something like this.before the assault,she had clued in mvm velázquez on how some unnamed ice agent was bothering or harassing her over the phone that agent,she tells us,called her a hundred times or so,which,she intimates,satisfies the requirement.yet mvm did nothing about that,even though mvm navarro admitted after the assault that she suspected ortiz was the harasser,and mvm approach following her conversation with velázquez led to ortiz sexually assaulting her at the hotel and pizarro humiliating her at the seminar.or so her argument concludes.
actually,though,a scan of the record shows that medina did not tell velázquez about a calls.she came up with that number after the assault.and even then she basically admitted that she only knew for sure that he had called her two times.here is how that came about.answering the first call and hearing ortiz identify himself,medina told him do ever call me again,and then she hung up on him.cajigas,her husband,answered the second call.yes,good day,is estrella in ortiz asked.look she not in,cajigas said.oh,well,ortiz responded,t ell her that agent ortiz called her.okay,cajigas replied.and then ortiz hung up.neither medina nor cajigas answered the other calls.but her caller id showed that the calls came from the same number.it turns out that that number is an ice work number,not ortiz personal number.yet she suggests that every call was from ortiz,even though someone could have been calling her on that line for reasons remember,medina was an employee who worked when called.her suggestion is nothing more than the sheerest speculation,which is entitled to no weight in the analysis.see,ahern,at medina muñoz,at see also amusements,town of dedham,cir noting that w hile the summary judgment mantra requires us to draw every reasonable inference in favor of the nonmoving party,inferences,to qualify,must flow rationally from the underlying facts,a suggested inference must ascend to what common sense and human experience indicates is an acceptable level of probability.
even putting that flaw aside,the difficulty for medina is that title vii does not ban harassment alone,no matter how severe or pervasive no,as relevant here,that statute bans sexual harassment.see higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir.harassing and harassment have different meanings in different contexts,broadly covering situations involving words and actions that,being directed at a specific person,annoy,alarm,or cause substantial emotional distress in that person and serve no legitimate purpose like when a creditor uses threatening or abusive tactics to collect a debt.black law dictionary ed.yet nothing medina said during her initial meeting with velázquez indicated that an ice agent was harassing her sexually of course we are not suggesting that she had to throw around buzzwords like sex or sexual harassment.we say only that she had to say something to put mvm on notice that the harassment was.for example,this might be a different case if,in addition to mentioning the harassing calls,medina also told velázquez about her other complaints i,how for months that same agent would get up close to her,tell her she smelled good,and try to hug her.but again,she did not do that.the first time that she brought that stuff up was in her meeting with navarro.as for why,she says that she stayed quiet until then because she feared being fired,though she presents nothing indicating that her fear was credible.see generally reed mbna mktg,cir holding that a vague fear of adverse consequences is not a sufficient basis for keeping quiet.
and while we are talking about navarro,medina makes much of navarro guessing that ortiz was the harasser a guess that should have caused navarro to investigate the situation,which,the theory goes,would have prevented the assault.but there is nothing suggesting navarro knew that ortiz was harassing medina over the phone because of her sex.recall how after medina told velázquez about the harassing calls a conversation that took place before the assault,velázquez shared this information with navarro,who was his in the mvm chain of command.well,again,nothing medina said indicated that the harassment was.also,medina directs us to nothing suggesting that navarro knew,say,that ortiz had a history of sexual harassment,which might have triggered a duty to investigate here.consequently,this argument does not help her position.
the upshot is that medina paints an ugly picture of what ortiz did to her during her mvm tenure.yet even assuming she has sketched events accurately,hard as our sympathies may pull us,our duty to maintain the integrity of the substantive law pulls harder.turner atl.coast line,cir wisdom.and ultimately,she has no claim against mvm,so we affirm the summary judgment on that claim.
retaliation 
whether or not mvm discriminated against her on the basis of sex,medina insists that it infracted title vii by retaliating against her for alleging that it did.see a title vii provision.to succeed on a retaliation claim,a plaintiff must first prove these elements one,she undertook protected conduct.see,ahern,at.two,her employer took a material adverse action against her,action that could deter a reasonable employee from complaining about the discrimination.id.quoting burlington santa fe ry.white,d.requiring that level of adversity helps to separate significant from trivial harms,with petty slights,minor annoyances,and simple lack of good manners falling in the trivial category.burlington,at.and finally,three,a causal nexus exists between elements one and two.ahern,at.obviously too,the employee must show that the retaliator knew about her protected activity after all,one can not have been motivated to retaliate by something he was unaware of.see lewis gillette,cir per curiam indicating that awareness may be shown by circumstantial evidence see also alvarado donahoe,cir similar,and discussing too the process that begins once plaintiff proves a case.
neither side disputes that medina engaged in protected conduct when she told mvm about how ortiz had sexually assaulted her.so we now determine whether the evidence,viewed through the standard prism,can support a finding that she suffered a materially adverse action causally connected to her protected activity.she thinks it does,making a number of arguments that boil down to this after she named ortiz as her assaulter,mvm,she says,a suspended her almost immediately,from october the day she told navarro about the terrifying hotel incident until november then b severely cut her work hours and later c humiliated her during the seminar.we discuss these points one by one.
as support for her suspension charge,medina relies on her,basically.take,for example,her deposition,where she flatly denied working during the alleged suspension term.not even one hour counsel asked.nothing,she said.she also relies on her mvm earning statements,which,she intimates,show a gap reflecting the alleged suspension period.a couple of things make her argument a nonstarter,however.for openers,she later admitted in her opposing statement of material that she had indeed worked during the three weeks following the incident with ortiz,during the supposed suspension term.on top of that,earning statements provided by mvm show that,yes,she had worked during that period something that she also admitted in her opposing statement of material facts.and as we just said a moment ago,we can not accept a party version of the facts when it is blatantly contradicted by the record,so that no reasonable jury could believe it,see scott,at,which is exactly our situation.clearly,then,medina has not met the action requirement here.
nor does she do any better in arguing that mvm slashed her work hours after she accused ortiz of sexual assault.what trips her up here is that she does not support her rhetoric with hard proof.looking to defeat summary judgment,she told the court below that one can not tell from mvm records how many hours she worked bef
