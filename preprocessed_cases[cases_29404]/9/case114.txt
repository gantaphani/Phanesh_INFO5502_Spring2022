nina shervin,secured admission to one of the country most prestigious orthopedic residency programs.when she was placed on academic probation,she concluded that her superiors were discriminating against her based on her gender and thereafter began retaliating against her because she had dared to challenge the probation decision.bent on vindicating these suspicions,shervin repaired to the federal district court and sued a gallimaufry of defendants,asserting claims under both state and federal law.
the district court whittled down shervin suit during pretrial proceedings,and a day jury trial ensued.the jury returned an verdict for the defendants.shervin appeals,asseverating that the district court miscalibrated the statute of limitations,improperly denied recusal,made several untoward evidentiary rulings,and committed instructional errors.after careful consideration of her asseverational array,we find no reversible error and,therefore,affirm the judgment below.
background 
we sketch the genesis and travel of the case,reserving a more exegetic discussion of the facts until our appraisal of the issues raised on appeal.
in,shervin began her training in the harvard combined orthopedics residency program hcorp or the program.the program is sponsored by massachusetts general hospital mgh,and training takes place at four teaching hospitals mgh,brigham and women hospital the brigham,children hospital,and beth israel deaconess medical center bidmc.mgh and the brigham are both under the corporate umbrella of partners healthcare system,partners.during her residency,shervin was nominally an employee of partners and worked under an employment contract with that entity.
hcorp is governed by an executive committee comprised of its director and the chiefs of the orthopedics departments at the four participating hospitals.during the times relevant hereto,james herndon served as the program director and harry rubash served as the chief of orthopedics at mgh.both of these physicians were employed at mgh through a private,corporation,massachusetts general hospital physicians organization mgpo,and held faculty appointments at harvard medical school harvard.
through the fourth year of her residency,herndon placed shervin on academic probation a decision shervin soon came to regard as motivated by gender bias.she asserts that,after she challenged the decision internally,she was subjected to further discrimination and an onslaught of retaliation that plagued her throughout her training and followed her as she pursued job opportunities throughout massachusetts.
on october,shervin filed a charge of discrimination with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad against partners,harvard,herndon,and rubash.the mcad later dismissed the charge without prejudice upon receiving shervin notification that she had elected to pursue her claims in court.see.laws ch.in april of,she sued in the federal district court,asserting claims of unlawful discrimination and retaliation against partners,mgpo,harvard,herndon,and rubash claims of discrimination and retaliation against partners,mgpo,and harvard and claims of tortious interference with advantageous business relations against partners and herndon and rubash.
after extensive discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the claims,arguing that many were and that the remainder were foreclosed on other grounds.the district court granted partial summary judgment with respect to the discrimination and retaliation claims,ruling that for all defendants except harvard conduct occurring prior to june,could not serve as a basis for liability or damages.see shervin partners healthcare,d.the court fixed this date based on the applicable day statute of limitations under federal and state discrimination laws,see e.laws ch,and a tolling agreement establishing a constructive filing date for shervin suit of april.harvard was not bound by the tolling agreement,and the district court fixed its limitations date at december.see shervin,d at.the court was quick to add,however,that while the d efendants may not be found liable for conduct outside the limitations period,the jury may still be permitted to consider untimely background evidence in assessing the viability of the actionable discrimination and retaliation claims.id.at.the court denied the summary judgment motions in all other respects.see id.at.
after a lengthy trial,the jury returned a verdict.this timely appeal followed.
in this court,shervin musters a plethora of claims of error.we consider them in roughly the same order as the underlying events occurred below.
ii.the summary judgment ruling 
shervin flagship claim is that the district court erred in its application of massachusetts law,leading it to conclude that certain alleged acts of discrimination and retaliation were.we preface our discussion of this issue with a brief account of the pertinent facts,taking them in the light most favorable to the party here,shervin.see noviello city of,cir.
shervin initially did well in her residency and received positive evaluations from her supervisors.in early,however,herndon received a complaint from an orthopedics fellow about shervin recent performance in the program.the fellow raised specific patient care issues and expressed concerns regarding shervin professionalism and technical competence.on february,herndon met with shervin and communicated these concerns to her.at the end of the meeting,he placed her on academic probation,telling her that probation could have a serious effect on her licensure,her upcoming fellowship and her ability to find a job.
a letter,dated march,outlined the terms of the probation,including monthly performance evaluations increased monitoring mandatory attendance at all educational components of the program and a ban on moonlighting.the letter warned that if shervin performance continued to deteriorate,she could be exposed to further discipline,including dismissal from the program.
around the same time,herndon told shervin mentor,dennis burke,that the reason he herndon had gone directly to probation without first issuing a warning or undertaking counseling was due to shervin stoic response to his concerns he added that,in his years of supervising residents,he had never before disciplined a woman resident and not seen her cry.based largely on this comment,and on her perception that immediate probation was not standard practice in hcorp,shervin concluded that herndon rush to judgment had been motivated by gender bias specifically,his stereotypical attitude toward women and her failure to behave in the way that herndon expected her to behave.
shervin voiced her concerns to rubash in march of.according to shervin,rubash expressed surprise at herndon decision to impose academic probation without consulting hcorp executive committee.but he then asked rhetorically if she wanted to graduate from the program and admonished her not to think of ever filing suit against him,herndon,or the program because doing so would not be beneficial to her career.
in shervin view,this incident marked the beginning of a steady stream of retaliatory and discriminatory acts that clouded the remainder of her residency.these acts included the zealous solicitation of negative comments about her by herndon and rubash.
in late march of,shervin requested a review of the probation decision by the executive committee.the committee upheld the decision in early june.shervin contends that the review process was incomplete,biased,and lacking in basic procedural safeguards.she also alleges that,shortly after this review concluded,a member of the executive committee mark gebhardt told burke that shervin needs to get her head screwed on and realize that she is a woman in a man specialty and suck it up.
in late june of,herndon and the executive committee extended shervin probation for three more months based on allegations of poor performance on a rotation at another hospital.shervin says that these allegations were unsubstantiated.she adds that,throughout the summer of,the defendants repeatedly tried to find fault with her performance and solicited negative evaluations of her work.by september,she felt threatened,unsafe,and harassed.
about the time that shervin extended probation ended in september of,herndon was replaced as her residency program director though he remained the director of the overall residency program and a member of hcorp executive committee.she nevertheless complains that retaliation persisted through her graduation from the program in june of 
there was more.shervin complains that,from july of to april of,officials of both harvard and partners falsely assured her that her probation would not need to be reported outside the program such as to state licensing authorities or prospective employers.these assurances,she says,discouraged her from immediately pursuing her grievance rights within the program.moreover,the assurances were not true her probation resulted in both a delay in the issuance of her license to practice medicine and the issuance of only a limited license in her fellowship year 
according to shervin,retaliatory acts continued even after her residency ended.for one thing,she says that the formal grievance process that she undertook in and which resulted in an affirmation of the probation decision was marred by bias,falsehoods,and insufficient procedures.for another thing,she says that the defendants deliberately blocked her from at least three job opportunities in massachusetts hospitals during the time frame.
with this factual predicate in mind,we turn to the merits of the district court summary judgment ruling.we review that determination de novo.see noviello,at.to avoid the swing of the summary judgment scythe,mulvihill top flite golf,cir,the nonmoving party here,shervin bears the burden of pointing to admissible evidence showing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact,see blackie maine,cir.the may not rely on conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.medina munoz reynolds tobacco,cir.
in this case,the court below considered full briefing and heard protracted arguments on the motions for summary judgment.it concluded that as a basis for either finding liability or awarding damages on the discrimination and retaliation claims.see shervin,d at see also e setting forth applicable day statute of limitations.laws ch,similar.the court then entered partial summary judgment to this effect,leaving open shervin other claims.the court ruling allowed shervin to introduce,as context evidence,proof about how she was placed on probation and the acts of alleged retaliation.see id.at.
before us,shervin argues that the district court erred in calibrating the statute of limitations for her discrimination and retaliation claims.as a threshold matter,she insists that her claims did not accrue until the probation hindered her ability to obtain a medical license in the summer of.we do not agree.
under both federal and state law,a cause of action for discrimination or retaliation accrues when it has a crystallized and tangible effect on the employee and the employee has notice of both the act and its invidious etiology.see thomas eastman kodak,cir wheatley am,adamczyk augat.here,shervin was convinced from the outset that discrimination and retaliation were at work.thus,her thesis boils down to a contention that the probation decision had no tangible,concrete effect either on her career or her employment as a medical resident until mid.
this contention is untenable.as no less an authority than the supreme court has stated,t he proper focus for determining when a cause of action accrues for limitations purposes is upon the time of the discriminatory acts,not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts became most painful.state coll.ricks,emphasis omitted quoting abramson of,cir accord sch.comm.of brockton mcad.
it is plain that shervin had notice almost immediately after being placed on probation that this disciplinary action was both tangible and concrete her probation was unconditional and instantly resulted in the imposition of a series of burdensome conditions such as heightened supervision,more frequent evaluations,and a ban on any outside work.moreover,context is always important and it is significant that the probation here occurred in the course of a prestigious and highly competitive academic medicine residency at a group of teaching hospitals.in that milieu,probation was not as shervin would now have us believe akin to sending a high school student to detention.rather,it was an ugly blot on an otherwise glittering record of accomplishment and something to be taken quite seriously.
indeed,both shervin and her mentor,burke,recognized the gravity of the probation placement immediately.that was why,from the very outset,shervin fought so hard to reverse or expunge it.given the record in this case,it strains credulity to suggest that probation was something to be taken lightly 
shervin averments regarding assurances about the innocuous effects of her probation do not alter our conclusion.during the period of roughly days from the time her probation was imposed until november of,virtually all of the information that shervin received about the reporting of probation pointed unerringly in the opposite direction.for example,herndon informed her from the very beginning both orally and in writing that probation could have a significant negative impact on her licensure,board certification,and job prospects.so,too,burke as early as april of expressed his deep concern about the effects of probation,writing to hcorp executive committee that probation,if allowed to stand,is such a serious disciplinary action that it will be required to be reported on every job or fellowship application and on every state licensure renewal.shervin does not deny that she knew about this letter and its contents.to round out the picture,the director of the office of women careers at mgh warned shervin in july of that probation may need to be reported depending on the specific questions asked on state or hospital licensing forms.
to be sure,in november of,mgh chief medical officer britain nicholson asked burke to advise shervin that she should just accept the probation since it was an internal matter that did not need to be reported externally.he emphasized that her probation ought not to be the focus of future references.but that opinion,standing alone,did not erase the very real effects that probation already had wrought on the terms and conditions of shervin residency.see,miller dep t of,cir.nor was there a reasonable basis for believing that persons who might subsequently be tasked with writing references would see the matter the same way there were simply too many contrary indications.under these circumstances,the evidence about what was said to burke in november of was not significantly probative as to whether the alleged discrimination was likely to cease and,therefore,could not defeat summary judgment.see anderson liberty lobby.
the short of it is that shervin knowledge of the probation and its immediate,tangible effects,together with her loudly bruited belief that the probation decision was a form of disparate discipline motivated by gender discrimination,is all that was needed for her cause of action to accrue and the limitations clock to begin to tick.see miller,at wheatley,at adamczyk,at.
shervin next contends that the district court should have applied an exception to the statute of limitations known as the continuing violation doctrine.see regs.stating that the day requirement shall not be a bar to filing in those instances where facts are alleged which indicate that the unlawful conduct complained of is of a continuing nature.under massachusetts law,the continuing violation doctrine serves as an exception to the statute of limitations only if three prerequisites are satisfied.a plaintiff who seeks to derive the benefit of the continuing violation doctrine bears the burden of establishing all three of its elements.see cuddyer stop shop supermkt,ocean spray,mcad.
first,the claim must be one that arises from a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.cuddyer,at.second,the claim must be anchored by at least one incident of discrimination or retaliation transpiring within the limitations period.noviello,at see cuddyer,at.this anchoring event must be substantially relate d to earlier instances of discrimination or retaliation and must contribute to the continuation of the pattern of conduct that forms the basis of the claim.cuddyer,at see noviello,at.third,the plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in her circumstances would have refrained from filing a complaint within the limitations period.see cuddyer,at.on this final element,the inquiry becomes whether the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known within the limitations period both that her work environment was discriminatory and that the problems she attributed to that discriminatory environment were unlikely to cease.see see also ocean spray,at explaining that the limitations period begins when the employee knew or reasonably should have been aware that the employer was unlikely to afford him a reasonable accommodation.as to the likelihood vel non of improvement,the question is whether the plaintiff delay in initiating the lawsuit,considered under an objective standard,was unreasonable,and summary judgment may be appropriate on this element where a pattern of harassment,considered from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,is so sufficiently known,pervasive,and uncorrectable that it would be unreasonable to delay filing suit.cuddyer,at.
in this instance,we can proceed directly to the third step of the continuing violation inquiry.even if the acts alleged by shervin satisfy the first two elements a matter on which we take no view her claim falters at the third step 
shervin does not dispute nor could she that she knew of the alleged incidents of retaliation and discrimination and regarded them as pervasive.it is undisputed on the summary judgment record that shervin came to believe almost immediately after the february meeting that herndon had discriminated against her based on gender and that she was experiencing a continuing stream of related discriminatory and retaliatory acts.her own deposition testimony indicates that she expressed specific concerns about discrimination to rubash as early as march of and specific concerns about retaliation to the executive committee the following month.
of course,under the continuing violation doctrine as formulated by the massachusetts courts and the mcad,a person awareness and duty to bring suit,ocean spray,at,arises only when the person has good reason to believe that her problems would not cease,cuddyer,at.here,shervin adduced no probative evidence that,during the days following either the february probation decision or rubash march comments,she thought it likely that her discriminatory treatment would cease.indeed,shervin complaint characterized her experience after she challenged the probation decision as a witch hunt and a campaign waged hour to hour,day to day,weeks on end with no resolution in sight.she further declared that the retaliation and discrimination continued unabated even after both she and burke reached out to partners and harvard for assistance.
these statements make pellucid shervin early awareness of both her plight and its unrelenting nature.the record evidence tells the same tale.it convincingly shows,as early as march of,that shervin was keenly aware that probation entailed immediate negative effects,had potentially deleterious consequences,and was not likely to be rescinded.and matters went downhill from there by june,the executive committee had ratified the probation decision using a process that shervin at the time found fundamentally unfair and herndon backed by the executive committee had extended the probationary period by three months on the basis of complaints that shervin believed were trumped up and inadequately investigated.
a reasonable person in shervin shoes,knowing the immediate downside of probation and its potentially detrimental effects on her future career,could not plausibly have thought that her discriminatory treatment was likely to abate.this is especially true since she professed to believe that the decisionmakers who had the power to furnish a remedy were taking biased views of her evaluations,searching for fault,and building a case against her.though some modest ameliorations did occur such as in september of when her probation was finally lifted and herndon was replaced as her residency director,those ameliorations apparently did nothing to relieve shervin sense that she was under siege.contemporaneously,shervin complained to hcorp administration about sent to the resident community from the accounts of other residents that she perceived to be offensive to women.she had requested confidentiality for her report and,when another resident accused shervin of being the source of the complaint,she concluded that a leak had occurred as part of the ongoing campaign of retaliation.even when she met with james kasser in september of and learned that she had been taken off probation,she told him of her continuing feeling of being threatened,unsafe,and harassed in the program.those fears were exacerbated when,according to shervin,kasser told her that the executive committee would continue to probe at residents to find any fault with her and expressed concerns about her professional behavior which she thought made no sense in the context of her efforts while on probation.in the same time frame,she also was pointedly informed by one of her supervising physicians that people were out to get her,so that she ought to watch her back.in shervin own words,t he retaliatory atmosphere continued even after the lifting of her probation.
an assertion that a situation seemed likely to improve must be grounded on more than rhetoric.here,nothing transpired that would have sufficed to ground an objectively reasonable belief that what shervin regarded as a pattern of discrimination and retaliation would dissipate.
nor are the assurances that shervin allegedly received about the effects of her probation adequate to create a genuine dispute as to the footing for a reasonable belief that her situation was likely to be successfully remedied.id.at.in arguing for a contrary conclusion,shervin points to at least two instances of supposedly equivocal or ultimately incorrect advice that she received throughout about the impact of probation on her medical licensure the executive committee statement in june that many other residents had resolved problems without any negative consequences,and assurances from nicholson in the fall that the probation was purely internal and not reportable to the licensing board these statements,however,are not probative of whether shervin reasonably could have believed that her work environment would improve.whether or not her probation was reportable would not affect the duration or conduct of the campaign of discrimination and retaliation which shervin believed was afoot from and after the moment she was placed on probation.and in all events,shervin does not claim that these assurances were products of a discriminatory or retaliatory animus as opposed to confusion,mistake,or subsequent changes in the licensing board regulations.
to sum up,shervin knew,from the time her probation was imposed in february of,that probation had materially adverse ramifications both for the rest of her residency and at least potentially for her future career.she formed an almost immediate belief,never diluted,that her probation was sparked by gender bias and she likewise came to believe,within a matter of weeks,that this change in her status was merely the beginning of a pervasive pattern of discriminatory and retaliatory acts.nor had she shown any reasonable basis for hoping that the situation would improve the executive committee rebuffed her attempt to have the probation decision reversed in june of,the term of her probation was extended shortly thereafter,and acts that she believed to be discriminatory and retaliatory continued to occur.
the bottom line is that the record,even when taken in the light most hospitable to shervin,does not support a finding that a reasonable person in shervin circumstances would have thought her situation apt to improve within the limitations period.see generally cuddyer,at setting forth the guiding principles to be applied by a judge deciding a motion for summary judgment with respect to the continuing violation doctrine.while shervin has pointed to bits and pieces of an extended dialogue that might,if taken in a vacuum,support her contrary position,we are obliged to view the summary judgment record as a whole.see,mesnick,cir.so viewed,there is no significantly probative evidence,anderson,at,to underpin a finding that shervin can satisfy the third element of the massachusetts continuing violation framework.it follows inexorably that the district court did not err in holding that shervin discrimination and retaliation claims could not be rescued through the continuing violation doctrine 
in an effort to turn the tide,shervin strives to convince us that there are two other grounds on which a jury might have found that her discrimination and retaliation claims avoided the limitations bar.we are not persuaded.
shervin begins with a suggestion that the statute of limitations was tolled by her pursuit,starting in march of,of an internal grievance under her employment contract.we need not linger long over this suggestion.massachusetts recognizes an exception to the statute of limitations when an aggrieved party enters into grievance proceedings pursuant to an employment contract within days from the challenged conduct.regs.the district court ruled that this exception did not apply because the mcad has interpreted the regulation as applying only to those grievance proceedings undertaken pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.see shervin,d at see also hall fmr,d,discussing underlying mcad decision in which agency formally took this position cuddyer,at noting massachusetts courts consistent deference to mcad decisions and policies.shervin insists that this is an incorrect reading of massachusetts law and that she properly invoked her grievance rights by a letter to the hcorp executive committee dated march.
we need not delve into the district court rationale because shervin did not invoke the grievance process in march of.we divide our explanatory comments into two segments,consistent with the fact that shervin employment contract incorporated both an adverse action process and a redress of grievance process.
the adverse action process pertains only to certain enumerated adverse actions,not including probation,and shervin was told that probation was not considered an adverse action.perhaps more importantly,that process sets out procedural rules to be followed by the hospital in taking such an action against a trainee.it does not provide a mechanism through which a resident or other employee can initiate complaints against her employer.it is,therefore,impuissant as a means of accessing the grievance exception.
the redress of grievance process is a different matter.that process applies to g rievances pertaining to the training program,faculty,or work environment.thus,the redress of grievance process applies on its face to a person in shervin position.
but there is a rub under the redress of grievance process,grievances must first be directed to the training program director in writing,and copied to the service chief and the director of graduate medical education.the program director then has two weeks to respond.if a response is not forthcoming or is unsatisfactory,the trainee may then request a hearing.
shervin letter simply did not invoke this process and it was never construed as invoking it.the letter,which was addressed to the chair of hcorp executive committee,was copied only to other committee members.the redress of grievance process was not mentioned.the ad hoc nature of shervin letter and her failure to initiate the redress of grievance process were confirmed by her subsequent interactions with partners staff and hcorp.
when shervin letter was received,hcorp undertook what it described as an informal review.in late april,partners vice president for graduate medical education,debra weinstein,reminded shervin that she could utilize the partners resident grievance process at any time.shervin took no action in response to this reminder for aught that appears,she neither sought to avail herself of the grievance process nor sought to go beyond the informal review that had been provided.
the executive committee informed shervin on june that it had completed its informal review.thereafter,shervin took no action anent grievance proceedings until the spring of,when she brought concerns about her medical licensure to officials at partners.even at that stage,the record makes manifest that both she and partners believed that she had not activated the redress of grievance process.it was not until late march of that shervin asked to meet with partners officials to learn about options for addressing grievances.she received a reply less than a week later,reminding her of the redress of grievance process.in may of that year,shervin noted in an that she had not yet initiate d a formal grievance process.
in light of the consistent interpretation placed by both partners and shervin on her march letter and the actions that ensued,we think it crystal clear that shervin did not invoke the redress of grievance process by means of that letter.
that is game,set,and match.even if we assume that the redress of grievance process,if properly invoked,would engage the gears of the grievance exception,shervin can not benefit from that exception 
finally,we agree with the district court that there is no cognizable basis for equitable tolling here.in massachusetts,such an extraordinary remedy is applied sparingly in employment discrimination cases.adamczyk,at.invoking such a palliative is permitted when,say,the plaintiff is excusably ignorant about the statutory filing period,or where the defendant or the mcad has affirmatively misled the plaintiff.andrews arkwright mut.ins,citation omitted.so,too,the doctrine can be employed where the potential defendant encourages or cajoles the potential plaintiff into inaction.cherella phoenix.none of these scenarios is present in this case and as we explain below,nothing of comparable magnitude transpired here.
to begin,shervin does not plead ignorance about the filing period.second,though shervin maintains that she was misled about the impact of her probation on her future licensure,she does not suggest that she relied on any such misrepresentations in considering whether or when to file her complaint.the mere fact that shervin may have relied on some misrepresentations by the defendants for other purposes does not establish the necessary linkage between those misrepresentations and her delay in bringing her complaint.see english pabst brewing,cir to invoke equitable tolling,the plaintiff must therefore show that the defendant attempted to mislead him and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentation by neglecting to file a timely charge.given this record,we discern no plausible basis for a claim of equitable tolling.see,rivera díaz humana ins.of,cir.
that ends this aspect of the matter.because all the broadsides that shervin aims at the district court entry of partial summary judgment miss the mark,we uphold the district court calibration of the limitations period and,thus,its summary judgment ruling.
iii.recusal 
shervin argues that a new trial is necessary because the district judge failed to recuse herself when an appearance of partiality arose.see a.this argument is doubly waived.
we set the stage.george dyer was a resident in orthopedics at mgh during shervin residency one year ahead of her and,in early,reported to herndon concerns about shervin performance.in ruling on a motion to quash discovery subpoenas,the district judge noticed that documents relating to dyer were included among the requests.the district judge promptly disclosed that dyer is her first cousin.she added that she did not consider this relationship to be a basis for recusal,but she nonetheless invited the parties to register any concerns that they might have with the court.shervin did not voice any objections,nor did she urge the judge recusal at any point.she likewise remained silent when dyer was identified to the jury as a fact witness in the opening statements of two of the defendants partners and herndon,which were delivered before the first witness was sworn.
near the end of her case in chief,shervin called dyer as a hostile witness.during direct examination,the district judge sustained defense objections to several questions aimed at developing an ostensible inconsistency in herndon testimony an inconsistency that purportedly arose because herndon testified that dyer reported his concerns in a meeting where another resident was present,while dyer said in his deposition that he and herndon had met alone.
after declining to undertake redirect examination and releasing the witness,shervin counsel requested a sidebar conference.at sidebar,she stated that she was concerned about the way in which this witness was handled by the court and asked the judge to inform the jury of her relationship with the witness to read dyer deposition testimony into the record.she did not,however,ask the judge to recuse herself.
when defense counsel pointed out that the judge had previously disclosed her relationship to dyer and no objection had been forthcoming,shervin counsel responded i withdraw my request,presumably referring to both of her curative requests.to dispel any further doubt on this issue,the district judge formally denied the remedies sought by shervin counsel,noting for the record the nature of the examination of dyer and her prior disclosure on the record of her relationship to dyer.the judge added that she had sustained the defendants objections because the questions were improper in form,and the statements sought to be introduced as prior inconsistent statements did not appear to be inconsistent with dyer deposition testimony.
against this backdrop,shervin argues that the judge obligation to recuse herself blossomed when counsel pointed out that the judge,knowing that dyer deposition testimony was inconsistent with his testimony on the stand,foreclosed efforts to impeach dyer with his prior deposition testimony and did not permit explanation of counsel concerns until the witness was excused.this argument stumbles at the starting gate.
in this case,the judge forthrightly disclosed her relationship to the witness prior to trial and provided ample opportunity for the parties to move for recusal.shervin did not seek the judge disqualification but,rather,by her silence acquiesced in the judge continued participation.that was a waiver,pure and simple.see,in re cargill,cir w aivers based on silence are standard fare.where,as here,the putative ground for recusal involves only an asserted appearance of partiality and thus rests solely on a,a judge is permitted to accept a party waiver as long as that waiver is preceded by a full disclosure of the alleged basis for disqualification.see e see also cargill,at el fenix de johanny,cir.it follows that shervin can not now be heard to complain that the judge should have recused herself despite the parties informed willingness to have her preside.
nor did subsequent developments in the trial mandate the judge recusal.to begin,shervin counsel never asked the judge to step down,even when she expressed her concerns about the judge handling of dyer.and with respect to the relief that she did request,there was a second waiver.at the sidebar conference following dyer direct examination which occurred near the end of trial shervin counsel was reminded of her earlier acquiescence,and she then withdrew her request for any curative action.that,too,was a waiver an intentional relinquishment of a known right.see,united states rodriguez,cir explaining that a party who identifies an issue,and then explicitly withdraws it,has waived the issue.
we need not tarry.the district judge performed admirably in managing a highly contentious trial.there is no claim of any actual bias on her part and the record reveals no footing for any such claim.as a general rule,a party is not entitled to relief on appeal that she did not seek below.see,cahoon shelton,cir beaulieu irs,cir.this case falls comfortably within this general rule,not within the exception to it.we find,without serious question,that the district judge did not err by failing to recuse herself sua sponte despite the parties tacit agreement that she continue to preside.
iv.evidentiary rulings 
shervin takes issue with a host of evidentiary rulings that she says deprived her of the ability to present critical evidence of discrimination and retaliation.we review rulings admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion.see torres arroyo rullán,cir gomez rivera rodríguez,cir.here,we have examined all of shervin claims with care.many relate to rulings limiting evidence of the experiences of other individuals who had allegedly faced discrimination or retaliation at the hands of one or more of the defendants.others relate to the exclusion of evidence that shervin hoped would show differential treatment in disciplinary or hiring contexts or,alternatively,would provide additional background information on the culture at mgh and its department of orthopedics.
it would serve no useful purpose to plow through all of these claimed bevues one by one.here,it suffices for the most part to say that after perscrutation of the record and the parties arguments,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding this evidence,particularly since much of it was either cumulative,attenuated from the issues underlying the litigated claims,peripheral,overly conducive to creating juror confusion,or unfairly prejudicial to one or more of the defendants.
this omnibus ruling reflects our awareness that trial courts enjoy a superior coign of vantage in undertaking the delicate balancing required to make these kinds of evidentiary determinations.fitzgerald expressway sewerage,cir.given the district court evident solicitude for policing the bounds of relevancy and keeping the jury focused on the issues in the case,we are unwilling to disturb the district court assessment of much of the proffered evidence.
there are,however,three evidentiary rulings that though supportable deserve more exegetic treatment.each of these three rulings excluded an statement offered by shervin as evidence of retaliatory animus.she asserts that these statements qualify as under various exceptions to the hearsay rule,and that the court exclusionary rulings were so uniquely important and so egregiously wrong that they eroded the foundation of her case.
before turning to these three challenges,we summarize a few first principles.statements,not made under oath,are generally regarded as hearsay evidence and,thus,are presumptively inadmissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted.see.c.there are several circumstances,however,in which such statements can shed their hearsay character and become eligible for admission into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.see id.d.yet even then,statements like other pieces of evidence must pass through further screens they may be excluded on,say,relevancy grounds,see id,or on grounds of undue prejudice,waste of time,potential for jury confusion,and the like,see id.it is against this backdrop that we approach the task at hand.
shervin sought to elicit through the testimony of partners former board chair that mgh ceo,peter slavin,had once told him that there not a court in the land that could force me to hire shervin back.shervin sought to admit this hearsay statement to show bias against her in the upper echelons of mgh and to explain partners interference with a potential job at cooley dickinson hospital cooley.
the relevant facts are as follows.cooley a hospital not then affiliated with partners offered shervin a position in the spring of.the offer was withdrawn,however,before she could accept it.in the same time frame,cooley was in merger talks with mgh.building on this foundation,shervin contends that slavin comment could have supported an inference that he or others following his orders used the relationship with cooley officials to stifle her job offer.this led to shervin attempt to introduce evidence of slavin hearsay statement,but when defense counsel objected to the questioning of the board chair about this statement,the district court sustained the objection.
although the challenged statement,if viewed in isolation,may seem to boost shervin theory of the case,the evidence as it unfolded at trial tells a more nuanced tale.shervin did not establish through either evidence or proffer when the statement was alleged to have been made by slavin,nor did she connect this statement in any way to cooley withdrawal of the job offer.what is more,shervin did not adduce a shred of evidence showing that slavin was himself a decisionmaker with regard to the cooley job offer or that he in any way influenced or attempted to influence cooley decision not to hire shervin.indeed,there is no evidence that slavin ever spoke to or otherwise communicated with anyone at cooley.
in excluding the challenged statement,the district court relied on federal rule of evidence.that rule requires a court to balance the probative value of particular evidence against the unfairly prejudicial effect of that evidence.see united states.mehanna,cir,cert.denied,s.without more meat on the bones,this lone remark was hardly probative of any actual influence by the defendants on the withdrawal of the job offer from cooley.see,lewis city of chi.police dep t,cir noting,in employment discrimination case,that comments of had little probative value as to the intent or mindset of the decisionmakers.
to be sure,we explained in travers flight services systems,cir,that even without direct evidence of causation a jury may reasonably infer that the wishes of a king often will be carried out by his courtiers when other evidence shows that retaliatory animus resides at the apex of the organizational hierarchy.id.at.but travers is distinguishable in many respects.first,the excluded statement here was much more like the nonprobative stray,stale,or ambiguous comments contrasted by the travers court with the probative strongly held,repeatedly voiced,and precise directives of the ceo.id.it is only the latter that travers said may permit an inference that animus was communicated throughout the organization.second,slavin comment was not made to an underling who might have been inclined to curry favor by carrying out his directives.see id.last but far from least slavin did not occupy the apex of cooley organizational hierarchy indeed,he was not part of that hierarchy.and although one can speculate that the pendency of merger negotiations may have accorded slavin views some weight if made known to the prospective merger partner,there is nothing in the record that suggests he ever communicated those views to cooley decisionmakers or,for that matter,to anyone associated with cooley.
when,as in this instance,highly charged evidence is of doubtful probative value,it may be excluded.see,williams drake,cir.the case for exclusion is stronger,of course,where,as here,the evidence has a high potential for unfair prejudice.downey bob disc.furniture holdings,cir.these tenets are controlling.given that the challenged statement was both incendiary in nature and offered without any supporting evidence that would have tethered it to the situation that played out at cooley,we can not say that the court below abused its discretion in striking the rule balance in favor of exclusion.after all,o nly rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.freeman package mach,cir.
shervin attempted to introduce evidence,through the testimony of the former ceo of milton hospital milton,that gebhardt,the chief of the orthopedics department at bidmc,blocked shervin hiring at milton a bidmc affiliate in the summer of.this evidence comprised statements that gebhardt would find it difficult to work with a person who was suing him and that if shervin was permitted to work at the new orthopedics center at milton,he would withdraw bidmc involvement there.shervin sought to admit gebhardt statements in support of her retaliation claims against harvard and partners,insisting that the statements were under federal rule of evidence d d,which covers admissions of a.
prior to trial,partners and other defendants but not harvard moved in limine to exclude gebhardt statements,arguing that they were made while gebhardt was acting under the authority of a,namely,harvard medical faculty physicians,a corporation consisting of physicians employed at bidmc.shervin opposed this motion,postulating that gebhardt statements were made in his capacity as a member of hcorp executive committee and that partners was ultimately responsible for hcorp.the district court granted the motion in limine,concluding that the challenged statements concerned an independent decision by gebhardt,which broke the causal chain needed to establish a connection to partners.see mole of.shervin provides no justification for this determination.
during the trial,the district court carefully sifted through evidence involving statements of gebhardt that shervin was attempting to attribute to partners.the court admitted some statements that were made within the scope of gebhardt executive committee position such as his statement to burke that shervin needed to get her head screwed on because she was a woman in a man specialty.however,the court excluded other statements.we discern no abuse of discretion given the evidence that gebhardt statements regarding shervin potential employment at milton were not within the scope of his role on hcorp executive committee,the court had sufficient reason to exclude those statements.
alternatively,shervin theorizes that the excluded statements were imputable to harvard by virtue of gebhardt faculty appointment and his seat on hcorp executive committee.the district court rejected this proffer,concluding that these hearsay statements were not admissible against harvard and that any probative value was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.
once again,we find no abuse of discretion.rule d d exempts from the definition of hearsay statements offered against an opposing party and made by the party agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed.here,though,shervin utterly failed to lay a foundation for showing that the challenged statements,any of the staffing decisions at milton,or any purported threat to withdraw bidmc medical faculty support fell within the scope of gebhardt harvard faculty appointment.thus,the excluded statements did not qualify as a party opponent statements within the purview of rule d d.see,vazquez lopez rosario,cir.
shervin has a fallback position with respect to the admissibility of these statements.she suggests that the statements should have been admitted as to harvard for the limited purpose of impeaching gebhardt denial that he ever said he would not support the new center if shervin were brought on board.see.b.but as the district court noted,the probative value of this impeachment evidence was greatly overshadowed by the fact that shervin failed to introduce any competent evidence to prove retaliation by harvard with respect to the position at milton.indeed,shervin failed to dredge up even a scintilla of evidence showing harvard involvement in the selection process for this position because there was too great a risk under the circumstances that the jury would consider the challenged evidence as substantive evidence against harvard,the district court acted well within the encincture of its discretion in sustaining harvard objection to this evidence.see united states hudson,cir upholding exclusion of evidence under rule even though evidence admissible under rule b see also faigin kelly,cir we are extremely reluctant to the district court battlefield determination that the scenario at hand presented a worrisome potential for unfair prejudice.
the next bone of contention involves an statement made to burke by joseph mccarthy,a in the mgh orthopedics department and the director of the center for joint reconstruction at newton wellesley hospital nwh,a partners affiliate.this statement was contained in an april exchange between the two doctors about the possibility of finding shervin a position at nwh upon the completion of her fellowship.in relevant part,burke wrote i am glad that you are on board with shervin staff position,and mccarthy responded,i glad we on the same page with this.i do my part out here.shervin proffered this evidence,too,as under rule d d.its purpose,she asserts,was to refute claims that she had not been hired at nwh either because she had not formally applied for such a position or because no positions were available.
the district court excluded the statement,and shervin assails the court exclusionary ruling.some further facts are needed to put her assignment of error in perspective.
prior to trial,harvard moved in limine to bar the introduction of this evidence,arguing that mccarthy statement was hearsay and that it was not admissible as a vicarious admission since mccarthy held only a clinical associate position at harvard and,thus,shervin could not show that any statements mccarthy made regarding hiring at mgh or nwh were within the scope of his harvard faculty appointment.the district court granted harvard motion.when shervin brought the issue up again at trial,the district court sustained the defendants objections.
with respect to harvard,there was no hint of abuse of discretion in excluding mccarthy statement as inadmissible hearsay.the record is bereft of any evidence that the statements fell within the scope of mccarthy harvard faculty appointment.see,lopez rosario,at.
switching gears,shervin suggests that mccarthy statement was admissible against partners.but even if this were so a matter on which we take no view the statement demonstrated at most that an individual in a leadership role in orthopedics at mgh and nwh was on the same page as burke about a staff position for shervin what that means is amorphous.what is clear,however,is that the statement does not show that shervin had a firm offer at nwh.nor does it directly contradict rubash testimony that there were no open positions at nwh at that time.
seen in this light,the exclusion of mccarthy statement plainly did not have a substantial or injurious effect on the jury verdict.gomez,at.any error in this regard was,therefore,harmless.
at the expense of carting coal to newcastle,we add that the harmlessness of any error was ensured by the district court prophylactic actions.when the court refused to allow burke to testify about mccarthy statement on the twentieth day of trial,it gave shervin explicit permission to call mccarthy as a witness even though final witness lists which did not name mccarthy had long since been submitted.yet shervin elected not to call mccarthy before she rested on the trial day.this was a strategic litigation choice and a party normally is bound by such choices.paul revere var.annuity ins,cir stating,in different context,that w here a party makes a considered choice,though it may involve some calculated risk,he can not be relieved of such a choice even if in hindsight the decision might have been improvident quoting ackermann united states.
the short of it is that the challenged evidentiary rulings,whether taken singly or in the aggregate,furnish no founded basis for setting aside the jury verdict.
jury instructions 
shervin serves up a smorgasbord of claimed instructional errors five related to instructions actually given and one related to a forgone instruction.all six of these claims are adequately preserved.we preface our discussion of them with a précis of the applicable standards of review.
the standard governing an appellate court review of a preserved claim of instructional error varies depending on the nature of the asserted error.we review de novo questions about whether a given instruction is,in substance,legally correct.see decaro hasbro,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the particular wording chosen to convey a concept to the jury.see testa wal mart stores,cir.that inquiry focuses on whether the instruction adequately illuminate d the law applicable to the controverted issues in the case without unduly complicating matters or misleading the jury.see davis rennie,cir.
when a party assigns error not to the substance of a jury instruction but to the court decision to give a requested instruction at all,our review is de novo.see butynski springfield term.ry,cir.the ultimate inquiry is whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the proponent of the instruction,justifies jury consideration of the underlying issue.id.when,however,a party assigns error to the failure to give a requested instruction,the threshold inquiry is whether the requested instruction was correct as a matter of law.see elliott warren,cir.if the answer to that threshold inquiry is in the negative,appellate review is at an end.see united states destefano,cir.but if the answer is in the affirmative,we will normally find reversible error if the omitted instruction is integral to an important part of the case and its content is not otherwise substantially covered by the instructions as given.see elliott,at destefano,at.
in mounting all of these inquiries,we examine the court instructions as a whole,rather than reviewing fragments in isolation.see testa,at.
shervin complains bitterly that the district court statute of limitations instruction confused and misled the jury by overstating the effect of the limitations bar on her timely claims.this plaint is easily dispatched.
jury instructions can be a useful tool in a trial court effort to acquaint the jury with the governing law.see,united states mare,cir.of particular pertinence here,the district court instructed the jury on the third day of trial that 
in this case,certain conduct is time barred as a matter of law from being the basis of any liability the plaintiff,shervin,is still allowed to introduce evidence of certain conduct that occurred prior to those dates.she may do so as background evidence to support her timely discrimination and retaliation claims.
in its charge,the court reiterated this instruction and expanded on it,stating 
while the d efendants can not be liable to shervin for any such alleged conduct before the respective dates i have just mentioned as to the discrimination and retaliation claims,you may,if you choose,consider such alleged conduct for the limited purpose of background evidence as it may,for example,bear upon motive,intent or context as to her timely discrimination and retaliation claims 
these instructions were free from error.in light of the district court accurate calibration of the statute of limitations at summary judgment,see supra part ii,these instructions were proper as a matter of both federal and state law.see pass.morgan,cuddyer,at.moreover,there was no abuse of discretion in the district court word choices trial courts must be accorded substantial latitude about how to distill complicated legal concepts into language that jurors will understand.
contrary to shervin importunings,the court instructions made it sufficiently clear that the jury could take the evidence into account for such purposes as evaluating motive,intent,or context.
the instructions also precluded the jury from taking that evidence into account for the improper purpose of assessing liability or damages.that was an accurate reflection of the law.see,tobin liberty mut.ins,cir cuddyer,at.the fact that the limitations instructions did not go as far as shervin would have liked is of no consequence a district court is not obliged to parrot the precise turn of phrase requested by a litigant.see,e,zimmerman direct fed.credit union,cir.the court here adroitly threaded the needle,selecting language that did not run the risk of misleading the jury into overlooking the limitations period while still leaving open the consideration of evidence as context for shervin timely claims.no more was exigible see morgan,at cuddyer,at,see also elliott,at.
shervin calumnizes the district court instruction on material adverse action in the discrimination context.she maintains that this instruction was both incorrect and apt to mislead the jury into disregarding the background evidence entirely.she specifically targets the portion of the instruction stating that an adverse employment action is one that,standing alone,actually causes damage,tangible or intangible,to an employee,positing that the phrase standing alone foreclosed the jury from considering the totality of the circumstances including evidence in evaluating whether an adverse action took place.
after careful scrutiny of the challenged instruction and the charge as a whole,we decline shervin invitation to hold that the instruction was incorrect as a matter of law.the district court did not use the phrase standing alone in connection with the limitations instruction but,rather,in explaining what may or may not amount to an adverse employment action.after explaining that an adverse action is one that standing alone,actually causes damage,the court went on to distinguish between acts that might rise to the level of an adverse action such as a decision to discharge or materially disadvantage an employee and those acts that merely cause subjective feelings of disappointment or disillusionment.this is a correct statement of the applicable law.see,blackie,at work places are rarely idyllic retreats,and the mere fact that an employee is displeased by an employer act or omission does not elevate that act or omission to the level of a materially adverse employment action.and since shervin discrimination claims were not tried on a hostile work environment theory,there was no error in instructing the jury that an adverse action is one that standing alone causes harm.see,johnson of,cir discussing distinction between hostile work environment and discrete act claims.
we add that this instruction in no way diluted the force of the statute of limitations instruction.the discrimination instruction followed the court limitations instruction,which had informed the jury that it was allowed to consider evidence for such purposes as motive,intent,and context.in later describing the prima facie elements of a discrimination claim and what constitutes proof of pretext,the court placed no temporal restrictions on the evidence that could or could not inform this evaluation.in sum,the discrimination instruction was legally correct,and the court use of the phrase standing alone in defining a materially adverse employment action was not an abuse of discretion.
shervin asserts that the district court definition of adverse action in its instruction on retaliation was misleading because it failed to convey to the jury that the standard for adverse action in the retaliation context is broader than in the discrimination context.but that assertion is belied by the text of the district court instructions.the court defined adverse action more broadly in the retaliation instruction than in the discrimination instruction.
the discrimination instruction stated,inter alia,a n employer takes an adverse action against an employee if it takes something of consequence away from the employee or fails to give the employee something that is a customary benefit of the employment relationship.the court went on to explain that a n adverse action may include a decision to terminate or discharge an employee or materially disadvantage her in respect to her salary,grade or other terms,conditions or privileges of employment.by contrast,the retaliation instruction explained that an adverse action in the retaliation context must be materially adverse such that it could deter a reasonable person from complaining about discrimination.the court then stated,i n the context of a retaliation claim,the p laintiff must show that she was subject to an employment action that materially disadvantaged her and added that an employer can retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to her employment or by causing her harm outside the workplace.
these contrasting instructions were not only legally sound but also adequately articulated.see,burlington santa fe ry.white,holding under title vii that the antiretaliation provision,unlike the substantive provision,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment psy ed klein,similar,under massachusetts law.the court made pellucid that adverse action in the retaliation context is more expansive than in the discrimination context,stating that a retaliatory adverse action includes conduct that could deter a reasonable person from complaining about discrimination and could encompass conduct entirely unrelated to the workplace.while the court elected not to provide certain specific examples of retaliation that shervin had requested,this refusal was well within the ambit of its discretion.see,decaro,at a trial court is not obliged either to embellish legally correct statements or to cover every factual permutation.see also elliott,at destefano,at.what counts is that the court crafted instructions that adequately conveyed these distinct concepts to the jury.
shervin reproves the district court vacant position instruction,which stated t o establish a failure to hire as an adverse employment action for the purposes of a retaliation claim,shervin must show by a preponderance of the evidence that she applied for a discrete,identifiable position the position was vacant and she was qualified for the position.she submits that this instruction was both incorrect as a matter of law and unwarranted on the facts.in support,she cites our decision in velez janssen ortho,llc,cir,in which we mapped out a showing for claims of retaliatory failure to hire.see id.at see also pina children place,cir applying same standard to ch.retaliation claim.shervin point is that,in her view,her case is more akin to the exception to this standard that velez acknowledged in dictum.see velez,at suggesting that if,as a matter of standard procedure,a company never advertises specific vacant positions it may be inappropriate to require plaintiff to show that she applied for a specific,posted position.
viewing the evidence in this case in the light most favorable to the defendants as the proponents of the instruction,see butynski,at,it can not be said that this case presented an exception to the velez prescription.the defendants adduced ample evidence that vacant positions at mgh and nwh were formally advertised in medical journals.because there was no evidence that mgh and nwh had a standard procedure of never formally posting employment vacancies,a velez instruction was permissible.see butynski,at see also brown coach stores,cir requiring plaintiff to show that she applied for particular,open positions even though employer posted such positions infrequently.
shervin complains about the district court refusal to instruct the jury in accordance with travers discussed in part iv supra.in an effort to avail herself of the travers court suggestion that a claim of retaliation might survive summary judgment even without direct evidence linking the person expressing animus to the allegedly retaliatory act so long as the animus flowed from the apex of the organizational hierarchy such that the person displaying the animus was a source with the formal authority to enforce compliance,travers,at,she requested the following instruction 
y ou may assess whether any retaliatory or biased animus harbored and voiced by those at the top of the organization could have made its way through the organization and informed the decisions at issue here.you may consider whether the decision made reflects a reluctance to frustrate the objectives of those high up in the organization even if there is no direct or admitted evidence,no testimony or communication or no chronicling of communications between those at the apex of the organization and those who made the decisions at issue.
the district court denied this request,citing the state of the evidence.
in considering whether the failure to give a requested instruction is error,we must first determine whether the omitted instruction was correct as a matter of law.see destefano,f d at.here,however,there is no evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the travers criteria were met the record is simply devoid of admitted evidence sufficient to ground a finding of animus in the higher reaches of the partners organization.
in all events,the jury was thoroughly instructed that it could consider circumstantial evidence,that it could draw reasonable inferences in light of common sense and personal experience,and that discriminatory or retaliatory animus could be established if a decisionmaker was shown either to have been influenced by,or to have ratified,another animus.taken in the ensemble,these various instructions covered the waterfront and addressed in substance the heart of shervin requested instruction.see,zimmerman,at concluding that omitted instruction was substantially covered where charge as a whole sufficiently addressed the core concern of proposed instruction united states,cir similar.consequently,the omission of the requested instruction did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
last,shervin assigns error to a statute of frauds instruction given in relation to her claims of tortious interference with advantageous business relations against partners,rubash,and herndon.the defendants sought such an instruction with respect to shervin charge that rubash had promised her a position at mgh in but withdrew that commitment in allegedly as a result of shervin pursuit of an internal grievance and this lawsuit.
under massachusetts common law regarding claims of tortious interference with advantageous business relations,one way in which a plaintiff can establish the existence of an advantageous relation is to prove the existence of an enforceable contract.see blackstone cashman,powers leno.but the massachusetts statute of frauds bars the enforcement of an oral contract that can not be performed within one year from the date of its making.see.laws ch.this stricture extends to employment agreements.see irving goodimate.as shervin claimed that rubash had offered her a position at mgh in to commence after the conclusion of her residency in and which,therefore,was not to be performed within one year from the date of its making,this purported oral contract would have been unenforceable as a matter of law and could not serve as a basis for a claim of tortious interference with an advantageous relationship in the nature of a contract.
shervin objected to the requested instruction on the ground that no defendant had pleaded the statute of frauds as an affirmative defense.the district court,citing conjugal partnership comprised by jones jones conjugal partnership comprised of pineda pineda jones,cir,overruled this objection exercised its equitable power to bypass the rule,see fdic ramirez rivera,cir and instructed the jury on the effect of the statute of frauds.
as a general matter,unpleaded affirmative defenses are deemed waived.see id.but even though the defendants never pleaded the statute of frauds as an affirmative defense,the district court did not abuse its discretion in giving the challenged instruction.we explain briefly.
a district court may relax the rule when equity so dictates and there is no unfair prejudice to any opposing party.see jones,at.in this case,shervin did not assert any breach of contract claims and,thus,the defendants duty to plead an affirmative defense based on the statute of frauds was arguable at best.see.laws ch,applying statute of frauds to actions in the nature of contract.in such a situation,principles of fundamental fairness counsel in favor of giving the trial court broad discretion as to whether to allow the defense.see,pane rca,cir concluding that when unpleaded issue was not an affirmative defense but a standard of liability under applicable statute,duty to plead not triggered and relaxation of rule warranted.
by the same token,there was no unfair surprise shervin had ample notice prior to trial that the defendants envisioned the statute of frauds as an issue in the case.for one thing,rubash summary judgment motion referenced the applicability of the statute of frauds in the context of the tortious interference claims.for another thing,the defendants proposed jury instructions,filed prior to the start of trial,included the very type of instruction at issue here.hence,the district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning the statute of frauds defense.see,niro,d.
shervin further argument is equally unavailing.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the proponents of the instruction here,the defendants,see butynski,at,we see no substantive error in the challenged instruction.
to the extent that shervin sought to prove that she and rubash had entered into an agreement in that she would work at mgh after the completion of her residency in,the court was entitled to tell the jury that such an employment contract would be unenforceable if not in writing.see,powers bos.cooper,cir applying massachusetts law goodimate,at.
we add,moreover,that insofar as shervin sought to prove not a contractual relationship but a different species of advantageous business relationship,see,leno,at,any risk that the statute of frauds instruction would mislead the jury was minimal.the court obviated such a risk by its further instruction that a plaintiff need not show an advantageous business relationship was a contractual relationship,but,rather,an advantageous business relationship may include a probable prospective business relationship with a third party from which she had a reasonable expectation of future economic benefit.
in this instance,all roads lead to rome.taking into account the state of the evidence,the charge as a whole,and the applicable standards of review,we conclude that the court below did not abuse its discretion in giving the challenged instruction.
vi.conclusion 
as this case illustrates,there is a certain quality to the world of academic medicine.here,however,the jury heard a welter of conflicting evidence presented by able lawyers and determined,after a fundamentally fair trial,that the defendants conduct though perhaps insensitive in some respects did not cross the border into the forbidden realms of discrimination and retaliation.in the absence of prejudicial error and we have found none here,we have no license to substitute our judgment for that of the jurors 
we need go no further.for the reasons elucidated above,we affirm the judgment entered in the district court.
in,shervin accepted a arthroplasty fellowship at mgh,to commence shortly after the anticipated completion of her residency in june of.
the claimed retaliation between september and june appears to consist primarily of the executive committee poor handling of her complaint regarding a pair of obscene circulating among hcorp residents and a of her thesis presentation by her fellow residents.as to the latter event,shervin claims that members of the executive committee were aware that a was planned and did nothing to prevent it.
although the delay in the issuance of her license to practice medicine resulted in a postponement of the start of her fellowship,she successfully completed the fellowship in.
in support of her argument that she could not have successfully challenged her probation before august of,shervin relies heavily on an unpublished district court decision in which the court concluded that probation imposed on a medical resident did not amount to a materially adverse employment action.see badgaiyan.principi,wl at.may.the badgaiyan decision turns on its own facts and idiosyncratic posture.for that reason,it can not support the weight that shervin piles upon it.and in any event,the decision is of questionable validity.after all,this court has held that even a strongly worded warning letter placed in a personnel file,without more,was a sufficiently crystallized form of harm to start the running of the limitations period.see miller dep t of,cir.
in reaching this conclusion,we need not address shervin remonstrance that the district court misapplied massachusetts law in concluding that her claim was not of the sort to which the continuing violation do
