afam uzoukwu,proceeding pro se,appeals from the august,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york abrams,dismissing his claims brought under for false arrest and excessive force,after a jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants.halfway through deliberations,the jury sent a note asking whether refusal to to police questions is considered obstruction of governmental administration.app x at.in response,the district court equivocally answered that r efusal to answer police questions alone,without more,would not constitute obstruction of governmental administration,but that such a determination would depend on the totality of the circumstances as you find them.app x at.however,new york law unambiguously holds that one can not obstruct governmental administration merely by refusing to answer police questions or to provide identification,both because such conduct is constitutionally protected,and because obstruction of governmental administration requires as an element a physical or independently unlawful act.given that this prejudicial error was indisputably preserved,we vacate the verdict and remand for a new trial.
background 
according to defendants,the underlying incident began when the two named officers approached uzoukwu at approximately on may,while he was sitting on a park bench eating jell o,h e did not have anything that indicated he had children in the park,such as a stroller.app x at.the posted park rules prohibited adults who were not accompanying children from being in the playground near where the bench was located.the officers testified that they told plaintiff he could not be there without children,asked him several times whether he had any children with him,and repeatedly requested his identification,but plaintiff continued looking down,eating his jello.he did not respond.app x at.officer krawiecki testified that to get his attention,i took his jello and i threw it out.app x at.according to the officers,plaintiff at that point began screaming and cursing,whereupon he was arrested.a uzoukwu was charged with i disorderly conduct and ii obstruction of governmental administration.
uzoukwu claimed that he was at the park with his two children,ages and,when the police approached him,demanded identification,and accused him of being a pedophile.he asserted that he only began yelling after the police officers hit him.in addition,plaintiff alleged that he was told by sergeant papgiannis that officers can hit you,punch you,assault you,because they need to subdue you before they arrest you.
on august,plaintiff criminal case was dismissed.on june,uzoukwu,who was then represented by counsel,filed a complaint asserting deprivation of rights under the united states constitution and against the named officers and liability of the city of new york for constitutional violations.on october,plaintiff filed an amended complaint claiming,inter alia,false arrest,excessive force,deprivation of liberty,physical injury and emotional distress.while the complaint asserted that the two officers struck plaintiff when plaintiff had not done anything that would justify an arrest,the complaint did not assert that he was bringing claims for battery or assault.
on march,the parties filed a joint pretrial order in which plaintiff asserted that the claims to be tried are a false arrest,b false imprisonment,c excessive force,d assault,e battery,f mental and emotional distress,and g malicious prosecution.defendants then moved for partial summary judgment requesting that the district court dismiss with prejudice plaintiff claims against the city of new york for failure to present evidence of a municipal policy,and the state law claims not previously asserted in the amended complaint.the district court issued a bench ruling granting defendants motion.
uzoukwu proceeded to trial on the section claims against the officers for false arrest and excessive force.as a defense to his claim of false arrest,the officers argued that they had probable cause to believe plaintiff had committed the crimes of i obstruction of governmental administration and ii disorderly conduct.at the close of trial,the jury was instructed that the officers could not be held liable for false arrest if they had probable cause to believe plaintiff had committed the crime of either i obstruction of governmental administration or ii disorderly conduct.
an hour after the jury retired to deliberate,it sent a note requesting the parties stipulations and the arrest records,and asking the following questions 
is refusal to to police questions considered obstruction of governmental administration 
does police emotional response weaken probable cause 
if police officer inappropriately approaches due to bias an individual,who then gives probable cause for arrest,is probable cause then eliminated 
that night,the parties submitted letters to the court proposing answers to the jury questions.uzoukwu argued that the first of these questions warranted an unequivocal answer in the negative,relying on new york state law for the proposition that an individual has a constitutional right not to respond to police questioning and mere words can not constitute the physical act required for the crime of obstruction.defendants argued that 
the relevant park rules should be included in response to question because as this question illustrates they are essential for the jury to make its determination whether there was probable cause to arrest for obstruction of governmental administration.
app x at.defendants also renewed their summary judgment motion for qualified immunity noting indeed,based upon the questions presented by the jury,it now appears that the court may have to decide the issue of qualified immunity.app x at.
the next morning,the district court met with the parties before bringing in the jury and informed them that it had found a new york court of appeals case that it concluded confirmed that violations of park rules constitute a a class b misdemeanor see rcny a penal law,the maximum penalty for which is days imprisonment and a fine see rcny a.people davis,upholding a conviction for failing to comply with posted sign indicating city park closing time was,where officer observed defendant in the park at.the district court told the parties that it would add a supplemental instruction informing the jury that it could also find that the officers lawfully arrested plaintiff if they had probable cause to believe that he violated the park rules.
after much debate and over uzoukwu objection,the district court provided the following answer to the jury first question 
refusal to answer police questions alone,without more,would not constitute obstruction of governmental administration.whether refusal to acknowledge or respond to police questions is considered obstruction of governmental administration depends on the totality of the circumstances as you find them.as i instructed you,a person is guilty of obstructing governmental administration when he intentionally obstructs,impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function or prevents or attempts to prevent a public servant from performing an official function,by means of intimidation,physical force or interference,or by means of any independently unlawful act a police officer official function includes enforcing compliance with park and playground rules.

the district court also answered the jury final question about whether probable cause is eliminated where a police officer inappropriately due to bias approaches an individual who then gives probable cause for arrest,explaining 
in response to this question i will refer you to my previous instruction that the issue in this case is not about whether plaintiff was properly stopped,but whether his arrest was unlawful.further,as i have instructed you,the motive of the defendant police officers is not a factor for you to consider in determining whether there was probable cause.the only issue for you to decide is whether the was probable cause to arrest.
app x at.the district court then charged the jury that 
in assessing probable cause to arrest,i have one further instruction to provide you.defendants also contend that plaintiff had violated various new york city park rules and regulations and that probable cause existed to arrest plaintiff for violations of the following rules,which constitute misdemeanors 
no person shall fail,neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any police officer,urban park ranger,parks enforcement patrol officer,or other department employee,indicated by gesture or otherwise.
no person shall fail to comply with or obey any instruction,direction,regulation,warning,or prohibition,written or printed,displayed or appearing on any sign,except such sign may be disregarded upon order by a police officer or designated department employee.it shall be a violation of these rules to engage in disorderly behavior in a park.a person in any park shall be guilty of disorderly behavior who engages in a course of conduct or commits acts that unreasonably alarm or seriously annoy another person.
if,after considering all the evidence,you find that defendants had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for any of these offenses,even if plaintiff was not charged with that crime,or the crimes that i previously instructed you about disorderly conduct or obstruction of government administration then you must find in favor of the defendants with respect to the false arrest claim.
app x at emphases added.
at,the district court instructed the jury to begin its deliberations anew.minutes later,at,the jury returned with a verdict finding in favor of the defendants on all claims.
discussion 
jury instructions.
we review de novo a claim of error in the district court jury instructions and will set aside a judgment secured by an erroneous charge only if the appellant shows that the error was prejudicial in light of the charge as a whole.jury instructions are erroneous if they mislead the jury or do not adequately inform the jury of the law.it is axiomatic,however,that a jury charge should be examined in its entirety,not scrutinized.sr int l bus.ins.world trade ctr,llc,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.as to supplemental instructions given by the district court,i f a supplemental charge is legally correct,the district court enjoys broad discretion in determining how,and under what circumstances,that charge will be given.united states civelli,cir holding district court did not plainly err in giving unchallenged supplemental charge on conscious avoidance,which correctly stated the law,after deliberations had begun,where jury asked question that could not be addressed by yes or no answer.however,rule requirement that counsel be informed of the instructions to be given before closing argument is an important safeguard of the right to a full and fair trial by jury and the district court discretion regarding supplementary instructions is not without limits.id.at citing united states blackmon,cir holding it was clearly prejudicial error to give a discretionary pinkerton instruction at the close of the trial,upon the basis of which defense counsel made their summations,and then switch to a mandatory charge in response to an inquiry by the jury during its deliberations.
both the jury question and the district court answer expressly addressed only the legal significance of plaintiff refusal to acknowledge or respond to police questions.under new york law,it is clearly established that uzoukwu constitutionally protected silence could not constitute any element of the crime of obstructing governmental administration,even if such silence interfered with the officers attempt to investigate whether uzoukwu was violating park rules.therefore,the district court should have simply answered no.alternatively,the district court should have stopped after issuing the first sentence of its instruction.however,its subsequent qualification finds no support under new york law.
the crime of obstructing governmental administration requires as an element of the crime that the accused act by one of three methods intimidation,physical force or interference,or any independently unlawful act.people case.it is axiomatic that only physical interference is encompassed in the second method of obstruction.in re davan,t he interference would have to be,in part at least,physical in nature.thus,purely verbal interference may not satisfy the physical component under penal law.in re davan,at see also case,at t he statute has been uniformly interpreted to the effect that mere words alone do not constitute physical force or interference such as to support the charge of obstructing governmental administration.it plainly follows that refusal to respond to an officer questions can not satisfy the interference element of the charge for obstruction of governmental administration,because silence does not entail a physical act.see in re kezzia,dep t appellant initial untruthfulness about the presence of a weapon inside the apartment,followed by her refusal to disclose its location,do not satisfy the elements of obstructing governmental administration.people tillman,city dismissing charges for obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest where suspect in narcotics investigation ran from police after being stopped for questioning,because flight did not constitute physical interference.
nonetheless,if the district court wished to provide more guidance than a simple,unequivocal no,it could have instructed the jury that w hile mere words alone do not constitute physical force or interference,words coupled with actions are sufficient.people chang,citing davan,at finding evidence sufficient to support charge of obstruction of governmental administration where teenager was instructed by police to leave the scene of undercover narcotics buy operation,but instead rode bicycle towards known criminal activity and yelled to potential targets to warn them of police presence,thereby causing a physical reaction and dispersal of the targets instead,the district court failed to convey to the jury that obstruction of governmental administration requires a physical act.
moreover,the district court answer significantly obscured the wellsettled principle that,in new york,a n individual to whom a police officer addresses a question has a constitutional right not to respond.he may remain silent or walk or run away.his refusal to answer is not a crime.people howard,see also people grullon,w hen this defendant refused further cooperation with the police,she did not obstruct governmental administration.for this reason,refusal to answer police questions also can not satisfy the independently unlawful act prong.see people perez,dep t holding evidence was legally insufficient to establish lawful arrest for disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration where defendant refused to cooperate with officers who knocked on his door while investigating origin of loud music emanating from his building because defendant was not required to respond to the officers request for identification or to open his door to the officers people cameron,dismissing charges for obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct where police,who were canvassing for wanted suspect,repeatedly requested name and date of birth of defendant that resembled suspect,eventually leading defendant to curse,yell and scream as well as flail his arms in an attempt to avoid being placed in handcuffs.indeed,it is that a suspect refusal to answer pedigree questioning is protected by the fifth amendment.see united states montana,cir citation omitted though solicitation of pedigree information normally does not amount to custodial interrogation,we see no basis for distinguishing silence in the face of pedigree questions from silence in the face of more substantive interrogation.united states dell aria,aff,cir it is settled in this circuit that silence in the face of custodial questioning aimed at eliciting only pedigree information,even absent substantive inquires,may suffice as an invocation of fifth amendment rights.
for substantially the same reasons,under new york law obstruction of governmental administratio
