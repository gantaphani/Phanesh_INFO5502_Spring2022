plaintiffs eugenio bizzarro and gary klivans,employees of the westchester county department of corrections doc,brought this suit against the county and several doc officials alleging that the defendants violated their fourteenth amendment rights by instituting disciplinary charges against the plaintiffs and removing bizzarro from a privileged work assignment after the plaintiffs refused to assist the doc in an internal investigation.the individual defendants asserted a qualified immunity defense and moved for summary judgment.the united states district court for the southern district of new york charles brieant,denied the motion on the ground that a jury could find that defendants violated plaintiffs clearly established equal protection and due process rights.on interlocutory appeal,we reverse in part the denial of summary judgment.with respect to the claim of denial of equal protection,taking the version of the facts most favorable to plaintiffs,plaintiffs can not establish a violation.
background 
resolving all disputes and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs,we decide this appeal on the following facts.throughout the relevant events,plaintiffs bizzarro and klivans worked as superior officers in the department of corrections,klivans as a captain and bizzarro as a sergeant.both were members of the superior officers association union.
the investigation.during december,kevin cheverko,the commander of the doc special investigations unit siu,was conducting an investigation of a corrections officer suspected of smuggling contraband to inmates at doc facilities.on december,cheverko requested that klivans assist him in the investigation by retrieving a bottle of alcohol from an inmate who was acting as an informant in the investigation.klivans obliged.a week later,on december,cheverko asked klivans to deliver money and a recording device to the same inmate.klivans told cheverko he no longer wanted to assist in the investigation.cheverko become a little angry,a little heated,and miffed.he told klivans,we need you to do this,but did not order klivans to assist.cheverko then turned to bizzarro.bizzarro also refused to assist in the investigation,in part because he did not want to bring contraband into the facility.cheverko informed doc commissioner rocco pozzi that klivans and bizzarro had refused to assist in the investigation.pozzi told cheverko that,as commander of the siu,cheverko had the authority to order the officers to assist,and that in any case he could say the order came directly from the commissioner.
on the morning of december,at a meeting in the parking lot of a diner,cheverko told bizzarro that he was ordering him to assist in the investigation and that the order came directly from the commissioner.bizzarro again refused,saying that assisting would place strains on his family,that he was upset at the outcome of an earlier episode in which he had helped cheverko,and that siu had a bad reputation.bizzarro said he would not assist without a personal order from the commissioner.cheverko became enraged,engulfed with anger,screaming at bizzarro,if you not going to participate,then i going to give you an order to participate.and before this whole thing is over,every supervisor will see it their obligation to cooperate,participate in the investigation.and if you not going to do it,i going to give you an order to do it right now.bizzarro replied that the conversation was over.
later that day,cheverko and bizzarro met again in cheverko office.cheverko reiterated the request to assist,but offered bizzarro an opportunity to think about it.cheverko also told bizzarro that,if bizzarro kept the investigation confidential,cheverko would not report the insubordination to his superiors.cheverko subsequently changed his mind,however,and notified bizzarro that he would be charged with disciplinary violations if he did not cooperate.
the disciplinary process.on january,cheverko delivered a written report to anthony czarnecki,special assistant to commissioner pozzi,detailing klivans and bizzarro refusal to assist in the investigation.according to cheverko report,there was a perception among superior officers that they were not required to assist the siu in internal investigations.the report noted that t his appears to be a systematic problem that has not been addressed in the past,and that siu investigators have informed me that prior investigations have been lost for this very reason.cheverko indicated that he personally believed that the policy requiring officers to assist was clear,but that it might be a good idea to make the policy more explicit to really jam it down people throats and offset the perception that people have that the policy is unclear.the report thus recommended that bizzarro be formally charged with insubordination,disobedience of orders,and conduct unbecoming an officer.after receiving cheverko report,czarnecki prepared his own report,dated january,which he delivered along with cheverko report to commissioner pozzi.czarnecki report echoed cheverko recommendation that bizzarro be formally disciplined,and recommended that klivans be counseled.
commissioner pozzi had final discretionary authority over all disciplinary matters.his usual practice was to make decisions based on the reports prepared by his subordinates.cheverko and czarnecki both lacked authority to institute disciplinary charges.if pozzi decided that formal discipline appeared warranted,his practice was to ask the county law department to investigate the matter and draft appropriate charges.
pozzi agreed with czarnecki recommendations and forwarded the report to the law department to draft charges.after consulting with cheverko and czarnecki,the county attorneys advised that bizzarro could be charged with violating of the doc code of conduct,which provides 
a peace officer employee shall cooperate in any internal or official investigation by the department,truthfully answer all questions,and submit any required written report in connection with such investigations consistent with the correction officer bill of rights.
the attorneys also suggested that if bizzarro was to be charged under,klivans ought to be charged as well,because he had similarly refused to assist in the investigation.in contrast,the attorneys recommended that charges against bizzarro for insubordination might be difficult to sustain because bizzarro might reasonably have believed that cheverko had released him from the direct order to assist so long as bizzarro maintained the confidentiality of the investigation.on the basis of this advice,commissioner pozzi decided to bring charges against both bizzarro and klivans,but not to bring insubordination charges.the charges were instituted on march.pozzi also removed bizzarro from the doc emergency response team.
after the disciplinary charges were brought,the president of the superior officers association,captain robert buckley,interceded with commissioner pozzi on behalf of klivans and bizzarro.pozzi was initially reluctant to withdraw the charges,but eventually offered to do so as a favor to buckley,on the condition that bizzarro and klivans sign releases promising not to sue.neither would agree to that condition.nonetheless,on may,pozzi eventually decided to withdraw the charges unilaterally.
this lawsuit.bizzarro and klivans then filed this suit against pozzi,czarnecki,cheverko,and westchester county under,alleging violation of their fourteenth amendment rights the individual defendants moved for summary judgment,raising a defense of qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,stating that it was impracticable to attempt to resolve this fact intensive issue on a summary judgment motion.the court ruled 
c ertainly the plain meaning of the disciplinary rule would suggest that no reasonable commander could believe the rule permits issuing an order for undercover activity by a corrections officer in this court view there was no legitimate basis for the order,if such it was,issued to the plaintiffs,and for refusal of which they were subjected to disciplinary charges clearly,there is a fourteenth amendment violation in this ca
