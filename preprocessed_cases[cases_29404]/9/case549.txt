abigail guzmán sued united parcel service ups in the district court for violations of titles i and v of the americans with disabilities act of ada,and section of the rehabilitation act of,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ups and guzmán now appeals.
the history can be briefly told.in,guzmán began work with ups four to five hours a day at its package clearing center at its muñiz base facilities in carolina,puerto rico.her main work assignment was to scan with a laser reader packages moving down an assembly line and,where necessary,to reposition packages on the belt.this required her to stand and move around in the vicinity of the belt.
in november,guzmán felt pain in her left side and entered a hospital for a stay.she was eventually diagnosed with ovarian cysts this condition sometimes disappears in a few months without surgery.to see if the cysts resolved themselves and perhaps for other reasons,surgery was deferred for about eight months.in the end,the cysts did not disappear they were surgically removed in july,restoring guzmán to health.
when she was hospitalized,guzmán told her supervisor of her condition to excuse herself from work,which he permitted.yet guzmán thereafter suffered symptoms intermittently,including pain and occasional dizzy spells that required her to sit down or double over.occasionally her symptoms were severe enough to require her to remain at home lying down.partly on this account and partly because her son was repeatedly ill during this period and required hospital care,guzmán was absent from work several times in excess of her sick leave allowance and was sometimes late to work.
in march,guzmán explained her condition to two supervisors,providing them with medical documentation evidencing her condition,to justify her absences from work and her occasional sitting down.though one supervisor told guzmán that it was okay the other said that she had to resolve her condition because her absences and her sitting down while working were adversely affecting the company.in may,guzmán received a warning letter from the division withdrawn as untimely under the collective bargaining lateness and absences during the period january through april.a second warning letter,relating to one more lateness in june,was timely.
in july,ups conducted a monthly audit of telephone usage and the auditor reported to the division manager that guzmán had been making excessive and unauthorized phone calls on company time.the division manager discharged guzmán,treating the matter as a theft of time from the company and so a listed ground for discharge the company had apparently fired other employees in and on the same ground.in a written declaration,the division manager described the unauthorized phone calls as the reason for guzmán discharge,although he separately described an unrelated incident of guzmán conduct that he believed improper.
in september,about months after her discharge,an arbitrator found that the termination was not justified under the collective bargaining agreement because the company had not earlier described such calls as theft and the evidence against guzmán was not strong.the company filed a court appeal but then settled,reinstating guzmán and providing partial back pay for the period of her discharge.
several months before the arbitration award issued,guzmán filed an administrative charge of disability discrimination.in january,the relevant agency rejected her claim and issued a letter.three months later,guzmán brought the present action in federal district court.apart from an unsupported claim under the civil rights act of,et,which guzmán has now abandoned,the complaint charged ups under the ada and rehabilitation act with failure to accommodate her alleged disability and retaliation against her for seeking an accommodation.
after discovery,ups moved for summary judgment based on guzmán deposition and other documents.deeming guzmán statement of contested facts inadequate under the local puerto rico rule the district court adopted ups statement of uncontested facts.see corrada betances,cir.the court then found that guzmán had not been disabled prior to her surgery,had not requested an accommodation,and had not been not subject to retaliation.this appeal followed.
review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.see,am.airlines,cir.ups list of uncontested facts is accepted,given guzmán failure properly to contest them otherwise,inferences from the record are drawn in the light most favorable to guzmán.see united parcel,cir.here,the main issues turn on applying legal tests to mostly known circumstances.
where a worker is disabled an employer may not assume stereotypically an inability to work and beyond this must provide reasonable accommodation unless undue hardship is shown.b see id.a b.having a disability means having or being regarded as having a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.id.a,c.we have regularly consulted eeoc definitions of the terms,wright compusa,cir,but no agency has been granted authority to issue binding regulations interpreting the term disability.toyota motor,williams,d.
two different issues are presented as to guzmán claim that she was disabled during the period in question.one is whether the ovarian cysts were sufficiently a condition to qualify as a disability rather than a temporary affliction the other is whether,duration aside,guzmán condition impinged sufficiently on a major life activity to be treated as disabling.the district court ruled against guzmán on both counts.
starting with the first of these issues,the ada is not a medical leave act nor a requirement of accommodation for common conditions that are or can be promptly remedied.the supreme court stated in toyota that in order to be substantially limit ing,an impairment must be permanent or long term.toyota,at.this may encompass conditions that are potentially,in that their duration is indefinite and unknowable,santiago clemente executive airlines,cir internal quotation marks omitted,but not those that are brief or foreseeably temporary,carroll xerox,cir medical leave for chest pains,soileau guilford of,cir leave from work and activity restriction because of a depressive attack.
although santiago clemente suggested in dictum that an impairment whose duration is expected to be at least several months might qualify as a disability if severe enough,at,this was before toyota permanent or long term pronouncement,and other cases may suggest that longer periods are required,carroll at soileau,at.case law in other circuits is also uncertain the reasons for the uncertainty are apparent.
the statute itself says nothing about duration and nothing in the term disability or its definition gives a judge,and still less a jury,much guidance.the problem is primarily a policy choice to which congress did not speak clearly and the supreme court has done no more than extrapolate,from some estimated numbers of those to be covered,that severe restrictions of very important activities were what congress had in mind.see toyota,at.until the supreme court its interpretation,it will be unclear how lower courts should deal with periods between,say,and months.
in this case,guzmán period of impairment falls within this zone,very close to the shorter end.that the impairment was not severe lends some support to the district court resolution,as our case law suggests that shorter durations are tolerated only for more severe impairments.see,santiago clemente,at soileau,at.still,we think it best to reserve the issue and rest our own affirmance on the district court second determination that guzmán disability did not substantially limit a major life activity.
one major life activity relied on by guzmán is working.the supreme court has expressed some doubt whether working can be so described.see sutton,united air lines,d.the eeoc regulations by contrast assume that working is a major life activity.they state that a plaintiff is disabled even if she can still work but if she is significantly restricted in or precluded from performing either a class of set of jobs u
