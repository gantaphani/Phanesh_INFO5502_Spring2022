background 
on may,at the end of emily second grade year,the cranston public schools the district evaluated her reading ability and identified her as a disabled child in need of special education services under idea.as required by idea,district personnel created an individualized education program iep for emily,which recommended that she remain in a mainstream classroom with students and receive approximately three hours a week of additional reading assistance.see d a.
following her fifth grade year,emily iep stated that she read at a third grade level,but it failed to include a statement of emily present education level,as required by idea.d a i.at the end of emily sixth grade year,her iep failed to indicate her specific reading level or include a statement of annual goals.id.d a i.throughout her years in the district,emily had poor attendance,and in the seventh grade,the middle school principal asked rafferty to provide the school with a letter from emily doctor explaining her absences.the letter stated that emily absences were due to a significant family disruption.apparently,the raffertys were having marital difficulties,and rafferty had been diagnosed with cancer.emily school agreed to provide her with tutoring to help her transition back to school following her numerous absences.from approximately the middle of march until june of,emily attended tutoring provided by her school.on june,the school held an iep meeting to discuss emily upcoming school year.emily father attended the meeting alone and signed the iep.
during the summer of,emily vacationed at her aunt house in kentucky.in june of,rafferty completed a parent questionnaire for the langsford reading center langsford in kentucky,and langsford personnel evaluated emily on july.four days before classes began at the district,rafferty informed the district that emily would be attending langsford.from september to december of,emily received reading tutoring at langsford.following her attendance at the reading center,emily matriculated at francis,a private school in kentucky.
on november,while emily was still in kentucky,rafferty requested an iep meeting.the district denied the request,stating that emily was no longer enrolled in the district.then,in january of,rafferty requested a due process hearing under idea,claiming that the district failed to give her notice of an iep meeting held on may.after rafferty made the hearing request,the district initiated a residency hearing.although she admitted to living in massachusetts with her mother while recuperating from brain cancer,she argued that their residence had never changed.a decision by mcwalters,the commissioner of the rhode island department of education,stayed a ruling on residency until the local level idea hearing officer made a finding regarding whether cranston had provided emily with a free appropriate public education fape.mcwalters reasoned that although there was evidence supporting the district argument that emily was sent to kentucky because rafferty was ill and unable to care for her,rafferty should be given the opportunity to argue that she sent emily to kentucky because the district had failed to provide a fape,a showing that potentially could entitle rafferty to reimbursement for the private school tuition.
the hearing officer determined that emily and ieps were inadequate and inappropriate.crucially though,the hearing officer also determined that langsford was an inappropriate placement because it was a reading clinic rather than a school.consequently,he denied private school reimbursement and only awarded rafferty attorney fees.both parties appealed the hearing officer decision to a department of education review officer.the review officer upheld the finding that the district did not err when it refused to give rafferty an iep meeting after november,because emily was living in kentucky.in addition,the officer upheld the denial of tuition reimbursement because rafferty did not notify the school at least days prior to removing emily from school,and langsford did not constitute the least restrictive environment to which rafferty could have sent emily.finally,the review officer reversed the hearing officer decision to award attorney fees to plaintiff counsel.
rafferty then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.she claimed that the defendants violated her and emily rights under idea and engaged in prohibited retaliation against her because she requested a due process hearing.the district court adopted the detailed report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,granting defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the claim against mcwalters and granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to all other claims.
ii.standard of review 
we review grants of summary judgment and dismissals on the pleadings de novo.rose yeaw,cir united states currency,cir.although we need not defer to the district court,we still must give due weight to the administrative record by using an intermediate standard of review.bd.of educ.rowley,d.this standard requires a more critical appraisal of the agency determination than review entails,but which,nevertheless,falls well short of complete de novo review.lenn portland sch,cir.while the court must recognize the expertise of an administrative agency,as well as that of school officials,and consider carefully administrative findings,the precise degree of deference due such a finding is ultimately left to the discretion of the examining court.westmoreland sch,cir citation omitted.
iii.waiver of claims not raised at due process hearing 
rafferty argues that the district court should have considered her claims that the district failed to provide adequate notice of procedural safeguards,as required by d,and that the district denied rafferty access to records however,she did not raise these issues at her due process hearing.
idea gives the parent of a disabled child the right to an impartial due process hearing conducted by the local educational authority,if she is dissatisfied with any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of her child or feels her child is not receiving a fape.b,f.any aggrieved party can appeal the findings and decision of the hearing officer to the state educational agency.id.g.if the parent remains dissatisfied,she can bring a civil action in federal district court.id.i.
idea requires that a plaintiff raise or exhaust claims concerning a disabled child educational situation in the due process hearing.weber cranston sch,cir.plaintiff can circumvent the exhaustion requirement if she can show that the agency adoption of an unlawful general policy or practice would make resort to the agency futile,or that the administrative remedies afforded by subchapter ii of idea are inadequate given the relief sought.id.at.
rafferty can not meet any of the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.she has not pointed to any evidence indicating that the agency adopted an unlawful general policy or practice.rafferty refers to records held by the district that were not turned over to her until a month after her request,but this does not constitute a charge of an unlawful general policy or practice by the agency.further,she can not show that resort to the hearing was futile because the hearing officer could not have awarded the redress sought.rafferty argument on this point is unclear,but she may be claiming
