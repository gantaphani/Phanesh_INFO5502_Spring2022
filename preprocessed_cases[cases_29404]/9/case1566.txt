opinion of the court 
we address this case in light of our recent decisions in mcternan city of york,cir,holman city of york,cir,and snell city of york,cir.although this case,like those cases,involves protestors at a health facility where abortions are performed,in this case the protestors seek to protest on a handicapped entrance ramp to the facility.because doing so would block handicapped access to the ramp,and the protestors have the opportunity to stand immediately next to the ramp on the public sidewalk and communicate to those entering the facility,we affirm the district court decisions denying the preliminary injunction plaintiffs sought and dismissing their action.
factual background 
the complaint alleges that the four plaintiffs appellants on appeal,john mcternan,edward snell,john wood,and luanne ferguson collectively,the plaintiffs,profess devout christian beliefs,including a belief that their religion requires them to share these beliefs with others.based on these religious beliefs,plaintiffs protested against abortions outside a planned parenthood facility in the city of york,pennsylvania the facility.
the facility is situated next to a public sidewalk and has a ramp leading to its front entrance that runs parallel to the sidewalk.the ramp has handrails on either side as well as a canopy above.a survey conducted by plaintiffs showed that feet of the ramp were constructed on the public right of way.
based on this survey,mcternan sent a letter dated november,to mark whitman,the commissioner of the york city police department,requesting that whitman require planned parenthood to remove the section that encroaches and extends over the property line.app.at.in this letter,mcternan also stated that he had notified the ceo of planned parenthood of the violation and requested that she cease hanging banners,at least one of which stated,inter alia,pledge a protestor campaign in effect today,app.at,between the canopy and the railing of the ramp.mcternan letter noted that when the banners were still hanging two days later,he asked the supervisor to remove them because they were in the public right of way.she declined to do so.
on november,jason jay,an officer with the city of york police department,was on duty outside the facility.plaintiffs,noting that a portion of the ramp and the banner was located on the public right of way,sought permission from officer jay to go on the ramp to communicate with clients entering the facility.officer jay refused them permission,telling plaintiffs that he would arrest them for trespass if they went on the ramp.
these allegations formed the basis of plaintiffs suit against officer jay,commissioner whitman,and the city of york,pennsylvania collectively,the defendants,claiming violations of plaintiffs rights to the free exercise of religion,peaceful assembly,and freedom of speech.plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that defendants failure to allow them on the ramp was unconstitutional,temporary and permanent injunctions restraining defendants from prohibiting plaintiffs access to the ramp,and nominal damages,and costs and attorneys fees.
the same day the complaint was filed,plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent defendants from interfering with their free exercise rights and first amendment rights.app.at.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction request.shortly thereafter,defendants filed a motion to dismiss,relying on federal regulations issued under the americans with disabilities act ada governing handicapped accessible ramps.they cited,for example,part,app.a,which requires that ramps for handicapped accessible buildings and facilities include a clear width of inches,part,app.a,a level landing at both the bottom and the top of the ramp,id.at,edge protection for ramps like the one in question,which has a dropoff,id.at,and handrails along both sides of the ramp,id at.all of the requirements are applicable to the facility.additionally,as the facility provides medical services,the ramp leading to the facility must have an overhead canopy or overhanging roof.id.at.
at the preliminary injunction hearing,defendants presented testimony from david redshaw,who had been the building code inspector for the city of york from september to december,during which time he oversaw the renovation of the front of the facility,including the construction of the ramp.prior to working as the building code inspector,redshaw was the rehab specialist for the bureau of housing services for nearly five years.app.at.during that period,redshaw became familiar with the various state and federal codes and regulations related to accessibility requirements.
redshaw testified that it was york policy to permit an encroachment onto the public right of way when the intrusion was de minimis and was necessary to allow construction of a handicapped accessibility ramp.an intrusion was considered de minimus when the ramp encroached no more than three feet onto the sidewalk and left at least five feet of sidewalk remaining.redshaw was personally aware of at least two other businesses in york with handicapped ramps encroaching in this manner on the public right of way,and had noticed other buildings encroaching on the sidewalk in a similar manner.
when redshaw was asked are there any accessability issues,based on your experience,with people standing or congregating on a handicap accessible ramp that are not issues with the public sidewalk,he replied that t he building codes state that you may not obstruct or reduce the accessibility of this means of egress.app.at.indeed,a regulation promulgated in connection with the ada provides in buildings or facilities,or portions of buildings or facilities,required to be accessible,accessible means of egress shall be provided in the same number as required for exits by local safety regulations.part,app.a.the regulation also defines means of egress as a continuous and unobstructed way of exit travel from any point in a building or facility to a public way.id.at.
after the hearing,the district court denied the motion,finding that the ramp was a nonpublic forum.the court concluded that because the static presence of a person on the ramp area,even if solely over the public right of way,would impede access,it is entirely reasonable for officer jay to instruct individuals not to stand or congregate on the ramp.app.at.the court further stated,it is plain common sense that if an individual other than the fictional ichabod crane stood in the area of the ramp that encroaches onto the public,there would necessarily be less than the required minimum clear width of inches between the handrails as required by the ada.app.at.
the district court also held that,because plaintiffs are not hindered in delivering their message in the vicinity of the facility,they would not be denied their first amendment rights if the injunction were not granted.app.at.moreover,the court concluded that the city of york would be harmed if handicapped access to buildings were affected,a concern that was also within the public interest.the district court therefore denied the preliminary injunction.based on its ruling that the ramp was a nonpublic forum and that plaintiffs had therefore suffered no constitutional injury,the district court granted the motion to dismiss shortly thereafter.
standard of review 
the appeal was timely filed and this court properly has jurisdiction over both issues under.this court reviews the district court decision on a motion to dismiss de novo.at t jmc telecom,llc,cir.we have stated that,i n deciding a motion to dismiss,all allegations of the complaint must be taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,and all inferences must be drawn in favor of them.schrob catterson,cir citation omitted.in addition to the complaint itself,the court can review documents attached to the complaint and matters of public record,lum bank of america,cir,and a court may take judicial notice of a prior judicial opinion.
ordinarily,when reviewing a decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction,this court reviews a district court findings of fact for clear error,conclusions of law de novo,and the ultimate decision to grant or deny the preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.child evangelism fellowship of stafford twp.sch,cir.however,when first amendment rights are implicated,this court must conduct an independent examination of the factual record as a whole.id.
discussion 
this appeal concerns a preliminary injunction and a related motion to dismiss.we will address the preliminary injunction first,following the order in which they were addressed by the district court.
a.the preliminary injunction 
when deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a district court must consider whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and whether granting the preliminary relief will be in the public interest.united states bell,cir.
probability of success on the merits 
plaintiffs motion for the preliminary injunction asked the court to enjoin the city and its officials from interfering with the plaintiffs free exercise rights in front of the planned parenthood facility and to e njoin the city of york from enforcing trespass statutes against the plaintiffs in areas where they are not physically on planned parenthood property.app.at.
defiant trespass is defined under pennsylvania law to include enter ing or remain ing in any place as to which notice against trespass is given by actual communication to the actor.b.it is a defense to defiant trespass that the premises were at the time open to members of the public and the actor complied with all lawful conditions imposed on access to or remaining in the premises.id.at c.as it is undisputed that plaintiffs had been told not to stand on the ramp,the question becomes whether the premises were open to members of the public and,if so,whether the conditions placed on the use of those premises that restrict the protestors first amendment rights survive the appropriate level of scrutiny.
a.the type of forum at issue 
the city offers no support for its assertion that the ramp should be considered private property.we will therefore accept that a portion of the ramp is located on public property.that is not dispositive,however,because we must first determine the type of forum that is at issue.arkansas educ.television comm forbes,d.
the supreme court has identified three types of fora the traditional public forum,the public forum created by government designation,and the nonpublic forum.id.quoting cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.designated public fora must be created by purposeful governmental action.arkansas educ.television comm n,at.as none of the parties argue that the government has made the ramp in this case a designated public forum,it must be either a traditional public forum or a nonpublic forum.
although public sidewalks have long been considered traditional public fora,madsen women health center,d,the supreme court has clarified that not all public sidewalks are public fora.in united states kokinda,the court distinguished a sidewalk that ran between a post office parking lot and a post office from a quintessential public sidewalk because,rather than being part of the transportation grid of the city,the sidewalk was constructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business,d.the court specifically noted that p ostal entryways may be open to the public,but that fact alone does not establish that such areas must be treated as traditional public fora under the first amendment.id.at.because the sidewalk at issue did not have the characteristics of public sidewalks traditionally open to expressive activity,the court held that it was a nonpublic forum.kokinda,at.
here,the district court analogized the sidewalk at issue to the postal sidewalk considered in kokinda,stating 
the planned parenthood ramp bears a striking resemblance to the sidewalk in kokinda.like the kokinda sidewalk,the planned parenthood ramp runs parallel to the sidewalk,which is a public passageway.they both lead from the parking area to the front door of the facility and were constructed solely for the passage of individuals engaged in business at the facility.additionally,the planned parenthood ramp was constructed for the specific purpose of complying with the ada,thereby ensuring that disabled patrons of the facility were able to negotiate the space between the parking area and the entrance of the facility.there is nothing in the record establishing that the ramp was constructed to facilitate expressive activity,daily commerce,or the life of the neighborhood.to the contrary,the ramp purpose was singular,to effectuate access of patrons,both able and disabled,to the planned parenthood facility.to find otherwise would be absurd.
app.at emphasis in original.
we agree with the reasoning of the district court.the diagram and images of the ramp in question in the appendix make clear that there is no way to build an entrance ramp to the facility that would comply with the ada that would not rest on top of a portion of what was formerly a public sidewalk.however,the ramp is distinct from the sidewalk and serves a separate purpose.we agree with the district court that any other conclusion would be absurd.app.at.we conclude,as did the district court,that the ramp is a nonpublic forum.
b.the relevant level of scrutiny 
we must next consider whether the restriction placed on that nonpublic forum,preventing the protestors from standing on it,is reasonable and not an effort to block expression merely because the government disagrees with the view of the speaker.kokinda,at.c onsideration of a forum special attributes is relevant to the constitutionality of a regulation since the significance of the governmental interest must be assessed in light of the characteristic nature and function of the particular forum involved.id.at.alteration in original quoting heffron int l soc.for krishna consciousness,d.
in this case,the ramp is the size required for a handicapped accessible ramp and is designed for people to enter and exit the planned parenthood facility.the record shows that if a person were to stand on the ramp it would no longer have the required handicapped clearance and the presence of a static body would block access to one of the two required handrails.it is also relevant that because the ramp parallels the sidewalk,a protestor can walk next to someone entering the building and continue talking to that person.in light of the availability of a protestor access to the desired audience,it is certainly not unreasonable to preclude the protestor from standing on the ramp itself,thereby blocking the handicapped accessibility of the structure.
this case therefore differs from our prior mcternan decision,which held that the reasonableness of prohibiting a protestor from walking in an alley adjacent to the facility while allowing persons associated with the facility to walk in the alley was a jury question.mcternan,at.not only was the alley in that case a traditional public forum,but questions remained as to whether the restrictions imposed were necessary for the safety of those in the alley,which depended on the traffic level and protestor activity,among other factors.id.no such questions are present in this case,where the forum is non public,and the restrictions are the reasonable and necessary response to ada regulations.see part,app.a.
the district court did not hold merely that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits it held instead that they had no chance of success on the merits.we see no reason to disturb those conclusions.although that holding is dispositive on the appeal of the order denying the preliminary injunction,we turn to the remaining factors relevant to the preliminary injunction as they may also have an impact on our review of the dismissal order.
irreparable injury 
the district court acknowledged that loss of first amendment freedom for any period of time can be considered irreparable harm,but stated that such harm had no
