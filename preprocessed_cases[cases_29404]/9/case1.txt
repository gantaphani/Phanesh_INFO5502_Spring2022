petitioner crst,a trucking company using a system under which two employees share driving duties on a single truck,requires its drivers to graduate from the company training program before becoming a certified driver.in,new driver monika starke filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission commission,alleging that she was sexually harassed by two male trainers during the portion of her training.following the procedures set out in title vii of the civil rights act of,see b,the commission informed crst about the charge and investigated the allegation,ultimately informing crst that it had found reasonable cause to believe that crst subjected starke and a class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment and offering to conciliate.in,having determined that conciliation had failed,the commission,in its own name,filed suit against crst under of title vii.during discovery,the commission identified over allegedly aggrieved women.the district court,however,dismissed all of the claims,including those on behalf of women,which,the court found,were barred on the ground that the commission had not adequately investigated or attempted to conciliate its claims on their behalf before filing suit.the district court then dismissed the suit,held that crst is a prevailing party,and invited crst to apply for attorney fees.crst filed a motion for attorney fees.the district court awarded the company over million in fees.the eighth circuit reversed the dismissal of only two claims on behalf of starke and one other employee but that led it to vacate,without prejudice,the attorney fees award.on remand,the commission settled the claim on behalf of starke and withdrew the other.crst again sought attorney fees,and the district court again awarded it more than million,finding that crst had prevailed on the claims for over of the allegedly aggrieved women,including the claims dismissed because of the commission failure to satisfy its presuit requirements.the eighth circuit reversed and remanded once more.it held that a title vii defendant can be a prevailing party only by obtaining a ruling on the merits,and that the district court dismissal of the claims was not a ruling on the merits.
held a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant is a prevailing party.
a common sense undermines the notion that a defendant can not prevail unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.a plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.but a defendant seeks to prevent an alteration in the plaintiff favor,and that objective is fulfilled whenever the plaintiff challenge is rebuffed,irrespective of the precise reason for the court decision,even if the court final judgment rejects the plaintiff claim for a nonmerits reason.there is no indication that congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorney fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.title vii statute allows prevailing defendants to recover whenever the plaintiff claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.christiansburg garment eeoc.congress thus must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant favor,whether on the merits or not.christiansburg itself involved a defendant request for attorney fees in a case where the district court had rejected the plaintiff claim for a reason.various courts of appeals likewise have applied the christiansburg standard when claims were dismissed for nonmerits reasons.
b the court declines to decide the argument,raised by the commission for the first time during the merits stage of this case,whether a defendant must obtain a preclusive judgment in order to prevail.the commission failure to articulate its preclusion theory earlier has resulted in inadequate briefing on the issue,and the parties dispute whether the district court judgment was in fact preclusive.the commission also submits that the court should affirm on the alternative ground that,even if crst is a prevailing party,the commission position that it had satisfied its presuit obligations was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.these matters are left for the eighth circuit to consider in the first instance.it is not this court usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance,see adarand constructors,mineta,and that is the proper course here,given the extensive record in this case and the commission change of position between the certiorari and merits stages.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case involves the interpretation of a statutory provision allowing district courts to award attorney fees to defendants in employment discrimination actions.under title vii of the civil rights act of,stat,as amended,et,which prohibits discrimination in employment,a district court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party.k.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that a title vii defendant prevails only by obtaining a ruling on the merits.marquart lodge,machinists and aerospace workers.this court disagrees with that conclusion.the court now holds that a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to find that a defendant has prevailed.
title vii of the civil rights act of authorizes an award of attorney fees in certain circumstances.the statute provides that 
i n any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the equal employment opportunity commission or the united states,a reasonable attorney fee including expert fees as part of the costs,and the commission and the united states shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.k.
before deciding whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate in a given case,then,a court must determine whether the party seeking fees has prevailed in the litigation.texas state teachers garland independent school,hensley eckerhart.
congress has included the term prevailing party in various statutes,and it has been the court approach to interpret the term in a consistent manner.see buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health and human resources,and.the court has said that the touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.texas state teachers,supra,at.this change must be marked by judicial imprimatur.buckhannon,at.the court has explained that,when a plaintiff secures an enforceable judgmen t on the merits or a consent decre e,that plaintiff is the prevailing party because he has received a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.at.the court,however,has not set forth in detail how courts should determine whether a defendant has prevailed.
although the court has not articulated a precise test for when a defendant is a prevailing party,in the title vii context it has addressed how defendants should be treated under the second part of the inquiry whether the district court should exercise its discretion to award fees to the prevailing party.when a defendant is the prevailing party on a civil rights claim,the court has held,district courts may award attorney fees if the plaintiff claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or if the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.christiansburg garment eeoc,see also,at.
the court of appeals determination of the first part of the inquiry whether petitioner is a prevailing party presents the central issue in this case.before addressing this question,however,a discussion of the facts and complex procedural history is warranted.
petitioner crst is a trucking company that employs a team driving system under which two employees share driving duties on a single truck.crst requires its drivers to graduate from the company training program before becoming a certified driver.part of that training is a trip with a veteran driver.in,a new driver named monika starke filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission commission alleging that two male trainers sexually harassed her during her training trip.
the commission receipt of a charge of an unlawful workplace practice starts title vii detailed,procedure through which the commission enforces the statute prohibition on employment discrimination.mach mining,llc eeoc,slip,at.under of title vii,the commission first must inform the employer about the charge and the details of the allegations.b.the commission next must investigate the allegation.ibid.if the agency determines after such investigation that there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,it shall dismiss the charge and notify the parties.ibid.at that point,the commission is no longer involved,and the aggrieved individual may sue the employer in his or her own name.f.if,on the other hand,the commission determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a title vii violation did occur,it shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.b.only if the agency attempt at conciliation fails may it file a court action in its own name on behalf of the aggrieved person who brought the charge.f.
following these procedures,the commission notified crst of starke charge and requested information regarding starke allegations.in response crst denied any wrongdoing.during the investigation,the commission discovered that four other women had filed formal charges against the company with the commission.the commission then sent crst several followup requests.it asked if crst had received other allegations of harassment,demanded contact information for any women who were instructed by the trainers starke accused of harassment,and sought detailed contact information for crst dispatchers and female drivers.eeoc crst van expedited.
over a year and a half after starke filed her charge,the commission sent crst a letter of determination informing the company that the commission had found reasonable cause to believe that crst subjected starke and a class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment and offering to conciliate.app.counsel for the commission and for crst discussed conciliation,but were unable to reach an agreement,and the commission promptly notified the company that,in the agency view,the conciliation efforts had failed.
in september the commission,in its own name,filed suit against crst under of title vii.it alleged that crst subjected starke and o ther similarly situated employees of crst to sexual harassment and a sexually hostile and offensive work environment in violation of a and a of title vii,and.app.the commission is allowed to seek specific relief for a group of aggrieved individuals under without first obtaining class certification pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,because that rule is not applicable to a enforcement action.general telephone of northwest eeoc.the commission sought to enjoin crst from engaging in discriminatory employment practices and to obtain an order requiring crst to take proactive steps to remedy and prevent discrimination in the workplace.the commission also sought damages and costs.
during discovery,the commission identified over allegedly aggrieved women far more than the commission had forecast.crst filed a motion for an order to show cause,alleging that the commission did not have a basis for seeking relief on behalf of all the women.eeoc crst van expedited,wl,nd iowa.the district court did not strike any allegedly aggrieved persons at that time,although it did note its concern that crst still might unfairly face a moving target of prospective plaintiffs as discovery winds down and trial approaches.ibid.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court proceeded to dispose of the commission claims in a series of orders responsive to various motions filed by crst.section of title vii authorizes the commission to bring a claim that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination.see.in the early stage of this litigation the commission made clear to the district court and crst that it believe d crst had engaged in a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment.order in nd iowa,doc.crst sought summary judgment on the commission perceived claim.the district court granted the motion.the court explained that,although courts have allowed the commission to use a theory when litigating a claim,the commission did not plead a violation of or use the phrase pattern or practice in its complaint,at.instead,the commission complaint reads as if the commission were asserting a prototypical action.ibid.but,the court noted,crst did not argue that the commission failed to state a claim in the complaint and the court presumed that crst would not have sought summary judgment on a claim it does not believe to exist.at.because both parties accepted that the claim was live,the court assume d without deciding that this is a sexual harassment pattern or practice case.ibid.after reviewing the parties arguments,the court held that the commission had not established a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment and dismissed with prejudice the assumed claim,at.the court,as a final matter,advised that n othing in this opinion should be construed as a final ruling on the individual claims of sexual harassment that the commission presses in this action.ibid.
next,the district court ruled in several orders that the commission claims on behalf of all but of the women were barred on a variety of grounds.the court had previously dismissed claims on behalf of nearly women as a discovery sanction due to the commission failure to produce the women for deposition.in rejecting the commission other claims,the court relied on the expiration of the statute of limitations judicial estoppel the employee failure to report the alleged harassment in a timely fashion crst prompt and effective response to reports of harassment and the lack of severity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassment.
the district court then barred the commission from seeking relief for the remaining women on the ground that the commission had not satisfied its presuit requirements before filing the lawsuit.the court concluded that the suit was one of those exceptionally rare cases where the commission wholly abandoned its statutory duties to investigate and conciliate.crst van expedited,wl,at.the court noted,however,that it expresse d no view as to whether the commission investigation,determination and conciliation of starke charge would be sufficient to support a pattern lawsuit.the district court then dismissed the suit,held that crst is a prevailing party,and invited crst to apply for attorney fees.
crst filed a motion for attorney fees.after describing how it disposed of the commission claims piece by piece,the district court held that the commission failure to satisfy its presuit obligations for its claims on behalf of the final women was unreasonable,and that an award of attorney fees was therefore appropriate.app.the court awarded crst over million in attorney fees,at.
the commission appealed the district court order dismissing the claims on behalf of the women that the district court rejected for failure to satisfy title vii presuit requirements as well as the district court dismissal of some of the commission other claims.as relevant here,the court of appeals held that the district court dismissal of the claims for a lack of investigation and conciliation was proper.the commission,according to the court of appeals,did not reasonably investigate the class allegations of sexual harassment during a reasonable investigation of the charge,but rather used discovery in the resulting lawsuit as a fishing expedition to uncover more violations.crst van expedited,at internal quotation marks omitted.the commission in fact did not investigate the specific allegations of any of the allegedly aggrieved persons until after the complaint was filed.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
the court of appeals affirmed the district court dismissal of almost all of the other claims on which the commission had appealed,reversing only the claims on behalf of starke and one other employee tillie jones for reasons not material to the question at issue here.like the district court before it,the court of appeals declined to comment on whether the presuit investigation and attempted conciliation would have been sufficient to support a claim.the court of appeals also vacated,without prejudice,the attorney fees award.in light of our reversals of the district court orders with respect to starke and jones,the court reasoned,crst is no longer a prevailing defendant because the commission still asserts live claims against it.at.judge murphy dissented from the court holding that the commission had failed to satisfy its obligation to investigate and conciliate the final claims,arguing that the commission did not need to complete its presuit duties for each individual alleged victim of discrimination when pursuing a class claim.at.
after the case was remanded,the commission withdrew its claim on behalf of jones and settled its claim on behalf of starke.the commission thus had no claims left.the company again moved for attorney fees,and the district court again awarded crst more than million in fees.the court first concluded that this case contained multiple and distinct claims for relief,thereby rejecting the commission contention that it had brought a single claim on which it had prevailed.wl,nd iowa.noting that the defendant does not have to prevail on every claim in a suit to obtain attorney fees,see fox vice,the court then determined the claims on which crst had prevailed.applying circuit precedent requiring a ruling on the merits of a claim before a defendant can be considered a prevailing party,the court found that crst did not prevail on the claims that were dismissed because of the commission failure to produce many of the allegedly aggrieved women for deposition.the court also found that crst had not prevailed on the merits with respect to a handful of the commission other claims.the court found that crst did prevail,however,on the commission claim and on the claims on behalf of over of the allegedly aggrieved women,including the claims dismissed because of the commission failure to satisfy its presuit requirements.the court held that its dismissal of those claims was a ruling on the merits because the commission obligation to investigate and conciliate is not a jurisdictional prerequisite rather,it is an ingredient of the commission claim.wl,at.the court further concluded that an award of attorney fees was appropriate because the commission failure to investigate and conciliate those claims was unreasonable,as were the claim and the other claims on which it prevailed.
the commission appealed,and the court of appeals again reversed and remanded.the court of appeals first agreed with the district court that the commission brought many individual claims,not just a single claim.the court of appeals disagreed,however,with the district court conclusion that crst could recover attorney fees for the claim.the commission did not allege a claim in its complaint,the court of appeals noted,and the district court had merely assumed without deciding that the commission brought a claim.at.the court of appeals concluded that the district court erred by awarding fees based on a purported claim.ibid.
the court of appeals,bound by its own precedent in marquart,then held that before a defendant can be deemed to have prevailed and to be eligible for fees there must have been a favorable judicial determination on the merits.at quoting marquart,at.a disposition is necessary,the court reasoned,because p roof that a plaintiff case is frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless is not possible without a judicial determination of the plaintiff case on the merits.at quoting marquart,supra,at.a case has not been decided on the merits,according to the court of appeals,if the defendant secured a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,on res judicata grounds,on grounds,or for something similar,at.the court of appeals distinguished claim elements,on the one hand,from jurisdictional prerequisites or nonjurisdictional prerequisites to filing suit,on the other,at.as relevant here,the court held that because title vii presuit requirements are not elements of a title vii claim,the dismissal of the claims regarding the women on the ground that the commission failed to investigate or conciliate was not a ruling on the merits,and crst did not prevail on those claims,at.as a result,the court concluded,crst was not entitled to an award of attorneys fees on such claims.ibid.the court of appeals also criticized the district court for mak ing a universal finding that all of the commission claims were without foundation,instead of laying out particularized findings as to each individual claim upon which it granted summary judgment on the merits to crst.at.such findings are necessary,the court reasoned,to avoid providing the defendant with compensation for any fees that he would have paid in the absence of the frivolous claims.ibid.quoting fox,supra,at.in particular,the court found it problematic that the district court blanket finding included the purported claim and the claims dismissed for the commission failure to satisfy its presuit obligations.at.the district court was ordered to undertake a proper,particularized inquiry on remand.
by precluding the defendant from recovering attorney fees when the claims in question have been dismissed because the commission failed to satisfy its presuit obligations,the decision of the court of appeals conflicts with the decisions of three other courts of appeals.see eeoc propak logistics,eeoc asplundh tree expert,eeoc pierce packing.this court granted certiorari.
the court of appeals held that crst did not prevail on the claims brought on behalf of women because the district court disposition of these claims for failure to investigate and conciliate was not a ruling on the merits.in this court the commission now takes the position that the court erred by applying an requirement.brief for respondent a sking whether a judgment is on the merits in some abstract sense risks confusion tr.of oral arg.we have abandoned the eighth circuit view that you need a disposition on the merits this court agrees and now holds that a defendant need not obtain a favorable judgment on the merits in order to be a prevailing party.
common sense undermines the notion that a defendant can not prevail unless the relevant disposition is on the merits.plaintiffs and defendants come to court with different objectives.a plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.a defendant seeks to prevent this alteration to the extent it is in the plaintiff favor.the defendant,of course,might prefer a judgment vindicating its position regarding the substantive merits of the plaintiff allegations.the defendant has,however,fulfilled its primary objective whenever the plaintiff challenge is rebuffed,irrespective of the precise reason for the court decision.the defendant may prevail even if the court final judgment rejects the plaintiff claim for a nonmerits reason.
there is no indication that congress intended that defendants should be eligible to recover attorney fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits.the congressional policy regarding the exercise of district court discretion in the ultimate decision whether to award fees does not distinguish between and judgments.rather,as the c
