carl summers appeals the dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.accordingly,we recount the facts as alleged by summers.minor bostwick,cir.
in july,summers began work as a senior analyst for the altarum institute,a government contractor with an office in alexandria,virginia.summers job required him to travel to the maryland offices of altarum client,the defense centers of excellence for psychological health and traumatic brain injury dcoe.at dcoe,summers conducted statistical research,wrote reports,and made presentations.altarum policy authorized employees to work remotely if the client approved.the client,here dcoe,preferred contractors to work during business hours,but permitted them to work remotely from home when putting in extra time on a project.
on october,summers fell and injured himself while exiting a commuter train on his way to dcoe.with a heavy bag slung over his shoulder,he lost his footing and struck both knees against the train platform.paramedics took summers to the hospital,where doctors determined that he had sustained serious injuries to both legs.summers fractured his left leg and tore the meniscus tendon in his left knee.he also fractured his right ankle and ruptured the tendon in his right leg.repairing the fracture required surgery to fit a metal plate,screws,and bone into his tibia.treating summers ruptured right quadriceps required another surgery to drill a hole in the patella and refasten his tendons to the knee.
doctors forbade summers from putting any weight on his left leg for six weeks and estimated that he would not be able to walk normally for seven months at the earliest.without surgery,bed rest,pain medication,and physical therapy,summers alleges that he would likely not have been able to walk for more than a year after the accident.
while hospitalized,summers contacted an altarum representative about obtaining disability benefits and working from home as he recovered.the altarum representative agreed to discuss accommodations that would allow summers to return to work,but suggested that summers take disability and focus on getting well again.summers sent emails to his supervisors at altarum and dcoe seeking advice about how to return to work he suggested a plan in which he would take disability for a few weeks,then start working remotely,and then increase his hours gradually until he was again.
altarum insurance provider granted summers disability benefits.but altarum never followed up on summers request to discuss how he might successfully return to work.the company did not suggest any alternative reasonable accommodation or engage in any interactive process with summers.nor did altarum tell summers that there was any problem with his plan for a graduated return to work.instead,on november,altarum simply informed summers that altarum was terminating him effective december,in order to place another analyst in his role at dcoe.
in september,summers filed a complaint in the eastern district of virginia alleging two claims under the americans with disability act ada or act.first,summers asserted that altarum discriminated against him by wrongfully discharging him on account of his disability.second,summers asserted that altarum failed to accommodate his disability.after summers amended the complaint in october,the district court granted altarum rule b motion and dismissed both claims without prejudice.
rather than filing a second amended complaint,summers filed a new lawsuit in december presenting essentially the same two claims.a few months later,the district court again granted altarum motion to dismiss both claims,this time with prejudice.first,the court dismissed the claim on the ground that summers had failed to allege that he was disabled.the court reasoned that a temporary condition,even up to a year,does not fall within the purview of the a ct and so the defendant not disabled.the court further suggested that summers was not disabled because he could have worked with the assistance of a wheelchair.second,the court dismissed summers claim on the ground that summers failed to allege that he had requested a reasonable accommodation.the court reasoned that an employee bears the burden of requesting a reasonable accommodation,and that summers proposal to work temporarily from home was unreasonable because it sought to eliminate a significant function of the job.
on appeal,summers challenges only the district court dismissal of his claim.he does not contest the court dismissal of his claim,and so we do not consider it.
