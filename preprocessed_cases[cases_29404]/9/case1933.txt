the town of cary,north carolina the town,appeals the district court invalidation of its municipal sign ordinance as it applied to resident william david bowden bowden.the district court held that the ordinance was a content based constraint on bowden first amendment rights.we disagree.because the ordinance regulates speech for reasons independent of content,it is a content neutral restriction subject to intermediate scrutiny.applying that scrutiny,we conclude the ordinance does not violate the first amendment and reverse.
pursuant to the authority granted by the north carolina legislature to state municipalities,the town has implemented a comprehensive land development ordinance ldo to regulate land use within its jurisdiction.the current ldo,adopted in,consists of twelve chapters of regulations,with chapter the sign ordinance governing the placement and display of residential signs.
characteristic of most sign regulations,the legislative intent of the sign ordinance is to promote aesthetics and traffic safety.chapter a outlines the purposes of the sign ordinance 
to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the town 
to maintain and enhance the pleasing look of the town,which attracts to the town major events of regional,national,and international interest 
to preserve cary as a community that is attractive to business 
to improve pedestrian and traffic safety 
to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property and 
to implement relevant provisions of the comprehensive plan,as updated from.
the sign ordinance also notes that a ttractive and integrated urban design features tend to improve a town image,raise overall property values,attract new business and residents,and improve the quality of life.id.town officials confirm these objectives,see the town concern for aesthetics,appearance,and visual appeal is a part of the land use plan focus,and they pervade the ldo preamble,see the regulations are specifically intended to preserve the character and quality of residential neighborhoods,l essen congestion in the streets,and m aintain and protect high quality aesthetic standards for development.
recognizing that residential signs serve an important purpose of providing residents with a forum in which to express their opinion on matters of public interest,in january the town modified the sign ordinance to permit residents to display up to two residential signs that shall not exceed five square feet per side in area and inches in height.
the ldo defines a sign broadly as a ny device,fixture,placard or structure,that uses any color,form,graphic,illumination,symbol,or writing to advertise,attract attention,announce the purpose of,or identify the purpose of,a person or entity,or to communicate information of any kind to the public.j.but the ldo also states expressly that holiday decorations and public art are not signs subject to the regulation.
the ldo defines holiday decorations as d isplays erected on a seasonal basis in observance of religious,national,or state holidays which are not intended to be permanent in nature and which contain no advertising material,and public art as i tems expressing creative skill or imagination in a visual form,such as painting or sculpture which are intended to beautify or provide aesthetic influences to public areas or areas which are visible from the public realm.
william bowden lived in cary for many years,and had long quarreled with the town over damage to his house allegedly caused by water discharge from municipal projects.dissatisfied with the town efforts to resolve the dispute,bowden responded by painting the words screwed by the town of cary across a fifteen foot swath of the facade of his home.bowden chose a bright fluorescent orange paint to express his unhappiness,using lettering that varied in height from to inches 
it was not long before a passing motorist alerted the police to bowden handiwork.following a short investigation,the town issued a notice of zoning violation referencing the chapter s size limitations for residential signs.after bowden refused to remove the lettering,the town issued a second notice citing two different ldo violations.first,as the display qualified as a wall sign rather than a residential sign,the town alleged that it violated the size limitations of chapter x a,which requires that all such signs not exceed two square feet in area.second,the town alleged that the sign violated the color restrictions of chapter b,which prohibits the use of high intensity colors or fluorescent pigments.
the second notice demanded bowden remove the sign or suffer daily fines.the town emphasized that it was not the content of bowden sign,but rather its size and color,that was the problem.accordingly,the town recommended bowden display his message through a medium that complied with the sign ordinance bowden refused.instead,he sued under,asserting facial and as applied challenges to the constitutionality of the sign ordinance.bowden principally argued that because the sign ordinance exempted certain signs from regulation while regulating his particular sign,it was a content based infringement on his first amendment rights.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court ruled for bowden.relying principally on the supreme court decision in metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality opinion,the district court first noted that the sign ordinance specifies several types of signs,including public art and holiday decorations,which are exempt from the restrictions that apply to all other types of signs.bowden town of cary,d.these exclusions,said the court,require the town to engage in a searching inquiry into the content of a particular sign to determine whether it is subject to or exempt from regulation.id.at.so,for example,because the sign ordinance requires examining the content of a sign such as scrooged by the town of cary to discern whether it is a holiday decoration and thus excluded from regulation,the district court concluded that the sign ordinance was a content based regulation.applying strict scrutiny,the court invalidated the sign ordinance,granted bowden a permanent injunction,and awarded him nominal damages of one dollar.in a subsequent order,the district court also awarded bowden in attorney fees and costs.
this appeal followed.
before passing on the constitutionality of the sign ordinance,we address two issues regarding our jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
first,bowden died during the pendency of this appeal,and in august we entered an order substituting the administratrix of his estate,dawn brown brown,as plaintiff appellee we then directed supplemental briefing on the issue of whether bowden claim survived his death 
historically,the common law rule for survivability was that a cause of action died with the person.see zatuchni sec y of health human,dyk,concurring citing restatement second of torts a cmt.to displace the common law rule,some jurisdictions have provided by statute that certain legal claims survive the death of a party.see moor alameda county,d.
as does not provide for survival of claims,we consult the law of the forum state the north carolina survival statute to determine whether the claim survives.see a robertson wegmann,d.that statute prescribes a default rule of survival for all claims,with three exceptions,including for causes of action where the relief sought could not be enjoyed,or granting it would be nugatory after death.b.
analogizing bowden federal civil rights claim to a corresponding action under north carolina law,we are satisfied that the claim would survive under that statute.while it is axiomatic that prospective injunctive relief could not be enjoyed by a deceased litigant,bowden also asserted a past deprivation of his constitutional rights.considering that the default rule of the north carolina statute is one of survival,as well as the fact that courts have applied this particular exception only to prospective remedies,see in re higgins,elmore elmore,we conclude that the controversy over this retrospective constitutional injury even if only compensable by nominal damages would survive under north carolina law,and therefore does not abate for our purposes.see mcgowen rental tool,allowing a suit for retrospective personal injury to survive under north carolina survival statute see also covenant media of llc city of charleston,cir holding that a suit challenging a local sign ordinance was not rendered moot by the defendant amendment of the sign ordinance because even if claim for injunctive relief had become moot,plaintiff was still entitled to at least nominal damages for the alleged constitutional violation.
next,the town contends that bowden lacks standing to challenge the exemptions of the sign ordinance but instead may challenge only the provisions regulating the size and pigment of residential signs,since only those restrictions caused him actual injury.the district court rejected this argument,a ruling that we consider de novo.see piney run ass county comm rs,cir.
as the district court correctly noted,bowden complaint alleges an infringement of his first amendment rights stemming from the ldo allegedly content based exemptions.inasmuch as the relevant content distinction derives from the town conscious choice to exempt certain signs from regulation,bowden legal injury derives from the exemptions no less than from the substantive restrictions themselves,and he may therefore subject those exemptions to constitutional scrutiny.see.writers project,ragland,d explaining that standing to challenge exemptions exists where others similarly situated were exempt from the operation of a state law adversely affecting the claimant.city of ladue gilleo,d.that is,after all,the essence of the content neutrality inquiry analyzing what speech the town has chosen to regulate and what speech it has chosen to exempt.accordingly,we reject the town standing challenge and proceed to the merits of the district court ruling.
in assessing the sign ordinance constitutionality under the first amendment,we review the district court summary judgment order de novo.webster dep t of,cir.our first task is to determine whether the sign ordinance is content based or content neutral,and then,based on the answer to that question,to apply the proper level of scrutiny.ladue,at,concurring.
not surprisingly,the parties present opposing views of how we should assess content neutrality.bowden argues that a regulation that depends on content distinctions is necessarily content based,while the town argues that its regulation may distinguish speech based on its content so long as its reasons for doing so are not based on the message conveyed.we think the town has the better argument.
for reasons we explain below,we reject any absolutist reading of content neutrality,and instead orient our inquiry toward why not whether the town has distinguished content in its regulation.viewed in that light,we are satisfied that the sign ordinance is content neutral.applying the intermediate scrutiny required for content neutral restrictions on speech,we hold that the sign ordinance does not violate the first amendment.
while signs are a form of expression protected by the free speech clause,they pose distinctive problems that are subject to municipalities police powers.ladue,at.accordingly,i t is common ground that governments may regulate the physical characteristics of signs just as they can,within reasonable bounds and absent censorial purpose,regulate audible expression in its capacity as noise.id.what governments may generally not do,however,is suppress,disadvantage,or impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content.turner broad,fcc,d.the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality,in speech cases generally and in time,place,or manner cases in particular,is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.ward rock against racism,d.
we consider the town appeal in light of our recent decision in wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir,a case the district court did not have before it.there,we assessed the constitutional bona fides of a sign ordinance that regulated the size of business signs while exempting noncommercial signs,as well as several additional types of government signs,from a mandatory permit process.id.at.
in deciding whether these exemptions distinguished based on content,we read the supreme court treatment of content neutrality in hill colorado,d,as e schewing a formalistic approach to evaluating content neutrality that looks only to the terms of a regulation and instead embrac ing a more practical inquiry.wag more dogs,at.our pragmatic view of first amendment principles in wag more dogs can not be squared with the formalistic approach relied on by the district court and urged by bowden on appeal.
as the chief purpose of content neutrality is to prevent a government from supervising the marketplace of ideas by choos ing which issues are worth discussing or debating,consol.edison pub.serv.comm n,d internal quotations omitted,the notion that any content distinction is intrinsically content based misapprehends the proper analysis.content neutrality bars only one particular sort of distinction those made with a censorial intent to value some forms of speech over others to distort public debate,ladue,at,concurring,to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,police dep t of chicago mosley,d,or to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable,texas johnson,d.
we acknowledge that several of our sister circuits hew to an absolutist reading of content neutrality.see neighborhood enterprises,city of louis,cir,cert.denied,d holding sign ordinance exemptions content based since one must look at the content of the object.serv.emp.int l union,local city of houston,cir a regulatory scheme that requires the government to examine the content of the message that is conveyed is regardless of its motivating purpose.internal quotations omitted solantic,llc city of neptune beach,cir applying the absolutist approach.
in our view,however,such an approach imputes a censorial purpose to every content distinction,and thereby applies the highest judicial scrutiny to laws that do not always imperil the preeminent first amendment values that such scrutiny serves to safeguard.as we did in wag more dogs,we again join those circuits that have interpreted hill as supporting a more practical test for assessing content neutrality.see aclu of alvarez,cir a law is not considered content based simply because a court must look at the content of an oral or written statement in order to determine whether a rule of law applies.quoting hill,at melrose,city of pittsburgh,cir a consideration of the sign content does not by itself constitute a lack of neutrality as to specific content,llc city of detroit,cir there is simply nothing in the record to indicate that the distinctions between the various types of signs reflect a meaningful preference for one type of speech over another.travel city of lake oswego,cir the regulation does not require lake oswego officials to evaluate the substantive message and certainly does not favor speech based on the idea expressed.internal quotations omitted.
we also reject the analogous principle that the sign ordinance is necessarily content based because a searching inquiry into the content of a particular sign is required.bowden,d at.rather,a more searching inquiry should merely be seen as indicative,not determinative,of whether a government has regulated for reasons related to content.see reed town of gilbert,cir if applied without common sense,this principle would mean that every sign,except a blank sign,would be content based.
affirming the practical inquiry propounded in wag more dogs,we reiterate its operative test for content neutrality 
a regulation is not a regulation of speech if the regulation is not a regulation of speech,but rather a regulation of the places where some speech may occur the regulation was not adopted because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys or the government interests in the regulation are unrelated to the content of the affected speech.
