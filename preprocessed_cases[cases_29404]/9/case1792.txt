opinion of the court 
in this close and complex appeal,we must decide whether plaintiffs have stated a claim for purposeful,racial discrimination under title vi of the civil rights act of,et and,by alleging among other things that the national collegiate athletic association adopted certain educational standards because of their adverse impact on black student athletes seeking college scholarships.we hold that they have sufficiently alleged a claim for relief.
as the complaint indicates,the ncaa purportedly tried to improve graduation rates among black student athletes by adopting proposition,a facially neutral rule that establishes scholarship and athletic eligibility criteria for incoming student athletes.as a result of these criteria,plaintiffs allege,proposition has caused increased numbers of black student athletes to lose eligibility for receiving athletic scholarships and for participating in intercollegiate athletics during their freshmen year.plaintiffs further allege that defendant knew of these effects and intended them.and thus,plaintiffs suggest that the ncaa actually adopted proposition to screen out more black student athletes from ever receiving athletic scholarships in the first place,with the asserted goal of increased graduation rates serving as a mere pretext.
because the complaint sufficiently avers that proposition has adversely impacted the number of black student athletes who qualify for athletic scholarships,and because it alleges the ncaa adopted this otherwise facially neutral policy because of this adverse,racial impact,we can not agree that the student athletes who failed to meet the eligibility criteria established by proposition failed to state a claim for relief under the liberal requirements of.a.
on the other hand,we affirm the district court holding that plaintiff kelly pryor lacks standing to prosecute her discrimination claims under the americans with disabilities act,et and the rehabilitation act of,et.as the district court reasoned,pryor may still recover the year of athletic eligibility that she lost as a freshman,depending on whether she completes of her degree requirements by the time she finishes her fourth year in college.but her fourth year will not end until sometime in the future.accordingly,because she has already irrevocably lost eligibility for her freshman year and because the ncaa may still restore that lost year of eligibility in any event,her claims for disability discrimination fail to satisfy the constitution article iii case or controversy requirements.
this appeal represents the latest challenge to proposition,a policy that the division i schools of the ncaa voluntarily adopted in and fully implemented by.to provide the proper context,we describe the role of the ncaa and proposition as well as two earlier,related appeals.next,we describe the allegations of the complaint in this case and why the district court granted the ncaa motion to dismiss.following a discussion about why we,too,must review this case under the standard as opposed to the summary judgment standard,we address the absence of standing for pryor ada and rehabilitation act claims why plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts showing a right to relief for purposeful discrimination why even a benign or laudable goal of improving graduation rates for black athletes via the adoption of proposition still would not necessarily immunize the ncaa from liability as a matter of law why plaintiffs alternative theory about the ncaa deliberate indifference to the impact its policy would have on a particular minority group fails to state a claim for purposeful discrimination under title vi and and why plaintiffs agreement to satisfy proposition academic requirements does not defeat their claim.
defendant ncaa is a voluntary association of more than a thousand members,mostly consisting of public and private universities that have varsity intercollegiate athletic programs.the ncaa member universities divide themselves by divisions division i,division ii and division iii.each division ordinarily adopts its own bylaws.these bylaws include rules for defining freshmen eligibility for intercollegiate athletic competition.for example,in,the division i members adopted proposition,which required incoming high school athletes to have a minimum grade point average of and a minimum score on the scholastic aptitude test in order to practice,play and receive an athletic scholarship.as this court has previously stated,the division i members implemented proposition to address the perception that its member schools were exploiting athletes for their talents without concern for whether they graduated.cureton collegiate athletic,cir.following the implementation of proposition,graduation rates among athletes,especially among black athletes,increased.
in,the division i schools voluntarily adopted the ncaa proposition,the provision at issue in this case.proposition modifies proposition by increasing the number of core high school courses in which a student athlete must have a minimum gpa,and it determines athletic eligibility based on a formula that combines a gpa and standardized test score.proposition essentially increases the minimum scores that a high school student athlete must attain to qualify for athletic scholarship aid and eligibility for practicing and competing as a college freshman.for example,if a student athlete had a gpa in the core high school courses,he or she must score a on the sat.the district court found in a similar case that proposition puts a greater emphasis on standardized test scores than did its predecessor proposition.
in,counsel for plaintiffs in this case sued the ncaa on behalf of different minority student athletes who claimed that proposition violated the regulations to title vi of the civil rights act.cureton collegiate athletic,at cureton i.specifically,the cureton plaintiffs alleged a title vi violation based on the theory that proposition creates a disparate impact on racial minorities.id.following discovery,the district court concluded that proposition disparate impact on athletes violated the regulations to title vi and so,the court permanently enjoined the continued enforcement of proposition.in so doing,the court accepted the ncaa proffered goal of implementing proposition as a way to raise all graduation rates,but it rejected proposition as a legitimate means for accomplishing that goal.further,the court held that although proposition may benefit black athletes by improving their overall graduation rate,it still adversely impacted minority athletes at the front end of the process,the eligibility of freshmen minority athletes.
this court reversed and remanded with instructions for the entry of judgment for the ncaa.in the court analysis,the regulations applied only to the specific programs or activities for which an entity uses federal funds,not to the entity at large.see cureton i,at.as a result,the court reasoned,even assuming the ncaa received federal funds,the title vi regulations did not apply to the ncaa because the ncaa did not exercise controlling authority over its member institutions ultimate decision about a eligibility to participate in collegiate athletics.see id.at citing and discussing ncaa tarkanian,d.
roughly one year after this decision,the supreme court held that title vi creates no claim for disparate impact,contrary to the theory alleged by the plaintiffs in cureton i title vi itself directly reach es only instances of intentional discrimination.alexander sandoval,d.
cureton ii 
on remand to the district court,the cureton plaintiffs moved to either amend their complaint or to have the judgment altered so as to add a claim of intentional discrimination based on the ncaa adoption enforcement of proposition.citing undue prejudice,delay and futility,some of the factors used to assess a motion to amend a complaint or judgment,the district court denied the motion.this court affirmed on the grounds of undue prejudice and delay only.cureton collegiate athletic,cir cureton ii.requiring the ncaa to address this intentional discrimination claim would essentially require it to the entire case again.id.in addition,the cureton plaintiffs admitted that they could have filed an intentional discrimination claim years ago they simply chose not to do so based on the putative strength of their disparate impact claim.see id.at.last,the ncaa had no notice that the cureton plaintiffs might later add this intentional discrimination claim,since the plaintiffs themselves had described the ncaa motives behind proposition as laudable.id.
this dispute very much resembles the cureton case,with the variant that plaintiffs here allege that the ncaa purposefully discriminated against them by adopting proposition.indeed,as the ncaa notes,some of the allegations in the current complaint come verbatim from the allegations lodged in the amended complaint in cureton ii.in addition,the complaint in this case contains several attachments,including various ncaa memoranda,affidavits from ncaa officials,an interrogatory response that the ncaa provided in the cureton litigation,as well as other discovery obtained during that case.the complaint frequently mentions the cureton litigation,including the discovery obtained therein.
according to the complaint,plaintiff kelly pryor is an student athlete recruited by san jose state to play varsity soccer.pryor has a learning disability.in,as a high school athlete,she signed an agreement,called a national letter of intent nli,to play soccer on a scholarship at san jose state beginning in the fall of.plaintiff warren spivey is an student athlete who signed an nli to play football at the university of connecticut uconn.as with the nlis signed by all student athletes who receive athletic scholarships,the nlis signed by pryor and spivey contain a condition that would render the agreement void if they failed to meet the eligibility requirements established in proposition.
neither pryor nor spivey met these requirements.pryor,however,did petition for a waiver based on her learning disability.as a result,she received partial qualifier status,meaning she retained her athletic scholarship and could still practice with the san jose state soccer team she just could not compete in the team games.in addition,in august,the ncaa instituted bylaw,which grants students like pryor five years to use their four years of athletic eligibility,provided that the student completes of her degree requirements by the end of her fourth year at the university.disabled student athletes,by contrast,must complete of their degree requirements by the end of their fourth year if they wish to stay a fifth year and use whatever athletic eligibility is remaining.pryor will presumably reach the end of her fourth year at san jose state by.
spivey himself,meanwhile,did not petition for a waiver but uconn did so on his behalf,arguing that spivey record showed that he was prepared for the academic requirements of college.the ncaa denied this petition,as well as the appeal thereto,meaning spivey could not receive athletically related financial aid or participate in varsity athletics during his freshman year.according to the complaint,spivey still attends uconn,but he incurred substantial debt,student loans,in order to pay his college tuition.
under proposition,student athletes who fail to meet the eligibility criteria as freshmen may still compete in varsity athletics beginning their sophomore year,provided they meet other minimum academic criteria.also,proposition relates only to the award of athletic scholarships no ncaa policy stops a university from giving a proposition casualty the financial aid that is available to all students.none of the year criteria are at issue in this case.
pryor and spivey sue the ncaa 
in february,pryor and spivey sued the ncaa and sought to certify a class against it.pryor alleged that proposition discriminated against her on account of her learning disability,in violation of the americans with disabilities act and the rehabilitation act,and she sought injunctive and declaratory relief so as to remedy the loss of her freshman eligibility.in addition,both pryor and spivey alleged that,by adopting proposition,the ncaa intentionally discriminated against them on account of their race,in violation of title vi of the civil rights act and.
as support for their claims,plaintiffs complaint cites often to ncaa memoranda and other evidence obtained during the cureton litigation.in particular,the complaint notes that the ncaa responded to an interrogatory about its reasons for adopting proposition by identifying as one of its top ten reasons the goal that proposition would promote a higher graduation rate for black athletes and would thereby narrow the gap between black graduation rates and white graduation rates.pls.compl.citing statements from the district court decision in cureton i,the complaint asserts that proposition explicit goal stands in stark contrast to the characterization of proposition as a facially neutral rule.id.quoting cureton ncaa,d.further,it professes a reliance,in part,on the serious questions the cureton court itself had about whether proposition function ed simply as a proxy for a racial quota.id.quoting cureton,supra.
in addition,the complaint identifies a memorandum from the ncaa dated july asserting that proposition and proposition have led to steady increases in the graduation rates for minorities and that no other proposed models would achieve that goal as well as proposition has.id.an affidavit from graham spanier,a former member of various ncaa committees,similarly avers that proposition precursor to proposition significantly improved graduation rates of student athletes,with the greatest increase coming among black student athletes.id.and another memorandum from an ncaa statistician calculates the projected graduation rates for black and white athletes under the proposition model as well as three alternative models.id.the memorandum indicates that proposition projected the highest graduation rate for black and white athletes.
liberally construed,the complaint maintains that proposition achieves the ncaa stated goal of improving graduation rates for black athletes relative to white athletes by simply screen ing out greater numbers of black athletes from ever becoming eligible in the first place,from ever receiving athletic eligibility and scholarship aid,pls.compl.further,it maintains that although the ncaa knew that proposition would have a more adverse impact on black student athletes than on white student athletes,the ncaa went ahead and adopted proposition anyway,based on its misguided view toward affecting graduation rates by denying scholarship eligibility to greater numbers of black student athletes.id.as support for this assertion,the complaint points to various studies,research and reports by the ncaa showing that proposition and its precursor proposition would disproportionately and negatively impact black student athletes,pls.compl.
citing these allegations,the complaint also lays out two theories of relief under title vi and.first,it asserts that because the ncaa adopted proposition knowing that it would adversely affect black student athletes,the ncaa thereby acted with deliberate indifference to proposition impact on student athletes.id.and that indifference,the theory goes,amounts to the purposeful discrimination proscribed by title vi and.see id.alternatively,the complaint indicates that the evidence of the ncaa knowledge about proposition impact as well as other circumstantial evidence establishes that the ncaa adopted this policy to intentionally deny athletic eligibility and scholarship aid to a greater number of black athletes.see,pls.compl.any suggestion that considerations of race did not at least partially motivate the ncaa adoption of proposition is pretextual.id.
in response,the ncaa moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint under.b or,alternatively,for summary judgment.
the district court grants the ncaa motion to dismiss 
in july,the district same judge that handled the cureton the ncaa motion to dismiss.as to pryor ada and rehabilitation act claims,the court determined that pryor lacked standing to effectively remedy her asserted loss of freshman eligibility.specifically,the court held that while pryor complaint satisfied the constitutional standing requirements of injury and causation,it did not meet the third prong concerning legal or equitable redress.this was so,the court explained,because the ncaa itself may still grant her the relief she seeks via bylaw rule granting athletes five years to play four years of varsity athletics if they complete of their degree requirements.in addition,the court rejected pryor argument that,because she has to earn back her fourth year of eligibility,she still had standing to prosecute her ada claim.as the district court noted,any claim that pryor now brought to recover for her fourth year of eligibility would fail for ripeness as pryor had simply not yet reached her fourth year at san jose state.
in addition,the court dismissed the two theories that pryor and spivey advanced to show purposeful discrimination.first,in the district court analysis,plaintiffs theory about the ncaa deliberate indifference could not stand because,under alexander sandoval,supra,the supreme court has held that even if a federally funded entity knowingly adopts a rule that creates a disparate impact,title vi still affords no remedy.second,plaintiffs alleged that a discriminatory purpose played a motivating factor in the ncaa development and adoption of proposition.but proposition is a facially neutral policy,the court stated and policies that incidentally create a racially disparate impact as opposed to policies that intentionally create a disparate impact do not abridge title vi or.further,the court determined that the ncaa monitoring of the effects that its policies have upon minority athletes does not suggest that the ncaa improperly considered race in either the promulgation or continued enforcement of proposition.last,the court reasoned that proposition was motivated by the desire to improve graduation rates for all student athletes,leading the court to find that the ncaa design and implementation of proposition occurred in spite of its alleged disparate impact,not because of that impact.
finally,the district court dismissed pryor and spivey claim.as stated earlier,plaintiffs had failed to adequately allege intentional discrimination and this deficiency merits dismissal of this claim.alternatively,the court held that plaintiffs had also failed to allege harm to the contracting activity protected by the ncaa proposition did not prevent either pryor or spivey from entering into a contract,an nli with their respective universities and it did not bar them from enjoying the benefits of those contracts either,since their nlis were conditioned on plaintiffs satisfying the eligibility requirements of proposition.accordingly,the court concluded that because pryor and spivey had entered into these nlis and accepted their conditions,they could not now disregard them for purposes of.
this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under and now affirm in part,reverse in part and remand.
both parties make numerous arguments on appeal,some going well beyond the rulings actually made by the district court.for her part,plaintiff pryor asserts that she did not lack standing to bring her ada and rehabilitation act claims because the district court could have granted the requested relief without speculating whether that relief an injunction and declaratory judgment would have remedied the loss of her freshman eligibility.along those same lines,she argues that ncaa bylaw did not confer relief remotely comparable to the relief she now seeks,as she would still have to earn back her fourth year of eligibility instead of receiving it automatically like other student athletes.
as to the intentional discrimination claims,plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly relied on cureton to hold that the ncaa adopted proposition in spite of its allegedly adverse impact,not because of that disproportionately adverse impact.in so doing,plaintiffs suggest that the district court was relying on cureton as if the ncaa had invoked notions of collateral estoppel,res judicata or law of the case.
addressing the same issue,plaintiffs further argue that the district court misunderstood the basis of their alternative theory that the ncaa had acted with deliberate indifference to the disparate impact created by the adoption of proposition.the claim is not merely that the ncaa was deliberately indifferent to proposition disparate impact.the claim is that the ncaa was and is deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs rights as secured under title vi appellants br.at.according to plaintiffs brief,the essence of plaintiffs deliberate indifference claim is that even if the ncaa did not intend to discriminate against student athletes,its conduct is so deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs rights as secured by those statutes that it might as well have intended to discriminate.appellants br.at.
next,referring to the evidence identified in their complaint,plaintiffs assert that the admissions by the ncaa about adopting proposition to raise graduation rates for black athletes constitute direct evidence of the ncaa decision to take race into account.plaintiffs extrapolate from these admissions an intent to adopt a policy that would exclude more black athletes from scholarships or freshmen participation appellants br.at,saying further that,a t the heart of their claim,they allege the ncaa uses proposition as a vehicle to exclude greater numbers of african american in order to wrongfully claim that it is decreasing the graduation gap and wrongfully claim that proposition has caused an increase in overall graduation rates.plaintiffs assert that they have the right to present the evidence of the ncaa intent to a jury.
last,plaintiffs recognize that the nlis they signed do contain the condition about having to meet the eligibility requirements established by proposition.but they begin another argument that proposition purposefully discriminates against black athletes.importantly,as does their complaint,they also suggest that the nli proposition condition is invalid,given that it is allegedly the product of intentional discrimination.
in response,the ncaa first notes that we may affirm the judgment as based on either a motion to dismiss or as a summary judgment motion.further,it identifies various principles of the article iii case or controversy analysis as barring plaintiff pryor ada and rehabilitation act,ripeness and,as to the core standing requirements,failure to allege an injury that a court could presently redress.also,on the merits of pryor ada and rehabilitation act claims,the ncaa asserts that these claims must fail because proposition merely embodies academic standards that are necessary to accomplish legitimate educational objectives.
as to plaintiffs intentional discrimination claims,the ncaa maintains that an unwavering line of supreme court decisions shows that purposeful discrimination requires proof of racial animus that is,an intention to harm racial minorities.appellee br.at emphasis added.in that vein,the ncaa continues,plaintiffs can not seize upon the ncaa admissions of trying to help black athletes as instead warranting an inference that it actually intended to discriminate against and harm black student athletes.meanwhile,the ncaa argues,plaintiffs restatement of their deliberate indifference claim merely assumes its own conclusion it does not distinguish that claim from precedents that have upheld a facially neutral policy that happened to create a disparate impact.
as to plaintiffs claim,the ncaa again adopts the district court reasoning,saying that because the nli contained a condition about meeting proposition eligibility requirements,the ncaa did not deprive plaintiffs of the right to make or otherwise enjoy the benefits of their respective nli contracts.in other words,because plaintiffs themselves had failed to meet a condition of their own agreement,the ncaa did not prevent them from enjoying the benefits of their nli contract rather,plaintiffs had simply deprived themselves of that right by failing to meet one of the nli conditions.
we review the district court decision granting a party motion to dismiss de novo.a court should not dismiss a complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim for relief unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claims which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.in evaluating whether dismissal is proper,a court must accept all the factual allegations of the complaint as true,and must draw all reasonable inferences to aid the pleader.enter.bucks county community college,cir.
in this case,however,the ncaa filed a motion to dismiss under.b or,in the alternative,a motion for summary judgment under.in addition,plaintiffs refer to several exhibits attached to their complaint,many of which concern the ncaa decision to adopt proposition.the evidence here,in other words,became part of the record on appeal because plaintiffs had attached it to their because either party had independently come forward and presented that evidence as matters outside the pleadings.and,as previously noted,plaintiffs assert error with the district court references to the cureton litigation,even though plaintiffs own complaint repeatedly cites and quotes from various portions of that decision.we dispose of this argument now and,in so doing,hold that we too must treat this appeal as if we are reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss only,not a motion for summary judgment.
generally speaking,a trial court has discretion to address evidence outside the complaint when ruling on a motion to dismiss.kulwicki dawson,cir citing wright miller,fed.prac.proc,at.further,as one treatise has explained,simply attaching exhibits to a complaint does not necessarily make that complaint amenable only to summary judgment or foreclose a court from considering those exhibits in its rule b ruling 
as a general rule,the court may only consider the pleading which is attacked by an frcp b motion in determining its sufficiency.the court is not permitted to look at matters outside the record if such matters are considered,the frcp b motion to dismiss is,by the express terms of frcp b,converted into a motion for summary judgment.however,the court may consider documents which are attached to or submitted with the complaint,as well as legal arguments presented in memorandums or briefs and arguments of counsel.further,documents whose contents are alleged in the complaint and whose authenticity no party questions,but which are not physically attached to the pleading,may be considered.documents that the defendant attaches to the motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff complaint and are central to the claim as such,they may be considered by the court.
fed.citations omitted emphases added see also fed.as previously discussed,certain matters outside the body of the complaint itself,such as exhibits attached to the complaint and facts of which the court will take judicial notice,will not trigger the conversion of an frcp b motion to dismiss to an frcp motion for summary judgment.
applying these principles,we discern no error with the district court references to the cureton litigation,as the body of the complaint itself expressly references the findings and statements made in that factually similar case.contrary to plaintiffs argument,moreover,the district court did not appear to cite cureton for purposes of assessing the truth of the factual allegations in this case,much less for applying principles of claim or issue preclusion or law of the case rather,the court cited cureton as precedent only.accordingly,plaintiffs argument on this point fails.
applying the rule b standard,we uphold the dismissal of plaintiff pryor claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act.as the district court reasoned,the court can not order the declarative or injunctive relief pryor seeks if the ncaa may later award her that relief anyway.and we will not know if the ncaa will do this until or so,meaning her disability claims fail for both lack of redress and lack of ripeness.
on the other hand,while we reject plaintiffs deliberate indifference theory,the complaint and exhibits have stated a claim for relief for purposeful discrimination.as more fully explained below,the complaint and exhibits show that the ncaa expressly considered race and how proposition would affect athletes when it adopted this policy.further,though the ncaa may have intended this consideration for the laudable goal of increasing graduation rates for black student athletes,the complaint indicates that the policy was actually adopted to harm black athletes by preventing them from ever receiving college athletic scholarships and eligibility in the first place.moreover,contrary to the assertions made in the ncaa brief,none of the case law it cited,much less supreme court case law,absolves a decisionmaker from liability simply because it considered race for the benevolent purpose of helping a particular racial group.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that considerations of race,well intentioned or not,can still subject a decisionmaker to liability for purposeful discrimination.
last,the claim must stand as well.simply put,plaintiffs could not legally consent or otherwise agree to a contract term or condition,the condition of complying with proposition academic requirements,if that condition was itself the product of purposeful racial discrimination.thus,we reverse and remand on this claim too.
constitutional standing requires pleadings that show a legally recognized injury caused by the named defendant or at least fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and that a favorable decision by the court would likely redress.bennett spear,d.redress,the third prong,will deprive a court of jurisdiction over cases in which the likelihood that the requested relief would remedy the plaintiff injury is only speculative.in re thornburgh,quoting linda richard,d.
in cases where a plaintiff seeks injunctive or declaratory relief only,moreover,standing will not lie if adjudication rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or indeed may not occur at all.de la vina,cir quoting texas united states,d.indeed,in ada cases,courts have held that a plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief unless he alleges facts giving rise to an inference that he will suffer future discrimination by the defendant.shotz cates,cir citations omitted see also armstrong world,adams,cir discussing how courts should dismiss action on ripeness grounds when a complaint seeking declaratory relief rests on the contingency that some future act will occur.
here,we uphold the dismissal of plaintiff pryor ada and rehabilitation act claims because we can not tell yet whether pryor will receive a fourth year of athletic eligibility.as the district court noted,pryor has no claim for damages under the ada because she still received her athletic scholarship via the partial waiver she obtained.further,she may not need declarative or injunctive relief.ncaa bylaw allows athletes like pryor to receive a fourth year of athletic thus recover the year of eligibility they lost as they compete of their degree requirements by the end of their fourth year.but the end of pryor fourth year will not arrive until the spring of or so.accordingly,if she meets the requirement by that time,she will receive her fourth year of athletic eligibility and thereby receive all the requested relief she sought via her ada and rehabilitation act claims.in other words,she will have rendered moot any claim for injunctive relief that would order the ncaa to declare her eligible for a fourth year of intercollegiate soccer.we note too that,at oral argument,plaintiffs counsel stated that pryor is doing well both academically and athletically.this statement only strengthens the likelihood that pryor may not need judicial intervention at all.
therefore,because we can only speculate that pryor may someday lose a fourth year of eligibility based on some future event,the failure to meet of her degree requirements by the end of her fourth year at san jose state,the district court correctly determined that no constitutional standing lies over pryor ada and rehabilitation act claims.consequently,we need not address the substance of pryor claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act.
as stated,plaintiffs complaint and attached exhibits sufficiently allege a claim for purposeful discrimination in the adoption of an otherwise facially neutral policy.in effect,the complaint states that the ncaa purposefully discriminated against black student athletes by adopting a policy with the intent to reduce the number of black athletes who could qualify for athletic scholarship aid.we address this theory first and plaintiffs deliberate indifference theory thereafter.
to recover under title vi or,plaintiffs can not simply assert that proposition has a disproportionate effect on certain minorities.see,stehney perry,cir a facially neutral policy does not violate equal protection solely because of disproportionate effects.as the parties agree,title vi and provide a private cause of action for intentional discrimination only.alexander sandoval,at title vi.contractors pennsylvania,d.
to prove intentional discrimination by a facially neutral policy,a plaintiff must show that the relevant decisionmaker,a state legislature adopted the policy at issue because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.personnel administrator of massachusetts feeney,d accord.contractors,at.a mere awareness of the consequences of an otherwise neutral policy will not suffice.feeney,at.holding that state legislature did not intentionally discriminate against women by enacting laws that gave hiring preferences to veterans even though the legislature was undoubtedly aware that most veterans were men the legislative history underlying these preferences showed that the legislature always intended to offer the veterans preference for any person.
once a plaintiff establishes a discriminatory purpose based on race,the decisionmaker must come forward and try to show that the policy or rule at issue survives strict scrutiny,that it had a compelling interest in using a classification and this classification is narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest.see,shaw reno,d these principles of strict scrutiny apply not only to legislation that contains explicit racial distinctions,but also to those rare statutes that,although race neutral,are,on their face,unexplainable on grounds other than race.quoting arlington heights metro.housing dev,d.racial classifications,well intentioned or not,must survive the burdensome strict scrutiny analysis because absent searching judicial inquiry there is simply no way of determining what classifications are benign or remedial and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.id.quoting richmond croson,d.this appeal involves only whether the ncaa intended to discriminate against black athletes by adopting proposition,not whether that policy survives strict scrutiny.
determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the adoption of a facially neutral policy demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.arlington heights,at.hunt cromartie,d applying the arlington heights criteria to a voting district allegedly drawn along racial lines.although considering evidence of impact would seem to contradict the principle that no claim for disparate impact lies under title vi or,see.contractors,at.it would be anomalous to hold that could be violated only by intentional discrimination and then to find this requirement satisfied by proof that the individual plaintiffs did not enjoy the same right as other citizens and that the defendants merely failed to ensure that the plaintiffs enjoyed employment opportunities equivalent to that of whites,the supreme court has more directly stated that the important starting point for assessing discriminatory purpose is the impact of the official action and whether it bears more heavily on one race than another.arlington heights,at.reno bossier parish school,d.as the court has explained,the impact of an official action is often probative of why the action was taken in the first place since people usually intend the natural consequences of their actions.bossier parish school,at.
other considerations relevant to the purpose inquiry include the historical background of the decision t he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision d epartures from the normal procedural sequence and t he legislative or administrative history,especially any contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body.accord arlington heights,at.owing perhaps to the principle that questions of intent and state of mind are ordinarily not amenable to summary adjudication,see,wright miller,fed.prac.proc,courts have only reluctantly upheld the rule b dismissal of a claim alleging unlawful discrimination in the adoption of an otherwise facially neutral policy.see,stehney perry,cir affirming dismissal of claim challenging a facially neutral policy as discriminatory against women when stehney did not allege that the facially neutral exemption from the polygraph requirement was adopted with the intent to discriminate against women contra hunt cromartie,at.applying arlington heights criteria and vacating summary judgment on claim that state legislature had purposefully drawn voting district along racial lines when competing evidence showed that politics may have motivated the legislature,not race shaw reno,d vacating district court dismissal of challenge to facially neutral action when complaint alleged that the state had deliberately segregated voters into districts on the basis of race without compelling justification see also.contractors,at.reversing findings of purposeful discrimination that a district court rendered after trial feeney,at.upholding findings made after compilation of a record that the massachusetts legislature did not intentionally discriminate against women by enacting laws arlington heights,at.upholding trial court findings that a local housing authority did not purposefully discriminate on the basis of race by denying a facially neutral application to have certain property as housing.
in this case,plaintiffs have stated a claim for purposeful discrimination.as we are reviewing this case at the rule b stage,we may affirm the judgment only if it appears beyond doubt that no set of facts would entitle plaintiffs to relief.see conley gibson,supra.in addition,as the supreme court has recently confirmed,a complaint requires only a short and plain statement to show a right to relief,not a detailed recitation of the proof that will in the end establish such a right.see swierkiewicz sorema,d discussing the requirements of.a for claims alleging intentional discrimination see also.b enumerating specific claims and defenses that require particularized allegations but omitting intentional discrimination as one such claim or defense.malice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.b emphasis added.
here,it does not appear beyond doubt that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege facts showing purposeful discrimination by the ncaa.the complaint and attached exhibits make clear that the ncaa considered race as one of its reasons for adopting proposition,with the ncaa stating explicitly that it believed the adoption of this policy would increase the graduation rates of black athletes relative to white athletes.further,the complaint alleges that the ncaa purposefully discriminated against black student athletes like plaintiffs when it adopted proposition because the ncaa various studies and the heightened academic requirements of proposition would effectively screen out or reduce the percentage of black athletes who could qualify for athletic scholarships.in short,the complaint alleges that the ncaa adopted proposition because it knew that policy would prevent more black athletes from ever receiving athletic scholarship aid in the first place.
citing feeney,at,the district court rejected this theory,holding that the ncaa adopted proposition in spite of its impact on black athletes,not because of that impact.but as shown by the complaint,this is not a case where the ncaa simply realized or otherwise could have guessed that proposition would have had a disparate impact on black athletes.in feeney,after all,the supreme court upheld a policy that favored veterans only after the compilation of a record showed that,yes,the state legislature almost certainly was aware that most military veterans were men and that,as a result,a law expressly benefiting veterans would work to the detriment of women.rather,this is a case where,based on the face of the complaint and all reasonable inferences thereto,the ncaa at least partially intended to reduce the number of black athletes who could attend college on an athletic scholarship by adopting the heightened academic requirements of proposition.and as the exhibits and complaint allege,the ncaa knew of this impact because of the studies informing them about this outcome.see bossier parish school,at.explaining that the impact of an official action bears on the analysis whether a decisionmaker adopted a facially neutral policy for purposes of race,since people usually intend the natural consequences of their actions arlington heights,at.
moreover,unlike feeney and nearly all the other precedents cited by the district court and the parties,the district court drew this distinction between the ncaa awareness and its purpose at the pleading stage,even though issues involving state of mind,intent are often unsuitable for a rule b motion to dismiss.indeed,of all the precedents cited,few have upheld the dismissal of a purposeful discrimination claim for failure to state a claim for relief.in stehney,for example,unlike here,we affirmed the dismissal of a claim for purposeful discrimination,reasoning that the complaint had simply failed to allege that the facially neutral classification at issue was adopted with the intent to discriminate against a protected trait gender.at.but again,liberally construing the allegations,the complaint here conveys that the ncaa adopted proposition because it allegedly wanted to reduce the number of black athletes who could ever become eligible for athletic scholarships.the complaint further suggests that the ncaa stated goal of wanting to improve graduation rates via proposition served as a mere pretext for its actual goal.see pls.compl.
in brown philip morris,meanwhile,we upheld the dismissal of a claim by a class of black smokers alleging that tobacco companies had purposefully discriminated against them in the sale and advertising of tobacco products,cir.there,the complaint did not allege that the tobacco companies had deprived these smokers of the right to contract for,purchase or use their cigarettes indeed,the plaintiffs conceded that the companies sold the same cigarettes on the same terms to black customers as they did to white customers.id.in short,the plaintiffs pointed to no disparities in the companies sales of cigarettes apart from the generalized allegation that are more likely than others to buy tobacco products as a result of targeted advertising.id.at.
here,by contrast,the complaint alleges that the ncaa purposefully adopted a policy because that policy would reduce the number of black athletes who could receive athletic scholarships and compete in intercollegiate athletics as freshmen.further,the complaint indicates that the ncaa knew this policy,proposition,would and has adversely affected black student athletes,not white student athletes,because of the studies that informed them of this outcome.in other words,unlike the complaint in brown,the complaint in this case does sufficiently state facts showing intentional,disparate treatment on account of race.
the ncaa asserts that both the complaint and the exhibits thereto show only that the ncaa intended to help black athletes by adopting proposition,not harm them.in like vein,it claims that precedent from the supreme court,as well as from rulings by other circuit courts,consistently absolve decisionmakers from liability so long as their intent was benign or in the words of plaintiffs counsel in cureton laudable.for two reasons,however,this argument is unconvincing.
first,as explained above,the complaint adequately alleges that the ncaa sought to achieve its stated goal of improving graduation rates by using a system that would exclude more freshmen who,in the past,might have qualified for scholarships.further,as the complaint and other exhibits suggest,the ncaa knew that using this approach would also screen out more black student athletes than white student athletes.so again,one could infer that,because the ncaa knew this,it was actually pursuing its stated goal and adopted means as a way to accomplish this sinister purpose while still seeming laudable and well intentioned.true,at first glance,some might well consider this theory far fetched.but we are reviewing this case at the pleading stage,not the summary judgment stage.further,two allegations and the exhibits supporting them support the theory of the complaint the ncaa openly considered race in formulating proposition and it had reason to know that the adoption of proposition would lead to the greater exclusion of black athletes from receiving college athletic scholarships.
again,one may doubt that the ncaa harbored such ill motives.after all,many ncaa schools have long engaged in fierce recruiting contests to obtain the best high school athletes in the country,many of whom are black.and in today world of collegiate athletics,better athletes can translate into more revenues and exposure for the schools that sign them.on the other hand,racial discrimination is nearly always irrational and thus,in the words of the supreme court,odious to our nation principles of equality.see,adarand constructors,pena,d citations omitted.further,neither our court nor the district court can render findings in this least not yet.and findings of fact,of course,turn on evidence,not on one speculations about the issue.nothing in our decision today precludes either summary judgment or trial findings that conclude the ncaa did not intend to discriminate on the basis of race.
second,even assuming the ncaa assertion that it had only laudable goals in adopting proposition and that it actually wanted only to improve graduation rates among black student athletes,the ncaa has cited no authority holding that a claim for purposeful discrimination may lie only if the accused decisionmaker had bad intentions or animus.quite the contrary.the court has squarely held that,or not,express or neutral on its face,a law or policy that purposefully discriminates on account of race is presumptively invalid and can survive only if it withstands strict scrutiny review.see adarand,at.strict scrutiny applied to federal government system of giving financial incentives to general contractors who used financially disadvantaged subcontractors when the system also created via statute a presumption that certain racial groups qualified as financially disadvantaged croson,at.holding that the standard of review under the equal protection clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification and that the single standard of review for racial classifications is strict scrutiny see also california bd.of regents bakke,d concluding in plurality opinion that programs designed to benefit minorities must withstand strict scrutiny t he guarantee of equal protection can not mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color and r acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination accord wygant jackson bd.of,d.as one court has put it when the government or other decisionmaker,the ncaa prefers individuals on account of their race or gender,it correspondingly disadvantages individuals who fortuitously belong to another race or to the other gender.coalition for economic equity wilson,cir upholding statute barring the adoption of any policies or laws by the state that would favor one race or gender over another.the persuasive authority cited by the ncaa d
