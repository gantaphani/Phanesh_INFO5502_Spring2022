opinion of the court 
this employment discrimination action is presented as a modern rendition of the parable of a son being punished for the sins of his father the father,sterril fogleman,had been an employee of defendant mercy hospital,mercy for seventeen years before leaving the hospital in.in an action separate from this case,sterril sued mercy claiming that he had been forced out of his job due to age and disability discrimination.sterril son greg fogleman,who is the plaintiff in the case at bar,also worked for mercy,being employed as a security guard for eighteen years before his termination in.although mercy claims to have fired greg for valid reasons,greg asserts that these reasons were pretextual,and that the real reasons for his firing relate to his father legal action against mercy.
greg sued mercy under the provisions of three civil rights laws the americans with disabilities act ada,the age discrimination in employment act adea,and the pennsylvania human relations act phra,alleging three theories of illegal retaliation.greg first theory of illegal discrimination is that he was fired in retaliation for his father having sued mercy for disability and age discrimination.second,greg claims that mercy violated the laws by terminating him because it thought that he was assisting his father with his lawsuit even if,in actuality,he was not.third,greg alleges that he was fired for refusing to cooperate with mercy in the investigation of his father claim.the district court granted summary judgment to mercy on all of greg claims,concluding that none of his theories of illegal retaliation was supported by the language of the ada,adea or phra.
in reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to greg first claim,we are called upon to determine whether the provisions of the ada,adea,and phra prohibit an employer from taking adverse employment action against a third party in retaliation for another protected activity.the ada,adea,and phra contain nearly identical provisions that prohibit discrimination against any individual because such individual has engaged in protected activity.a d.d.although we recognize that allowing an employer to retaliate against a third party with impunity can interfere with the overall purpose of the laws,we believe that by referring to such individual,the plain text of these statutes clearly prohibits only retaliation against the actual person who engaged in protected activity.
unlike the adea and phra,however,the ada contains an additional provision that makes it unlawful for an employer to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any individual exercising rights protected under the act.b.we conclude that under this provision,which contains language similar to that of a section of the national labor relations act nlra,a,that we have interpreted as recognizing retaliation claims,greg claim that he was retaliated against for his father protected activity is valid as a matter of law,and we will therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment.
we also believe that greg perception theory of illegal he was fired because mercy thought that he was engaged in protected activity,even if he actually was a valid legal claim.because the statutes forbid an employer taking adverse action against an employee for discriminatory reasons,it does not matter whether the factual basis for the employer discriminatory animus was correct and that,so long as the employer specific intent was discriminatory,the retaliation is actionable.accordingly,we will reverse the court grant of summary judgment on greg perception claim of retaliation.we discuss these first two theories in the text,infra.greg other theory of illegal he was fired for refusing to cooperate with mercy in the investigation of his father plainly without merit and we dispose of it in the margin 
facts and procedural history 
members of the fogleman family have a long history of employment at mercy hospital.the plaintiff,greg fogleman,began working for mercy as a security officer in.in mercy named him supervisor of security,a post he held until his termination in.greg wife,michelle,also worked for mercy for a few years in the late and early,and greg mother was an employee at mercy until her retirement in may.but the story of this litigation begins with greg father,sterril fogleman,who began working at mercy in as an engineer and remained on the staff for years,until,when the hospital offered him a choice between accepting a demotion or leaving the hospital.sterril chose to leave,and suspected that mercy had pushed him out due to his advancing age and his recent loss of sight in one eye.
in june,after satisfying the administrative prerequisites,sterril sued mercy for illegal discrimination in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.just before trial was to begin,in july,the parties settled and the case was dismissed.greg asserts that he did not participate in any way in sterril complaints or lawsuit.
shortly after sterril filed his lawsuit in federal court,martin everhart,mercy vice president of human resources,circulated a memorandum to top mercy officials offering a brief explanation of why,in the hospital opinion,sterril claim was meritless.the memo acknowledged that commenting on sterril lawsuit during its pendency was done at some risk as we continue to have relatives of fogleman employed by mercy and open ourselves up to further public exposure particularly through newspapers as this document may be shared that way.greg submits that this language indicates that mercy considered him a risk because of his father lawsuit.he also asserts that everhart was a bit colder to him after the circulation of this memo.as described in note,supra,greg also avers that a representative of,michael questioned him about the status of his father lawsuit in an attempt to pry information out of him to aid the hospital in its defense.
on september,greg was involved in an incident at the hospital gift shop that ultimately provided the claims for mercy termination of his employment.greg claims that he used a spare key to enter the hospital gift shop that morning to check on the of an elderly woman,audrey oeller,who worked there as a volunteer.greg avers that his job description authorized him to enter the shop additionally,his supervisor testified that before this incident greg routinely entered the shop to check on oeller.
the hospital,in contrast,asserts that greg had no authority to enter the gift shop at any time,and that his entry was in violation of hospital rules.moreover,the hospital represents that it was troubled by oeller conflicting account of greg reasons for entering the shop.according to oeller,greg told her that he entered the shop to check on the sprinkler system at the request of maintenance supervisor dave searfoss.searfoss,however,related to the hospital that he had never made any such request of greg.according to mercy,greg also violated hospital policy by failing to report the incident to anyone until questioned about it,failing to request assistance,failing to document the incident until directed to do so,and failing to report the taking of the key to the gift shop from a secure maintenance department room.
on september,the hospital suspended greg with pay in the wake of the gift shop incident pending further investigation.greg claims that he was told that he would not receive a final determination on his employment status until september,which was also the same day that his father was to be deposed for his federal lawsuit against mercy.although it appears that no actual investigation took place before september,greg was fired on that day,allegedly for reasons related to the gift shop incident.greg avers that his termination was in violation of the hospital progressive discipline policy.other employees,greg contends,were punished less severely for far more egregious infractions.
greg sued mercy in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania alleging violations of the ada,the adea,and the phra.mercy moved for summary judgment on these claims,and the district court granted the motion,concluding that the statutes did not allow a plaintiff to sue on the theory that he had suffered a discharge in retaliation for protected activity engaged in by another person,even if that other person was a close relative.the court rejected greg alternative theories,concluding that they were unsupported by the statutory language.this timely appeal followed.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we set forth the familiar standard of review for grants of summary judgment in the margin 
ii.the relevant provisions 
greg alleges that his termination violated the provisions of the ada,the adea,and the phra.the ada provision states 
no person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this chapter.
a.the adea and phra contain nearly identical provisions,which we quote in the margin 
because the provisions of the ada and adea are nearly identical,as is the provision of title vii,we have held that precedent interpreting any one of these statutes is equally relevant to interpretation of the others.see krouse american sterilizer,cir.the language of the phra is also substantially similar to these provisions,and we have held that the phra is to be interpreted as identical to federal laws except where there is something specifically different in its language requiring that it be treated differently.see dici commonwealth of pennsylvania,cir.there is no argument made by either party that the phra should be interpreted any differently from federal law in this case.for purposes of this appeal,therefore,we will interpret the provisions of the ada,adea,and phra cited above as applying identically in this case and governed by the same set of precedents.
in addition to the provision cited above,the ada has a further provision not found in the adea and the phra.that provision reads 
it shall be unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by this chapter.
usc b.as will appear,this provision,in light of its similarity to language in the nlra,see a,is critical to the outcome of this case.
before analyzing each of greg theories of illegal discrimination,we note that in order to establish a prima facie case of illegal retaliation under the statutes,a plaintiff must show protected employee activity adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee protected activity and a causal connection between the employee protected activity and the employer adverse action.krouse,at.because the district court concluded that greg failed to satisfy the first prong with respect to his theories of relief,it never addressed the adverse employment action and causation prongs of his retaliation claims.consequently,we do not address those issues here on appeal in the first instance.rather,we consider only the district court treatment of the protected activity prongs of greg claims.
iii.greg third party retaliation claim 
in arguing that mercy unlawfully retaliated against greg for the protected activity of his father,greg maintains that as a matter of statutory construction,the provisions are violated even if the person retaliated against did not himself engage in protected conduct.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has filed an amicus brief in support of this position.mercy responds that the provisions only prohibit retaliation against a person who himself engaged in protected activity.
in determining whether retaliation against a person who has not himself engaged in protected conduct is actionable,we first consider the ada,a,adea,d,and phra.d,each of which contains similar language prohibiting retaliation.we have yet to decide squarely whether these provisions make actionable retaliation against someone who has not himself engaged in protected conduct.among the other courts that have addressed the issue no consensus has emerged.some courts have answered the question definitively in the,a plaintiff may not present an claim without personally participating in protected activity.see,smith riceland foods,cir holt jtm,cir.but other courts have expressly acknowledged the viability of retaliation claims.see,eeoc nalbandian sales,d,de medina reinhardt.
the plain text of the provisions requires that the person retaliated against also be the person who engaged in the protected activity each statute forbids discrimination against an individual because such individual has engaged in protected conduct.by their own terms,then,the statutes do not make actionable discrimination against an employee who has not engaged in protected activity.read literally,the statutes are,it is hard to imagine a clearer way of specifying that the individual who was discriminated against must also be the individual who engaged in protected activity.furthermore,although there is no third circuit opinion squarely deciding the issue,the language of our opinions has at times reflected this literal understanding of the statute.for instance,in kachmar sungard data,cir,we stated that i n order to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory retaliation,the plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected activity id.at emphasis added.
nevertheless,greg and the eeoc are correct that a literal reading of the provisions is at odds with the policies animating those provisions.the provisions recognize that enforcement of laws depends in large part on employees to initiate administrative and judicial proceedings.there can be no doubt that an employer who retaliates against the friends and relatives of employees who initiate proceedings will deter employees from exercising their protected rights.indeed,as the seventh circuit sagely observed,to retaliate against a man by hurting a member of his family is an ancient method of revenge,and is not unknown in the field of labor relations.nlrb advertisers,cir.allowing employers to retaliate via friends and family,therefore,would appear to be in significant tension with the overall purpose of the provisions,which are intended to promote the reporting,investigation,and correction of discriminatory conduct in the workplace.see de medina.at concluding that tolerance of reprisals would,no less than the tolerance of direct reprisals,deter persons from exercising their rights under title vii.
this case,therefore,presents a conflict between a statute plain meaning and its general policy objectives.in general,this conflict ought to be resolved in favor of the statute plain meaning.see caminetti united states.it is elementary that the meaning of a statute must,in the first instance,be sought in the language in which the act is framed,and if that is plain the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.the preference for plain meaning is based on the constitutional separation of makes the law and the judiciary interprets it.in doing so we generally assume that the best evidence of congress intent is what it says in the texts of the statutes.see norman singer,statutes and statutory construction,ed.
to be sure,however,there are cases in which a blind adherence to the literal meaning of a statute would lead to a patently absurd result that no rational legislature could have intended.following the letter,rather than the spirit,of the law in such cases would go against the court role of construing statutes to effectuate the legislature intent.see united states schneider,cir it is the obligation of the court to construe a statute to avoid absurd results,if alternative interpretations are available and consistent with the legislative purpose.we do not believe,however,that this is such a case.although we think,as explained above,that recognizing retaliation claims is more consistent with the purpose of the statutes,we can not say that prohibiting such
