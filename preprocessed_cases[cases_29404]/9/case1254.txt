plaintiffs timothy bryant et,who were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct during a large public event,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,lawrence mckenna,judge,dismissing their second amended complaint complaint alleging principally that defendants city of new york the city,its police department,mayor,and certain police officers and officials violated plaintiffs rights under federal and state law in connection with plaintiffs arrests and postarrest processing.plaintiffs asserted,inter alia,that their due process rights were violated by defendants failure to release them shortly after their arrests.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing the constitutional claims,finding chiefly that the due process claims were untenable because plaintiffs had failed to show either a a protected liberty interest,or b if such an interest existed,any impact on that interest sufficient to create an issue of constitutional dimension.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims.on appeal,plaintiffs contend principally that the district court erred in assessing their due process claims.defendants contend,inter alia,that plaintiffs claims of undue delays in being released from custody should be analyzed under the fourth amendment rather than under more general principles of due process,but that the claims can not survive analysis under either framework.for the reasons that follow,we agree with defendants that the fourth amendment provides the proper analytical framework for those claims and that they were properly dismissed.
background 
this case arises out of a held in new york city on the evening of monday,october,to protest violence complaint and honor the memory of matthew shepard,a gay college student who had been murdered in wyoming id.one week earlier.the event shepard demonstration was scheduled to begin with a gathering at approximately at the intersection of street and fifth avenue the participants were to march down the sidewalk on fifth avenue from street to madison square park,located between and streets,where the shepard demonstration would conclude with speeches.
most of the plaintiffs were participants in the event.they were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct when they walked or stood in the roadway and failed to return to the sidewalk when ordered to do so by police officers most were taken to a police station all were held overnight,or at least until after midnight,and then released.none were convicted.
to the extent pertinent to this appeal,the details as to these events are not in dispute except as indicated below,having been a asserted principally in defendants statement of undisputed facts pursuant to local rule defendants stmt.submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment,and not disputed in accordance with that rule by plaintiffs rule statement in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment plaintiffs opp.stmt.or b asserted by plaintiffs in a rule statement submitted in support of a for summary judgment in plaintiffs favor on certain of their claims plaintiffs stmt.and not disputed by defendants.we view the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,as the parties against whom summary judgment was granted.
a.the march 
it was anticipated that the shepard on october would be attended by some persons.no permit was obtained see defendants stmt,as i t was understood that the walk was to be a sidewalk march plaintiffs opp.stmt,and n o permit is required for a sidewalk march id.
as it turned out,however,by the end of the evening the rally and march had attracted some participants.see defendants stmt.plaintiffs opp.stmt.initially,police officers had been assigned to the shepard demonstration as the number of participants grew,and overflowed the sidewalks,some police officers were mobilized for.see defendants stmt,plaintiffs opp.stmt.after the marchers began to pour down fifth avenue,the police erected barricades,diverting the marchers west on street one block to avenue of the americas,then south to street,and then east one block to fifth avenue where they again were allowed to proceed south.
according to defendants,who presented a videotape of the event to support their assertions,uniformed police officers made announcements to the crowd by use of bullhorn loud speakers.those announcements included statements that the participants were required to remain on the sidewalks and were not allowed to walk on or remain in the roadway that if the participants remained on the sidewalks they would be escorted to madison square park and that persons who remained in the roadway would be arrested.see defendants stmt.in response to these rule assertions,plaintiffs stated only that several plaintiffs did not hear the announcements that they should stay on the sidewalk and would be arrested if they failed to do so.see plaintiffs opp.stmt.
supported by additional citations to the videotape,defendants asserted that despite the police announcements,a large group of participants entered the roadway at fifth avenue and street,locked arms,and obstructed traffic that demonstrators were encouraging each other to enter the roadway that one demonstrator with a bullhorn told other participants,if you are willing to take arrests,please move into the street that many individuals then sat down in the roadway that demonstrators in the street chanted,who street our street and take the streets that at that time,persons who remained in the roadway were arrested and that during the time that police officers were attempting to arrest persons who initially went into the roadway,the remaining thousands of demonstrators flooded the street and proceeded to march down fifth avenue.defendants stmt.in response to these assertions,plaintiffs stated that none of the plaintiffs engaged in this conduct,but they did not dispute that such conduct occurred as described.see plaintiffs opp.stmt.
the parties disputed whether there was vehicular traffic on fifth avenue south of street.defendants asserted that the crowds walking in the roadway interfered with vehicular traffic,caused significant safety hazards to the occupants of numerous vehicles,including cars,trucks,and public buses,and caused significant delays and disruptions to the flow of traffic in and around midtown manhattan.see defendants stmt.plaintiffs asserted that there was no vehicular traffic on fifth avenue south of street because fifth avenue had been blocked by the police at street.see plaintiffs opp.stmt.
b.the arrests of the plaintiffs 
in the course of the shepard demonstration,people,including the seven named plaintiffs,were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.see defendants stmt.plaintiffs opp.statement.the six plaintiffs other than leonard gay were arrested as they stood or walked in the street.although those six contended that they either were approaching a sidewalk when arrested,or that there was no room on the sidewalk,or that there were impediments to their reaching the sidewalk,there is no dispute that,when arrested,they were in a roadway.see,defendants stmt.bryant,jessica dyson,maurice cassidy,joseph defilippis,robert takacs,ulrik trojaborg corresponding paragraphs of plaintiffs opp.stmt.

gay joined the march late,attended part of the rally at madison square park,and then began to leave the area.he stopped near fifth avenue and street to observe what appeared to be the recording of a television interview.police officers repeatedly asked gay to step away from the press area.when he refused after the final request,he was arrested.see defendants stmt.gay contended that no one told him he was in a restricted area,plaintiffs opp.stmt.gay was arrested at approximately,charged with two counts of disorderly conduct,and held in a cell until he was taken to criminal court the next morning.see defendants stmt.he was arraigned and then released at approximately see defendants stmt.plaintiffs opp.stmt.gay received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal in april the charges against him were dismissed on october.see plaintiffs stmt.
c.the present action 
plaintiffs commenced the present action under in november and filed their second amended complaint in january,asserting claims of,inter alia,false arrest,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,assault,battery,use of unreasonable force,and violations of their rights under the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.their principal constitutional contention was that defendants deprived them of substantive due process by not releasing them sooner pursuant to a new york criminal procedure law provision that gives a police officer discretion in certain cases to issue a desk appearance ticket dat to an arrestee rather than holding him or her in custody until a judge is available to conduct an arraignment.under this procedure,the arrestee is released and must return to the criminal court at a future date for arraignment.see.proc.law,mckinney.the complaint alleged that 
those plaintiffs who were formally charged with a crime or violation,to wit,bryant,dyson,gay and others were deprived of desk appearance tickets by defendants despite their eligibility for same.these deprivations were arbitrary,capricious and discriminatory and were predicated on plaintiffs actual or perceived participation in the aforesaid rally.as a consequence of defendants denials to the aforesaid plaintiffs of desk appearance tickets,said plaintiffs were needlessly incarcerated and otherwise detained overnight 
complaint.the complaint alleged that the wholesale denial of dats was pursuant to an official municipal policy,custom and usage id.and that the denials deprived plaintiffs of their rights to a freedom of expression,b the rights to assemble peaceably,to petition for redress of grievances and to be free of unreasonable seizures,c the equal protection of the laws and d liberty and property without due process of law id.
after a period of discovery,defendants moved pursuant to.for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.in support of their motion they submitted,inter alia,the videotape of the event,adverted to in part above,as evidence of the nature of the event.with respect to the denial of dats,defendants relied on the deposition testimony of louis anemone,who was the city police chief at the time of the shepard demonstration and was in command of the police operation on the night of the event.
anemone testified that,although he did not know for certain whether he had ordered that none of the arrestees be issued dats deposition of louis anemone anemone dep.at,he surmised,based on his past practices,that he had given such an order see id.at.such an order would have been warranted by the arrestees actions during the course of the demonstration their violation of police direction and their actions to endanger the public safety.id.at.anemone stated that 
t he group,from my perspective,was a violent mob.it was out of control.there was very little leadership,or any,that anyone on the police side could detect.so it the worst kind of a group to be handling and dealing with in an unrestrained manner to me it was crystal clear that they should not be given the privilege of a desk appearance ticket because this would probably end up becoming a bigger problem for us later on that evening 
id.at.anemone testified that officers on the scene had indicated to him that the persons arrested were very likely to continue to engage in the actions for which they had been arrested.id.at.by holding the arrestees rather than immediately releasing them,the police department was able to assure that this hundred and fifteen of the most violent members of the crowd were kept under control.id.at.
anemone also testified that a number of people resisted arrest.although it may not have caused an injury on the part of the police officer,force was needed to affect sic those arrests.each one of those situations presents a possibility of additional violence or injuries.id.at.he noted that two officers had been injured already.id.at.
in addition,anemone testified that a dat requires considerably more paperwork than the normal processing of an arrestee see id.at and that the arresting officer must be present for the completion of the dat paperwork see id.at.in contrast,if the arrestee is processed normally t he officer can be quickly redeployed back to the street if you using a desk appearance ticket process,the officer is lost to the commander on the street while he engaged in this process.id.thus,one consequence of using dats during an ongoing demonstration is a potential diminution of police ability to maintain order.see id at.
anemone also believed that the arrest and arraignment process are sic frustrated by the use of dats b ecause many of those people issued desk appearance tickets never show up on their return date.warrants end up being issued.at one point we had over a hundred thousand active warrants in the id.at.
in a memorandum and order dated december,see bryant city of new york,wl,bryant i,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs federal claims.to the extent pertinent to this appeal,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims that their rights to due process had been violated by defendants failure to issue dats,ruling that,for two reasons,plaintiffs had not demonstrated that a constitutional violation took place.bryant i,wl,at.first,the court found that an arrestee is not entitled to a dat as a matter of right 
new york state law does not create a protected right in the issuance of a desk appearance ticket its issuance is purely discretionary.under new york law,a defendant has no constitutional or statutory right to a dat,and a police officer who has arrested a defendant for a misdemeanor may choose instead to retain custody of the defendant until his arraignment in a local criminal court 
in this case,the plaintiffs suggest that because they met the criteria set forth in the regulations for issuing desk appearance tickets,the police should have issued them.at the very least,they argue the decision was 
but t he statute governing the issuance of desk appearance tickets has no mandatory language whenever a police officer is authorized to arrest a person without a warrant,he may issue to and serve upon such person an appearance ticket.proc.law emphasis added both parties agree that plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected right to due process before being deprived of their liberty.defendants argue,however,that this right attaches to the arrest as a whole,and not solely to a discretionary procedure designed to ease the burden on the court and corrections system the court agrees.

second,the court found that even if plaintiffs had been entitled to dats
