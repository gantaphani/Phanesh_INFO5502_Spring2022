plaintiff maria díaz bigio,who was a medical social worker at the health department of san juan,puerto rico,brought this suit against the municipality of san juan and several city officials under,alleging that they fired her in retaliation for statements she made on matters of public concern in violation of the first amendment.her complaint requested reinstatement and monetary damages.before us is an interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of summary judgment to the individual defendants in their personal capacities on grounds of qualified immunity.
díaz bigio made statements in august accusing the executive director of the health department of having a serious conflict of interest.in both print and radio media,she alleged that he had economic interests in companies and a medical group that had been given health department contracts.the city immediately investigated these charges,and díaz bigio was twice issued a summons to provide testimony in support of her allegations,but she refused to do so.after the investigation concluded that the charges were false and groundless,the city notified díaz bigio that it intended to terminate her employment and that she had the right to an administrative hearing on the issue.after that hearing on december,in which she again declined to testify,she was fired.the letter of termination informed her that in making false and groundless allegations against the executive director of the health department and failing to comply with the summons to appear before the body investigating her allegations,she had broken several laws and regulations governing her obligations as a public employee.
the question before us is whether the undisputed facts of the record demonstrate that a reasonable public official could have concluded that terminating díaz bigio employment in these circumstances would not violate her first amendment rights.the answer to this question determines whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.the district court concluded that they are not.díaz bigio municipality of san juan,wl.we reverse and direct entry of judgment for defendants in their individual capacities on grounds of qualified immunity.
a claim of qualified immunity demands deference to the objectively reasonable beliefs and actions of the defendants as to the constitutionality of their actions,even if the beliefs are mistaken.ashcroft,d.the summary judgment standard requires that reasonable inferences be drawn in díaz bigio favor,as long they are based on facts that are put forward on personal knowledge or otherwise documented by materials of evidentiary quality.morelli webster,cir.we identify the version of events that best comports with the summary judgment standard and then ask whether,given that set of facts,a reasonable officer should have known that his actions were unlawful.id.at.
on august,díaz bigio,apparently acting as the president of the brotherhood of health employees,made statements during a demonstration in front of san juan puerto nuevo health plus center.in radio interviews and statements to newspapers,díaz bigio accused the executive director of san juan health department,defendant alfredo escalera,of having economic interests in a medical group that had a contract with the center and in private companies that provided emergency room,laboratory,and dental services to the center.díaz bigio further alleged that this conflict of interest was responsible for differences in the quality of the conditions in different areas of the hospital to the benefit of escalera.
in an interview on wapa radio,díaz bigio stated that the air conditioning works in the areas of the hospital that escalera has privatized which is the emergency room,laboratory,x rays and dental areas,but that in the areas under san juan municipal control,that are not generating money for escalera,it is not working.when asked,is it not generating money for the health plus center she responded,no,it is generating money for escalera.this allegation was also reported in the el vocero newspaper,which quoted díaz bigio as saying that the emergency room,laboratory,and dental area of the center have air conditioning and are in good condition because they belong to the san juan vice mayor and health medical director,alfredo escalera.
díaz bigio also stated,in an interview on radio puerto rico,that escalera is the owner of the emergency rooms,and when a reporter asked what proof she had of this,she told the reporter to look in the records of corporations registered with the puerto rico state department.she said,you make the search,i tell you what there is,but when asked for the name of the corporation recorded with the state department,she responded i do know,i ca tell you that the owner is alfredo escalera.if with a group it as if it were an ipa.
díaz bigio repeated her allegations in a press conference on september.as reported the following day in the el nuevo dia newspaper maria díaz bigio said that escalera owns the mpl,but when she was asked to substantiate the accusations,she declined to do so.this article also reported that the executive director of the brotherhood was more cautious and underscored that although he could not accuse escalera of having a contractual relation with the privatizing entity,he did allege that he had some type of economic ties with that company.
on august,the day after díaz bigio first made her accusations against escalera,the mayor of san juan,defendant jorge santini,ordered san juan internal auditing office to initiate an internal investigation to determine whether the allegations were true.the investigation was overseen by defendant elmer saurí santiago,the director of the internal auditing office,who explained in a report to the mayor that the investigation was carried out in accordance with generally accepted governmental rules and procedures in current auditing practices,using a methodology that included obtaining statements under oath from the implicated parties and reviewing pertinent documentary evidence.
several sources of documents were considered in the investigation.records in the state department were reviewed to identify the directors and officers of the medical group operating at the center.although díaz bigio had claimed that this would show that the group was controlled by escalera,the investigation found that escalera was not among the group directors or officers during the relevant time period.the medical group contract with the center was also reviewed to determine when the contractual relationship originated and to identify the executing parties.the investigation found that escalera was not an original party and that the relationship originated before escalera was a member of the cabinet of the municipal administration.finally,a certified report from the collections and revenue office showed that the city,and not escalera,was receiving the payments from the center emergency room,laboratory,and dental services.
the internal auditing office also obtained statements under oath from escalera,the contractors in the privatized medical service areas,and the administrator and director of the center,none of which provided any support for díaz bigio allegations.
díaz bigio was aware that her claims against escalera were under investigation.on august,and again on august,she was issued a summons to appear at the internal auditing office to make a statement under oath about everything that she knew regarding her allegations,but she did not comply,despite express instructions to do so from her supervisor.she did not comply with the first summons because it requested that she appear three hours after it was served and her attorney and union representative were unavailable.she wrote a letter requesting that the appearance be rescheduled and that she be given more notice.for the second summons,she appeared at the requested time at the internal auditing office accompanied by her attorney and a representative from the brotherhood.when she was told that she needed to go into the office alone,however,she declined to do so and left without providing a statement 
on september,defendant saurí santiago provided a report on the investigation findings to the mayor.summarizing the evidence described above,he explained that the investigation was able to determine that there is insufficient competent and relevant evidence to validate the expressions that were made by maria díaz bigio to the press.he stated that the investigation concluded that díaz bigio allegations are lacking in grounds,and that this was based on evidence and testimony that we consider to be competent,sufficient and relevant.the report concluded with recommendations that the mayor send a copy of the report to the puerto rico governmental ethics office,which was investigating the same matter,and that the director of human resources for the municipality of san juan evaluate the report so that appropriate action could be taken.
on september,the director of human resources,defendant martiza aguilar jusino,sent a letter to díaz bigio notifying her that the city intended to terminate her employment and that she had a right to a hearing.the letter summarized the allegations that díaz bigio had made against escalera and informed her that based on an analysis of the documents and testimony,her allegations were found to be false and groundless.it explained that she had obstructed the internal auditing office investigation by failing to comply with express instructions to appear and provide a statement in support of her allegations.the letter also explained that in making these groundless allegations of conflict of interest and failing to respond to the internal auditing office summons,díaz bigio had violated several provisions of the laws and regulations defining the duties and obligations of san juan employees,including the governmental ethics regulation and the san juan municipal conduct and disciplinary actions regulation.these regulations require that employees not take actions that will adversely affect the trust of the public in the integrity and honesty of governmental institutions,that they not make false or defamatory averments against other employees,supervisors,directors or against the nominating authority,and that they appear at a citation or summons for an administrative procedure hearing or for an investigation.noting that díaz bigio had been subject to earlier disciplinary actions in and,including a suspension for days without pay,the letter explained that her reiterated pattern of conduct that violates the disciplinary rules applicable to the employees of the municipality of san juan constitutes a breach of labor peace and the defamatory and vicious nature of the accusations justifies the filing of new charges.
on december,the administrative hearing on díaz bigio termination was held.díaz bigio was present with counsel,but refused to present any testimony or evidence on her behalf.she stated she would not do so,on advice of counsel,because the governmental ethics office was in an ongoing investigation of escalera alleged conflict of interest.
while the outcome of that hearing was pending,the puerto rico governmental ethics office issued a summons for díaz bigio to attend an interview on june,stating that she must bring any documents,papers,or other tangible things containing evidence that supported her allegations against escalera.it is unclear whether she provided the office with any such evidence.in her deposition for this case,díaz bigio stated that she could not remember whether she brought any evidence.she also made an admission that she never had any documents to sustain her allegations and that the allegations were made relying on information received at the brotherhood.
in a letter dated june,san juan secretary for administration,defendant jorge colomer montes,informed díaz bigio that she was being dismissed from her position in conformity with the recommendation of the administrative panel after the hearing.this letter reiterated the grounds for dismissal that were listed in the september,letter from defendant aguilar jusino.
after díaz bigio was dismissed,the puerto rico governmental ethics office completed its investigation of her august claims that escalera acted with a conflict of interest.it found that díaz bigio allegations were groundless and concluded that escalera did not have an economic interest in said companies or a contractual relationship in this matter.
none of these facts are disputed by díaz bigio.
in general,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable,but a denial of qualified immunity may be appealed to the extent the decision is a purely legal one.rodríguez rodríguez ortiz vélez,cir.we have jurisdiction to decide whether díaz bigio own version of events together with uncontested facts entitles the defendant s to immunity.id.at see also valdizán rivera hernandez,cir t he court of appeals retains jurisdiction to entertain an immediate appeal in situations in which the district court assumes a set of facts and decides,as a matter of law,that those facts will not support a qualified immunity defense.quoting camilo robles hoyos,cir.
qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects public officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d internal quotation marks omitted.it provides immunity from suit and not a mere defense to liability.maldonado fontanes,cir.
under pearson,we follow a analysis for determining whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,asking whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged violation.id.at see also.at.the second prong,in turn,has two parts a whether the legal contours of the right in question were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would have understood that what he was doing violated that right,and b whether the particular factual violation in question would have been clear to a reasonable official.decotiis whittemore,cir.the salient question is whether the state of the law at the time gave a defendant clear notice that what he was doing was unconstitutional.id.at quoting costa urena segarra,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
unlawfulness must be apparent at the time of the alleged violation in the light of law.anderson creighton,d.immunity exists even where the abstract right invoked by the plaintiff is,so long as the official could reasonably have believed on the facts that no violation existed.dirrane brookline police dep t,cir.although the supreme court has made clear that municipal officers can be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,hope pelzer,d,it has also stressed that qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.at quoting malley briggs,d.
a right is clearly established and immunity will not issue only if every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at quoting anderson,at emphasis added.if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the lawfulness of the action,they are entitled to immunity.malley,at.
b.the first amendment 
although this case is about qualified immunity,we start with the general requirements of a first amendment retaliation claim by a public employee.the law is settled that as a general matter the first amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for speaking out,hartman moore,d but this prohibition is not absolute.i n recognition of the government interest in running an effective workplace,the protection that public employees enjoy against reprisals is qualified.decotiis,at quoting mercado berrios cancel alegría,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also rivera jiménez pierluisi,cir.three requirements must be met to make out a claim of unconstitutional retaliation in public employee speech cases.decotiis,at.
first,the employee must have been speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.garcetti ceballos,d.otherwise,the employee has no first amendment cause of action based on his or her employer reaction to the speech.see also snyder phelps,d s peech on matters of public concern is at the heart of the first amendment protection.alteration in original quoting dun bradstreet,greenmoss builders,d.
second,under the balancing test of pickering board of education,d,the employee first amendment interests in the speech must outweigh the government interests as an employer in avoiding disruption in the workplace.rivera jiménez,at.this balancing test is necessary in order to accommodate the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the first amendment.rankin mcpherson,d.
third,the employee must meet the burden of producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that his constitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor behind his dismissal.acevedo diaz aponte,cir see also guilloty perez pierluisi,cir.
if an employee succeeds in establishing this causal relationship,an employer can still defeat the claim by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the governmental agency would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.quoting healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.these two criteria the but for causation test and the healthy defense ensure that a who would have been dismissed in any event on legitimate grounds is not placed in a better position merely by virtue of the exercise of a constitutional right irrelevant to the adverse employment action.acevedo diaz aponte,cir see also healthy,at.
c.the termination of díaz bigio employment 
assuming arguendo that the facts alleged by díaz bigio set forth a claim of a first amendment violation,we turn to the second prong of pearson and ask whether a reasonably competent city official could have thought that he or she would not violate the first amendment by terminating díaz bigio employment given the circumstances of the case where the city investigated díaz bigio much publicized allegations of serious improprieties by the executive director of her department,where she refused to provide testimony or evidence to corroborate her claims,where the investigation determined that the claims were false and baseless,and where her actions were found to violate state and local regulations.
under a long line of cases from this circuit granting qualified immunity,the defendants are entitled to summary judgment because the outcome of the pickering balancing of interests in this case was not so clear as to put all reasonable officials on notice that firing díaz bigio would violate the law.reasonable officials could well have concluded there was no first amendment violation on these facts.see,philip cronin,cir administrator of medical examiner office could have reasonably believed that firing an examiner who had sent letters to the governor criticizing procedures used in office would not violate first amendment when there were other complaints about his conduct wagner city of holyoke,cir police officials could have reasonably believed that firing sergeant who made public allegations of corruption and discrimination in police department would not violate first amendment when sergeant had,in doing so,disregarded confidentiality protocols and bypassed chain of command fabiano hopkins,cir city officials could have reasonably believed that firing city attorney who filed pro se suit alleging improper variance renewal by city zoning board of appeal would not violate first amendment,even though city eventually admitted allegations truth,when lawsuit created potential conflict of interest dirrane,at,police officials could have reasonably believed that transferring an officer who had made complaints about the falsification and destruction of fingerprint reports would not violate first amendment under circumstances of case steeves,cir town selectman could have reasonably believed that firing employee who had publicly accused selectman of personal use of town funds would not violate first amendment even though allegations truth was undisputed,as outcome of pickering balance was unclear.
as we have previously highlighted,w e and other circuits have noted that the pickering balancing is subtle,yet difficult to apply,and not yet well defined,and that,consequently,only in the extraordinary case will it have been clearly established that a public employee speech merited constitutional protection.jordan carter,cir citation omitted quoting pike osborne,cir see also brewster board of,cir listing cases.
indeed,two years before díaz bigio termination,this court held in fabiano that b ecause pickering constitutional rule turns upon a balancing test,it can rarely be considered clearly established for qualified immunity purposes.fabiano,at quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,in frazier bailey,cir,we held that if the existence of a right or the degree of protection it warrants in a particular context is subject to a balancing test,the right can rarely be considered clearly established,at least in the absence of closely corresponding factual or legal precedent.id.at quoting myers morris,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the case before us in which an investigation concluded that there was no basis for díaz bigio very serious allegations of impropriety and is not the exceptional case in which all reasonable officials would have concluded they were barred by the first amendment from terminating her employment.
first,although díaz bigio allegations that a senior public official had a conflict of interest that potentially violated the law were on a clear matter of public concern this fact weighs on both sides of the pickering balancing test,as it means that the allegations could also prove highly disruptive to public trust and confidence in the accused government office and the functioning of the office.at the time of díaz bigio termination,the law recognized that a government employer has a strong interest in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out its public service mission.guilloty perez,at quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.
also clear was the government wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs includ ing the prerogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation and to do so with dispatch.connick myers,d quoting arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring in part.public employers need not allege or show that an employee speech actually disrupted the workplace,and substantial weight has been given to government employers reasonable predictions of disruption.waters churchill,d see also curran cousins,cir an employer need not show an actual adverse effect in order to terminate an employee under the test.here,the nature of díaz bigio conduct supported a reasonable prediction that her retention could cause disruption.
that díaz bigio made false and groundless allegations could have been reasonably seen as part of a broader disciplinary problem a problem that included her refusal to appear before the internal auditing office investigation after receiving a summons and order to do so,as well as the behavior for which she had been subject to prior disciplinary actions.the legitimate interest of public employers in maintaining discipline is well established.see,rankin mcpherson,d we have previously recognized as pertinent considerations whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors guilloty perez,at recognizing discipline as relevant consideration.here,this interest was formally stated in a regulation,noted in the termination letter,authorizing disciplinary action for employees who make false or defamatory averments against other employees,supervisors,directors,or against the nominating authority.in addition,in failing to appear before the internal auditing office to substantiate her allegations,díaz bigio violated a direct order from her supervisor and
