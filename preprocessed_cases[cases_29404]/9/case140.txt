the plaintiffs mclaughlin group,who prevailed in a constitutional challenge to section of the defense of marriage act doma,appeal from the district court denial of fees and costs under the equal access to justice act eaja,a d.whether prevailing parties who successfully challenged section of doma are entitled to fees under eaja is an issue of first impression in any court of appeals.
on appeal,the mclaughlin group argues that the government position could not have been substantially justified because its and position involved knowingly and intentionally violat ing the mclaughlin group constitutional rights,and its strategy concedes that its position is not substantially justified the mclaughlin group also contends that,even if not entitled to fees,they are entitled to in costs under a separate provision of the eaja,a,and.d.
we reject these arguments.the district court denial of fees was correct as a matter of law because the government reasonably believed its actions were constitutionally appropriate under the circumstances.see aronov napolitano,cir en banc.and its denial of costs without comment was not an abuse of discretion because the reason for the denial that the case was close and difficult was readily apparent on the face of the record.see fernández hnos,kellogg usa,cir quoting in re two appeals arising out of the san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir.
the mclaughlin group are active duty members of the united states armed forces and national guard,veterans,and their spouses.on october,they brought suit against the united states of america,and secretary of defense leon panetta,attorney general eric holder,and secretary of veterans affairs eric shinseki,in their official capacities.the suit challenged the constitutionality of section of doma as applied to definitions of marriage in title,title,and title of the united states code as they affect military spouses.
president obama had previously determined,eight months earlier in february,that 
he personally believed that section of doma was unconstitutional 
out of deference to the courts and to congress,and in light of the executive obligation to faithfully execute the laws,the president would nonetheless instruct that the executive branch continue to enforce doma however,
this presented the rare case in which the department of justice should decline to defend the statute.
the government,pursuant to this presidential position,did not oppose the mclaughlin group suit on the merits.
at the parties request,the district court stayed the case in light of two other similar challenges that were then on appeal before the first circuit.this court held section of doma invalid on may.see massachusetts dep t of health human,cir.the district court continued the stay,over the mclaughlin group objection,following this court decision in that case,id.at,to withhold issuance of a mandate in deference to anticipated doma challenges before the supreme court.
on june,the supreme court held section unconstitutional as a violation of the fifth amendment.see united states windsor,d.
the district court resumed proceedings in this case,entering judgment in favor of the mclaughlin group on october.the district court did not address costs at that time.
on october,the mclaughlin group moved for fees and costs under the eaja.the district court denied the mclaughlin group motion,finding that the government position was substantially justified.the district court reasoned 
to answer this question,the court need go no further than the windsor decision itself.as the high court recognized,the approach taken by the president of preserving the justiciability of section of doma by continuing to enforce it despite a personal belief that the statute was unconstitutional,paid the appropriate respect to the primacy of the supreme court in matters of constitutional interpretation.
mclaughlin hagel,d.the court added that the relevant question was not whether the president could have ended enforcement of section,but whether it would have been constitutionally reasonable under the circumstances,concluding that i t is clear from windsor that the supreme court would have thought not.id.
a district court determination of whether the government was substantially justified,and so whether to award attorney fees under eaja,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see pierce underwood,d.legal determinations made in finding a position substantially justified are reviewed de novo.see aronov,at.
a denial of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.fernández,at.
under the eaja,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.the burden is on the united states to make those showings.see saysana gillen,cir.because we agree with the district court that the position of the united states was substantially justified,we do not reach the question of special circumstances.
a position of the united states is substantially justified if it is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person that is,if the position has a reasonable basis both in law and fact.pierce,at.if the government reasonably believes the action or inaction is required by law,then,by definition it can not be the basis for an award of eaja fees.aronov,at citing dantran,u.dep t of labor,cir holding government was substantially justified as a matter of law.both the government and litigation positions are evaluated holistically in making this determination.see saysana,at.
this extraordinary case presents the unusual situation in which the government and position was to enforce a challenged statute,but in which the government litigation position was to argue that the challenged statute is unconstitutional.the mclaughlin group makes a twofold argument the government pursued actions that it believed violated the mclaughlin group constitutional rights,and the government litigation position agreed with the mclaughlin group in denying that the opposite position,defense of the statute,had any merit.
the mclaughlin group attempts to divorce the government position from the practical constitutional difficulty the government faced.the president and the department of justice concluded unilaterally both that heightened scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review contrary to substantial circuit authority and that there was no reasonable argument consistent with that standard available in defense of section.the government then face d a difficult choice either enforce but decline to defend a statute it believed unconstitutional,or decline to enforce the statute under a novel legal theory while simultaneously precluding judicial review of that novel theory.see windsor.at.the district court appreciated this difficulty,and found that,under the supreme court decision in windsor,the government position was substantially justified 
in windsor,the court observed that the alternative to finding justiciability would be to find that the government refusal to defend section precluded judicial review.id.at.the court reasoned that this alternative was unacceptable because it would undermine the clear dictate of the principle that when an act of congress is alleged to conflict with the constitution,i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.id.quoting zivotofsky clinton,d quoting marbury madison,cranch.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found that this dilemma provided a reasonable basis for the government position.we agree.first,had the government not continued to enforce section,it would have precluded judicial review of a controversial conclusion regarding the statute validity.second,had it not continued to enforce section,the government would also have posed a second grave challenge to separation of powers by effectively nullify ing congress enactment solely on its own initiative and without any determination from the court.id.
this practical difficulty highlights the conceptual difficulty in identifying the government position the mclaughlin gro
