summary judgment on ada and phra claims 
on march,the district court granted cemcolift motion for summary judgment concerning rinehimer ada and phra claims under federal rule of civil procedure c.rinehimer cemcolift,slip op.at.march.the district court held that pneumonia was a temporary condition and hence not a disability under the ada or the phra.further,it found that cemcolift did not know rinehimer had asthma and,hence,his asthma could not be the basis of his ada and phra claims.finally,the district court concluded that rinehimer would not be able to show that he was suffering from an impairment within the meaning of the ada,or that cemcolift regarded him as impaired to such an extent that he was completely foreclosed from working in his type of employment.rinehimer,slip op.at.for these reasons,rinehimer could not state a claim under the regarded as disabled prong of the ada.c.

the ada prohibits discriminat ion against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual.a.under the statute,an individual is defined as disabled if has a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c is regarded as having such an impairment.however,a temporary,impairment of short duration is not a disability covered by the ada.mcdonald.dep t of public welfare,polk,cir.
rinehimer argues that he satisfies clause a of the definition of disability because his ability to breathe,which is,according to federal regulations,a major life activity,j ii,is significantly impaired since his pneumonia was a temporary impairment of his ability to breathe,and hence not a disability for purposes of the ada,rinehimer clause a argument must relate to his asthma,which is a condition.however,to establish discrimination because of a disability,an employer must know of the disability.taylor,at discussing b a.cemcolift argues that it did not know rinehimer had asthma,a claim that rinehimer does not dispute.rinehimer does appear to argue that cemcolift knew that he had some sort of respiratory disorder prior to his termination in light of the letter from his doctor saying that he should avoid dust and fumes.however,rinehimer condition of being sensitive to dust and fumes,which is not temporary in contrast to his pneumonia and which cemcolift arguably knew about in contrast to his asthma,does not substantially limit a major life activit y.a.thus,rinehimer either fails to satisfy prong a of the definition of disability,a,or he can not establish discrimination under the ada because cemcolift did not know about his disability.
rinehimer also argues that cemcolift regarded him as having a disability and thus he is disabled under prong c of the definition of disability.c.a person is regarded as having a disability if 
has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by the covered entity as constituting such limitation 
has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment or 
has no such impairment but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.

in the present case,the district court correctly noted that to be covered under the regarded as prong of the ada the employer must regard the employee to be suffering from an impairment within the meaning of the statutes,not just that the employer believed the employee to be somehow disabled.rinehimer,slip op.at quoting francis city of meriden,cir.as we discussed above,pneumonia is a temporary condition and is not protected by the ada.if cemcolift regar
