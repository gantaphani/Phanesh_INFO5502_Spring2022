this appeal arises from two lawsuits filed by charles lee against his employer,norfolk southern railway company ns.in the first lawsuit,lee claimed that ns suspended him on the basis of his race in violation of.after the district court granted ns summary judgment,lee filed his second lawsuit,claiming that ns in fact suspended him for reporting rail safety offenses,in violation of the whistleblower protection provision of the federal railroad safety act frsa.the district court again granted summary judgment to ns,holding that lee second lawsuit was barred by the frsa election of remedies provision,which provides that a n employee may not seek protection under both this section and another provision of law for the same allegedly unlawful act of the railroad carrier.f.
we disagree.as explained below,a suspension on the basis of race is not the same allegedly unlawful act as a suspension in retaliation for frsa whistleblowing.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
charles lee works as carman for ns in asheville,north carolina.as a carman,he is responsible for inspecting railcars to identify potential defects.in july,ns suspended lee without pay for six months.the parties dispute the reason for the suspension.ns claims it suspended lee because he drank a beer on duty and then operated a automobile in violation of company policy lee,who is african american,claims the suspension was motivated both by his race and in retaliation for federal rail safety whistleblowing.
on september,lee filed his first lawsuit,alleging that the suspension constituted racial discrimination in violation of.in the complaint,lee alleged several instances where ns favored white carmen over african american carmen.first,lee contended that ns trained and promoted white carmen pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with the carman union,but denied african american carmen those same opportunities.second,lee alleged that his white supervisor also drank beer while on duty,and the supervisor was not punished.finally,lee alleged several instances of racial harassment,such as his hanging a noose in his locker,threatening his children,and calling him racial slurs.
less than two months after filing his first lawsuit,lee filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha under the frsa whistleblower provision.that provision prohibits railroad carriers from,among other things,discriminating against employees who refuse to violate or assist in the violation of any federal law,rule,or regulation relating to railroad safety or security.id.a.according to lee,federal law required him to identify or bad order defective rail cars for repair.ns capped the number of cars he could tag with such orders,however,effectively requiring him to violate federal law.when he refused to comply with the caps,lee alleges that ns suspended him in july.
during discovery in the first lawsuit,ns attorney sought to depose lee about the osha whistleblower complaint,believing it to be part of lee lawsuit here in federal district court too.lee attorney objected,noting that lee did not bring his frsa claims in his first lawsuit,because he was first required to exhaust his administrative remedies before osha and the secretary of labor although the parties ultimately agreed to defer discussing the osha complaint,they left the door open to returning to it when the matter was ripe.id.ns attorney agreeing that if either party ultimately decided to address the osha whistleblower complaint in the first lawsuit,then arrangements will be made at a later time to allow that party to get into it.
on september,osha dismissed lee whistleblower complaint after concluding that ns did not commit any frsa violations.lee timely objected,and sought a hearing before a department of labor administrative law judge alj.on november,lee gave notice to the alj that he intended to exercise his right to file a lawsuit under the frsa provision.lee did not,however,seek to amend his section complaint to add his frsa claims.he also did not notify the district court that he intended to file a lawsuit under the frsa.
accordingly,when the district court granted ns summary judgment on december,the order addressed only lee section claims,not his frsa claims.first,the district court concluded that,to the extent lee claims were based on the collective bargaining agreement,they were preempted by the railway labor act rla,et,which requires arbitration of such claims.the court further concluded that ns was not vicariously liable for the individual instances of racial harassment by lee including the incident with the noose and use of racial slurs.
less than a month after the district court granted ns summary judgment in the first lawsuit,lee filed his frsa retaliation lawsuit.the allegations in this second lawsuit largely track those in lee osha complaint.lee again alleged that he was tasked with tagging defective train cars with bad orders,but that ns capped the number of cars he could tag.in doing so,lee contends ns pressured him to violate federal rail safety regulations and laws and violate ns own safety and mechanical department rules.notably,the specific retaliatory acts are identical to the retaliatory acts alleged in lee first complaint,including that ns i refused to properly train and promote him ii allowed him to be racially harassed by his and iii suspended him on july,purportedly for drinking a beer while on the job.
on may,the district court granted summary judgment to ns on lee frsa claims,concluding that lee first lawsuit for racial discrimination under section constituted an election of remedies under frsa section f that barred lee subsequent frsa retaliation action.lee then timely noted this appeal.
this appeal turns on the meaning of the frsa election of remedies provision.see f.we begin with a brief summary of the relevant statutory background to provide context for the parties arguments.
congress enacted the frsa in to promote safety in railroad operations.see et.when it was enacted,the frsa did not contain a whistleblower provision.in,congress amended the frsa to add such a provision to prohibit railroads from retaliating against employees who provided information about violations of federal railroad safety laws.see federal railroad safety authorization act of,stat.rayner smirl,cir.employees who sought to bring an frsa retaliation claim under this new provision were required to do so under the mandatory arbitration procedure established under the rla.see,c.the amendments also added the election of remedies provision,which required an employee seeking protection under any other provision of law in connection with the same allegedly unlawful act of an employer to choose either to seek relief pursuant to this section the frsa or pursuant to such other provision of law,d.
in,congress again amended the frsa to enhance administrative and civil remedies for employees and ensure that employees can report their concerns without the fear of possible retaliation or discrimination from employers.conf,at,reprinted in,wl.among other changes,congress eliminated the requirement that retaliation claims be resolved in arbitration under the rla.in its place,congress established an administrative procedure under which retaliation complaints are first resolved by osha and the secretary of labor and then in the district courts after exhausting these administrative procedures 
congress also added provisions stating that nothing in the frsa retaliation provision preempted or diminished other rights of employees and that the rights provided by frsa could not be waived.see g,h.but congress did not remove the election of remedies provision,which,in its current form,prohibits an employee from seek ing protection under both this section and another provision of law for the same allegedly unlawful act of the railroad carrier.f.
in its summary judgment order,the district court divided the election of remedies provision into four discrete elements an employee may not seek protection under the frsa and another provision of law for the same allegedly unlawful act of the railroad carrier.because the district court concluded that lee did not contest the first,second,and fourth elements,the court devoted most its analysis to the third element that is,to its conclusion that lee first lawsuit under section was an attempt to seek protection under another provision of law.
contrary to the district court finding,lee expressly argued in opposing summary judgment that a suspension on the basis of race is not the same allegedly unlawful act as a suspension in retaliation for frsa whistleblowing.lee also renewed that argument here on appeal.appellant br.at.accordingly,we find that lee properly preserved this argument for appeal.see united states zayyad,cir to preserve an argument on appeal,the party must object on the same basis below as he contends is error on appeal.we therefore turn to the merits of lee argument.
this appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.eeoc great steaks,cir.in construing a statute meaning,we begin,as always,with the language of the statute.duncan walker,d.in that regard,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute.ignacio united states,cir citation omitted.if the plain language is unambiguous,we need look no further.id.on the other hand,if the text of a statute is ambiguous,we look to other indicia of congressional intent such as the legislative history to interpret the statute.cgm,llc bellsouth,cir citation omitted.
a statute is ambiguous if it lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation.newport news shipbuilding dry dock brown,cir.we determine the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.yates united states,d citation and quotation omitted.
as set forth below,we conclude that the election of remedies provision is unambiguous because it is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation that a suspension on the basis of race is not the same allegedly unlawful act as a suspension in retaliation for frsa whistleblowing.and even if we did find the provision ambiguous,we would still reverse because the legislative history and context of the statute demonstrates that the provision does not sweep as broadly as ns suggests.
we begin with the plain language of the statute.whether the frsa election of remedies provision bars lee suit depends on the meaning of the phrase the same allegedly unlawful act.the words in this phrase are not defined in the frsa or in any other relevant statutory provision.accordingly,we give the words their ordinary dictionary meanings.taniguchi kan pac.saipan,d.
lee concedes that the act he challenges his july suspension is the same in both lawsuits.but the election of remedies provision applies to the same allegedly unlawful act not merely the same act.and lee suspension standing alone is not unlawful.rather,to become unlawful,the suspension must have of course violated a law.see black law dictionary ed defining unlawful act to mean c onduct that is not authorized by law a violation of a civil or criminal law.
in the first lawsuit then,the allegedly unlawful act was the suspension on the basis of race in violation of section in the second lawsuit,the allegedly unlawful act was the suspension on the basis of retaliation for lee whistleblowing regarding rail safety violations.these are distinct causes of action with different elements and burdens of proof.indeed,the framework that is applicable to frsa cases is much easier for a plaintiff to satisfy than the mcdonnell douglas standard applicable to section claims.araujo transit rail operations,cir see also cash norfolk ry,cv,dist.lexis,at,same 
in short,the act may be the same in both lawsuits,but the act is allegedly unlawful for fundamentally different reasons.under the ordinary meaning of the statute then,a suspension on the basis of race and a suspension on the basis of whistleblowing are not the same allegedly unlawful act.see black law dictionary ed defining same to mean i dentical or equal resembling in every relevant respect see also merriam webster dictionary,available at defining same as resembling in every relevant respect saved as ecf opinion attachment.
ns disagrees,though its interpretation hinges more on the phrase grammar than on the meaning of its words.according to ns,the word same can not modify unlawful because those words are parallel adjectives that independently or separately modify the verb act.under this reading,the election of remedies provision applies whenever a single act is allegedly unlawful for multiple different reasons.of am.amic.br.at 
while creative,this argument creates its own grammatical issues.for example,according to several widely respected style guides,adjectives that independently modify a noun must be separated by a comma.see the chicago manual of style ed see also william sabin,the gregg reference manual,c ed.a comma should not be used,however,if the second adjective and the noun can be thought of as a single unit or phrase,because in that scenario the first adjective modifies the entire phrase.chicago manual of style see also gregg reference manual when two adjectives precede a noun,the first adjective may modify the combined idea of the second adjective plus the noun.in such cases do not separate the adjectives by a comma.
this distinction supports lee interpretation.congress did not use a comma between same and allegedly unlawful,thus indicating that those words do not independently modify act.moreover,black dictionary defines the words unlawful act together,further indicating that,as a term of art,those words act as a single unit or phrase.black law dictionary ed accordingly,under the grammatical rules set forth above,same is an adjective modifying the phrase unlawful act.
of course,we do not mean to suggest that this appeal turns entirely on punctuation.as the supreme court has recognized,however,the meaning of a statute will typically heed the commands of its punctuation.see bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,d.that is true here congress decision to omit a comma between same and allegedly unlawful is wholly consistent with the plain meaning of the phrase.even if grammatical rules supported this result and as discussed above,they do not we would decline to read the phrase in a manner so plainly contrary to its ordinary meaning.
at bottom,both the definitions of the words the same allegedly unlawful act and accepted grammatical rules demonstrate that the election of remedies provision does not prohibit lee second lawsuit.and because congress has spoken clearly,no further analysis is required.the plain meaning of the statute settles the issue.see ignacio,at a bsent an ambiguity in the words of a statute,our analysis begins and ends with the statute plain language.
even if we did find that ns grammatical argument rendered the election of remedies provision ambiguous,we would still reverse.
according to the secretary of labor appearing as an amicus on lee behalf,both the statutory context and legislative history make clear that the election of remedies provision only requires an employee to choose between proceeding under the frsa or another law prohibiting retaliation for the same types of rail safety or whistleblowing addressed in the frsa.in other words,the provision does not require a choice between the frsa and statutes aimed at curbing racial discrimination.we agree.
as noted above,when the frsa was enacted in,it did not contain a whistleblower provision.despite this omission,railroad employees could still seek protection under section c of the occupational safety and health act osh act,which protects workers in all industries from retaliation for filing a complaint,instituting a proceeding,testifying,or exercising rights related to safety and health in the workplace.see c.the osh act merely acts as a default,however.where congress has enacted an statute conferring authority over working conditions on another agency the osh act does not apply.power fuels,llc fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir see also.b.the feder
