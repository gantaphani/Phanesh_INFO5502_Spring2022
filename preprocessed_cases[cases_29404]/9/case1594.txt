on july,orland briscoe filed a complaint in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.briscoe,a pennsylvania state prisoner,alleged that two incidents occurred in which prison officials at hill and violated his constitutional rights.
the first instance occurred on december,when several corrections officers cos arrived to return briscoe to his cell after he had been released from the infirmary at hill.he alleged that sergeant paul leggore,co moore,co nicholas prave,co james zihmer,lieutenant miller,and co anthony alianiello entered his infirmary cell,and proceeded to strike him with a riot shield,beat him,kick him,and carry him to the strip search area.he was then strip searched in the presence of leggore,prave,alianiello,zihmer,co kenneth klaus,co adam huber,and co randy mccauslin.
the second instance occurred on april,when several cos transferred briscoe from hill to.the cos took briscoe to the strip search area,and the following officers conducted the search leggore,mccauslin,prave,klaus,smith,co clifford pelter,co edward hatcher,and co raymond stender.after briscoe failed to follow the cos instructions during the strip search,smith ordered the officers to take him down to the floor.while he was on the floor,klaus kneed him in the face.the cos then took briscoe to the van to transfer him.during the transfer,briscoe claims that stender elbowed him in the mouth,damaging one of his teeth.he also claims that smith used an electronic immobilizing device on him upon arriving at,the nurse,marsha hancock,examined and treated briscoe.
based on these facts,briscoe instituted this litigation against the prison officials pursuant to,alleging that the prison officials violated his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights in the following ways miller,leggore,moore,alianiello,prave,and zihmer used excessive force on him in the infirmary cell on december,miller,leggore,moore,alianiello,prave,and zihmer used excessive force on him during the strip search on december,miller,stender,leggore,mccauslin,pelter,prave,smith,and klaus used excessive force on him during the strip search on april,stender and smith used excessive force on him while transporting him to on april,and nurse hancock refused to provide him with the medical treatment he requested.
in july,briscoe did not attend his scheduled deposition.on september,defendant klaus filed a motion to dismiss briscoe case for failure to prosecute.on september,briscoe submitted a brief in opposition to the motion.in it,he explained that,prior to the hearing,prison officials had confiscated all of his legal documents and his clothing.he attached a declaration from an inmate who supported his assertion of these facts.he further stated that he had contacted klaus counsel,requesting that the deposition be rescheduled when he had access to all of these materials.on march,the district court denied klaus motion to dismiss.
after completion of discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.on march,the district court denied briscoe motion for summary judgment,but granted the defendants motion for summary judgment in part,finding that several of the defendants had not violated briscoe eighth and fourteenth amendment rights.specifically,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the following defendants miller,leggore,moore,alianiello,prave,and zihmer,finding that they had not used excessive force during the strip search on december,miller,stender,leggore,mccauslin,pelter,and prave,finding that they had not used excessive force during the strip search on april,and nurse hancock,finding that she had not acted with deliberate indifference in treating briscoe.therefore,briscoe remaining claims that survived summary judgment were miller,leggore,moore,alianiello,prave,and zihmer used excessive force on him in the infirmary cell on december,smith and klaus used excessive force on him during the strip search on april,and stender and smith used excessive force on him while transporting him to on april.
on august,the district court filed a scheduling order.it scheduled the final pretrial conference for september,and it set the trial to begin on september.briscoe filed a motion,requesting a extension to file his jury instructions and subpoena his witnesses.the district court did not rule on this motion.
on september,the district court entered an order,stating that it had been notifi ed from plaintiff custodian,the state correctional institution at fayette,labelle,pennsylvania,that the plaintiff is refusing to be transported for purposes of attending the final pretrial conference scheduled in this matter for thursday,september.as a result of this notification,it entered the following order 
the plaintiff refusal to appear at the final pretrial conference in this matter could be construed as a failure to prosecute the action,as well as a failure to comply with the rules of court and will result in an involuntary dismissal of the action,on the merits,pursuant to.b 
the clerk of court is hereby directed to serve this order on the plaintiff custodian via facsimile 
plaintiff custodian is ordered to serve this order upon the plaintiff forthwith 
plaintiff custodian is further ordered to notify this court of the plaintiff status by on this date.
pursuant to this order,the prison officials notified the district court that briscoe continued to refuse to be transported.thus,the district court entered a second order,cancelling the conference.
on september,the district court dismissed briscoe case for failure to prosecute and comply with its orders pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in its order,the court considered the six factors applicable to dismissing a case pursuant to rule b as set forth in poulis state farm fire and casualty,cir.it noted that briscoe claims were based in some merit because they had successfully cleared the summary judgment hurdle and were in posture to proceed to trial.however,it found that the remaining factors were not in favor of briscoe.it found that briscoe was personally responsible for his refusal to attend the conference,his refusal was willful because he had ignored the court specific warning to him,and his failure to attend the conference prejudiced the defendants because the defendants could not effectively prepare for trial so as to bring the litigation to a resolution.additionally,it found that,although briscoe did not have a history of dilatoriness,his refusal to attend the conference was a dilatory tactic in light of his request for an extension of time to comply with the court order regarding pretrial documentation.finally,it found that alternative sanctions were unavailable in the present case.based on its evaluation of these factors,the district court dismissed briscoe case.its order stated 
the plaintiff action is dismissed on the merits for failure to prosecute and comply with orders of the court pursuant to.b 
the clerk of court is directed to close this case 
any appeal from this order will be deemed frivolous,lacking in probable cause and not in good faith.
on september,briscoe filed a timely notice of appeal to this court 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to a,and we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review a district court decision to dismiss a plaintiff case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for an abuse of discretion.emerson thiel,cir.while we defer to the district court discretion,dismissal with prejudice is only appropriate in limited circumstances and doubts should be resolved in favor of reaching a decision on the merits.id.
federal rule of civil procedure b permits a district court to dismiss a plaintiff case for failure to prosecute.see.b if the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order,a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.to determine if the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case,we will be guided by the manner in which the trial court balanced the following factors,and whether the record supports its findings the extent of the party personal responsibility the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery a history of dilatoriness whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal,which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions and the meritoriousness of the claim or defense.poulis,at emphasis in original.
we will conduct an analysis of the poulis factors below,but first,we note that dismissals with prejudice are drastic sanctions.id.at.as a result,it is imperative that the district court have a full understanding of the surrounding facts and circumstances pertinent to the poulis factors before it undertakes its analysis.emerson,at affirming the district court order dismissing the plaintiff case,and in doing so,noting that the district court gave the plaintiff numerous extensions of time,and the opportunity to substantiate that he was unable to proceed for medical reasons.while a district court may dismiss a case sua sponte,see donnelly sales,cir,it should use caution in doing so because it may not have acquired knowledge of the facts it needs to make an informed decision.with this caution in mind,we hold that the district court should provide the plaintiff with an opportunity to explain his reasons for failing to prosecute the case or comply with its orders prior to dismissing a case sua sponte.see emerson,at.our review of the district court application of the poulis factors in this case demonstrates the inherent problem with dismissing a case without providing the plaintiff with an opportunity to be heard.
evaluation of the six poulis factors 
the extent of the party personal responsibility.
the district court found that briscoe was personally responsible for his refusal to attend the conference,particularly because he is proceeding pro se.although the district court correctly described the law,the record was insufficient for it to conclude that briscoe was personally responsible without first providing him with an opportunity to explain why he failed to attend the conference.
as a legal proposition,the district court is correct in stating that a pro se plaintiff is responsible for his failure to attend a pretrial conference or otherwise comply with a court orders.compare emerson,at,with poulis,at.in emerson,we found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the plaintiff case,and in doing so,we implicitly affirmed the district court finding that a pro se plaintiff is personally responsible for complying with the court orders.at.moreover,it is logical to hold a pro se plaintiff personally responsible for delays in his case because a pro se plaintiff is solely responsible for the progress of his case,whereas a plaintiff represented by counsel relies,at least in part,on his or her attorney.see poulis,at stating that a client can not always avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of its counsel,but considering the plaintiffs lack of responsibility for their counsel dilatory conduct in conducting the balancing of the six factors.therefore,the district court was correct in stating that a pro se plaintiff is responsible for his failure to attend a pretrial conference or otherwise comply with a court orders.
however,the record in the present case is insufficient to support the district court finding that briscoe refus ed to attend the pretrial conference and thus fail ed to comply with orders of th e court.the district court made this finding based upon its communications with prison officials,and thus,it assumed that the prison officials correspondence was accurate and truthful.it never,however,sought briscoe explanation regarding why he failed to attend the hearing and comply with the order.briscoe now argues to this court that the prison officials account of the incident was inaccurate and dishonest,and the reason he could not attend the conference was because the prison officials refused to transport him.as discussed above,the district court should have provided briscoe with the opportunity to explain his failure to attend the conference,thus gathering a full understanding of the facts.because it did not,the record was insufficient for the district court to find that briscoe was personally responsible for failing to attend the conference.
the prejudice to the adversary.
the district court found that briscoe failure to attend the conference prejudiced the defendants because the defendants could not effectively prepare for trial so as to bring the litigation to a resolution.again,while the district court correctly described the law,the record was insufficient for it to conclude that briscoe conduct prejudiced the defendants without providing briscoe with an opportunity to explain why he failed to attend the conference.
we have stated that e vidence of prejudice to an adversary would bear substantial weight in support of a dismissal or default judgment.adams trustees of brewery employees pension trust fund,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.generally,prejudice includes the irretrievable loss of evidence,the inevitable dimming of witnesses memories,or the excessive and possibly irremediable burdens or costs imposed on the opposing party.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in the present case,the defendants were not prejudiced based on this general description of prejudice,briscoe failure to attend the conference did not cause a loss of evidence,a dimming of the witnesses memories,or excessive costs.see id.
however,prejudice is not limited to irremediable or irreparable harm.see also ware rodale press,cir curtis bedwell sons,int l fidelity ins,cir.it also includes the burden imposed by impeding a party ability to prepare effectively a full and complete trial strategy.ware,at.oftentimes,this type of prejudice involves disputes between the parties on discovery matters because the defendants were deprived of necessary information or had to expend costs to obtain court orders for compliance.see,poulis,at finding that the defendants were prejudiced where the plaintiffs did not answer interrogatories,the defendants had to file a motion to compel the plaintiffs answers,and the defendant had to file its statement without the opportunity to review plaintiffs pretrial statement which was due to be filed first ware,at affirming the district court conclusion that a defendant had been prejudiced where the plaintiff repeatedly ignored the defendant discovery request for the plaintiff computation of damages and did not provide it until one week prior to trial.
the district court was correct in extending this type of deprivation of necessary information to final pretrial conferences.at the final pretrial conference,the district court formulate s a trial plan,including a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence.e.by this time,each party has fully disclosed the evidence it plans to present at trial.if the plaintiff has not disclosed all of its evidence prior to trial or fails to attend the conference,the district court would not be able to properly formulate a plan,prejudicing the defendants in their trial preparations.
in the present case,ass
