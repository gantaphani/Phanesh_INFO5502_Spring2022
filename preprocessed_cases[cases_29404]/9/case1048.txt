samuel ed davis,an inmate in the custody of the new york state department of correctional services docs appeals from a january,decision and order of united states magistrate judge kenneth schroeder,granting summary judgment in favor of david barrett,a docs hearing officer,and dismissing davis action under,seeking damages for the alleged abridgment of his procedural due process rights by barrett in the course of assigning him to administrative segregation for days.davis barrett,sr.
on appeal,davis argues that the magistrate judge conducted a flawed sandin conner,d,analysis by failing to undertake a careful examination of the actual conditions of davis confinement and by failing to compare them with those of the general prison population and other segregated confinement.in so doing,davis argues,the magistrate judge erroneously concluded that davis had not properly alleged a liberty interest sufficient to trigger due process protection.we hold that a dispute of fact exists as to the actual conditions of davis confinement,and thus vacate the district court judgment and remand for further.
background 
on january,davis,an inmate at the elmira correctional facility,received an administrative segregation recommendation written by sergeant perry,stating that perry had received confidential information from four separate sources in the previous two weeks indicating that davis was involved in fights and extortion.the informants asserted that davis used a weapon on occasion and targeted weaker inmates from whom he extorted commissary products.during an administrative hearing held on january,with barrett serving as the docs hearing officer,davis acknowledged having received perry recommendation,but denied the allegations.barrett did not interview the confidential informants,or perry,but rather relied exclusively on perry report,explaining that he had confidence in perry ability to assess their credibility.at the conclusion of the hearing,barrett advised davis that he agreed with perry recommendation,and davis was transferred to administrative segregation in the special housing unit shu,where he remained for days,until he was transferred to the general population at attica correctional facility.
davis timely filed an administrative appeal.see regs.tit.barrett decision was reversed on march,based on the absence of testimony from the author of the recommendation perry,or an assessment by barrett of the reliability of the confidential information.
davis filed a pro se complaint on july,pursuant to,seeking compensatory and punitive damages,alleging that his procedural due process rights were violated by the administrative hearing.barrett moved for summary judgment,and davis opposed the motion magistrate judge schroeder held that davis failed to demonstrate that the conditions of his administrative confinement from january,through february,created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.he noted that davis was confined in administrative segregation from january,through february,and that a period was insufficient to establish a liberty interest in the absence of evidence of conditions more onerous than normal for shu.while the magistrate judge acknowledged davis allegations regarding atypical conditions of confinement,he concluded that davis had not demonstrated a liberty interest sufficient to trigger due process protection,and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of barrett.this appeal followed 
discussion 
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
as a preliminary matter,we address barrett argument that davis failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act plra,et.davis argues that he adequately exhausted his administrative remedies by filing an administrative appeal following his administrative hearing,while barrett argues that davis was additionally required to grieve separately the conditions of his confinement to exhaust his prison remedies.we agree with davis that his appeal of the administrative hearing was sufficient to exhaust all available administrative remedies as required by the plra.
the plra provides that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a see generally woodford ngo,d.the supreme court has stated that the phrase prison conditions in the plra refers to all inmate suits about prison life,whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes,and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.porter nussle,d.there are several reasons underlying the exhaustion requirement.exhaustion gives the docs an opportunity to correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers before it is haled into federal court.woodford,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.further,exhaustion promotes efficiency by requiring claims first to be processed at the administrative level,often obviating the need for parties to pursue the matter further in federal court.id.
barrett claims that,under the plra,davis was not only required to appeal the administrative hearing,but also to separately grieve the conditions of his confinement.but davis only seeks redress for his claim that the hearing procedure violated his constitutional right to due process.he contends he has done all that new york requires to appraise prison officials of his injury.
under new york inmate grievance program regulations,barrett handling of the hearing is.the regulation provides that a n individual decision or disposition of any current or subsequent program or procedure having a written appeal mechanism which extends review to outside the facility shall be considered.regs.tit,e.new york courts have made clear that while the grievance procedure can not be used to challenge the decision in a particular disciplinary proceeding which results in a sanction,it may be used to challenge the manner in which the sanction is imposed.johnson ricks,dep t,lv denied,citations omitted emphasis added.
under new york regulations,barrett alleged conduct in presiding over the administrative hearing was properly the subject of an appeal of the hearing,but could not be the basis for an additional grievance.and while the plra is not subject to by state law,the availability of administrative remedies for prisoner complaints is a decidedly state law matter.davis raised,in his administrative appeal,his objections to barrett conduct,and could not further grieve the procedures of the appeal under new york regulations.davis successful appeal of his administrative hearing constitutes exhaustion under the plra for purposes of rendering his due process claim ripe for adjudication in federal court.see rivera goord,d,sweet wende corr.facility,d.
furthermore,this court has previously indicated that a prisoner may exhaust his administrative remedies for segregated confinement by appealing the adverse hearing determination.see ortiz mcbride,cir.in ortiz,this court expressly agreed with the parties that ortiz exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his due process claim by successfully appealing the hearing which resulted in his confinement.id.at.
davis failure to grieve the conditions of his confinement is no bar to his due process claim because the conditions of his confinement are not the basis on which he alleges he suffered harm.in ortiz the court distinguished exhaustion for his due process claim from exhaustion for his eighth amendment claim the latter being a claim as to the manner in which the sanctions were imposed.we noted that ortiz was required to grieve the conditions of his confinement in order to exhaust his eighth amendment claim.id.at.here,unlike in ortiz,davis makes no the eighth amendment or the conditions of his confinement directly.rather,his sole claim calls in to question barrett conduct at the administrative hearing.thus,we find that davis administrative appeal was sufficient for purposes of plra exhaustion.
the concerns underlying the plra exhaustion rule support our conclusion that davis administrative appeal satisfied the e
