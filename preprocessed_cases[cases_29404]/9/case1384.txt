the new york city department of correction appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,baer,denying in part the department motion to terminate consent decrees pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra,pub,stat,codified at.the consent decrees concern jail conditions for pretrial detainees in department facilities the plra requires the termination of such consent decrees,upon a motion for termination under b,unless findings are made that prospective relief remains necessary to correct ongoing violations of a federal right and that the relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.see b.in july,the district court upheld the constitutionality of the plra and vacated the consent decrees.see benjamin jacobson.benjamin i.a panel of the court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.see benjamin jacobson,cir benjamin ii.on rehearing in banc,the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to an opportunity to present evidence demonstrating the existence of current and ongoing violations of constitutional rights and the need for continuation of prospective relief.see benjamin jacobson,cir benjamin iii.
on remand,the district court held five days of hearings devoted to conditions affecting attorney visitation,use of restraints,restrictive housing,inmate correspondence,and law libraries in a detailed opinion,judge baer granted most of the relief sought by the department motion,terminating the consent decrees that called for judicial supervision over restrictive housing,inmate correspondence,and law libraries.the court denied the department motion to terminate decrees relating to attorney visitation and due process affecting the use of restraints,see benjamin kerik,d benjamin iv,and specified the terms of the continuing relief,see benjamin kerik,civ.hb,slip op.at august,benjamin kerik,civ.hb,slip op.at august.defendants appealed 
background 
attorney visitation 
based on the evidence introduced at the hearings,the district court found that defense attorneys routinely face unpredictable,substantial delays in meeting with clients detained at department facilities.the court determined that attorneys are forced to wait between minutes and two hours,or even substantially longer,after arriving at a facility to see a client see benjamin iv,d at.
the record indicates that several factors contribute to these delays.first,many department facilities have few counsel rooms relative to the number of detainees housed at the facility second,certain detainees may not be moved to counsel rooms without escort officers.third,inmates are generally not brought to counsel rooms during inmate counts,which can delay visits for several hours.since the counts are held at unpredictable times and the department does not furnish schedules for attorneys,attorneys can not time their visits so as to avoid the counts.the department bureau chief for management and planning conceded that security considerations did not require the freeze of inmate movement during counts,and that,while detainees are not brought to attorney visits during counts,they are taken to family visits.the defendants were unable to identify security or administrative problems that would result from such movement to meet with attorneys during counts.
the district court found that visitation has been significantly compromised by the delays.benjamin iv,at.several legal aid society las attorneys testified that they had largely stopped visiting clients at particular facilities,that they were sometimes forced to abandon efforts to meet with clients after arriving at department facilities,and that the delays deterred necessary consultation,particularly given that las attorneys typically handle cases at a time.for example,las attorney heidi segal testified that 
b ecause you know you experiencing significant delays you make determinations about whether or not you even have the time to visit a client,so there are times that you would forego a visit if you only had four hours free that day as opposed to six or seven.on days where i experienced significant delays,i would cut short my visit 
similarly,jesse uhrman,the social work supervisor for las parole revocation defense unit,stopped visiting clients at one of the facilities because of extensive delays.las witnesses,testified that the delays impaired their ability to establish rapport and trust with clients,to collect information from clients,to counsel clients in a crisis,and to assist clients in considering plea agreements.
plaintiffs also established that courthouse visits are not an adequate substitute for jailhouse visits.see benjamin iv,at.courthouse visits are not available on less than a day notice,nor in the evenings or on weekends.attorneys must call every hour to see if their client has been produced.inmates may be returned to jail before the attorney arrives,or may not be produced at all.some of the counsel rooms at the courthouses are not private.finally,when attorneys rely on courthouse visits,the burden on the client may cause the relationship to suffer.inmates are awakened at for transport to court and may wait eight hours in a bullpen to see their attorney.depending on their restraint status,inmates may spend the entire day in restraints in order to meet with their attorney for a few minutes.
judge baer considered the viability of plaintiffs suggestions for reducing delays and the extent to which the suggested measures would impose an intrusive burden on the department institutions.the suggested measures included providing counsel with a reliable pamphlet detailing visiting hours for different facilities,assigning more officers to escort duty,or initiating the process of bringing detainees to the counsel room at the point the attorney checks into the facility,rather than when the attorney reaches the visiting area.noting that the plaintiffs had point ed to alternative s that fully accommodate the prisoner rights at a de minimis cost to valid penological interests,benjamin iv,at quoting turner safley,d,the court concluded that current obstacles to attorney visitation are not justified by legitimate penal interests t he department facilities are frequently inadequate for counsel visits and defendants institutional security regulations are not the sole or even the primary reason for undue delays to attorney visits.id.at.
having concluded that the defendant policies led to unconstitutional burdens to inmate access to counsel and courts,judge baer ordered the defendants to provide recommendations for prospective relief.id.at.after reviewing these recommendations,the court issued an order which required that the department establish procedures to ensure that attorney visits commence within minutes of an attorney arrival at rikers island,or within minutes of an attorney arrival at a borough facility.in addition,the order required the defendants to ensure both that an adequate number of attorney visiting rooms be made available and that such rooms foster the requisite degree of privacy.see benjamin,civ.hb,slip op.at august.the court specifically found that this relief was necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the federal right,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and was narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.id.at.
red status and restraint status 
detainees not classified for special restraints may move within the department jails free of mechanical restraints.when taken outside of the example to wear handcuffs secured in front of their bodies.inmates classified as either red or restraint status are subjected to heightened restraints described below,which are painful and at times injurious.
the red policy is designed to prevent violence when inmates are moved outside of department jails.restraint status is designed to reduce violence within department facilities.out of roughly detainees,there are approximately in red status and in restraint status.
inmates who have been found to possess a weapon while in the department custody are assigned red status.a red detainee must wear a red identification card which enables department staff to determine that the detainee is subject to special attention during jail searches and strip frisks.when red i.detainees are moved anywhere outside their facility,their hands are placed in black tubes termed security mitts.although the exact types of restraints apparently vary,typically the cuffs are attached to a waist chain and the hands are cuffed behind the back facing outwards.the detainee may also be placed in leg irons.during the detainee courthouse visit,he may be shackled in this manner for up to fourteen hours.
restraint status,which is more restrictive than red,is for individuals who have committed a violent act while in custody.restraint status detainees are subject to the same restraints as red inmates not only when they are moved outside the jail,but also when they are moved within the jail,for example,to the clinic,recreation area,or law library.the department regulations specify that restraint status shall not be considered a punishment,but shall be a method of protecting staff and inmates from being attacked.it is also a means of deterring inmates from engaging in assaultive behavior.see city of new york department of correction operations order.
at the hearings before the district court,detainees testified that the shackling which accompanies red and restraint status is painful.the inmates stated that they often required medical attention and painkillers after spending a day in restraints.nicolaj amann,a red inmate,testified,for example,that whenever he went to court he was chained,placed in leg shackles,and handcuffed behind his back with the black box a rigid metal cover that prevents the handcuffs from being moved between the wrists.after court visits,he needed to seek medical treatment because my shoulder was completely numb from being handcuffed like that all day.louis roque,who was similarly restrained,testified of his injuries 
they very painful.the black box to the court i do know if you could see my hands.the handcuffs usually go on the wrists,and you have some movement,but when they put a black box on it and they force you to bring it in,it forces your hand,your arms out on the sides and the metal rubs on the wrists.
the court so those,the welts that are on there,they come from the restraints 
the witness yes,sir.
the court can i see the other wrist i see.okay.thank you.
the witness see the black box,it it holds the handcuff rigid.it does give it any movement one way or the other.it goes in between and then they make you put a chain,the y want to put a chain around your stomach and when you hold it in,your arms are forced out,so it rubs,it bites into the bone.
another inmate,andre greene,testified that after being in the court pens for fourteen hours with his arms held behind his back,he needed muscle relaxers and pain killers because of the pain.he added that the restraints make detainees vulnerable to attacks by other prisoners and that officers assigned to protect them do pay attention.he reported that one of the inmates in my building he was cut from his ear to his neck,and he was even able to defend himself,while an officer stood right there talking to another female officer.
in addition to inmate witnesses,plaintiffs called las attorney russell neufeld,who testified that he had seen the severe injury to the wrists and cuts and bleeding that occurs after detainees are transported in restraints.
the issue before the district court was not the use of restraints,which are necessitated in appropriate cases by security concerns,but rather whether the process of designating a detainee for restraints entails any procedural protections to insure that painful,onerous,even injurious restraints be terminated if instituted without reason.where the accusations that led to the imposition of red status occasioned a disciplinary charge,department policies do not provide for removal from red status if the disciplinary charge is dismissed,the detainee is exonerated,or no hearing is held.
red and restraint status may be imposed by the warden or deputy warden without prior notice or an opportunity to be heard.according to the rules,inmates may appeal placement in red status by writing to the warden,who is to investigate the circumstances surrounding the appeal.if the appeal is denied,department policy requires that the detainee receive a written response explaining the reasons for the denial.see city of new york department of correction operations order.as to restraint status,a month after the determination,and every four weeks thereafter,department policy provides for a review to determine if a change in the inmate conduct justifies the removal of restraints.see city of new york department of correction operations order.
the evidence,however,showed that the department review policies are not followed in practice and that the directions of medical staff affecting prisoners in special restraint status are not necessarily followed.for example,detainee nikolaj amann was placed in red status after arguing with a staff member and later being told that a razor was found in his property.he was never charged with any rule violation or given a hearing.when he tried to challenge his status,jail staff would not give him a decision in writing.his subsequent efforts to contest his red designation in state court failed because he could not document that he had exhausted administrative remedies.detainee keith todd was likewise accused of possessing a razor.a disciplinary charge was brought,but dismissed with no finding of guilt.criminal charges brought by the department were dismissed by the grand jury.todd sent two letters to the warden to appeal his status but received no response.inmate andre greene testified that after he attempted to commit suicide by slashing his wrists,medical staff directed that he not be handcuffed until his wrists had healed however,greene was simply given and then cuffed over the wounds.keith todd,a red inmate,testified that he suffered extreme pain because of restraints,that he developed numbness in both hands,and that he was diagnosed with damaged nerves.a jail doctor orders not to handcuff him behind his back did not stop the practice.
the office of compliance consultants occ,which was asked by the court to investigate the defendant procedures,found that inmates placed in restraint status were not afforded the due process rights prescribed by the consent decree.according to occ 
while many department security folders contained monthly reviews of security status,only a few folders contained documentation indicating that security restraint inmates were afforded the opportunity to appear before a hearing officer as required by the consent decree and departmental policy.in those few cases in which restraint status was reviewed by the adjudication unit,the security folder did not contain documentation of what took place at the hearing 
the district court concluded that red and restraint status involve punishment as well as administrative justification,and that the department,by imposing such sanctions without providing meaningful subsequent review,violates the constitutional standard of wolff mcdonnell,d.see benjamin iv,at.after receiving proposed orders from counsel,judge baer issued an order requiring that a within hours after placing an inmate in red or restraint status,the department afford the inmate a hearing pursuant to wolff b within hours of the hearing,a written decision be prepared by the hearing officer and given to the inmate c appeals from placement in red or restraint status be reviewed within seven days d inmates be given the opportunity to seek further review based upon good cause and e inmates subjected to red or restraint status receive monthly medical reviews.see benjamin,civ.hb,slip op.at august.the court found that this relief met the prerequisites of the plra,being narrowly drawn,minimally intrusive,and extending no further than necessary to correct an ongoing violation of a constitutional right.see id.at.
discussion 
the plra provides that 
prospective relief shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the federal right,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.
b.when a defendant moves to terminate a consent decree,plaintiffs must be given an opportunity to present evidence showing the need for continuation of prospective relief.benjamin iii,at.
the district court,after conducting hearings,determined that prospective relief remained necessary in two of the five areas litigated.on appeal,defendant contends that the district court both misapplied the law and misconstrued the evidence.reviewing the questions of law de novo,the questions of fact for clear error,and the matters of discretion for abuse of discretion,see pierce underwood,d,we affirm.
attorney applicability of lewis casey to pretrial detainees access to counsel 
as regards attorney visits,defendants contend that the district court erred by rejecting their argument that lewis casey,d,applies to claims brought under the sixth amendment,and by instead applying the standard set out in procunier martinez,d,overruled in part on other grounds by thornburgh abbott,d.both procunier and lewis involve the claims of convicted prisoners unlike this case,they involve neither sixth amendment claims of right to counsel nor pretrial detainees.we agree with the district court that procunier,which concerned restrictions on attorney contact with clients,more closely parallels our case than lewis,which concerned the provision of law libraries and legal assistance.we hold that lewis is inapplicable.
the procunier plaintiffs challenged regulations which prevented the use by attorneys of law students or paralegals to undertake such tasks as interviewing inmates and obtaining prisoner signatures.the supreme court held that inmates must have a reasonable opportunity to seek and receive the assistance of attorneys and that r egulations and practices that unjustifiably obstruct the availability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts are invalid.procunier,at.in finding an unjustifiable burden on the prisoners right of access to the courts,the court weighed the financial and time costs imposed on attorneys by travel to remote prisons.see id.at.
lewis was a class action in which the district court,relying on bounds smith,d requiring adequate law libraries or legal assistance,entered a sweeping injunction to improve law libraries and legal assistance programs in arizona prisons.in striking down the injunction,the supreme court held that a prisoner alleging a bounds violation must show actual injury.lewis,at.thus,to establish a claim of inadequate access to the courts under bounds,an inmate must show that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim for example,by demonstrating that he has been unable to file a complaint or has had a complaint dismissed for failure to observe a technicality.id.at.
the department contends that lewis standing requirement of actual injury applies not just to law libraries and legal services,but to all and claims.it argues,interference with attorney visits does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation unless the inmate is completely denied access to courts or legal counsel,or a policy exists that creates a substantial interference with communication that has an identifiable detrimental effect.
we disagree.the court in lewis gave no indication that it intended to overrule procunier.procunier relating to an inmate ability to seek and receive the assistance of an attorney is closer than lewis dealing with the state obligation to provide legal services and a law library to convicted prisoners to our case.more importantly,lewis is inapplicable to sixth amendment claims of pretrial detainees.
lewis reasoning is premised on the distinction between the standing required to assert direct constitutional rights versus the standing required to assert claims that are derivative of those rights.because law libraries and legal assistance programs do not represent constitutional rights in and of themselves,but only the means to ensure a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts,prisoners must demonstrate actual injury in order to have standing.lewis,at.internal quotations omitted.in the absence of actual or imminent harm,the doctrine of standing,a constitutional principle that prevents courts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches,id.a,requires the judicial branch to leave to the political branches the choice among alternative means to achieve meaningful access to the courts,id.at.by contrast,where the right at issue is provided directly by the constitution or federal law,a prisoner has standing to assert that right even if the denial of that right has not produced an actual injury.
the right of the accused i n all criminal prosecutions to have the assistance of counsel for his defence is a direct right,grounded squarely in the text of the constitution.const.amend.vi.while a prisoner complaining of poor law libraries does not have standing unless he can demonstrate that a direct his right of access to the been impaired,in the context of the right to counsel,unreasonable interference with the accused person ability to consult counsel is itself an impairment of the right.as the supreme court has recognized,to deprive a person of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself.maine moulton,d.see also wolfish levi,cir o ne of the most serious deprivations suffered by a pretrial detainee is the curtailment of his ability to assist in his own defense,rev on other grounds,bell wolfish,d schoemehl,cir when pretrial detainees interest in effective communication with attorneys is inadequately respected during confinement,the ultimate fairness of their eventual trial can be compromised.while certain restrictions on a detainee right to counsel may be justified by the constraints of institutional management,this does not affect the detainee standing to challenge those restrictions.in other words,the standing question raised by a person interests have been harmed in a way that creates a justiciable be distinguished from the subsequent question of such an impairment is necessitated by a legitimate government interest.
the department is correct that the right to counsel and the right of access to the courts are interrelated,since the provision of counsel can be a means of accessing the courts.however,the two rights are not the same.the access claims at issue in lewis concerned the ability of convicted prisoners to attack their sentences,directly or collaterally,and to challenge the conditions of their confinement.at.by contrast,here we are concerned with the sixth amendment right of a pretrial detainee,in a case brought against him by the state,to utilize counsel in his defense.it is not clear to us what actual injury would even mean as applied to a pretrial detainee right to counsel.lewis describes actual injury as a showing that a legal claim had been frustrated or was being impeded due to the action of prison officials.lewis,at.the reason pretrial detainees need access to the courts and counsel is not to present claims to the courts,but to defend against the charges brought against them.see murray giarratano,d contrasting trial stage of a criminal proceeding,where the state by presenting witnesses and arguing to a jury attempts to strip from the defendant the presumption of innocence and convict him of a crime,with the stage where the defendant needs an attorney not as a shield to protect him against being haled into court by the state and stripped of his presumption of innocence,but rather as a sword to upset the prior determination of guilt internal quotation marks omitted.
in considering burdens on the sixth amendment right to counsel,we have not previously required that an incarcerated plaintiff demonstrate actual injury in order to have standing see perry leeke,d stating that denial of access to counsel for consultation is not subject to prejudice analysis wolfish,at remedial order affirmed where attorney visits were made in the general visiting rooms during visiting hours thereby entailing long delays,limiting the attorney time with his client,and totally vitiating confidentiality covino vermont dep t of,cir remand to determine whether detainee transfer to a more distant jail impaired his sixth amendment right to counsel smith coughlin,cir ban on visits by paralegal personnel to convicted inmate violated the sixth amendment although inmate could not prove compensable injury,he was entitled to nominal damages see also schoemehl,at restrictions on telephone access to attorneys by pretrial detainees were inadequately justified cobb,at upholding injunctive relief against pretrial transfer of detainees to distant facilities since such transfers caused substantial interference with the right to effective assistance of counsel.
having determined that lewis is inapplicable and that both the due process right of access to the courts and the sixth amendment right to counsel are implicated,we apply the standards set out in procunier,at.unjustifiably obstruct the availability of professional representation or other aspects of the right of access to the courts,and bell,at.when an institutional restriction on pretrial detainees infringes a specific constitutional guarantee,the sixth amendment,the practice must be evaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration,safeguarding institutional security we note that this circuit has adopted similar standards in wolfish,at,finding prison regulations restricting pretrial detainees contact with their attorneys to be unconstitutional where they unreasonably burdened the inmate opportunity to consult with his attorney and to prepare his defense.similarly,in cobb,at we enjoined prison transfers that significantly interfered with pretrial detainees access to counsel.see also covino,at citing cobb.the district court found that the defendants institutional security regulations are not the sole or even the primary reason for undue delays to attorney visits.benjamin iv,at.this finding was amply supported by the record.the department did not offer any justification for allowing family visits but not attorney visits during counts.no reasons were given why the department could not begin the process of bringing detainees to counsel rooms when an attorney first checks in to the facility,rather than when the attorney arrives at the visiting area.nor did the defendant present evidence explaining why a reservation policy could not be used in facilities with limited visiting space.
we so no reason to overturn judge baer conclusion that the reasonable measures ordered would safeguard the detainees constitutional rights at minimal cost to the department and without impairing its institutional concerns.turner,at.i f an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid governmental interests,a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.we find no error in judge baer conclusion that with respect to attorney visitation there was a continuing need for prospective relief to correct an ongoing denial of a federal right,and that the relief ordered was sufficiently narrow to satisfy the requirements of the plra.
red status and restraint status 
the department argues the district court erred in holding that red and restraint status are extraordinary restraints on the liberty of pretrial detainees that call for a reasonably prompt hearing and periodic review.see benjamin iv,at.it contends first that the detainees do not have a protected liberty interest that would trigger a right to procedural due process,and that,assuming arguendo they do,the procedural protections provided by the department are adequate.
l iberty from bodily restraint always has been recognized as the core of the liberty protected by the due process clause from arbitrary governmental action.youngberg romeo,d internal quotation marks omitted.the interest survives a criminal conviction and incarceration,pretrial detention,or involuntary civil commitment.see id.of course,a detainee liberty interest in freedom from restraint is highly qualified and must be balanced against the state reasons for restraining that liberty.see id.at.under bell,the supreme court seminal pretrial detention case,restrictions on pretrial detainees that implicate a liberty interest protected under the due process clause may not amount to punishment of the detainee.at.absent a showing of an expressed intent to punish,the determination whether a condition is imposed for a legitimate purpose or for the purpose of punishment generally will turn on whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may rationally be connected is assignable for it,and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned to it.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court found that d espite the formal characterization of restraint status and red status as a safety measure these sanctions have a severe and deleterious effect on pretrial detainees tantamount to punishment.benjamin iv,at.the court noted that restraint status and red status can prove to be a painful restraint on liberty,and that restraint status can result in injury.id.at.we see no basis to overturn the court ruling,particularly given that the court did not restrict the department use of such restraints or impose preconditions,but merely required reasonable procedural protections to ensure that such restrictions on liberty will be terminated reasonably soon if they have no justification.
the appellants also argue that the restraints are permissible because they do not impose atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,as required by sandin conner,d.
the district court concluded,joining our fellow circuits,that sandin does not apply to pretrial detainees see,resnick hayes,cir reading sandin to mean that a pretrial detainee,unlike a convicted prisoner,has a liberty interest in not being placed in disciplinary segregation rapier harris,cir distinguishing sandin because pretrial detainees are not under a sentence of confinement,and therefore it can not be said that they ought to expect whatever deprivation can be considered incident to serving such a sentence mitchell dupnik,cir because the sandin reference to ordinary incidents of prison life refers to the ordinary incidents of imprisonment under a sentence after conviction,pretrial detainees may only be subjected to disciplinary segregation if they are provided a due process hearing to determine whether they have in fact violated any rule whitford boglino,cir sandin does not apply to pretrial detainees,who may not be punished without due process of law regardless of state regulations.fuentes wagner,cir.sandin,which concern ed punishment of a sentenced prisoner,was inapplicable to convicted but not yet sentenced detainee,cert.denied,d.
sandin proclaimed a return to the principles of meachum fano,d.case where convicted prisoners challenged transfer from a medium to a maximum security grounded on the idea that a conviction extinguishes liberty interests 
given a valid conviction,the criminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of his liberty to the extent that the state may confine him and subject him to the rules of its prison system so long as the conditions of confinement do not otherwise violate the constitution the conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant liberty interest to empower the state to confine him in any of its prisons within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the state to impose.
id.at.emphases added.
moreover,sandin itself specifically distinguished pretrial detainees from convicted prisoners.the court rejected precedents from cases concerning pretrial detainees,noting that t he pun
