on july,prior to parkinson discharge from the hospital,the state police secured his prosthesis for possible use as evidence in any forthcoming criminal prosecution,and kept the prosthesis in its custody.this action was taken pursuant to instructions by cozzolino and leahy.parkinson was issued crutches and was sent to columbia county jail pending indictment.
during the pendency of the indictment,parkinson and his attorney requested that the prosthesis be returned to him,but leahy refused,asserting that the prosthesis had evidentiary value and thus had to be preserved.parkinson was then indicted on two counts of attempted aggravated assault on a police officer and one count of reckless endangerment in the first degree.he was released on bail,still without his prosthesis.trial commenced in the county court of columbia county in january.during trial,the state introduced the prosthesis into evidence,and the defense also used the prosthesis in an attempt to prove that parkinson was lying on the ground when he was shot.parkinson was convicted on all counts in the indictment.
at sentencing,parkinson asked the trial judge,the honorable john leaman,to order the return of his prosthesis.the state,however,argued that its retention was necessary pending any appeal taken by parkinson.judge leaman thus directed the state police to hold the leg.on april,parkinson was sentenced to a term of three to six years imprisonment.parkinson filed a notice of appeal on april.
on april,while incarcerated,parkinson wrote new york supreme court justice john connor,asking for assistance in having his prosthesis returned.in a written response to parkinson,justice connor said that he had converted parkinson letter into an order to show cause and had prepared a writ of mandamus directed at cozzolino,requiring her to show cause why she should not be held responsible for the return of evidentiary matter belonging to parkinson.on june,justice connor held a show cause hearing,and,by a decision and order dated july,ordered that the leg be returned to parkinson.justice connor found that retention of parkinson leg constitutes cruel and unusual punishment as defined by the eighth amendment of the constitution and that cozzolino deliberate indifference to parkinson need for his prosthetic leg,and the retention of the same,was arbitrary,illegal and inexcusable.
cozzolino and the state police then brought a special proceeding to vacate justice connor decision.justice anthony carpinello of the new york appellate division for the third department issued an order to show cause to vacate justice connor order,and held a hearing.during the hearing,a stipulation was agreed upon,pursuant to which cozzolino would return parkinson prosthesis and justice connor decision would not be made part of the record on parkinson criminal appeal to the appellate division.the prosthesis was returned to parkinson on october.ironically,at the same time,parkinson also received a new prosthesis.
