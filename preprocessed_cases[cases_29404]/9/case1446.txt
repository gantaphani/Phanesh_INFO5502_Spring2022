opinion of the court 
introduction 
plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their suit against the city of new york the city.they claim to be targets of a surveillance program that the new york city police department the nypd began in the wake of the september,terrorist attacks the program.plaintiffs allege that the program is based on the false and stigmatizing premise that muslim religious identity is a permissible proxy for criminality,and that muslim individuals,businesses,and institutions can therefore be subject to pervasive surveillance not visited upon individuals,businesses,and institutions of any other religious faith or the public at large.first am.compl.the complaint or compl.they bring this lawsuit to affirm the principle that individuals may not be singled out for intrusive investigation and pervasive surveillance that cause them continuing harm simply because they profess a certain faith.id.
in its narrowest form,this appeal raises two questions do plaintiffs themselves allegedly subject to a discriminatory surveillance program have standing to sue in federal court to vindicate their and rights if so,taking plaintiffs allegations as true,have they stated valid claims under the first and fourteenth amendments to our constitution both of these questions,which we answer yes,seem straightforward enough.lurking beneath the surface,however,are questions about equality,religious liberty,the role of courts in safeguarding our constitution,and the protection of our civil liberties and rights equally during wartime and in peace.
ii.background 
plaintiffs allegations 
lead plaintiff syed faraj hassan and others of or associated with the islamic faith collectively plaintiffs assert that,since january,the city has through the nypd conducted the program in secret to monitor the lives of muslims,their businesses,houses of worship,organizations,and schools in new york city and surrounding states,particularly new jersey.see pls.br.citing compl.as this case comes before us on the city motion to dismiss,we must take all facts alleged in plaintiffs complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences that arise therefrom in their favor.see.b.
the program 
plaintiffs contend that the nypd launched the program following the september,terrorist attacks with the goal of infiltra ting and monitor ing muslim life in and around new york city.compl.they claim that it target s muslim entities and individuals in new jersey for investigation solely because they are muslim or believed to be muslim rather than based upon evidence of wrongdoing.id.plaintiffs claim that the program,going on its tenth year when the complaint was filed,has never generated a single lead.id.
per the complaint,the nypd uses a variety of methods to spy on muslims.id.among the techniques that it employs are to snap pictures,take video,and collect license plate numbers of mosque congregants and to mount surveillance cameras on light poles,aimed at mosques,which o fficers can then control remotely with their computers and which generate footage used to help identify worshippers.id.plaintiffs also allege the nypd sends undercover officers some of which are called mosque crawlers and rakers into mosques,student organizations,businesses,and neighborhoods that it believes to be heavily muslim.id.by monitor ing sermons and conversations in mosques and surveil ling locations such as bookstores,bars,cafes,and nightclubs,officers document american muslim life in painstaking detail and report back to the nypd.id.
while plaintiffs believe that some of this surveillance activity is passive such as tak ing video and photographs at mosques,businesses,and schools,id,and recording the subject of conversations overheard at mosques,id,in other cases nypd officers more actively engage with the persons monitored.one alleged spying method of the latter type is to sen d undercover officers to locations to engage in pretextual conversations to elicit information from proprietors and patrons.id.officers also sometimes pose as members of certain groups and organizations under investigation.id.the complaint illustrates one such example where an nypd officer went on a rafting trip with a muslim students association msa and monitored and recorded how often the student participants on the trip prayed and their discuss ion of religious topics.id.
not only does the alleged program utilize numerous forms of surveillance,id,but that surveillance is also widespread.plaintiffs claim,for instance,that the nypd has strived to have an informant inside every mosque within a mile radius of new york city and has place d informants or undercover officers in all or virtually all msas at colleges and universities in new york,new jersey,connecticut,and pennsylvania without any indication whatsoever of criminal activity or any connection whatsoever to wrongdoing.id.in all,the nypd has allegedly surveill ed at least twenty mosques,fourteen restaurants,eleven retail stores,two grade schools and two msas,in addition to an untold number of individuals who own,operate,and visit those establishments.id.
plaintiffs claim that,in addition to singling out organizations and businesses for surveillance that in some way are visibly or openly affiliated with islam such as mosques or businesses with prayer mats or other islamic identifications,the program also intentionally targets muslims by using ethnicity as a proxy for faith.id.plaintiffs aver,for instance,that the nypd has designated countries constitut ing about of the world muslim population and american black muslim as ancestries of interest.id.but the program is still decidedly focused on religion.thus,rather than surveil all people and establishments with ancestries of interest,the nypd expressly chooses to exclude people and establishments with such ancestries if they are not muslim.id.this includes egyptians if they are coptic christians,syrians if they are jewish,or albanians if they are catholic or orthodox christian.id.conversely,plaintiffs claim that the nypd has examined other immigrant communities in newark,new jersey for the presence of muslims,such as the portuguese and brazilian immigrant communities notwithstanding that portugal and brazil are not found on the nypd list of ancestries.id.
reports and informational databases 
plaintiffs allege that the program has resulted in a series of reports documenting in detail the information obtained from the nypd surveillance of new jersey muslim communities.id.these includ e a report focusing on the muslim community in newark the newark report,more than twenty maps of the city of newark,noting the location of mosques and muslim businesses and the ethnic composition of the muslim community,id.analytical report s on every mosque within miles of new york city,id.and a weekly msa report on schools,including reports on rutgers new brunswick and rutgers newark,id.
the information and records collected and compiled are extensive and varied.among these are pictures,video,and license plate numbers of mosque congregants,id.intelligence about where religious schools are located,id.indications of religious affiliation and muslim patronage of shops,restaurants,and grocery stores,lists of businesses owned or frequented by muslims,and names of professors,scholars,and students affiliated with msas,id.the city also allegedly compiles databases of new muslim converts who take arabic names,as well as muslims who take names that are perceived to be western.id.
besides names and other identifying information of individuals,businesses,and organizations,the nypd reports include seemingly mundane and innocuous details about muslim community life in new jersey,such as flyers are posted in shops advertising for quran tutoring a picture of a mosque hangs in a grocery store a restaurant serves religious muslims customers visit a donuts after friday prayer a restaurant is located near a particular mosque employees or customers of establishments are observed wearing traditional clothing muslim prayer mats are hanging on the wall at an indian restaurant and a store posts a sign that it will be closed on friday in observance of friday prayer.id.finally,nypd officers have compiled the subject s and details of conversations overheard at mosques.id.in one report,for instance,they document ed conversations at twenty mosques,though n one of the information collected showed any indication of criminal activity.id.
fall out from the program disclosure to the public 
plaintiffs claim that,despite initial secrecy,public knowledge of the alleged program existence has become widespread in new jersey and elsewhere.id.they also contend that a number of the allegedly generated reports ha ve been widely publicized,id,and that each plaintiff has been either specifically named in an nypd spying report or is a member of at least one mosque or other association named in such a report,pls.br.citing compl.
plaintiffs have learned since the news broke,for instance,that the nypd newark report designates several of them as a location of concern,defined as,among other things,a location that individuals may find for illegal actions,and a location that has demonstrated a significant pattern of illegal activities.compl.similarly,the nypd iran report describes organizations believed to pose serious threats to new york city,such as hezbollah and hamas,along with a list of other locations in the vicinity of nyc,which include plaintiff muslim foundation mfi and masjid e ali mosque owned and operated by mfi,as well as three additional mosques attended by plaintiff hassan.id.
while plaintiffs allege that the program is stigmatizing by itself,they also claim these specific defamatory statements targeting them in particular have intensified their harms and that new york city officials have exacerbated these injuries by publicly acknowledg ing the program existence and describing it as focused on threats and as an attempt to document the likely whereabouts of terrorists.id.discussing the surveillance,former mayor bloomberg has stated publicly that w e doing the right thing.we will continue to do the right thing.id.and former police commissioner kelly has said that w e going to continue to do what we have to do to protect the c ity.id.plaintiffs state that these and other official proclamations,which falsely suggest that muslims alone present a unique law enforcement threat,indicate that city officials believe the nypd targeting of muslims for surveillance on the basis of their religion is appropriate and will continue.id.
plaintiffs also contend that,in large part because of the program alleged stigmatizing and reputational consequences,the surveillance has affected their worship and religious activities.for example,plaintiff hassan,a soldier in the army who has worked in military intelligence,asserts that h e has decreased his mosque attendance significantly because of his belief that being closely affiliated with mosques under surveillance by law enforcement will jeopardize his ability to hold a security clearance and will tarnish his reputation among his fellow soldiers and diminish their trust in him.id.likewise,plaintiffs moiz mohammed,jane doe,and soofia tahir state that they now avoid or have avoided discussing their faith openly or at msa meetings for fear of being watched and documented,id,and plaintiff mohammad alleges that t he stigma now attached to being a muslim member of the msa has caused him to avoid discussing his faith or his msa participation in public and to avoid praying in places where might see him doing so,id.
the individual plaintiffs are not the only ones affected.the organizational plaintiffs allege that the program has undermined their ability to fulfill their mission s by deterring potential members from joining and casting doubt on their ability to maintain the confidentiality of their membership.pls.br.citing compl.according to the complaint,two mosques that are members of plaintiff council of imams in new jersey,and that are named in the nypd newark report,have seen a decline in attendance as a result of the nypd surveillance because their congregants can no longer worship freely knowing that agents or informants are likely in their midst.compl.similarly,a s affinity student groups,msas subject to surveillance are diminished in their ability to establish viable student organizations that students will feel secure joining and participating in and are less able to embark upon integral partnerships with campus administrators and other organizations and to fulfill the spiritual needs of their members in a confidential manner.id.and plaintiff mfi has changed its religious and educational programming to avoid controversial topics likely to stigmatize its membership further and to attract additional nypd attention.id.
finally,several plaintiffs also contend that financial harm has accompanied their alleged religious,reputational,and stigmatizing injuries.for example,plaintiffs all shop body inside outside and unity beef sausage company claim that the surveillance has damaged their business es by scaring away customers,id,and plaintiffs zaimah abdur rahim and abdul hakim abdullah allege that the publication of the address and a photograph on the internet of their home in connection with the nypd surveillance has decreased its value and diminished its prospects for sale,id.also,two of plaintiff council of imams in new jersey member mosques have witnessed l osses in financial support,which further harm s both mosques ability to fulfill their religious missions.id.
district court 
in june,plaintiffs sued the city pursuant to and monell department of social services of the city of new york,for discriminating against them as muslims in violation of the free exercise and establishment clauses of the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.they seek expungement of any unlawfully obtained records pertaining to them,a judgment declaring that the city has violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights,an order enjoining their future discriminatory surveillance,and damages.
the district court granted the city motion to dismiss the complaint in february pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of standing and federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.first,the court held that plaintiffs failed to identify any cognizable let alone one fairly traceable to the city surveillance.second,it concluded that plaintiffs failed to state a claim because t he more likely explanation for the surveillance was a desire to locate budding terrorist conspiracies than a desire to discriminate.hassan city of new york,cv,wl,at.it therefore entered judgment in the city favor.plaintiffs now appeal these rulings.
iii.standing 
as did the district court,we begin with plaintiffs standing to have a federal court decide their claims.standing to sue is required for jurisdiction in a federal forum.derived from article iii of our constitution,it is the threshold inquiry in every case,one for which t he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proof.lujan defenders of wildlife.analyzing this requirement entails a inquiry.has at least one plaintiff suffered an injury in fact id.if so,is that injury fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant id.at alterations in original quoting simon.welfare rights.and if the answer to both is yes,will that injury be likely redressed by a favorable decision id.at quoting simon,at.
when answering these questions,we must assume that the party asserting federal jurisdiction is correct on the legal merits of his claim,that a decision on the merits would be favorable,and that the requested relief would be granted.cutler dep t of health human,internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,to withstand a facial attack at the stage,a plaintiff need only plausibly allege facts establishing each constitutional requirement.lewis casey.
injury in fact 
a plaintiff alleges when it claims that it has,or is in imminent danger of having,suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural and hypothetical.lujan,at quoting whitmore arkansas,u,internal quotation marks omitted.the burden is low,requiring nothing more than an identifiable trifle of harm.joint stock soc y udv,cir alito,quoting united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap.
while plaintiffs point to at least four other injuries they contend also meet this requirement,t he indignity of being singled out by a government for special burdens on the basis of one religious calling,locke davey,scalia,dissenting,is enough to get in the courthouse door.unequal treatment is a type of personal injury that ha s long been recognized as judicially cognizable,heckler mathews,and virtually every circuit court has as has the supreme court that a discriminatory classification is itself a penalty,saenz roe,and thus qualifies as an actual injury for standing purposes,where a citizen right to equal treatment is at stake.see also ne.chapter of associated contractors of am.city of jacksonville,the injury in fact is the denial of equal treatment 
none of the city arguments to the contrary are persuasive.first,its argument that unequal treatment is only injurious when it involves a tangible benefit like college admission or social security takes too cramped a view of article iii injury requirement.as the supreme court has noted,
discrimination itself,by perpetuating archaic and stereotypic notions or by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group as innately inferior and therefore as less worthy participants in the political community,can cause serious noneconomic injuries to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment solely because of their membership in a disfavored group.
heckler,at citation omitted quoting.for women hogan,see also,mardell harleysville life ins,cir per curiam a victim of discrimination suffers a dehumanizing injury as real as,and often of far more severe and lasting harm than,a blow to the jaw.internal quotation marks omitted.after all,t he fundamental concern of discrimination law is to redress the dignitary affront that decisions based on group characteristics represent,not to guarantee specific economic expectancies.sandberg kpmg peat marwick,cir.
the city next argues that plaintiffs have suffered no because it has not overtly condemned the muslim religion.city br.this argument does not stand the test of time.our nation history teaches the uncomfortable lesson that those not on discrimination receiving end can all too easily gloss over the badge of inferiority inflicted by unequal treatment itself.closing our eyes to the real and ascertainable harms of discrimination inevitably leads to regret.compare plessy ferguson,if enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority,it is not by reason of anything found in the act,but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it,with brown bd.of,to separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.
moving on,we are similarly unpersuaded by the city alternative argument that plaintiffs alleged injuries are not particularized.it is true that only a complainant who possesses something more than a general interest in the proper execution of the laws is in a position to secure judicial intervention.stark wickard.but where a plaintiff is asserting his or her own equality right,a claim of discrimination,even where it affects a broad class,is not an abstract concern or generalized grievance.ad hoc comm.of concerned teachers greenburgh union free sch,cir quoting warth seldin.because plaintiffs in this case claim to be the very targets of the allegedly unconstitutional surveillance,they are unquestionably affect ed in a personal and individual way.lujan,at.
further,that hundreds or thousands or even millions of other persons may have suffered the same injury does not change the individualized nature of the asserted rights and interests at stake.see,sch.dist.schempp,calling religious freedom an individual right adarand constructors,peña,referring to a citizen personal right to equal protection of the laws emphasis in original.standing is easily recognized,for instance,in the case of a widespread mass tort,even though large numbers of individuals suffer the same injury.fec akins.and for good reason t o deny standing to persons who are in fact injured,simply because many others are also injured,would mean that the most injurious and widespread government actions could be questioned by nobody.massachusetts epa,emphasis omitted quoting scrap,at.harm to all even in the nuanced world of standing law can not be logically equated with harm to no one.
against this background,the city reliance on laird tatum,is misplaced.the plaintiffs there alleged only a chilling effect on third parties speech caused by the mere existence,without more,of governmental investigative and activity.id.at.plaintiffs here,by contrast,allege that the discriminatory manner by which the program is administered itself causes them direct,ongoing,and immediate harm.because standing is only a problem where no harm independent of the first amendment is alleged,gill pidlypchak,cir calabresi,and laird does stand for the proposition that public surveillance is either per se immune from constitutional attack or subject to a heightened requirement of injury,that case narrow holding,see at,does reach the facts of this case.
indeed,in several cases we have recognized that,while surveillance in public places may not of itself violate any privacy right it can still violate other rights that give rise to cognizable harms.see,hall.state police,f d,cir although it may be assumed that the state may arrange for photographing all suspicious persons entering the bank,it does not follow that its criterion for selection may be racially based,in the absence of a proven compelling state interest.citation omitted anderson davila.cir roth,while public governmental surveillance alone was not cognizable,identical surveillance conducted in retaliation for one exercise of first amendment rights gave rise to a separate injury cognizable under article iii.
fair traceability 
the second requirement of is a causal connection between a defendant alleged conduct and the plaintiff harm.see lujan,at.the city contends that plaintiffs have failed to satisfy this requirement because the associated press ap,not the nypd,revealed the program to the public and did so without the city permission.in short,it argues,what you do know ca hurt you.and,if you do know,do shoot us.shoot the messenger.
aside from its distortions of the factual record the city argument is legally untenable because to repeat the discrimination itself is the legally cognizable injury.indeed,discrimination often has been likened to a dignitary tort,see,curtis loether,quoting charles gregory harry kalven,cases and materials on torts ed,where t he tort is said to be damage itself,dan dobbs,dobbs law of remedies,at ed.and,as with other torts in this category,the affront to the other dignity is as keenly felt by one who only knows after the event that an indignity has been perpetrated upon him as by one who is conscious of it while it is being perpetrated.restatement first of torts cmt.e.because we view the claimed discrimination itself as the primary injury alleged,it follows from our definition of injury in fact that the city is the cause of that injury rather than any member of the press.ne.chapter of associated contractors,at.
finally,even if only the collateral consequences of the discrimination rather than the unequal treatment itself could count as article iii injury,the city wrongly equat es injury fairly traceable to the defendant with injury as to which the defendant actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.constitution party of aichele,cir second alteration in original quoting bennett spear.that is incorrect.t here is room for concurrent causation in the analysis of standing,and,indeed,an indirect causal relationship will suffice,so long as there is a fairly traceable connection.id.citation omitted quoting toll township of readington,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also block meese,d.scalia,t he question of core,constitutional requires no more than de facto causality.pitt news fisher,cir but for causation sufficient to establish traceability to establish standing.
redressability 
the last requirement of article iii standing is redressability,which requires the plaintiff to show that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at quoting simon,at.redressability is easily established in a case where,as here,the alleged injury arises from an identifiable discriminatory policy.smith meese,cir.while we can not predict the exact nature of the possible relief without a full development of the facts,an order enjoining the policy and requiring investigation and enforcement would redress the injury.id.
as for past harms,the potential avenues for redress depend on how a particular plaintiff injury shows itself.those plaintiffs able to prove actual injur ies,those other than the abstract value of the constitutional right s,such as losses or emotional distress may recover compensatory damages.memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,see also carey piphus.for other plaintiffs,the major purpose of the suit may be to obtain a public declaration that the y are right and w ere improperly treated,see restatement second of torts cmt.c,along with nominal damages that serve as a symbolic vindication of their constitutional right s,schneider county of san diego,cir quoting floyd laws,cir.given the range of available remedies,redressability is easily satisfied.
confident in our jurisdiction to hear this case,we now turn to the merits of plaintiffs constitutional claims and begin with equal protection.
iv.constitutional claims 
equal protection claim 
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to our constitution provides that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.plaintiffs claim the city is contravening that mandate and violating their rights by surveilling them pursuant to a program that investigates persons not because of any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing or other neutral criterion but solely because of their muslim religious affiliation.
a claim of selective investigation by the police draws on ordinary equal protection standards.flowers city of minneapolis,cir quoting wayte united states.as with other claims,we ask whether the city intentionally discriminates against a reasonably identifiable group and whether that intentional discrimination is nonetheless legally justified.
do plaintiffs plausibly allege intentional discrimination 
to state an claim,plaintiffs must allege and ultimately prove intentional discrimination.washington davis,pers.adm r of feeney.it is not enough for them to allege that they are muslim and that the nypd surveilled more muslims than members of any other religion.see ashcroft iqbal.rather,plaintiffs religious affiliation must have been a substantial factor in that different treatment.davis,at feeney,at.
plaintiffs plausibly allege a surveillance program with a facially religious classification.
there are a variety of theories to consider in an claim of this type.first,plaintiffs could point to a policy that is facially discriminatory,meaning that the policy by its own terms singles out muslims for different treatment.ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law ed see,adarand,at.second,they could identify a policy that either shows no classification on its face or else indicates a classification which seems to be legitimate,yet one that nypd officers apply to muslims with a greater degree of severity than other religious groups.rotunda novak,supra,see,yick wo hopkins.or,third,plaintiffs could identify a facially neutral policy that the city purposefully designed to impose different burdens on muslims and that even if applied evenhandedly does in fact have the intended adverse effect.rotunda novak,supra,see,village of arlington heights met.hous.dev.
here,plaintiffs seek to proceed by way of the first of these three methods,arguing their allegations leave no doubt that the program relies on an express classification of muslims for disfavored treatment.see pls.br.this is a viable legal theory.where a plaintiff can point to a facially discriminatory policy,the protected trait by definition plays a role in the process,inasmuch as the policy explicitly classifies people on that basis.cmty.servs.wind gap mun,cir quoting dibiase smithkline beecham,cir.put another way,direct evidence of intent is supplied by the policy itself.massarsky motors,cir sloviter,dissenting.
the city nonetheless attacks the plausibility of the allegations,arguing that plaintiffs point to only conclusory allegations spread throughout the c omplaint,which as a matter of law can not be credited.city br.it further asserts that,o nce the conclusory allegations are pushed aside,the remaining factual allegations are insufficient to find a facially discriminatory classification.id.
we disagree with this characterization.while the city compares plaintiffs claims to the conclusory allegations in iqbal,those were far from what we have here.in our case,plaintiffs allege specifics about the program,including when it was conceived january,where the city implemented it in the new york metropolitan area with a focus on new jersey,and why it has been employed because of the belief that muslim religious identity is a permissible proxy for criminality,compl.the complaint also articulates the variety of methods by which the surveillance is carried out.see,id.tak ing videos and photographs at mosques,businesses and schools id.monitor ing muslim websites,listservs,and chat rooms id.snap ping pictures,tak ing video,and collect ing license plate numbers of congregants as they arrive at mosques to pray id.us ing undercover officers to monitor daily life in muslim neighborhoods and sermons and conversations in mosques id.plac ing informants or undercover officers in all or virtually all msas.these allegations are hardly bare assertions amount ing to nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a constitutional discrimination claim.iqbal,at quoting bell atl.twombly,at.
despite the city demand for more information about when,by whom,and how the policy was enacted and where it was written down,the twombly iqbal duo have not inaugurated an era of evidentiary pleading.santana cook cnty.bd.of review,emphasis in original see also twombly,at rejecting the proposition that notice pleading require s heightened fact pleading of specifics.nor do factual allegations become impermissible labels and conclusions simply because the additional factual allegations explaining and supporting the articulated factual allegations are not also included.in re niaspan antitrust,d,internal quotation marks omitted.while it is possible that plaintiffs will ultimately falter in meeting their burden of proof,the collection of evidence is the object of discovery.
moreover,even if the pleading of evidence rather than grounds for relief were required which it is not,the complaint includes numerous examples of persons that the nypd is surveilling because of their religious affiliation see,compl.the masjid and masjid ali muslim mosques id.msas for rutgers university campuses at newark and new brunswick id.all body shop inside outside id.unity beef sausage id.the masjid e ali mosque id.al hidaayah academy id.al muslimaat academy.these allegations supplement those that the nypd surveil led at least twenty mosques,fourteen restaurants,eleven retail stores,two grade schools and two msas in new jersey,id.creat ed over twenty maps of the city of newark,and attempted to place an informant inside every mosque within a mile radius of new york city as well as prepared an analytical report on every mosque within miles,id.
finally,because plaintiffs allege that all of these persons and entities were surveilled without any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing as noted above,they assert that,i n all its years of operation,the program has never generated a single criminal lead,id,this case can be easily contrasted with others where the investigation at issue was almost certainly explained by a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing george rehiel,cir the tsa officials suspicion was an obvious alternative explanation for their conduct,which negates any inference of retaliation.that we might be able to conjure up some motive to explain the city alleged conduct is not a valid basis for dismissal.it is only when a defendant plausible alternative explanation is so convincing to render the plaintiff explanation im plausible that a court may dismiss a complaint.starr baca,cir emphasis in original.
in sum,because plaintiffs have pleaded ample factual content that allows us to draw the reasonable inference that the city is liable for the misconduct alleged,iqbal,at,we decline to dismiss their complaint on the ground that they have not plausibly alleged a surveillance program with a facially discriminatory classification.
ii intentional discrimination does not require an invidious motive.
the city also argues that,even assuming plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a facial classification based on religious affiliation,their allegations of discriminatory purpose are implausible because the more likely explanation for the nypd actions is public safety rather than discrimination based upon religion.city br.its reasoning is essentially the surveillance is alleged to have begun just after the september,terrorist attacks,and t he police could not have monitored new jersey for muslim terrorist activities without monitoring the muslim community itself,id.alteration in original quoting hassan,wl,at.
here the city problem there a difference between intent and motive.a defendant acts intentionally when he desires a particular result,without reference to the reason for such desire.motive,on the other hand,is the reason why the defendant desires the result.harry sanger richards et,american law and procedure,at.in other words,intent asks whether a person acts intentionally or accidentally,while motive asks,if he did it intentionally,why did he do it john william salmond,jurisprudence,at ed emphasis in original see also black law dictionary bryan garner,ed.while motive is the inducement to do some act,intent is the mental resolution or determination to do it.this fundamental distinction between motive and intent runs all through the law.johnson phelan,cir posner,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
in focusing on what the city contends was its legitimate purpose of analy zing potential security threats and vulnerabilities,city br,it wrongly assumes that invidious motive is a necessary element of discriminatory intent.it is not.all you need is that the state actor meant to single out a plaintiff because of the protected characteristic itself.see,snyder louisiana,bray alexandria women health clinic.in a case,for instance,the intent which triggers a finding of unconstitutionality is not an intent to harm black students,but simply an intent to bring about or maintain segregated schools.united states sch.dist.of omaha,cir.likewise,a prosecutor who strikes a juror on the basis of race discriminates intentionally even if motivated by a sincere desire to win his case.see,georgia mccollum.
so too here.while the absence of a legitimate motive may bear on whether the challenged surveillance survives the appropriate level of scrutiny,intentional discrimination need not be motivated by ill will,enmity,or hostility to contravene the equal protection clause.floyd city of new york,d,quoting ferrill.parker,cir see also cmtys.for equity.high sch.athletic ass n,cir distinguishing between an intent to treat two groups differently and an intent to harm garza county of los angeles,cir kozinski,concurring in part and dissenting in part t here can be intentional discrimination without an invidious motive.thus,even if nypd officers were subjectively motivated by a legitimate purpose no matter how sincere,they intentionally discriminated if they would have surveilled plaintiffs had they not been muslim.
is the alleged discrimination nonetheless legally justified 
once a plaintiff demonstrates treatment different from others with whom he or she is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment is the result of intentional discrimination,the adequacy of the reasons for that discrimination are separately assessed at equal protection second step under the appropriate standard of review.secsys,llc vigil,cir.to apply this traditional legal framework to the facts of this case,we must determine the appropriate standard of review,rational basis,intermediate scrutiny,or strict scrutiny and then ask whether it is met 
level of scrutiny 
at a minimum,intentional discrimination against any identifiable group is subject to review,which requires the classification to be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.johnson cohen,cir.where a or suspect classification is at issue,however,the challenged action must survive intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny.intermediate scrutiny applicable to classes like gender and illegitimacy requires that a classification be substantially related to an important governmental objective.clark jeter.in contrast,strict scrutiny applicable to suspect classes like race and nationality is an even more demanding standard,which requires the classification be narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.gratz bollinger.strict and intermediate scrutiny which we collectively refer to as heightened scrutiny to distinguish them from the far less demanding review in effect set up a presumption of invalidity that the defendant must rebut.
perhaps surprisingly,neither our court nor the supreme court has considered whether classifications based on religious trigger heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.see steven calabresi abe salander,religion and the equal protection clause why the constitution requires school vouchers,kenji yoshino,suspect symbols the literary argument for heightened scrutiny for gays,colum.we therefore confront a question of first impression in this circuit.
although the answer to this question is not found in binding precedent,we hardly write on a clean slate.to start,it has long been implicit in the supreme court decisions that religious classifications are treated like others traditionally subject to heightened scrutiny,such as those based on race.united states.armstrong,naming race and religion as examples of unjustifiable standard s for a decision whether to prosecute quoting oyler boles,u,burlington ford,referring to race and religion as classif ications along suspect lines friedman rogers,calling race,religion,and alienage inherently suspect distinctions city of new orleans dukes,same united states batchelder,listing race and religion as unjustifiable standard s under our constitution quoting oyler,at steele louisville nashville,murphy,concurring the constitution voices its disapproval whenever economic discrimination is applied under authority of law against any race,creed or color.
this line of comment can be traced back to the famous footnote four of the supreme court decision in carolene products,where the court suggested that discriminatory legislation should be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the fourteenth amendment if directed at particular religious,or national,or racial minorities.united states carolene prods,citations omitted emphasis added.and even before carolene products,the court considered religious discrimination to be a classic example of a denial of the equal protection of the laws to the less favored classes.am.sugar ref.louisiana,see also hall de cuir,directors of schools in iowa can not deny a youth of proper age admission to any particular school on account of nationality,color,or religion.
it is true that these statements are dicta.but even so,supreme court dicta requires serious consideration,united states marzzarella,cir,especially when,as here,we encounter a succession of statements from the court,myers loudoun cnty.pub,cir motz,concurring in the judgment.moreover,this dicta is consistent with our own.connelly steel valley sch,cir identifying race,religion,and alienage as inherently suspect distinctions quoting schumacher nix,cir internal quotation marks omitted united states dejesus,cir fuentes,referring in dictum to religious affiliation as a protected class tolchin supreme court of new jersey,cir naming race,religion or alienage as suspect distinctions united states friedland,cir t he government can not refuse to move for a downward departure under e if base d on a constitutionally suspect ground such as race or religion.
we also are guided by other appellate courts that have subjected classifications to heightened scrutiny.for instance,both the eighth and tenth circuit courts have held without fanfare that r eligion is a suspect classification,abdulhaseeb calbone,cir patel bureau of prisons,cir,and the second and ninth have done the same in so many words,see,united states brown,cir calabresi,holding that the exercise of a peremptory strike due to a venire member religious affiliation would violate batson kentucky,because religious classifications trigger strict scrutiny christian sci.reading room jointly maintained city of san francisco,cir it seems clear that an individual religion meets the requirements for treatment as a suspect class,amended,cir 
today we join these courts and hold that intentional discrimination based on religious affiliation must survive heightened review.before turning more fully to our reasoning,however,we pause to reiterate that the term heightened scrutiny,as we use it,encompasses both intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny.because the city bears the burden of production and proof with respect to both,see infra part iv a,we need not and should determine in connection with its motion to dismiss which of the two applies,and we leave that question for the district court in the first instance when and if it becomes necessary to decide it.
in designating a particular classification as suspect or under the equal protection clause,the supreme court generally considers a variety of factors grouped around the central idea of whether the discrimination embodies a gross unfairness that is so sufficiently inconsistent with the ideals of equal protection to term it invidious.watkins army,cir en banc norris,concurring in the judgment.among these are whether the class is defined by a n immutable trait that frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society and whether the class has been saddled with unique disabilities because of prejudice or inaccurate stereotypes.id.at quoting frontiero richardson,plurality opinion.but while these factors are those most often considered,n o single talisman can define those groups likely to be the target of classifications offensive to the fourteenth amendment experience,not abstract logic,must be the primary guide.city of cleburne cleburne living,marshall,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
courts first have looked with particular suspicion on discrimination based on immutable human attributes.parham hughes,plurality opinion.accordingly,a classification is more likely to receive heightened scrutiny if it discriminates against individuals based on a characteristic that they either can not realistically change or ought not be compelled to change because it is fundamental to their identities.see,baskin bogan,cir posner,framing this issue as whether the unequal treatment is based on some immutable or at least tenacious characteristic of the people discriminated against as opposed to a characteristic that is easy for a person to change,such as the length of his or her fingernails watkins,at norris,concurring in the judgment t he supreme court is willing to treat a trait as effectively immutable if changing it would involve great difficulty,such as requiring a major physical change or a traumatic change of identity.
religious affiliation falls within this category.as we have recognized in the immigration context religious affiliation is typically seen as capable of being changed,yet of such fundamental importance that individuals should not be required to modify it.ghebrehiwot attorney of,cir quoting escobar gonzalez,cir see also baskin,at posner,listing religion as an example of a deep psychological commitment that would qualify for heightened scrutiny.moreover,while some immutable characteristics,such as intellectual disability,are so often correlated with a person ability to participate in society that we frequently deem them to be constitutionally permissible bases for discrimination,see baskin,at,a person religious affiliation is at the other end of that spectrum.
religious discrimination,by its very nature,has long been thought odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.bell maryland,goldberg,concurring quoting hirabayashi united states.state bd.of educ.barnette,for jefferson and those who followed him,r eligious minorities as well as religious majorities were to be equal in the eyes of the political state.president james madison,religious freedom a memorial and remonstrance against the general assessment,in a bill establishing provision for the teachers of the christian religion,presented to the general assembly of virginia,at the session of a just government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property by neither invading the equal rights of any sect,nor suffering any sect to invade those of another.
courts also are more likely to subject classifications that are closely associated with inequality to a more searching inquiry.windsor united states,cir,aff on other grounds.thus,if the classification is accompanied by a history of discrimination based on archaic and overbroad assumptions,roberts jaycees,or if it has been traditionally used as a tool for the oppression and subordination of minority groups,see,city of richmond croson,plurality opinion,heightened scrutiny often is more appropriately applied.
the history of religious discrimination in the united states is intertwined with that based on other protected characteristics,including national origin and race saint francis coll.al khazraji,noting that t he ninth edition of the encyclopedia britannica referred to arabs,jews,and other ethnic groups such as germans,hungarians,and greeks,as separate races citations omitted fong yue ting united states,referring to chinese laborers as of a distinct race and religion in re halladjian,a hindoo differs in color no less from a chinaman than from an anglo saxon khaled beydoun,between muslim and white the legal construction of arab american identity,ann.surv.am,noting that the conflation of arab and muslim identity was deeply entrenched within the courts during the naturalization era and that islam was treated as an identity.
it is thus unsurprising that tampering with religious affiliation brings into play the same concerns of inequality.though n othing but the most telling of personal experiences in religious persecution suffered by our forebears could have planted our belief in liberty of religious opinion any more deeply in our heritage,schempp,at citation omitted,we have struggled to guarantee religious equality since our nation founding.see generally everson bd.of educ.of ewing,shaare tefila congregation cobb,schware bd.of bar exam rs of,murdock pennsylvania.different religious groups have borne the brunt of majority oppression during different times,and the battle against religious prejudice continues.see,patriot act of,a,stat.the acts of violence that have been taken against arab and muslim americans since the september,attacks against the united states should be and are condemned by all americans who value freedom.brief in support of appellants by amici curiae the asian american legal defense education fund other non governmental organizations supporting civil rights for american muslims.
in light of this history,distinctions between citizens on religious grounds pose a particularly acute danger of stigma and stirred animosities.bd.of educ.of kiryas joel vill.sch.dist.grumet,kennedy,concurring in the judgment see also wright rockefeller,douglas,dissenting when racial or religious lines are drawn by the state,the multiracial,multireligious communities that our constitution seeks to weld together as one become separatist antagonisms that relate to race or to religion are generated kunz new york,jackson,dissenting if any two subjects are intrinsically incendiary and divisive,they are race and religion.that c enturies of experience testify that laws aimed at one religious group generate hatreds and prejudices which rapidly spread beyond control,am.commc ns ass n,douds,black,dissenting,also counsels in favor of heightened scrutiny.
a final relevant consideration is whether the legislative and executive branches have concluded that a form of discrimination is inherently invidious.in holding gender to be a classification deserving of intermediate scrutiny,the supreme court noted,for instance,in frontiero that,because congress is a coequal branch of government,its conclu sion that classifications based upon sex are inherently invidious was not without significance to the question then under consideration.at.
many of the same statutes that foreclose discrimination,including title vii of the civil rights act of cited by the frontiero court,see id.at,also forbid religious discrimination.see,making it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate based on race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.and from the passage of the civil rights act of to those designed to strengthen national security in our world that commitment to the sacrosanct concept of equality among all religious groups,see patriot act of a,is embodied throughout the.see,a employment b,b banking fair housing a peace corps service u.air transportation and use of private airports.
the same commitment to religious equality is seen in the pronouncements of the executive branch,from those of our first president,george washington,to our current president,barack obama.see,president george washington,address to the members of the new church in baltimore,in jared sparks,life of george washington commander in chief of the american armies to which are added,his diaries and speeches and various miscellaneous papers relating to his habits opinions,in this enlightened age,and in this land of equal liberty,it is our boast that a man religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws,nor deprive him of the right of attaining and holding the highest offices that are known in the united states.president harry truman,special message to the congress on civil rights,racial,religious and other invidious forms of discrimination deprive the individual of an equal chance to develop and utilize his talents and to enjoy the rewards of his efforts.president theodore roosevelt,sixth annual message to congress,w e must treat with justice and good will all immigrants who come here under the law,w hether they are catholic or protestant,jew or gentile president barack obama,state of the union address,w e believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being,regardless of race or religion,creed or sexual orientation.
for these reasons,we conclude that classifications on the basis of religious affiliation are subject to heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause.
ii.evaluation of means and ends 
the final step in evaluating an claim is to examine the challenged action means and ends and the fit between the two.the specific analysis differs depending on the level of scrutiny that applies.the higher the scrutiny required,the more persuasive must be the governmental objective and the snugger the fit.thus,while it usually matters little for purposes of review that a governmental interest is not exceedingly important or that other means are better suited to the achievement of governmental ends,heightened scrutiny demands a much stronger justification and a much tighter relationship between the means employed and the ends served.tuan anh nguyen ins,dissenting.
also increasingly demanding is the standard of proof.while the standard usually puts the burden of proof on the classification opponent and permits a court to hypothesize interests that might support the governmental distinctions,id.at emphasis added citing heller doe,ret.bd.fritz,the burden of justification under both intermediate and strict scrutiny is demanding and rests entirely on the state,united states virginia.see also hogan,at discussing the standard and burden for intermediate scrutiny fisher of at austin,strict scrutiny.
here,the city argues that a comprehensive understanding of the makeup of the community would help the nypd figure out where to look and where not to look in the event it received information that an islamist radicalized to violence may be secreting himself in new jersey.city br.it even goes so far as to assert that it would be irresponsible for the nypd not to have an understanding of the varied mosaic that is the muslim community to respond to such threats.id.emphasis added.but because heightened scrutiny applies in this case,we can not accept the city invitation to dismiss plaintiffs complaint based on its assurance that the program is justified by and concerns.rather,the burden of producing evidence to overcome heightened scrutiny presumption of unconstitutionality is that of the city,aiken city of memphi s,cir en banc when,as here,a affirmative action plan is subjected to strict scrutiny,the party defending the plan bears the burden of producing evidence that the plan is constitutional,and must be met after its motion to dismiss.
to be clear,we acknowledge that a principal reason for a government existence is to provide security.but while we do not question the legitimacy of the city interest,t he gravity of the threat alone can not be dispositive of questions concerning what means law enforcement officers may employ to pursue a given purpose.city of indianapolis edmond.rather,heightened scrutiny requires that the relationship between the asserted justification and discriminatory means employed be substantiated by objective evidence.patrolmen benevolent ass of new york city of new york,cir.m ere speculation or conjecture is insufficient,as are appeals to common sense which might be inflected by stereotypes,reynolds city of chicago,cir posner.see also lomack city of newark,cir citing with approval patrolmen benevolent ass n,at.
and e ven in the limited circumstance where a suspect or classification is permissible to further an important or compelling state interest,the government is still constrained in how it may pursue that end.grutter bollinger,second alteration in original quoting shaw hunt,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.while a classification does not fail review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality,heller,at internal quotation marks omitted,strict scrutiny requires that the classification at issue fit with greater precision than any alternative means,wygant jackson bd.of,plurality opinion citing john hart ely,the constitutionality of reverse racial discrimination,chi.intermediate scrutiny falls somewhere in between the two,asking if there is a direct,substantial relationship between objective and means.hogan,at.
no matter how tempting it might be to do otherwise,we must apply the same rigorous standards even where national security is at stake.we have learned from experience that it is often where the asserted interest appears most compelling that we must be most vigilant in protecting constitutional rights.h istory teaches that grave threats to liberty often come in times of urgency,when constitutional rights seem too extravagant to endure.skinner ry.labor execs.ass n,marshall,dissenting see also grutter,at scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part the lesson of korematsu united states,is that national security constitutes a pressing public necessity,though the government use of a suspect classification to advance that objective must be appropriately tailored.skinner,at marshall,dissenting the world war ii cases and the red scare and internal subversion cases are only the most extreme reminders that when we allow fundamental freedoms to be sacrificed in the name of real or perceived exigency,we invariably come to regret it.citations omitted.
today it is acknowledged,for instance,that the administration and military authorities infringed the constitutional rights of japanese americans during world war ii by placing them under curfew and removing them from their west coast homes and into internment camps.yet when these citizens pleaded with the courts to uphold their constitutional rights,we passively accepted the government representations that the use of such classifications was necessary to the national interest.hirabayashi,korematsu.in doing so,we failed to recognize that the discriminatory treatment of approximately persons of japanese ancestry was fueled not by military necessity but unfounded fears.see united states hohri,see also act to implement recommendations on the commission of wartime relocation and internment of civilians,a,stat.given that unconditional deference to the government invocation of emergency has a lamentable place in our history,patrolmen benevolent ass n,at citing korematsu,at,the past should not preface yet again bending our constitutional principles merely because an interest in national security is invoked.
in sum,because plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the city engaged in intentional discrimination against a protected class,and because that classification creates a presumption of unconstitutionality that remains the city obligation to rebut,plaintiffs have stated a claim under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
first amendment claims 
we finally reach plaintiffs claims under the religion clauses of the first amendment.they allege violations of both the establishment clause and the free exercise clause,which respectively prohibit the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.const.amend.
plaintiffs bring both claims under the theory that the first amendment demands strict governmental neutrality among religious sects.while it is intuitive that discriminatory conduct that inhibits a person full religious expression may run afoul of the free exercise clause of the first amendment,under the facts here the same is counterintuitive for the establishment clause,as the latter tend s to involve challenge s to governmental endorsement.catholic league for religious civil rights city of san francisco,cir en banc emphasis added.but see.christian weaver,cir mcconnell,s tatutes involving discrimination on the basis of religion,including interdenominational discrimination,are subject to heightened scrutiny whether they arise under the free exercise clause,the establishment clause,or the equal protection clause citations omitted.however,a full discussion of either religion clause and its application to our case is unnecessary,as we confine ourselves to the city arguments raised in its motion to dismiss.those arguments are unpersuasive.
the city first argues that,according to a three month fact finding investigation by the new jersey attorney general,the surveillance program did not violate new jersey civil or criminal law.city br.that this argument could defeat a federal constitutional claim,let alone on a motion to dismiss,borders on the frivolous.aside from a court inability to consider such matters extraneous to the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure b,it is the united states constitution not the civil or criminal law of new jersey that plaintiffs seek to enforce.but even more fundamentally,the new jersey attorney general legal conclusion is not helpful in determining whether the city violated plaintiffs constitutional rights.it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department not the new jersey executive to say what the law is.marbury madison,cranch.
the city only other argument aside from a few scattered citations to and privacy cases that have little application to plaintiffs religion claims is buried in a footnote in its brief amidst a discussion of the equal protection clause 
plaintiffs have also failed to allege a classification that violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the first amendment because such claims similarly require a showing of discriminatory purpose.see church of lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,here,as in equal protection cases,we may determine the city council object from both direct and circumstantial evidence.sic lemon kurtzman,in order to survive an establishment clause challenge,the government practice must have a secular purpose,have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion,and not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.
city br.emphasis added.a argument buried in a footnote is hardly a satisfactory way to tackle two of the most jurisprudentially challenging and nuanced areas of our law.schempp,at brennan,concurring noting the difficulty endemic to issues implicating the religious guarantees of the first amendment robinson city of edmond,cir recognizing that the establishment clause is an area notorious for its difficult case law harris city of zion,cir c ases arising under the religion clauses of the f irst a mendment have presented some of the most perplexing questions in constitutional law.we therefore consider this argument waived.john wyeth brother cigna int l,cir alito,a rguments raised in passing such as in a footnote,but not squarely argued,are considered waived.
but even if we were to consider the city halfhearted assertion that allegations of overt hostility and prejudice are required to make out claims under the first amendment,this argument would easily fail,just as did the identical argument with respect to the equal protection clause.while the contours of neither the free exercise nor the establishment clause are static and well defined,courts have repeatedly rejected the notion that either clause is confined to actions based on animus.laurence tribe,american constitutional law,at ed.a law that is not neutral or that is not generally applicable can violate the free exercise clause without regard to the motives of those who enacted the measure.see also shrum city of coweta,cir mcconnell,proof of hostility or discriminatory motivation may be sufficient to prove that a challenged governmental action is not neutral,but the free exercise clause is not confined to actions based on animus.citations omitted allen morton,tamm,concurring noting that,under the establishment clause,good motives can not save impermissible actions.at bottom,the city needs something other than this threadbare argument based on the absence of subjective hostility to avoid a strikeout.
conclusion 
the allegations in plaintiffs complaint tell a story in which there is standing to complain and which present constitutional concerns that must be addressed and,if true,redressed.our job is judicial.we can apply only law,and must abide by the constitution,or we cease to be civil courts and become instruments of police policy.korematsu,at jackson,dissenting.
we believe that statement of justice jackson to be on the right side of history,and for a majority of us in quiet times it remains so until the next time there is the fear of a few who can not be sorted out easily from the many.even when we narrow the many to a class or group,that narrowing here to those affiliated with a major worldwide religion is not near enough under our constitution.t o infer that examples of individual disloyalty prove group disloyalty and justify discriminatory action against the entire group is to deny that under our system of law individual guilt is the sole basis for deprivation of rights.id.at murphy,dissenting.
what occurs here in one guise is not new.we have been down similar roads before.jewish americans during the red scare,african americans during the civil rights movement,and japanese americans during world war ii are examples that readily spring to mind.we are left to wonder why we can not see with foresight what we see so clearly with hindsight that l oyalty is a matter of the heart and mind,not race,creed,or color.ex parte mitsuye endo.
we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree that plaintiffs have demonstrated standing and made sufficient allegations of violations of rights.i differ from the majority in its failure to determine whether intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny applies here.in our determinations so far,we have also,i believe,made the findings necessary to resolve the issue of the appropriate level of scrutiny.
in my opinion,intermediate scrutiny is appropriate here.i say this because intermediate scrutiny is the level applied in gender discrimination cases.i have the immutable characteristic of being a woman.i am happy with this condition,but during my years on this earth,it has caused me at times to suffer gender discrimination.my remedy now for any future gender discrimination would be reviewed with intermediate scrutiny.for that reason,i can not endorse a level of scrutiny in other types of discrimination cases that would be stricter than the level which would apply to discrimination against me as a woman.

plaintiffs personal interest in religious equality falls squarely within the zone of those protected by the constitutional guarantees in question.while their claims certainly strike at the heart of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the first amendment guarantee of freedom of religion includes freedom from religious discrimination.see,permoli municipality of new orleans,equality before the law is of the very essence of liberty,whether civil or religious.christian weaver,cir mcconnell,from the beginning,this nation conception of religious liberty included,at a minimum,the equal treatment of all religious faiths without discrimination or preference.karl loewenstein,some general observations on the proposed international bill of rights.t he religion clauses and the equal protection clause as applied to religion all speak with one voice on this point absent the most unusual circumstances,one religion ought not affect one legal rights or duties or benefits.bd.of educ.of kiryas joel vill.sch.dist.grumet,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in part see also,rosenberger rector visitors of of,larson valente,comm.for pub.educ.religious liberty nyquist,gillette united states,epperson arkansas,everson bd.of educ.of ewing.
we do not take a position on whether plaintiffs could have brought suit to vindicate such an interest.they do not allege a violation of some constitutional right to privacy,but to equal treatment.
far from attesting to the nypd and ap respective roles in revealing the program,the affidavit of defense counsel on which the city relies merely states that the ap reported on the nypd conduct and released unredacted documents to the public at large beginning in august.decl.of peter farrell.it is impossible to infer reasonably,let alone conclude,from this statement that the ap was the first or only public source of the information or that the nypd played no role for which it may be held legally,even if they were required to do so,plaintiffs have produced ample evidence in rebuttal showing that a former nypd informant independently of the ap revealed the nypd practice of targeting innocent muslims by sp eaking publicly in great detail about his part in the nypd policy and practice of surveilling muslims on the basis of religion,decl.of glenn katon and s ince the ap began publishing reports regarding the nypd policy and practice of targeting muslims for surveillance,senior new york city officials have acknowledged and endorsed the nypd tactics,thus propagat ing and amplif ying the harm,id.
to the extent the city focuses on plaintiffs failure to allege the existence of a written policy,there is no requirement that a policy be reduced to written form.see,johnson california,holding that an unwritten prison policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells was subject to strict scrutiny.as the ninth circuit has explained,t he primary indeed,perhaps only difference between a suit involving a written and unwritten policy is an evidentiary one.hoye city of oakland,cir.while a p laintiff ha s no difficulty establishing what a policy is when the policy is written,a n unwritten policy,by contrast,is usually harder to establish.id.
to the extent the city means to argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly that even these exemplars have not been singled out by reason of their religious affiliation,we disagree.plaintiffs allegations,which draw on the sources of circumstantial evidence commonly used to make out a prima facie case of intentional discrimination in a suit of this type,easily satisfy the plausibility threshold required to survive a motion to dismiss.see,rojas alexander dep t store,cir maintenance of records of the race of the arrestees marshall colum.lea reg l,cir mcconnell,racial designation on a form where none was called for jean nelson,cir statistical evidence showing glaring effect on protected class floyd city of new york,d,disparities between minority groups in hit rates combined with other evidence rodriguez cal.highway patrol,d,statistical evidence.
this of course is not to say that an absence or presence of reasonable suspicion in a particular case determines the viability of a plaintiff claim.whren united states,t he constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race.but the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the equal protection clause,not the fourth amendment.subjective intentions play no role in ordinary,fourth amendment analysis.united states scopo,cir newman,concurring though the fourth amendment permits a pretext arrest,if otherwise supported by probable cause,the equal protection clause still imposes restraint on impermissibly discriminations.but although a lack of reasonable suspicion does not afford a presumption that a officer initiated an investigation on the basis of a protected characteristic,it is certainly one factor that may be considered by a finder of fact.see bennett city of eastpointe,cir while the stop was justified from a fourth amendment perspective,the lack of suspicion may properly be considered in the plaintiffs claim.anderson cornejo,d,citing the lack of adequate suspicion for a strip search as probative of the fact that a customs officer acted,at least in part,because the plaintiff was an african american woman.
although other modes of analysis have also been employed,see,obergefell hodges,we find it appropriate to apply the conventional framework in the context of this case.
strict scrutiny is also triggered in the case of a fundamental right.while the right to free exercise of religion is fundamental,lewis,at,plaintiffs proceed in this case on the theory that religious affiliation is a protected class.
we refer in this opinion only to discrimination based on religious affiliation rather than involvement.case law distinguishes between the two.see,united states dejesus,cir fuentes,because we affirm the district court finding that the government strikes were based on the jurors heightened religious involvement rather than their religious affiliation,we need not reach the issue of whether a peremptory strike based solely on religious affiliation would be unconstitutional.united states stafford,cir posner,explaining that i t is necessary to distinguish among religious affiliation,a religion general tenets,and a specific religious belief,modified,cir.nor do we mean to state a position on the separate question of whether all religions together constitute a suspect or class.christian sci.reading room jointly maintained city of san francisco,cir nor
