ii.statement of facts 
leamer was incarcerated at avenel on may.pursuant to the provisions of,et,he received regular and intensive therapy,including both group and individual therapy.he served as a therapy clerk,earning per day.on february,leamer was placed in the close custody unit,on rap status.the following day,he was provided with a form stating that he had been assigned to the close custody unit because of his exhibition or indication of unstable mental or physical behavior which suggests probable harm to inmate,to others,or to property.he was brought before the institutional classification committee icc and informed that he had been placed on cell rap for attempting to hire a.he was also informed that after he was placed on rap status,personnel searching his cell had found a letter that had been addressed but never sent to catherine blandford,one of leamer therapists.despite leamer attempts to deny any wrongdoing,he was told he would be maintained on rap status pending further investigation.as a result of his placement on rap,his job assignment was changed,his earnings dropped to per day,and he was denied outside recreation and other freedoms within the institution.during the next years,leamer was maintained on rap status,though sometimes confined to his cell and sometimes to his wing.according to his complaint,leamer status was reviewed regularly,but he was not present at the reviews except on a few occasions further,leamer alleges that the written statements of the reviews that were provided to him did not specify the basis for the decisions,did not include any of the reports upon which at least some of the decisions were purportedly based,and did not provide him an opportunity to respond.in february,leamer was shifted to phase i,a status usually reserved for new inmates,because of poor institutional adjustment.phase i status allegedly precludes the obtaining of institutional jobs,participating in the parole release process,participating in certain educational and recreational programs,and achieving gang or full minimum custody status.
although the march review stated that leamer would be permitted to attend group therapy as arranged by his therapist,leamer alleges that he was not able to attend group therapy.in may,he was assigned to writing therapy which precluded any group or individual therapeutic contact.after protests,he was told that he could attend group therapy as arranged by a therapist,but only with a escort.in his complaint,leamer cites eleven separate appeals and protests that he directed to the superintendent the director of psychology,asking that his therapy be reinstated or that arrangements be made to allow him to attend group therapy.he identifies only two occasions on which escorts enabled him to attend a required therapeutic group that had sixteen scheduled sessions,and identifies another group to which he was assigned but never escorted.
pervading leamer page pro se complaint is a profound sense of frustration at being assigned to and maintained on rap status and eventually on phase i status for failing to progress in being unable to attend therapy as a consequence of that status.he also expresses frustration with the deprivations attendant upon and the perfunctory reviews of his status.for example,leamer describes a hunger strike that he began on november.when wayne sager,a therapist who was director of psychology for some of the period at issue,inquired as to why he had undertaken the hunger strike,leamer replied that it was due to the consistent negative responses from staff members to plaintiff many requests of defendant turek also a therapist to have plaintiff called to group,to have access to defendant turek,and to thereby communicate with turek.plaintiff informed sager that he would continue a hunger strike until he plaintiff was provided with regular access to a therapist.sager response allegedly was to advise leamer to bring the issue up in the group sessions that he was complaining about being unable to attend and resolve it through the normal therapeutic process.as leamer stated,plaintiff was at a loss as to how to handle the matter through the regular therapeutic process when defendant turek would neither make arrangements to have plaintiff escorted to group nor would meet or converse with plaintiff.in february,at a review leamer was not allowed to attend,he was demoted to phase i status due to poor institutional adjustment.in march,noting another review at which he was not present that merely confirmed his continued status,leamer comments the icc makes reference to a therapist report.first,the plaintiff neither saw nor communicated with his therapist,or any other therapist,prior to the submission of such report and,second,plaintiff was not given the content of the report,not even summarily,thereby precluding plaintiff from rebutting,refuting,or even utilizing such reported information to enable him to gain release from rap.again in august,without leamer being present,a review concluded that leamer needed to remain in phase i due to insufficient progress in therapy.leamer complains by plaintiff not being provided with the escort to bring plaintiff to his therapy sessions and defendant turek neither seeing nor communicating with plaintiff,plaintiff is thereby prevented from progressing in therapy,prevented from obtaining a higher phase,prevented from obtaining release from rap,and prevented,thereby,from ever reaching the point of eligibility for parole.
there are several points in the complaint where leamer addresses therapy alone,or in conjunction solely with the removal from rap status,but there are also several places in the complaint when leamer speaks of parole,though always as a possibility foreclosed by his continued lack of therapy.for instance,he avers the only possible way for a inmate,such as plaintiff,to obtain the possibility of parole is to be provided with treatment to which he is mandated by law to receive.and again,plaintiff,by being denied access to the group is further impeded from proceeding in the parole release process.plaintiff,by being denied access to the group to complete the course is further impeded from proceeding in the parole release process.this theme is repeated throughout his pleading.in his request for declaratory relief,leamer asks that we declare the refusal to provide him with treatment contrary to the united states and new jersey constitutions and new jersey state law,but says nothing whatsoever about parole or release from confinement.again,in his request for injunctive relief,he asks that the defendants be ordered to refrain from denying plaintiff his mandated treatment and requisite parole eligibility therefrom.
leamer has sued william fauver,commissioner of the new jersey department of corrections,and present and former employees of the avenel adult diagnostic and treatment center in both their official and individual capacities.most are alleged to have held positions on the institutional classification committee that was responsible for reviewing leamer rap status.others are alleged to have participated in the internal affairs units for the new jersey department of corrections and for the avenel adult diagnostic and treatment center.still others were therapists to whom leamer was assigned,or who supervised therapists to whom leamer was assigned.in his complaint,he casts his claims in five causes of action a fourteenth amendment due process violation,an eighth amendment violation of the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment,an ex post facto increase in his punishment,a fourteenth amendment equal protection violation,and a violation of the state statutory provisions guaranteeing him mental health treatment under a scheme.he prays for declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as damages.
iii.district court opinion 
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss under rule c,resting its decision primarily upon its reading of edwards balisok,d.in balisok,a washington state inmate had filed a claim challenging the procedures used in a disciplinary hearing that had resulted in a loss of credits.the supreme court held that because the inmate challenge necessarily implied that his sentence was invalid,because the credits should not have been taken away,it could only be brought on a writ of habeas corpus.the district court read balisok as precluding civil rights actions based on due process claims regarding the invalidity of the punishment imposed.because leamer is complaining of the lack of therapy and its impact on his rap status,the district court reasoned that he was implying that his sentence was possibly longer than it would have been,which implied the invalidity of his restrictive status and ultimately impacts the length of plaintiff sentence.further,because the district court viewed balisok as preclusive,it discounted leamer analogy to gerald commissioner,new jersey department of corrections.as is discussed in more detail below,we feel that the district court did not view the holding of balisok correctly,and that gerald does help to elucidate the position of new jersey in this case.
although recognizing that leamer was seeking injunctive relief in addition to damages,and noting that injunctive relief would not have been foreclosed under balisok,the district court believed that leamer was seeking only to reverse his rap status and reinstitute therapy,neither of which were prospective,and,consequently,relief could not be granted.despite the district court conclusion that balisok disposed of the case,it did characterize the individually alleged constitutional violations as without merit.the district court perceived leamer due process challenge as procedural and baseless,since leamer complaint detailed regular reviews and described procedures that were adhered to,or substantially adhered to,by the defendants.
the district court likewise disposed of the equal protection,ex post facto and state law claims,as well as the claims directed against fauver individually leamer has not raised the dismissal of these claims on appeal,and consequently,they are not before us.
we find the district court interpretation of balisok to be in error.further,we believe that the unique statutory scheme set up by new jersey compels a of the merits of leamer claims.on appeal,leamer has requested that we recognize that he has a liberty interest in treatment,and that the constitutional violations he alleged are cognizable as claims.we agree that we should do so.because our understanding of the requirements of the new jersey statute is integral to our conclusions,we will analyze its provisions first.
iv.statutory history 
the structure of the statutory scheme established by new jersey to ensure treatment for sex offenders is somewhat unique the provisions at issue here were originally enacted in,and in they were revised to reflect the findings of a commission especially appointed to study the treatment of sex offenders.state wingler.the resulting provisions embodied the legislative determination that sex offenders should be committed to either a mental or correctional institution for treatment and released when capable of making an acceptable social adjustment,but in no event beyond the maximum term prescribed by law for the crime of which he was convicted.id.at.in upholding the constitutionality of the provisions against a challenge that it unfairly denied persons convicted and committed under those provisions to the commutation for good behavior and work accorded to persons convicted of the same crimes but not committed,the new jersey supreme court said,
t he legislature has,with sufficient cause,classified certain repetitive,compulsive sex offenders as falling within a separate group urgently requiring,for the protection of society as well as the offenders themselves,special confinement and treatment until they are capable of making acceptable social adjustments,but in no event beyond the maximum term fixed by law.the constitutional power of the legislature to make reasonable classifications of criminals for purposes of sentence and release is beyond question.
those within the class are not subjected to any improper discriminations.they are given special beneficial treatment designed to advance their interests as well as those of society.it is true that despite all available medical and psychiatric facilities and conscientious statutory reviews,some of the offenders may be confined for maximum terms because they remain incapable of making an acceptable adjustment in the community.but that fact does not impair the constitutionality of the general legislation,and,fortunately as the experiences to date indicate most of the offenders will actually benefit and be returned to society as and useful citizens long before they approach the maximum terms prescribed by law.
id.at.t he findings of the statutory facts for special commitment under the act do not entail a heavier penalty on the offender,but only a different,specially adapted method of dealing with the offender,for both his benefit and that of society state blanford,remanded on other grounds by state horne.new jersey courts have interpreted as requiring the provision of treatment.see,state harvey.law div,aff,the commissioner has an affirmative duty to treat defendant.it is not conditioned on defendant ability to fit into a particular modality.if the present operation at is unable to meet his needs,the commissioner has a responsibility to formulate and implement a policy which will.see also lair fauver,cir.
since the replacement of by is a hybrid between a therapeutic and purely penal statute and provides for credits and standard parole new jersey courts have compelled the department of corrections to resentence offenders under if the department of corrections has physically transferred an inmate to a location that will not provide the treatment mandated under.see gerald commissioner,of,state cruz.courts have considered it a matter of statutory compulsion and fundamental fairness that offenders be resentenced with the same opportunities for parole as offenders unless treatment is provided.id.at construing gerald.
habeas corpus and section 
although both and habeas corpus allow prisoners to challenge unconstitutional conduct by state officers,the two are not coextensive either in purpose or effect.habeas relief is clearly quite limited the underlying purpose of proceedings under the great writ of habeas corpus has traditionally been to inquire into the legality of the detention,and the only judicial relief authorized was the discharge of the prisoner or his admission to bail,and that only if his detention were found to be unlawful.powers of congress and the court regarding the availability and scope of review,harv.section,in contrast,provides for liability on the part of any state actor who subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.it has been described as a species of tort liability.smith holtz,cir discussing heck humphrey,d.there is only a narrow subset of actions that arguably might properly be brought as either,that is,where the deprivation of rights is such that it necessarily impacts the fact or length of detention.in a series of decisions,the supreme court has made it clear that for those cases,the narrower remedy,the habeas petition,is the only available avenue of relief.balisok was one of these decisions in it,the court clarified that a plaintiff can not circumvent the overlap between habeas and by raising an issue as an attack upon procedure rather than substance,when resolution of the issue in his favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of the fact or duration of detention.the court noted that proper judicial response to such procedural defects is to invalidate the flawed decision that impacted the sentence,by reinstating the removed good time same remedy that would attach if the substance were attacked.at.because the remedy therefore is,in actuality,a habeas remedy,the plaintiff must proceed by way of a habeas petition.
as noted above,balisok was not decided in a vacuum.in preiser rodriguez,d the court had granted certiorari specifically to consider whether state prisoners may use to challenge the constitutionality of acts that deprived them of credits where the remedy would be restoration of their credits and a shortening of their sentence.at.in holding that the action was only appropriate under habeas,the court looked to the purpose of the habeas secure release from illegal custody.id.at.it then determined that the exhaustion requirements of the more specific habeas statute should be satisfied when the remedy sought is a habeas remedy.id.at.preiser holding was specifically limited to persons seeking equitable relief and not damages.id.at.in distinguishing the cases where the court had upheld the use of to challenge the conditions of their confinement,the court noted 
but none of the state prisoners in those cases was challenging the fact or duration of his physical confinement itself,and none was seeking immediate release or a speedier release from that heart of habeas corpus.
it is clear,then,that in all those cases,the prisoners claims related solely to the states alleged unconstitutional treatment of them while in confinement.none sought,as did the respondents here,to challenge the very fact or duration of the confinement itself.those cases,therefore,merely establish that a action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner who is making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his prison life,but not to the fact or length of his custody.
id.at.emphasis added.heck humphrey resolved one of the questions explicitly left unresolved in preiser where the challenge is to the legality of the prisoner confinement,it is not sufficient for the prisoner to raise the claim solely as a damages action and thus avoid the exhaustion requirement of habeas.at.instead,if a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence it is not appropriately brought under.id.at.conversely,if the success of the plaintiff action will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff,the action should be allowed to proceed,in the absence of some other bar to the suit.id.emphasis in original.balisok then addressed another question left open in preiser may the plaintiff raise an issue as an attack only upon procedure rather than substance again,the court found that a plaintiff could not mask a claim that really required habeas relief as a claim.at.most recently,in spencer kemna,the court addressed a contention that a habeas action brought subsequent to the expiration of the prisoner sentence should not be viewed as moot,because the plaintiff would have been foreclosed from bringing an action under unless he could establish the invalidity of his parole revocation.the court stressed that damages need not always and everywhere be available,and noted that recovery under would not be foreclosed if his challenge were to procedures and not the result,as long as the procedural defect did not necessarily imply the invalidity of the revocation.at.
when read together,there is a logical and coherent progression of supreme court jurisprudence clarifying when is unavailable whenever the challenge ultimately attacks the core of habeas the validity of the continued conviction or the fact or length of the challenge,however denominated and regardless of the relief sought,must be brought by way of a habeas corpus petition.conversely,when the challenge is to a condition of confinement such that a finding in plaintiff favor would not alter his sentence or undo his conviction,an action under is appropriate.
here,the district court reasoning regarding balisok was somewhat cryptic.on the one hand,the court stated that leamer had failed to allege a violation of the due process clause because this claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of the discipline imposed.the court found balisok factually similar to the plaintiff claims,noting that leamer alleges that certain of the defendants conspired to wrongfully place and maintain plaintiff on rap status through prejudice,deceit and arbitrariness,and that plaintiff allegations would imply the invalidity of his restrictive status.therefore,as in balisok,plaintiff has not stated a valid claim under.on the other hand,the court concluded that the denial of therapy and the inability to gain release from rap status prevented him from getting paroled,possibly resulting in a longer sentence for him.
the district court appears to have gone astray in two ways one in its reading of balisok,and the other in its reading of leamer complaint.by implying that balisok extends the rule of preiser and its progeny to any disciplinary of whether the outcome necessarily impacts the duration of the district court unnecessarily invalidated claims that are not truly within the overlap between habeas and.leamer could not have brought this claim as a habeas claim he did not and could not seek earlier release based on the adjudication of his constitutional claims the court also erred in concluding that the possibility that parole would be delayed if he remained on rap status would be sufficient to trigger a balisok analysis.
we are bolstered in our conclusion by the analysis undertaken by other courts of appeals.the second circuit court of appeals recently engaged in a thorough review of each of the decisions,including the concurrences and dissents,and concluded that nothing in supreme court precedent requires that the heck rule be applied to a challenge by a prisoner to a term of disciplinary segregation.jenkins haubert,cir.accordingly,it held that a suit that challenges the validity of a disciplinary or administrative sanction that does not affect the overall length of the prisoner confinement is not barred by heck and edwards.see also brown plaut.the seventh circuit court of appeals,in choosing to follow jenkins overruling its earlier,broader reading see barnes,cir,noted the inapplicability of habeas to the facts of the prisoner claim before it unlike the plaintiffs in preiser,heck,and edwards,dewalt case does not lie at the intersection of sections and.dewalt does not challenge the fact or duration of his confinement,but only a condition of his loss of his prison job.consequently,under our precedent,dewalt may not pursue a habeas action.dewalt carter,cir.
here,as in dewalt,the challenge by leamer is aimed at a condition of his confinement,and is a challenge properly brought under.whether the rap status is invalidated is immaterial to the propriety of the claim.the operative test under preiser and its progeny is not whether leamer would,if successful,be able to appear before the parole board.it is whether a favorable determination of leamer challenge would necessarily imply that he would serve a shorter sentence,which,as the district court recognized,would not be the case.in fact,elsewhere in its opinion,the district court noted the situation of inmates incarcerated at adtc is unique in that their eligibility for parole is directly linked to their progression in therapy.unless an is cured he will serve the maximum sentence.
the district court concluded that this characteristic is what brought leamer case squarely within balisok actually,as we see it,this is what squarely distinguishes it from balisok.whatever the decision on the claim,leamer release date will not change it is precisely because he does not earn credits to which he can claim entitlement that his rap status does not determine the date of release.in considering a challenge to hawaii sex offender program,the ninth circuit court of appeals wrote 
the only benefit that a victory in this case would provide neal and martinez,besides the possibility of monetary damages,is a ticket to get in the door of the parole board,thus only making them eligible for parole consideration according to the terms of their sentences.if neal and martinez win,it will in no way guarantee parole or necessarily shorten their prison sentences by a single day.the parole board will still have the authority to deny the inmates requests for parole on the basis of any of the grounds presently available to it in evaluating such a request.a victory in this case would not alter the calculus for the review of parole requests in any way.because the inmates challenge in this case does not necessarily imply the invalidity of their convictions or continuing confinement,it is properly brought under.
neal shimoda,cir.this reasoning conforms with the way we have previously viewed relief in this context.in,with only preiser as guidance,we stated that the fact that a prisoner success in the litigation might increase the chance for early release does not,in itself,transform the action into one for habeas corpus.georgevich does not ask for release on parole,but merely seeks uniform application of due process procedures to all members of the class.georgevich strauss,cir.following the supreme court decision in heck,in smith holtz,we again clarified that the critical initial question in determining whether habeas or is appropriate is whether the claim truly lies at the intersection.it does only claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction,cir applying heck to bar a challenge to a pending criminal charge.
as we clarify today,the propositions in these cases are unchanged.when examining whether preiser and its progeny require a claim to be brought under habeas,unless the claim would fall within the core of habeas and require sooner release if resolved in the plaintiff favor,a prison confinement action such as this is properly brought under.leamer claim not only does not fall within the core of habeas it would not be properly brought under habeas at all.conversely,it was properly brought under.
vi.constitutional claims 
leamer has alleged violations of procedural due process,substantive due process,and the eighth amendment proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.because the district court read balisok as foreclosing leamer claims in their entirety,it never fully analyzed whether leamer has posited a sufficiently fundamental liberty interest to implicate these guarantees under the eighth and fourteenth amendments.in fact,the sole reference in the opinion to leamer liberty interest is even assuming plaintiff has a liberty interest in being afforded therapy,a claim for damages can not be brought while the facts will necessarily animate these claims,we note that we view the unique statutory scheme present here,and the essential right to treatment inherent in it,as presenting the type of liberty interest that is at the heart of procedural and substantive due process,and that could support a finding that a total denial of treatment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
the united states supreme court has repeatedly recognized that civil commitment procedures may implicate fundamental liberty interests.see,addington texas,d vitek jones,d youngberg romeo,d foucha louisiana,d.leamer has not been civilly committed.he has been detained by the state because he has broken its laws.but here,confinement and treatment are inextricably linked.we note in this regard that leamer claim of a liberty interest that was created by new jersey sentencing of him under a statutory scheme that predicates the term of his sentence on his response to treatment is somewhat unique.the sentencing court has classified leamer as having a mental aberration and in need of specialized treatment.that assessment has automatically subjected him to the maximum incarceration permitted by law unless he is cured prior to that point.neither good behavior,parole policies,or other credits can affect the term of his sentence.only successful therapy can shorten his incarceration.therapy is thus an inherent and integral element of the scheme,and its deprivation is clearly a grievous loss not emanating from the sentence.thus,we must analyze each of the three constitutional guarantees asserted,asking 
whether leamer had a liberty interest i n treatment that was implicated for purposes of procedural and substantive due process.
ii.did the procedures employed in denying treatment comport with due process 
iii.was the denial of treatment deliberately indifferent and so arbitrary as to shock the conscience for purposes of substantive due process 
iv.were the correctional authorities deliberately indifferent to leamer treatment needs for the purposes of the an eighth amendment analysis 
the record before us is such that we can and will answer the first question,but we will only discuss the nature of the inquiry as to the remaining questions,deferring an individualized analysis of the specific constitutional rights until the factual record has been further developed in the district court on remand.
a.the nature of leamer liberty interest 
in sandin conner,d,the supreme court,addressing a procedural due process claim,held that in defining which liberty interests created by state law warrant due process protection,we must assess the nature of the interest and whether its deprivation caused the inmate to suffer a grievous loss of liberty retained even after imprisonment.id.at.quoting morrissey brewer,d.sandin further clarifies that the interests would be generally limited to freedom from restraint which imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.id.at.
here,the state has created a scheme in which therapy is both mandated and promised,and the department of corrections is without discretion to decline the obligation.
the commissioner has an affirmative duty to treat defendant.it is not conditioned on defendant ability to fit into a particular modality.if the present operation at is unable to meet his needs,the commissioner has a responsibility to formulate and implement a policy which will.
state harvey,aff.the state has further recognized that the treatment requirement is distinct from the traditional scheme of incarceration by requiring the state to resentence prisoners to whom it will not provide treatment.gerald,of,state cruz.the court noted further that,since treatment rather than punishment was the goal of the act,a lack of treatment could not be justified by distinguishing his condition because he has been sentenced for a criminal offense and not been adjudicated insane or mentally incompetent.at.we conclude that leamer liberty interest in treatment is fundamental and cognizable for purposes of both the procedural and substantive due process analyses.
procedural due process 
the district court expressly concluded that leamer right to procedural due process appears to be without merit.the court based its conclusion on the numerous reviews that occurred while leamer was on rap status
