background 
williams was hired by donnelley,a company that publishes telephone directories,in may,as an new business development representative in donnelley las vegas office.thereafter,between and,williams was promoted several times first,in january,to account executive within the business development unit second,in july,to full account executive and finally,in january,to sales training manager stm.williams voluntary acceptance of the stm position required her to relocate to purchase,new york,where donnelley sales training department is located.
after working as an stm in new york for approximately ten months,williams sought to return to las vegas,where she still maintained a home,and where donnelley permitted her to work as an stm one week out of every month.on october,williams applied for an account manager position in donnelley las vegas office.the account manager position,however,required two to three years of proven performance working with medium to large accounts with minimum monthly billings of,williams concedes she did not have this experience.williams alternatively requested that,if she were found unqualified for the account manager position,donnelley create a new management position for her in the las vegas office.approximately two months later,in december,donnelley denied her application for the account manager position and offered the position to another woman.donnelley also refused williams request that a management position be created for her in the las vegas office.on december,williams requested to be transferred to las vegas as an account executive,the position she had held before being promoted to stm.donelley denied this request as well.in january,donnelley advertised a vacant dsm iii position in its las vegas office.williams inquired about the dsm iii position,even though she did not have the requisite two years of experience as a dsm ii.
donnelley rejected williams application and,in february,gave the dsm iii position to an male,who up to that time held a dsm ii position.two days before that employee promotion took effect,williams,on the advice of her physician,requested an indefinite disability leave of absence until her medical condition stabilized.donnelley thereafter,without soliciting applications,filled the newly vacated dsm ii position with a white male.williams remained on disability leave until july,when donnelley offered her the choice of two account executive positions in las vegas.in september,williams resigned from donnelley.

the district court granted summary judgment in donnelley favor on all claims.the court found that williams did not establish that she was qualified for any of the promotions she sought,and that the denial of her requests for a lateral transfer and the creation of a new position did not constitute adverse employment actions in violation of title vii.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
williams argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of donnelley on her race and sex discrimination claims we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see dallas aerospace,cis air,cir.summary judgment may be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.dallas aerospace,at.
statutory scheme 
under title vii,an employer may not discriminate against an individual with respect to his or her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.in an employment discrimination case,a plaintiff has the burden at the outset to prove by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination.collins new york city transit,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
to meet her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,williams must demonstrate that she is a member of a protected class she applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants she suffered an adverse employment action and the circumstances surrounding that action permit an inference of discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas green,d delta air lines,cir.although,a plaintiff burden of establishing a prima facie case is de minimis,at internal quotation marks omitted,a title vii plaintiff claims nevertheless fail if she can not make out a prima facie case of discrimination.see mc donnell douglas,at.
because she is an female,williams satisfies the first prong of the prima facie case for each of her claims.she fails,however,to establish the remaining elements.we address each of her claims in turn.
failure to promote to account manager 
having established that she is a member of a protected class,williams must establish that she was qualified for the account manager position.as williams correctly notes,the plaintiff burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is neither onerous,nor intended to be rigid,mechanized or ritualistic,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,this burden is not inconsequential.we have held that being qualified refers to the criteria the employer has specified for the position.thornley penton publ g,cir.therefore,in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,williams must show that she met the defendant criteria for the position.
by her own admission,williams may not have been qualified for the account manager position,because she did not possess the two to three years of proven performance working with medium to large accounts required for that position.williams,however,argues that donnelly previously interpreted the requirements for the account manager position loosely,and consequently,interviewed candidates without the required experience.in support of her claims,williams asserts that scott allan,a white male applicant for the account manager position,had qualifications similar to hers,but was granted an opportunity to interview for the position.it is undisputed,however,that allan,unlike williams,had two to three years experience in sales,and ranked in the top third of his peer group in sales.thus,donn
