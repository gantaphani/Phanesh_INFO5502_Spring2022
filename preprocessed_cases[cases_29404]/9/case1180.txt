plaintiff richard kessler appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,charles brieant,judge,summarily dismissing his complaint complaint alleging that defendants westchester county the county and its agency westchester county department of social services dss violated his rights under title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.title vii,and the age discrimination in employment act of,as amended,et.adea,by transferring him to a less desirable employment post and changing his responsibilities in retaliation for kessler filing of charges of discrimination pursuant to title vii and the adea.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing those claims on the ground that kessler,who conceded that the transfer had not effected any change in his salary,benefits,job title,grade,or hours of work,failed to show that he had suffered an adverse employment action.on appeal,kessler contends that he had adduced evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact to be tried as to whether the changes in his employment were materially adverse,and that summary judgment was thus inappropriate.in light of the supreme court recent decision in burlington northern santa fe railway white,d,we agree.
background 
taken in the light most favorable to kessler,as the party against whom summary judgment was granted,the record,which includes kessler affidavit and his deposition testimony,as well as depositions of various dss officials,indicates the following.
kessler,employed by the county since,has been assigned to dss since october in the permanent civil service position of assistant commissioner of social services.from until april,kessler was assigned to work in dss offices located in white plains,new york.except for three years of that period when he headed dss office of child support enforcement,kessler was assigned to dss central administrative office,where the dss commissioner and senior staff members had their offices.
during the period october to april,kessler duties included broad departmental responsibilities such as negotiating contracts on behalf of dss developing new departmental program initiatives designing and implementing training programs for employees and programs to train outside vendors to perform functions in the manner desired by dss and acting as a liaison with pace university in a management training fellowship program.at times kessler supervised upwards of dss employees.he managed broad program areas,as to which he reported directly to the commissioner or a deputy commissioner.
kessler past claims of discrimination 
in june,kessler,a white,jewish male born in,filed with the new york state division of human rights nysdhr and the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a complaint against the county and dss first sdhr complaint.kessler charged principally that,beginning in,defendants had denied him equal terms,conditions and privileges of employment on account of his age,race,gender,and religion,in violation of,inter alia,title vii and the adea first sdhr complaint et,by denying him promotions and other privileges of employment that had been granted to his younger or or or female counterparts id.in august,kessler immediate supervisor,fred broege,a first deputy commissioner,told kessler that as a result of filing the nysdhr complaint,kessler loyalty to dss was in question and that senior staff members were concerned that kessler was not a part of the team and could not be trusted.affidavit of richard kessler dated march,kessler aff.
the eeoc notified kessler,by letter dated january,of its decision not to bring suit on his behalf with respect to his adea claim,stating that that decision did not affect his right to sue and that eeoc permission to sue was not required with respect to that claim.by letter dated january,the eeoc issued kessler a letter on his title vii claim.in february,kessler discussed his discrimination charges and the eeoc letters with william ryan,a member of the county board of legislators,who informed him shortly thereafter that kessler charges had been discussed with the dss commissioner.see kessler aff.deposition of william ryan at.on march,and,in connection with his discrimination charges,kessler submitted freedom of information law requests to the office of the commissioner of dss,seeking information as to dss promotion practices and documents pertaining to the position taken by defendants in his nysdhr proceeding.
on march,kessler role in implementing a human resources training initiative called the leadership transformation group was summarily curtailed deposition of richard kessler kessler dep.at,and he was instructed not to attend an upcoming meeting on that project see id.at.he was soon also relieved of his other training duties,including acting as liaison with pace university in the management fellowship program.see id.at.
on april,kessler was informed that he was being transferred from dss central administrative office in white plains to the dss district office in yonkers,new york.he asserts that jewru bandeh,dss deputy commissioner since,who informed him of the transfer,
refused to discuss or provide me with a statement of my assignment and duties in yonkers.upon arriving at yonkers,associate commissioner lee jacobs,who headed the office,told me that he had not requested my services and that i was because they wanted you out of white plains.
kessler aff.the transfer did not affect kessler job title,job grade which was,salary,benefits,or hours of work.however,as described in greater detail in part below,kessler found that he had been stripped of his prior responsibilities,which were replaced by menial tasks.
b.the present claims of retaliation 
some seven months after his transfer to yonkers,kessler filed a new complaint with nysdhr charging dss with transferring him in retaliation for filing his june discrimination charges and for making his subsequent requests for information in connection with those charges second sdhr complaint.after completing that administrative proceeding,kessler commenced the present action,alleging that his transfer to yonkers constituted a demotion complaint that was intended by defendants to punish him for his prior charges of discrimination see id.
following a period of discovery that included kessler deposition and the depositions of bandeh,jacobs,and other dss officials,defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing kessler complaint,on the grounds,inter alia,that kessler lacked a good faith,reasonable belief that the actions challenged in his initial discrimination charges were unlawful that kessler assignment to yonkers did not constitute an adverse employment action and that there was no causal connection between kessler charges of discrimination and his transfer.defendants also contended that they had proffered legitimate business reasons for kessler transfer,which kessler failed to rebut.
in opposition to the motion,kessler submitted,inter alia,the official dss job description for the class of positions called assistant commissioner of social services,which stated as follows 
under the general direction of the commissioner of social services or deputy commissioner,an incumbent of this position is responsible for the development of program policies and procedures or the direction and control of a large segment of the department field operations.this position has overall responsibility for policy formulation,resource allocation,planning and evaluation of programs and procedures,financial and personnel management.this class functions as part of the top management of the department and is responsible and accountable for the analysis of proposed state and federal legislation and regulations,departmental alternatives and impact,and makes recommendations to the commissioner and executive staff.this class differs from deputy commissioners in that wide latitude and independent judgment is exercised over a significant portion of the department operation while deputy commissioners may act for the entire department.supervision is exercised over a large number of managerial,professional and clerical support staff.
exhibit to deposition of jewru bandeh dss job description emphases added.in his own deposition,kessler testified that although he had performed the above duties prior to april,upon his transfer to yonkers he was,inter alia,relieved of his training duties see kessler dep.at and relieved of responsibility for developing and implementing new program initiatives and for representing dss in initiating and maintaining relationships with outside consultants and vendors see id.at.in addition,he no longer reported directly to a dss first deputy commissioner or interacted with the commissioner see id.at,he was excluded from managerial meetings of the sort he had previously attended see id.at and in yonkers,he was required to report to a supervisor who was of the same civil service grade as kessler,rather than to supervisors such as those to whom he had reported prior to filing his first sdhr complaint in june see id.at.
kessler also submitted his affidavit,further detailing ways in which the transfer to yonkers changed the nature of his job.for example,whereas in white plains he had at times supervised upwards of staff members kessler dep.at,upon his transfer to yonkers he supervised no one kessler aff,and his assigned tasks were menial 
during my first year in the yonkers district office,i did not supervise any employees i had no support or clerical staff assigned to me i reported exclusively to associate commissioner lee jacobs and not to the commissioner or any deputy commissioner and i was assigned exceptionally limited and amorphous assignments and tasks that did not in any way involve broad departmental responsibilities 
during my first year in the yonkers district office,i was assigned tasks such as contacting hospitals and reporting back to jacobs obtaining listings of scheduled unit meetings updating an employment matrix.some of these tasks had previously been performed by lower level line managers.an administrative assistant and two supervising eligibility examiners,grade,were assigned to work along side me in connection with some of these assigned tasks,not as my subordinates,but as my peers.
id.see also deposition of lee jacobs jacobs dep.at other staff members were directed to work with kessler,but not to report to him.when kessler updated the employment matrix,no one was assigned to assist him,and he was forced to perform data entry tasks himself.see jacobs dep.at.
given the dss job description and his sworn statements as to the ways in which the substance of his job had been dramatically altered by the transfer,kessler argued that there was a genuine issue to be tried as to,inter alia,whether the transfer effected change that was materially adverse.
c.the ruling of the district court 
the district court,in a memorandum and order dated april,see kessler westchester county department of social services,civ,wl,district court opinion,granted defendants motion for summary judgment.the court stated that,in order to make out a prima facie case of retaliation under either the adea or title vii,a 
p laintiff must prove that he engaged in protected activity that defendant was aware of this participation that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action and that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.
district court opinion,wl,at.without discussing all of these elements,the court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because kessler had not adduced sufficient evidence to show that he had suffered an adverse employment action.
citing and quoting decisions of this court,the district court stated that 
a n adverse employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment and includes termination,demotion evidenced by a decrease in salary or wage,a less distinguished title,a material loss in benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices unique to a particular situation.see williams donnelley,cir.there must be more than mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.see galab ya new york city bd.of,cir.the adea protects an employee against reprisals that do not reach the level of a termination or reduction in wages or benefits,but the employer action must still be sufficiently deleterious to the plaintiff current or future employment to constitute an adverse employment action.see wanamaker columbian rope,cir minor,ministerial stumbling blocks are insufficient to constitute adverse employment actions.
district court opinion,wl,at emphases ours.the court stated that an internal transfer may be an adverse employment action if it is accompanied by a negative change in the terms and conditions of employment,id.citing morris lindau,cir emphasis in district court opinion,but that 
a purely lateral transfer,that is,a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance,can not rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action to be adverse,change in work assignment must cause materially significant disadvantage the key inquiry regarding involuntary transfers is whether the transfer constitutes a negative employment action tantamount to a demotion.
district court opinion,wl,at quoting galabya new york city board of education,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis ours.
noting that kessler admits that he was never disciplined,suspended,or written up and that his salary,benefits and hours of work were not decreased in any way,and that kessler has never received an unsatisfactory evaluation,the court stated that i t is clear that the traditional indices of adverse employment actions amounting to retaliation are not present,and that kessler did not suffer an adverse employment action.district court opinion,wl,at.the district court saw no evidence that the transfer in this case was anything other than a pure lateral transfer between various offices within the discretion of the employer and responsive to its perceived needs,id.at,and ruled that the transfer was therefore a mere administrative change,and not a de facto demotion,id.the court concluded that 
t he evidence belies plaintiff assertion that he was transferred to an inferior position in yonkers in which he had less responsibility.plaintiff personal dissatisfaction with his current position in yonkers and his belief that his skills and qualifications are underutilized do not create jury issues as to whether his transfer was adverse accordingly,the court concludes that kessler has not suffered an adverse employment action as a result of the transfer.
judgment was entered dismissing the complaint,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,kessler contends that the district court erred in ruling that he had not adduced evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue to be tried as to whether he suffered an adverse employment action.in light of the supreme court decision in burlington northern santa fe railway white,d white,rendered subsequent to the district court decision in this case,we agree.we also reject defendants contention that the dismissal of kessler claims should be affirmed on alternative grounds.
a.the elements of a retaliation claim and the standard of review 
title vii forbids an employer to retaliate against an employee for,inter alia,complaining of employment discrimination prohibited by title vii 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.
a.the adea contains a nearly identical provision prohibiting retaliation for complaining of employment discrimination on the basis of age,see d,and the same standards and burdens apply to claims under both statutes,see,terry ashcroft,cir.
in order to present a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii or the adea,a plaintiff must adduce 
evidence sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find that he engaged in protected participation or opposition under title vii or the adea,that the employer was aware of this activity,that the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff,and that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action,that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action.

t he issue of material fact required to be present to entitle a party to proceed to trial is not required to be resolved conclusively in favor of the party asserting its existence rather,all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties differing versions of the truth at trial.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the same standards apply on appellate review of a grant of summary judgment.see,cifra,at.
b.the element of a retaliation claim 
title vii core substantive provision makes it an unlawful employment practice 
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin or 
to limit,segregate,or classify employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.
a.the adea sets forth similar prohibitions with respect to discrimination on the basis of age.see a and.
with respect to claims that an employer has violated these core provisions by taking an adverse employment action for discriminatory reasons against a member of a protected class,see generally de la cruz new york city human resources administration department of social services,cir de la cruz,we have stated that a transfer is an adverse employment action if it results in a change in responsibilities so significant as to constitute a setback to the plaintiff career,galabya new york city board of education,cir galabya.we have also ruled that an adverse employment action may be found where the plaintiff was transferred from an elite unit to one that was less prestigious,de la cruz,at,or where the transfer effected a radical change in nature of the plaintiff work,rodriguez board of education of eastchester union free school district,cir.
but we have generally looked to whether the plaintiff has suffered a materially adverse change in h is employment status or in the terms and conditions of his employment,williams donnelley,cir williams 
employment actions that have been deemed sufficiently disadvantageous to constitute an adverse employment action include a termination of employment,a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices unique to a particular situation.galabya new york city bd.of,cir ellipsis in original citations omitted.as these examples suggest,t o be materially adverse a change in working conditions must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,we have held that an involuntary transfer may constitute an adverse employment action if the plaintiff show s that the transfer created a materially significant disadvantage with respect to the terms of her employment.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
williams,at emphases added.
we have adopted this standard in several cases addressing claims of adea and title retaliation.see,fairbrother morrison,cir fairbrother richardson new york state department of correctional service,cir richardson.with respect to the retaliation claim at issue in richardson,for example,we stated that a plaintiff may suffer an adverse employment action if she endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in fairbrother,we stated that a n adverse employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment,at internal quotation marks omitted,and that 
i f a transfer is truly lateral and involves no significant changes in an employee conditions of employment,the fact that the employee views the transfer either positively or negatively does not of itself render the denial or receipt of the transfer an adverse employment action,
id.quoting williams,at other internal quotation marks omitted.we stated that a transfer that does not change the conditions of employment is a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities,and hence is not materially adverse.fairbrother,at quoting galabya,at.
c.the supreme court decision in white 
in white,the supreme court announced a different standard.the white court ruled that the provision of title vii,unlike title vii substantive provision,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.at emphasis added.rather,to prevail on a claim for retaliation under title vii,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiff in white had been hired by the defendant burlington as a railroad track laborer,a job that entailed removing and replacing track components,transporting track material,cutting brush,and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the.some facets of that job involved operation of a forklift.white was soon assigned to operate the forklift,and while she also performed some of the other track laborer chores,operation of the forklift became her primary responsibility.after she complained to burlington officials about sexual harassment by her male supervisor,however,white was relieved of forklift duty and assigned to perform only other track laborer tasks.white sued,asserting a claim of retaliation,and a jury found in her favor.the district court denied a posttrial motion by burlington for judgment dismissing white claim as a matter of law,a denial that was ultimately affirmed by the court of appeals sitting en banc,and the supreme court affirmed.
the supreme court noted that both burlington and the solicitor general of the united states,appearing as amicus curiae,contended that there should be 
a link between the challenged retaliatory action and the terms,conditions,or status of employment.they note that title vii substantive provision protects an individual only from discrimination.they add that the provision should be read in pari materia with the provision.and they conclude that the employer actions prohibited by the provision should similarly be limited to conduct that affects the employee compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.brief for united states as amicus curiae quoting a see brief for petitioner same.
at.but,noting the differences between the language of title vii substantive prohibition,which refers expressly to an employee compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,and the language of its retaliation prohibition,which contains no such reference,the court concluded,we can not agree.id.
observing that title vii primary goal is to promote a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial,ethnic,religious,or status,the court pointed out that t he provision seeks to secure that prima
