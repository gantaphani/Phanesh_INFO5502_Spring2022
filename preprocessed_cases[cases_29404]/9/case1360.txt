this appeal requires us to determine the appropriate standard under which involuntary medication may be ordered to render a criminal defendant competent to stand trial.aaron gomes appeals from the february,order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut christopher droney,district judge authorizing gomes involuntary medication with antipsychotic drugs,subject to certain conditions,to render him competent to stand trial for the charged criminal conduct,and extending his commitment to the custody of the attorney general.on appeal,gomes challenges only that part of the district court order authorizing his involuntary medication.we vacate the order of involuntary medication and remand for further proceedings in light of the standard we have adopted.
background 
on october,a federal grand jury indicted gomes on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g and a.the indictment followed gomes arrest by the hartford police on september,for possession of a pistol without a permit,possession of a controlled substance,and possession of narcotics and theft of a firearm.on may,the government filed a notice informing the district court that because gomes had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses,he qualified for a sentence enhancement as an armed career offender under e.with this enhancement,gomes faces a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.
gomes has yet to stand trial for these charges.after the district court denied gomes motion to suppress evidence in april,the proceedings in this case have centered on gomes competency to stand trial.on may,gomes own attorney first raised the issue.citing behavior of the defendant which casts some doubts as to defendant competency,gomes counsel on june,sought authorization to have a psychiatrist determine gomes present competency and whether he was criminally insane at the time of the offense.however,gomes refused to participate and this examination did not take place.
on june,the district court,on its own motion and without the benefit of expert testimony,found that there was reasonable cause to believe that gomes may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he may be unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him to assist properly in his defense.the district court ordered a competency hearing that was to be held after gomes was examined by a psychiatrist.once again,gomes refused to cooperate.on october,the district court,absent objection,ordered that gomes be committed,pursuant to b,to the custody of the attorney general for placement in a suitable psychiatric facility for thirty days for examination of his mental health and competency to stand trial.
i.the competency hearings 
after gomes was examined at the medical center for federal prisoners in springfield,missouri,the district court scheduled a competency hearing.at the hearing,held on may,gomes persisted in his refusal to participate and angrily objected to,among other things,certain witnesses who were to testify by teleconference.gomes efforts to obstruct the proceedings led to his removal from the courtroom.the district court proposed various measures that would have allowed gomes to participate in the hearing from outside the courtroom,but none of these proposals were technologically feasible.ultimately,without objection from counsel for either side,the district court held the hearing in gomes absence.
the government offered the testimony and written report of david mrad,a bureau of prisons forensic psychologist.mrad,who had examined gomes at,concluded that gomes was incompetent because,while he understood some aspects of the proceedings against him,he lacked a rational understanding of those proceedings and suffered from an undefined psychotic disorder.mrad report cited numerous instances of gomes persecutory ideas and other delusions.among these delusions is gomes insistence that the instant federal proceedings are part of a vast conspiracy against him orchestrated by the judge in a prior state court proceeding.
in a june,ruling,the district court found that gomes was not competent to stand trial and ordered him committed to the custody of the attorney general for three months to determine whether there was a substantial probability that gomes would attain the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future.the district court agreed with mrad that gomes persecutory delusions rendered him unable to assist in his own defense because his efforts would be directed toward uncovering the supposed conspiracy rather than defending against the actual charges.we affirmed the district court in an unpublished summary order dated october.
ii.the administrative involuntary medication proceedings 
upon his return to following the hearing,gomes was examined again and prescribed antipsychotic medication.when gomes refused to take the medication,two administrative hearings were held at,in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth at,to determine whether gomes could be involuntarily medicated.the second hearing was necessary because it was unclear whether gomes was given a copy of the report of the first hearing as required.the psychiatrists who presided at the hearings,patrick gariety and carlos tomelleri,concluded that antipsychotic medication was appropriate because it was the indicated treatment for gomes illness and other forms of treatment would not be likely to alleviate his symptoms.gomes refused to take the prescribed antipsychotic medication.
on october,the government sought to have the district court supplement its earlier commitment order to extend the time of gomes commitment and to expressly authorize the bureau of prisons to medicate gomes against his will.in a november,ruling and order,the district court granted the extension of time but denied authorization of involuntary medication.because the government interest in medicating gomes was restoring him to competency so that he could be tried,and not the weightier interest of pacifying a dangerous detainee,the district court found that involuntary medication could not be ordered without first holding a judicial hearing.
iii.the district court involuntary medication proceedings 
the district court held an involuntary medication hearing on december.the government argued that,in determining whether to order the involuntary medication of gomes to render him competent to stand trial,the district court should employ the same standard that was used in the administrative hearings the government need only show by a preponderance of the evidence that weighing the benefits against the risks,the medication was medically appropriate and there were no less intrusive means that would enable the government to bring the defendant to trial.in the alternative,the government argued that the involuntary medication of gomes was authorized under the strict scrutiny standard announced by the sixth circuit in united states brandon,cir.to prove the necessity of forcibly medicating gomes,the government offered the testimony of james wolfson,gomes treating psychiatrist at.
in response,gomes contended that such involuntary medication was never warranted unless the defendant posed a danger to himself or others.because gomes refused to submit to a psychiatric examination,his defense was limited to his own testimony and of the government psychiatrist.
the district court concluded that it could order the involuntary medication of a defendant,but that the government must first show that the involuntary medication is necessary to accomplish an essential government interest.the district court then listed eight factors that the government must establish by clear and convincing evidence 
whether the government has an overriding justification for involuntarily medicating the defendant 
whether psychotropic medication is medically appropriate and necessary 
whether there are any less intrusive means by which to restore the defendant to competency 
whether there is a sound medical basis for administering psychotropic medication 
whether there is any significant risk that the medication will impair or alter in any material way the defendant capacity or willingness to react to the testimony at trial or to assist his counsel 
whether there are any apparent of the psychotropic medication 
whether there are any other indications that the medication will in any way interfere with the defendant ability to provide information to his attorney and to participate in the making of decisions on his own behalf at trial and 
whether the defendant appearance will be adversely a ffected or whether he will suffer other prejudice at trial as a result of involuntary medication.
finally,the district court determined that it must weigh five additional factors the competing interests of the defendant and the government the dangerousness of the defendant the seriousness of the charged crime the possibility of the defendant release in the event that he can not be made to stand trial and the availability of less intrusive means by which the defendant could be restored to competency.
in concluding that the government had met its burden,the district court found that the government interest in enforcing the federal criminal laws constituted an essential,overriding justification for involuntary medicat ion.according to the court,wolfson testimony sufficiently established that the administration of the antipyschotic drugs was medically appropriate and necessary to reduce gomes persecutory delusions and restore his mental functioning that there were no less intrusive means to do so and that there was a high likelihood that the drugs would have the desired effect.the district court also found that the risks posed by side effects were neither sufficient to prohibit the use of the medication nor likely to interfere with gomes ability to participate in and assist with his trial.based on these findings,the district court ordered the involuntary medication of gomes with antipsychotic drugs,subject to certain conditions,and a extension of his commitment to the custody of the attorney general,pursuant to d a.
gomes appealed from this order.the district court stayed,during the pendency of the appeal,its order to medicate gomes.
discussion 
the question of under what circumstances medication may be forcibly administered to a criminal defendant for the purpose of rendering him competent to stand trial is one of first impression in this circuit.similarly,the supreme court has had no occasion to finally prescribe substantive standards to govern this question.riggins nevada,d.before we turn to that issue,however,we will address whether we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.
appellate jurisdiction 
the parties agree that we have appellate jurisdiction over the district court order that,among other things,authorizes the involuntary medication of gomes,under the collateral order doctrine set forth in cohen beneficial industrial loan.because jurisdiction can not be conferred by the parties,however,we must independently decide the question.
under cohen and its progeny,orders are immediately appealable if they conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d footnote omitted see also cohen,at.applying this standard,the sixth and the fourth circuits have determined that they had appellate jurisdiction to review district court orders authorizing the involuntary medication of criminal defendants.brandon,at united states morgan,cir see also united states sell,cir exercising,without expressly considering the issue,appellate jurisdiction over a district court order authorizing the involuntary medication of a criminal defendant to render him competent to stand trial united states weston,cert.denied,d same.
we join our sister circuits in holding that the cohen test is satisfied here.the district court order conclusively determined the question before it,namely whether gomes may be involuntarily medicated.also,the issues involved in determining whether to order involuntary medication are separate from the merits of the underlying criminal charges.see morgan,at brandon,at.finally,the district court order is effectively unreviewable on appeal.if the defendant should prevail after he has been forcibly medicated,his right to refuse to be medicated would have been lost and his victory would be a hollow one.see morgan,at.thus,we have jurisdiction.
ii.involuntary medication 
while the supreme court has yet to articulate a standard for determining when a criminal defendant may be involuntarily medicated to render him competent to stand trial,it has framed the issue in general terms.t he substantive issue involves a definition of th e protected constitutional interest,as well as identification of the conditions under which competing state interests might outweigh it.washington harper,d quoting mills rogers,d citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted,alterations in original.our first task,then,is to identify the competing interests of the defendant and the government.
a.the defendant interest in avoiding unwanted medication 
there can be little doubt that the forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person body represents a substantial interference with that person liberty.riggins,at.quoting harper,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court has noted,the purpose of the antipsychotics is to alter the chemical balance in a patient brain,leading to changes,intended to be beneficial,in his or her cognitive processes i t is also true that the drugs can have serious,even fatal,side effects.id.quoting harper,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.given this level of invasiveness and the severity of the possible side effects of antipsychotic medication,it follows that the criminal defendant liberty interest to be free from this sort of bodily intrusion under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is a substantial one.see,weston,at brandon,at.
when the drugs are being administered to render the defendant competent to stand trial,the defendant has other interests that come into play after the administration of the medication.it is unconstitutional for the government to bring an incompetent defendant to trial.see pate robinson,d.even when they restore competency,in particular cases antipsychotic drugs can affect a defendant demeanor as well as his willingness and ability to assist in his defense,thereby implicating sixth amendment rights to a fair trial.riggins,at.kennedy,concurring weston,at,brandon,at.in addition,some courts have gomes presses the argument in this a criminal defendant has a first amendment interest in avoiding forced medication,which may interfere with his ability to communicate ideas.brandon,at see also bee greaves,cir.
b.the government countervailing interests in prosecution 
the government countervailing interests are no less substantial and,under certain circumstances,outweigh those of the criminal defendant.the supreme court has on numerous occasions recognized that the individual strong interest in liberty,even though importan t and fundamental may,in circumstances where the government interest is sufficiently weighty,be subordinated to the greater needs of society.united states salerno,d see also kansas hendricks,d youngberg romeo,d.moreover,trial prejudice can sometimes be justified by an essential state interest,riggins,at,and the supreme court has rejected the view that the rights protected by the first amendment are absolutes.konigsberg state bar of,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the government interest in bringing a criminal defendant to trial is a fundamental one.the c onstitutional power to bring an accused to trial is fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty and prerequisite to social justice and peace.illinois allen,d brennan,concurring see also winston lee,d.in the context of forcibly administering antipsychotic medication to render a criminal defendant competent to stand trial,the government interest in prosecution has been deemed essential,sell,at,weston,at substantial,brandon,at and vital,state garcia.as the district of columbia circuit noted in weston,even though civil commitment might reduce the danger to the community posed by an individual,it can not address a host of other important societal concerns and values served by a criminal trial the retributive,deterrent,communicative,and investigative functions of the criminal justice system,serve to ensure that offenders receive their just deserts,to make clear that offenses entail consequences,and to discover what happened through the public mechanism of trial.at.the government interest in the prosecution of crime generally is a substantial and important interest,and it is usually an essential one.
iii.the standard for involuntary medication 
with these competing interests in mind,we turn to the circumstances under which the government interests are likely to outweigh those of the defendant.abjuring any definitive pronouncements,the supreme court in riggins has offered some suggestions as to the baseline requirements that must be met before antipsychotic drugs may be forcibly administered to a criminal defendant to render him competent to stand trial.
a.the substantive standard 
in riggins,the defendant,who was sentenced to death following his conviction for murder and robbery,challenged a state court order denying his motion to halt the administration of antipsychotic medication during his trial.at.the court reversed,but concluded that it had no occasion to finally prescribe substantive standards for involuntary medication,since the trial court allowed administration of antipyschotic medication to continue without making any determination of the need for this course or any findings about reasonable alternatives.id.at.emphasis in original.
one of the lessons we draw from riggins is that before the government is permitted to forcibly medicate a criminal defendant to bring him to trial,the trial court must make explicit findings as to the factors that weigh in the balance and the government showing that these factors weigh in its favor.in particular,the court indicated that forced medication might be allowable if,in addition to being medically appropriate,it were necessary to bringing a criminal defendant to trial.see id.at.t he state might have been able to justify medically appropriate,involuntary treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not obtain an adjudication of riggins guilt or innocence by using less intrusive means.id.o nce riggins moved to terminate administration of antipsychotic medication,the state became obligated to establish the need for mellaril and the medical appropriateness of the drug.the court also set forth a standard of heightened,but not strict,scrutiny for determining when the possible prejudice to a defendant fair trial rights might be outweighed by the government interest in prosecution administration of antipsychotic medication that is necessary to accomplish an essential state policy.id.at.see also id.at.contrary to the dissent understanding,we do not adopt a standard of strict scrutiny.citation omitted.
we agree with the observations of our sister circuits that the supreme court in riggins suggest ed that the governmental interest in restoring a pretrial detainee competence to stand trial could override his liberty interest,weston,at see also sell,at,and that the opinion language suggests some form of heightened scrutiny,weston,at see also sell,at.in accord with riggins,sell,and weston,we hold that heightened,but not strict,scrutiny is the appropriate standard for determining when a criminal defendant may be forcibly medicated with antipsychotic drugs for the purpose of rendering him competent to stand trial.we think that the government must show,and the district court must explicitly find,by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed treatment is medically appropriate,see sell,at weston,at that it is necessary to restore the defendant to trial competence,see sell,at weston,at that the defendant can be fairly tried while under the medication,see sell,at weston,at and that trying the defendant will serve an essential government interest,see sell,at weston,at see also united states,d,following riggins in prescribing a heightened scrutiny standard and several other factors.
the process of medicating a defendant is a dynamic one.it can be evaluated over the course of treatment to ascertain,with expert assistance,both its effectiveness and the nature of any side effects.accordingly,we believe that a district court ordering involuntary medication must closely monitor the process to ensure that the dosage is properly individualized to the defendant,that it continues to be medically appropriate,and that it does not deprive him of a fair trial or the effective assistance of counsel.see sell,at noting with approval the district court willingness to reconsider the defendant fair trial rights after the administration of the medication.there are three principal reasons why we believe the foregoing standard is the appropriate one.
b.the government overriding interest in prosecution 
first,we are convinced that,while an individualized finding must be made in each case,in most although not necessarily all of them,the district court will be considering a government interest in prosecution that will be found to weigh heavily in the balance.in our view,a strict scrutiny standard,such as that adopted by the sixth circuit,is unduly restrictive because strict scrutiny has come to be considered fatal in fact.see brandon,at.although we are not unmindful of brandon concerns about the important interests of the defendant,we can not accept the proposition that involuntary medication should be limited to defendants who are prosecuted for only the most heinous crimes.sell,at bye,dissenting weston involving,among other things,two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder of federal law officers typifies the case where the government interest is paramount because the charges include the most serious crimes known to man.as will be discussed in more detail below,we believe that in most cases a flexible regime can accommodate both the government interest in prosecution and the defendant health interests and fair trial rights consistent with constitutional requirements.
protection of the defendant health interests and fair trial rights 
second,recent advances in antipsychotic medication reduce our concerns that the defendant health interests and fair trial rights can not be adequately protected when he is involuntarily medicated to render him competent to stand trial.these concerns,which gomes forcefully presents,were carefully articulated by justice kennedy in his concurrence in riggins,at,and have been repeated in subsequent decisions.see brandon,at united states santonio,wl,at may,woodland angus.justice kennedy was particularly troubled that the side effects of these drugs might,by making the defendant look bored or unfeeling,prejudice the jury and affect the outcome of the trial.riggins,at.in addition,he believed that the drowsiness and effects of these drugs might hamper the relation,preventing effective communication and rendering the defendant less able or willing to take part in his defense.id.at.
these are important concerns.in responding to them,we first note that significant improvements have been made in antipsychotic medication in the decade since justice kennedy expressed his misgivings in riggins.justice kennedy himself presciently acknowledged then that t he state of our knowledge of antipsychotic drugs and their side effects is evolving and may one day produce effective drugs that have only minimal side effects.id.at.as the american psychiatric association has pointed out,a new generation of antipsychotic drugs largely riggins and with a more favorable side effect profile has appeared.amicus br.of the am.psychiatric ass at,hereinafter am.psychiatric ass n.the american psychological association agrees,stating that these new drugs,called atypicals,generally exhibit equal or improved therapeutic efficacy in comparison to the traditional or conventional agents,yet they have a more favorable side
