tyheem keesh and jesus jova,pro se and incarcerated,appeal a decision of the district court granting the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissing their complaint which alleged several constitutional violations in addition to violations of their rights under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et.in this opinion,we address only the rluipa claims the other claims are addressed in a separate summary order filed today.we affirm the judgment below in part and vacate and remand it in part.
plaintiff keesh allegedly wrote the defendants in requesting that he be able to practice his religion,tulukeesh.in response,the defendants advised keesh that he could practice tulukeesh in the privacy of his cell,and asked that he speak with the prison chaplain about tulukeesh and its tenets.keesh later explained to the chaplain that the dictates of tulukeesh were set forth in the book,holy blackness,which imposed various dietary obligations on followers of the religion.tulukeesh also requires tulukeesh members to engage in sparring,and prohibits them from appearing nude in front of.referencing directive,the defendants informed keesh that,in order for him to practice his religion in a group setting,he must procure an outside religious clergy person,as well as an inmate facilitator,but that he was free to hold individual services in his own cell.in response,keesh informed the defendants that,pursuant to rules set forth in the holy blackness,he was prohibited from practicing his religion absent a congregation,and protested that the defendants reliance on directive deprived him of his right to practice his religion keesh then filed a grievance raising this issue.in a decision issued in response to his grievance,the defendants informed keesh that he was permitted to practice his religion to the extent allowed under directive that he should attempt to contact an outside clergy member who could volunteer to administer religions services and that,with respect to his dietary requirements,he could eat the religious alternative meal upon keesh request,the defendants also eventually changed keesh officially listed religious designation to tulukeesh.during this same period,jova also requested to change his religious designation to tulukeesh,and demanded that the defendants accommodate his practice of the religion in the same manner as keesh had sought.
from january to july,keesh and jova wrote letters and filed grievances against the defendants complaining that they continued to be deprived of their right to practice their religion,and arguing that they were being retaliated against for exercising this right.in july,keesh and jova cells were searched by prison officials,who confiscated copies of holy blackness and materials showing that keesh,seeking to distribute the book,had contacted a company.both keesh and jova were then charged with violating institutional rules prohibiting contraband,unauthorized organization,solicitation of goods,and practicing martial acts and engaging in sparring in their defense,keesh and jova asserted their first amendment rights to free exercise.both were,however,found guilty of the majority of the charges.in a memorandum explaining the decision,keesh was told that directive prohibited proselytizing,and that his actions were tantamount to proselytization.
keesh and jova thereafter continued to file grievances alleging violations of their right to practice tulukeesh and asking that their copies of holy blackness be returned to them.these grievances were all denied,and,after another search of his cell occurred,keesh again accused the defendants of retaliating against him.in january keesh was informed that holy blackness did not violate institutional guidelines set forth in directive,but that he would not be allowed to possess the book.instead,the book would remain with the prison chaplain and keesh,jova,and any other adherent could seek permission to read it.finally,plaintiffs explained in their complaint that the tenets of tulukeesh required that they eat only a complex,highly regimented vegan diet,and that,because the defendants had not provided one,they continued to experience health problems.
as an initial matter,we must determine whether appellants received proper notice of the nature and consequences of summary judgment under vital interfaith med,cir.the failure to give actual notice to a pro se litigant of the consequences of not responding adequately to a summary judgment motion will usually constitute grounds for vacatur.see sawyer am.fed of gov t employees,cir collecting cases.where,however,a pro se litigant has demonstrated a clear understanding of the nature and consequences of a summary judgment motion and the need to set forth all available evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute over material facts,failure to provide proper notice will be deemed harmless.see reish,cir finding that a pro se litigant who filed a declaration of facts with pages of exhibits,a memorandum of law,and a for summary judgment understood the nature and consequences of summary judgment.
here,there is no indication that defendants or the district court gave plaintiffs a proper vital notice.nevertheless,we conclude that the absence of notice was harmless,as the record indicates that plaintiffs were fully aware of the requirements of summary judgment.they filed a for summary judgment,submitted over pages in opposition to the defendants motion,and,in their statement of undisputed material facts,attempted thoroughly to dispute the statement of material facts submitted by the defendants.taking into account the nature of the papers submitted by the litigant and the assertions made therein as well as the litigant participation in proceedings before the district court,vital,at,we,therefore,find that the plaintiffs knew that they were required to present evidence supporting their factual allegations and,in fact,did so,and that the lack of vital notice was harmless,see,at.
we review orders granting summary judgment de novo and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir republic bank delta airlines,cir allstate ins.mazzola,cir.in determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact,we are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.terry ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as a general matter,the rluipa imposes duties on prison officials that exceed those imposed by the first amendment.see cutter wilkinson,d.rluipa protects inmates by providing that a government shall not impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of inmates in certain institutions unless the government shows that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means.salahuddin goord,cir quoting rluipa,a.where a plaintiff adduces evidence sufficient to show that the government practice substantially burdens her religious exercise,the onus shifts to the government to demonstrate that the practice furthers a compelling governmental interest,and that the burden imposed on religion is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.see b.
here,because the defendants do not dispute that the appellants are engaged in religious exercise,and because both parties also assume that the challenged actions constitute a substantial burden on that exercise,we need only consider whether the defendants restrictions serve a compelling state interest and are the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
we have not previously considered what constitutes a compelling state interest under the rluipa.see westchester day sch.vill.of mamaroneck,cir holding only that compelling state interests are interests of the highest order.internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the supreme court has observed that safety and security concerns are undisputedly compelling state interests,and that,in enacting the rluipa,congress anticipated that courts wou
