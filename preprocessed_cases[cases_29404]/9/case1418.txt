opinion of the court 
antonio pearson is a prisoner who suffered from two serious medical needs during his incarceration at pennsylvania state correctional institution somerset.in,he filed suit under,claiming that various prison officials and an independent medical contractor were deliberately indifferent to those needs in violation of the eighth amendment.in this appeal,pearson challenges the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the five defendants remaining in this case.for the reasons set forth below,we will reverse the district court order,in part,insofar as it grants summary judgment in favor of nurse david rhodes.we will,however,affirm the district court order in all other respects.
in april,medical officials at sent pearson to the hospital twice within the same week to undergo surgery.the first was a surgery to remove his appendix.the second was a surgery to repair a urethral tear caused by the insertion of a catheter during the first surgery.the defendants are five individuals who were either aware of or responded to pearson requests for medical treatment before those surgeries.mcgrath is a medical contractor who examined pearson when he complained of bleeding after his first surgery.the other four defendants are department of corrections employees,including three nurses who examined pearson,and a guard who was informed of pearson bleeding on the morning of his second surgery.
events leading to surgery for appendicitis 
on april,pearson began experiencing sharp pains in his abdomen and requested an appointment with the medical unit.at,nurse denise thomas examined pearson and noted that his pain intensified with certain movements and never fully relieved.diagnosing him with a pulled muscle,she placed him on sick call for the following day without ordering additional treatment.
pearson excruciating pain continued and he returned to medical at.this time,nurse linda kline examined him,offered tylenol or maalox,and instructed him to rest until his appointment in the morning.according to pearson,she told him that his gallbladder was failing.
at approximately that night,pearson told the block officer that he was in severe pain and asked him to call the medical unit.after speaking with the medical unit,the officer returned to pearson cell and told him that nurse david rhodes would not come to see him because two nurses had already examined him,and he was on for the following day.left in excruciating pain,pearson screamed for several hours until the officer called medical again.this time,nurse rhodes came to his cell with a wheelchair but nurse rhodes was upset,pearson alleges,and told him that he would not be taken to medical unless he placed himself in the wheelchair.unable to walk and in pain,pearson claims that he was forced to crawl across the floor to the wheelchair.
nurse rhodes took pearson to the infirmary and examined him.he checked his vitals and recognized that pearson had possible signs of appendicitis.because abdominal pain has many causes and pearson was scheduled for a doctor examination in the morning,nurse rhodes thought a period of watchful waiting would be prudent and placed pearson inside an infirmary cell for observation.at this time,nurse rhodes put an order on pearson chart for nothing by mouth as a precaution in case he needed surgery but did not elevate pearson condition to another medical official.continuing to suffer in pain,pearson screamed throughout the night.
at approximately on april,pearson was seen by ghatge,who ordered him sent to somerset hospital for evaluation.later that day,pearson was diagnosed with appendicitis and a surgeon removed pearson inflamed appendix,as well as a gangrenous part of his omentum.
events prior to surgery for urethral tear 
on april,pearson returned to the prison with an order from his attending surgeon that he be scheduled for a examination in one week.he was examined by a prison nurse and prescribed motrin,physical therapy,and a with a physician assistant before being sent back to his cell.
on april,pearson began experiencing sharp pains and felt liquid running down his leg,which he later identified as blood flowing from his penis.he requested to be seen by medical.according to pearson,the correctional officer called medical,but nurse kline instructed the officer that bleeding was normal after surgery and that pearson should just lie down on his bunk.she did not examine him.
at this point,pearson claims that he continued to bleed in constant pain until the block officer witnessed it and sent him directly to the medical unit.at medical,pearson maintains,nurse magyar had him undress in case he needed to go to the hospital and called mcgrath,who was angry at being called at home.during that call,mcgrath ordered antibiotics as well as an increased intake of fluids.he also instructed the nurse to place pearson in the infirmary for observation.
mcgrath examined pearson at the following morning,diagnosed the bleeding as a normal consequence of the recent surgery,and sent him back to his cell.during the examination,mcgrath collected lab work,ordered antibiotics,and scheduled a appointment.later that night,pearson began bleeding again and collected a quarter of a cup of blood in a glove to show the extent of it.he then complained about the bleeding to sergeant rittenour.according to pearson,rittenour relayed his complaint to captain thomas papuga,who ordered rittenour to discard the blood pearson collected in the glove.but papuga knew that pearson was receiving medical care one of the cell block officers contacted medical and relayed to captain papuga that pearson was unsatisfied with their response.
at on april,pearson began bleeding again.he returned to medical where mcgrath observed the bleeding and transferred him to the emergency department at somerset hospital.at the hospital,it was determined that pearson was suffering from a urethral tear caused during his prior surgery.pearson underwent a second surgery to cauterize the tear and was returned to the same day.
in,pearson filed suit,pro se,under,alleging that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.shortly thereafter,the district court dismissed pearson complaint for failure to state a claim,and,on october,we vacated that dismissal,holding that several of pearson allegations stated a claim for deliberate indifference,including his allegations against nurse thomas,nurse kline,nurse rhodes,and mcgrath.pearson prison health,app x,cir.at the time,we left open whether the other defendants might be able to raise grounds for dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.and we ordered the district court to allow pearson to amend his complaint before dismissing it.id.at.
on remand,pearson filed an amended complaint,and in,the district court dismissed the claims against all the defendants except nurse kline,nurse rhodes,captain papuga,and mcgrath for failure to state a claim.nine months later,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of mcgrath and dismissed pearson actions against nurse kline,nurse rhodes,and captain papuga as a sanction for failure to prosecute.pearson appealed and this court vacated the dismissal against nurse thomas,nurse kline,nurse rhodes,and captain papuga as well as the summary judgment order in favor of mcgrath.pearson prison health,app x,cir.once again,we remanded this case to the district court.
during the second remand,counsel was appointed for pearson who requested funds for the retention of a qualified medical expert to develop malpractice and claims against somerset hospital and his appendicitis surgeon,pradham.those requests were denied,and,in,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation advising that summary judgment be entered for the five remaining defendants in this case.the district court adopted the report and recommendation and granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.this timely appeal followed.

in this case,the parties agree that pearson appendicitis and urethral tear both constitute serious medical needs,and,as we noted the first time this case was appealed,we think it beyond question that both medical issues were serious.see pearson,app x at see also atkinson taylor,cir.t his court has defined a medical need as serious if it has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment sherrod lingle,cir.affirming that an appendix on the verge of rupturing is a serious medical need.thus,the only question on appeal is whether pearson has presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the defendants were deliberately indifferent.
in its decision below,the district court granted summary judgment on all of pearson eighth amendment claims.it found that expert testimony was necessary for a reasonable jury to find that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference because pearson entire claim rests on the assertions that his care was inadequate.on appeal,pearson argues that the record is sufficient without expert testimony to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether nurse thomas,nurse rhodes,nurse kline,captain papuga,and mcgrath were deliberately indifferent.for the reasons stated below,we disagree with the district court conclusion that expert testimony was necessary in this case.and,because the record is sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that nurse rhodes acted with deliberate indifference to pearson serious medical needs,we will reverse the district court order,in part,insofar as it grants summary judgment in favor of nurse rhodes.
to assess whether summary judgment was appropriate,we must first consider whether the district court properly held that expert testimony was necessary in this case.if that legal conclusion is correct,we can affirm the district court decision without further analysis.if not,we must also consider whether pearson has offered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in his favor.
at the outset,we note that in our most recent opinion in this case,we observed that it is not clear that an expert opinion is necessary.pearson,app x at.we also note that our prior consideration of when expert testimony is required in a deliberate indifference case has only addressed when expert testimony is necessary to create a genuine dispute that the prisoner medical needs are serious.in boring kozakiewicz,cir,we held that a district court may properly require expert medical opinions when,a s laymen,the jury would not be in a position to decide whether any of the conditions described by plaintiffs could be classified as serious.id.at.in brighthwell lehman,cir,we reiterated our holding in boring,clarifying that expert testimony is not necessarily required to establish the existence of a serious medical need and that o ther forms of extrinsic proof may suffice in some cases.id.at.
because the parties agree that pearson medical need was serious,this appeal requires us to resolve an issue of first impression in this circuit.we must decide for the first time whether and when medical expert testimony may be necessary to create a triable issue on the subjective prong of a deliberate indifference case.in answering this question,three principles guide our analysis.the first is that deliberate indifference is a subjective state of mind that can,like any other form of scienter,be proven through circumstantial evidence and witness testimony.see,durmer,cir.noting that,when intent becomes critical,it is important that the trier of fact hear the defendant testimony in order to assess his credibility campbell sikes,cir.p laintiffs necessarily must use circumstantial evidence to establish subjective mental intent.in re kauffman,cir.intent must be gleaned from inferences drawn from a course of conduct.internal quotation marks omitted.
the second principle is that there is a critical distinction between cases where the complaint alleges a complete denial of medical care and those alleging inadequate medical treatment.united states ex.rel.walker fayette,cir.because mere disagreement as to the proper medical treatment does not support a claim of an eighth amendment violation,monmouth cty.corr.inst.lanzaro.cir,when medical care is provided,we presume that the treatment of a prisoner is proper absent evidence that it violates professional standards of care.see brown borough of chambersburg,cir.i t is well established that as long as a physician exercises professional judgment his behavior will not violate a prisoner constitutional rights.
the third and final principle is that the mere receipt of inadequate medical care does not itself amount to deliberate indifference the defendant must also act with the requisite state of mind when providing that inadequate care.durmer,at noting a plaintiff can only proceed to trial when there is a genuine issue of fact regarding both the adequacy of medical care and the defendant intent.this observation is critical because it makes clear that there are two very distinct subcomponents to the deliberate indifference prong of an adequacy of care claim.the first is the adequacy of the medical care an objective inquiry where expert testimony could be helpful to the jury.the second is the individual defendant state of mind a subjective inquiry that can be proven circumstantially without expert testimony.
based upon these observations,we think that medical expert testimony may be necessary to establish deliberate indifference in an adequacy of care claim where,as laymen,the jury would not be in a position to determine that the particular treatment or diagnosis fell below a professional standard of care.as is the case with evaluating whether the prisoner is suffering from a serious medical need,evaluating whether medical treatment is adequate presents an objective question typically beyond the competence of a professional.likewise,it makes sense to require a prisoner to offer extrinsic proof regarding the quality of medical care in adequacy of care cases when,to defeat our presumption that the medical care provided to him or her was adequate,the prisoner must show that the medical official did not exercise professional judgment.see,celotex catrett,holding that when the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the nonmoving party,the party moving for summary judgment may satisfy rule by demonstrating that the nonmoving party evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of its claim durmer,at p rison authorities are accorded considerable latitude in the diagnosis and treatment of prisoners.brown,at a s long as a physician exercises professional judgment his behavior will not violate a prisoner constitutional rights.
nonetheless,for two reasons,we disagree with the district court conclusion that medical expert testimony was necessary in this case.first,we believe that conclusion ignores our decision in brightwell,where we noted that expert testimony is not necessarily required where other forms of extrinsic proof may suffice.at.in this case,pearson has not offered any extrinsic proof regarding the quality of his medical care,and,it may well be possible that other forms of extrinsic proof,a training manual,photograph,or medical records could have permitted a reasonable jury to find that his medical care was inadequate.accordingly,to the extent we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could not find in pearson favor on this record,we believe that it is additional extrinsic proof,rather than an expert witness specifically,that was required for him to survive summary judgment.
second,we disagree with the district court conclusion that additional proof was needed to create a triable issue on all,rather than just some,of pearson deliberate indifference claims.certainly,for the reasons just stated,extrinsic evidence is needed to create a triable issue on pearson adequacy of treatment claims where it would not be obvious to a layperson that the defendant breached a professional standard of care.however,pearson also raises two claims that he was delayed or denied treatment outright for a reason and one adequacy of treatment claim where it would be apparent to a layperson that his medical treatment violated a professional standard of care.for these claims,additional extrinsic proof was not necessary to survive summary judgment,and we hold that the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
for pearson claim that nurse rhodes forced him to crawl to a wheelchair,we believe that pearson sworn testimony is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact that nurse rhodes acted with deliberate disregard to his medical needs.see bushman halm,cir.noting that in the absence of any contrary medical evidence,plaintiff sworn testimony must be taken as true for purposes of creating a fact issue.as noted above,our precedent provides that a plaintiff can proceed to trial on an adequacy of care claim when there is a genuine issue of fact regarding both the adequacy of care and the defendant intent.durmer,at.and we do not think additional extrinsic proof is necessary for pearson to create a genuine dispute of fact on either issue for this claim.a layperson is capable of concluding that forcing a screaming patient to crawl to a wheelchair violates professional standards of care and a reasonable jury could find that nurse rhodes knew pearson could not walk and deliberately failed to assist him for reasons.
for pearson claims that he was delayed or denied medical treatment for a reason,we also believe that requiring additional extrinsic proof would be inappropriate given the subjective nature of scienter and our case law on deliberate indifference.again,a delay or denial of medical treatment claim must be approached differently than an adequacy of care claim.fayette,at.unlike the deliberate indifference prong of an adequacy of care claim which involves both an objective and subjective inquiry,the deliberate indifference prong of a delay or denial of medical treatment claim involves only one subjective inquiry since there is no presumption that the defendant acted properly,it lacks the objective,propriety of medical treatment,prong of an adequacy of care claim.absent that objective inquiry,extrinsic proof is not necessary for the jury to find deliberate indifference in a delay or denial of medical treatment claim.all that is needed is for the surrounding circumstances to be sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that the delay or denial was motivated by factors.see,durmer,at united states michener,cir.i t is for the jury to determine the weight to be given to each piece of evidence particularly where the question at issue is the credibility of the witness.the district court erred in holding otherwise.
in sum,because it is just as difficult for a layperson to assess the adequacy of medical care as it is for them to assess the seriousness of a medical condition,we hold that medical expert testimony may be necessary in some adequacy of care cases when the propriety of a particular diagnosis or course of treatment would not be apparent to a layperson.nonetheless,we disagree with the district court conclusion that expert testimony was necessary in this case because we are not satisfied that medical expert testimony would be necessary for all of pearson claims,nor are we satisfied that other forms of extrinsic proof would not have sufficed.
because the district court incorrectly held that expert testimony was necessary for pearson to survive summary judgment,we must now consider whether the record in this case was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether nurse thomas,nurse rhodes,nurse kline,captain papuga,and mcgrath were deliberately indifferent to pearson serious medical needs.as the supreme court has explained,deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence and is a subjective standard that requires the official to both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists and to also draw the inference.farmer brennan.in prior cases,we have found deliberate indifference in a variety of contexts including where prison authorities deny reasonable requests for medical treatment,knowledge of the need for medical care is accompanied by the intentional refusal to provide it,necessary medical treatment is delayed for reasons,and prison authorities prevent an inmate from receiving recommended treatment for serious medical needs.lanzaro,at.because each defendant played a different role in regard to pearson treatment at sci somerset,we will address pearson claims against each of them in turn.
claims against nurse thomas 
pearson first claims that the district court erred when granting summary judgment to nurse thomas.he argues that a reasonably jury could find that she acted with deliberate indifference because she did not raise his abdominal pain with other staff and offered no medical assistance other than to place him on sick call.
we disagree.first,even if a reasonable jury could find that nurse thomas was negligent in diagnosing or treating his pain,that would not be enough for the jury to find that nurse thomas acted with deliberate indifference in violation of the eighth amendment.as the supreme court has held,a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the eighth amendment.estelle,at see also spruill gillis,cir.allegations of medical malpractice are not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.
second,while pearson claims that nurse thomas delayed or denied him medical care,it is undisputed that she examined him,diagnosed him with a pulled muscle,and decided not to elevate his condition based on her opinion that it was not severe.thus,his claim against her is one that she inadequately diagnosed and treated his medical condition.as we remarked earlier,that distinction is critical because the deliberate indifference standard affords considerable latitude to prison medical authorities in the diagnosis and treatment of the medical problems of inmate patients,we must disavow any attempt to the propriety or adequacy of their particular course of treatment so long as it remains a question of sound professional judgment.inmates of allegheny cty.jail pierce,cir.internal quotation marks omitted see also brown,at i t is well established that as long as a physician exercises professional judgment his behavior will not violate a prisoner constitutional rights.fayette,at f ederal courts are generally reluctant to second guess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims which sound in state tort law.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,pearson has offered no circumstantial evidence suggesting that nurse thomas subjectively appreciated the true seriousness of the risk of harm.nor did he produce extrinsic evidence suggesting that nurse thomas treatment decision regarding the symptoms of which she had awareness was a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,practice,or standards such that a reasonable jury could conclude that she actually did not base her decision on such judgment.youngberg romeo.accordingly,no reasonable jury could find that she acted with the obduracy and wantonness that violates the eighth amendment,and we agree with the district court that nurse thomas is entitled to summary judgment.whitley albers,it is obduracy and wantonness,not inadvertence or error in good faith,that characterize the conduct prohibited by the cruel and unusual punishments clause.
claims against nurse kline 
for similar reasons,we also agree with the district court that nurse kline is entitled to summary judgment.although pearson argues that a reasonable jury could find that she was deliberately indifferent to his appendicitis when she told him that his gallbladder was failing but merely offered him tylenol and maalox,we disagree.without extrinsic evidence showing that a failing gall bladder is emergent or necessitates some other response,no layperson would be able to find that nurse kline determination that pearson should rest until his examination in the morning was a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,practice,or standards.youngberg,at.hence no reasonable jury could find that this response violated the eighth amendment.see,brown,at i t is well established that as long as a physician exercises professional judgment his behavior will not violate a prisoner constitutional rights.
likewise,while pearson maintains that a reasonable jury could find that nurse kline acted with deliberate indifference to his urethral tear when she initially declined to examine his bleeding on april and then noted a copious amount of blood,in his underwear without escalating his situation,we believe that the record fails to create a triable issue as to whether nurse kline acted with deliberate indifference.whether or not nurse kline escalated pearson condition,it is clear that his condition was elevated to mcgrath once pearson was taken to the infirmary.nurse kline can not be held liable for allowing a different nurse to escalate pearson condition,nor can she be held liable for following mcgrath orders that pearson remain in the infirmary overnight.see durmer,at noting can not be considered deliberately indifferent simply because they failed to respond directly to the medical complaints of a prisoner who was already being treated by the prison doctor.
finally,even if nurse kline refused to examine pearson when the correctional officer first called about his bleeding,the circumstances surrounding this refusal are not sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether she violated the eighth amendment.while pearson points to evidence that nurse kline delayed her examination because she believed that his bleeding was normal after surgery,this serves only to reinforce that she failed to immediately appreciate the severity of his medical needs.absent evidence that the seriousness of his bleeding was communicated to her at that time,a reasonable jury could not conclude she was aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm existe d and that she also dr ew the inference.see farmer,at.and that is only particularly so here given this lack of communication regarding the seriousness of the bleeding,and given that pearson was under the care of mcgrath,who had prescribed medicine and physical therapy upon pearson return from his appendectomy,nurse kline was justified in believing that pearson was not in danger absent instructions from mcgrath or pearson surgeon that bleeding should be treated as more than a normal consequence of his surgery 
claims against nurse rhodes 
pearson next argues that a reasonable jury could find that nurse rhodes acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs because nurse rhodes refused to examine him in his cell when the block officer first called medical,forced him to crawl to the wheelchair to obtain medical treatment,and did nothing but order him placed in the infirmary overnight despite recognizing signs of appendicitis.we agree with pearson that these claims create a triable issue as to whether nurse rhodes acted with deliberate indifference to his needs.we will therefore reverse the order of the district court,in part,insofar as it grants summary judgment in favor of nurse rhodes.
pearson claim that nurse rhodes failed to examine him when he initially requested medical assistance creates a triable issue as to whether nurse rhodes was deliberately indifferent because it raises a claim that pearson was either denied reasonable requests for medical treatment,or necessary medical treatment was delayed for reasons.unlike nurse kline,nurse rhodes can not claim that pearson was already being treated by a physician.in addition,when rhodes initially denied medical care,he was confronted with a report from a corrections officer that an inmate was suffering from excruciating pain an inmate who had twice sought medical assistance earlier in the day,reporting the same complaint but with increasing severity.as farmer noted,an official may not escape liability by merely refus ing to verify underlying facts that he strongly suspect s to be true,or declin ing to confirm strong inferences of risk that he strongly suspect s to exist.farmer,at.neither is he immunized from liability merely because he delays care for an emergent condition in reliance on a sick call policy.see natale camden cty.corr.facility,cir.because these circumstances may suggest that nurse rhodes engaged in a pattern of deliberately indifferent conduct in spite of evidence that he was aware that pearson faced a substantial risk of harm,there is a genuine issue of fact as to why nurse rhodes refused to examine pearson and we can not conclude as a matter of law his conduct did not run afoul of the eighth amendment.durmer,at.
likewise,pearson claim that he was forced to crawl to the wheelchair creates a genuine dispute as to whether nurse rhodes acted with deliberate indifference.viewing the record in pearson favor,as we must,nurse rhodes forced a patient,who had been screaming in pain for several hours,to crawl to a wheelchair despite indicating that he was unable to walk.we do not believe that additional evidence is required for a reasonable jury to conclude that this conduct violates a professional standard of care or that such conduct entails the obduracy and wantonness that is proscribed by the eighth amendment.see,cummings roberts,cir.reversing grant of summary judgment where the plaintiff claimed that defendants refused to give him a wheelchair,forcing him to crawl on the floor 
finally,pearson claim that nurse rhodes merely ordered observation despite recognizing signs of appendicitis creates a triable issue as to whether nurse rhodes acted with deliberate indifference.on its own,this claim might not be sufficient to survive summary judgment because nurse rhodes examined and diagnosed pearson in the infirmary,we would be confronted with an adequacy of treatment claim that lacks extrinsic evidence showing that nurse rhodes response so deviated from professional standards of care that it amounted to deliberate indifference.allard baldwin,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.but that examination did not occur until after nurse rhodes refused to treat pearson and allegedly forced him crawl to a wheelchair.this pattern of disinterested conduct separates this complaint from ordinary allegations of medical malpractice.white napoleon,cir.indeed,while one reasonable reading of the record in this case is that nurse rhodes ordered observation in the infirmary based on his informed medical judgment,we can not conclude that it is the only one because,insofar as the record suggests that nurse rhodes repeatedly ignored pearson requests for treatment
