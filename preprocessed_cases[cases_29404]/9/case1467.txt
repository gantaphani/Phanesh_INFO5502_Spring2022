opinion of the court 
in this case we consider the efforts of plaintiff patricia thompson to hold her former employers responsible for alleged overtime violations under the fair labor standards act flsa,and the new jersey wage and hour law,stat.ann.thompson appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of new jersey,which granted the motion of defendants to dismiss each of thompson claims under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.for the following reasons,we will vacate and remand.
in june,appellant patricia thompson,a new jersey resident,was hired as a mortgage underwriter by defendant security atlantic mortgage company security atlantic,a nationwide direct mortgage lender.app.shortly thereafter,however,she was assigned to a training class led by a representative for a different mortgage company,defendant real estate mortgage network remn.that employee represented that remn was a sister company of security atlantic.app.
in february,allegedly in response to an investigation being conducted by the department of housing and urban development hud into security atlantic mortgage practices,thompson and many of her colleagues were asked by supervisors to fill out new job applications to work for remn.thompson completed the application as requested.from roughly that date forward,thompson paychecks were issued by remn instead of security atlantic.defendants characterize security atlantic,which is no longer in business,as defunct.
despite thompson transfer to remn,virtually no change occurred in operations.thompson and her colleagues continued to do the same work,at the same desks,at the same location.thompson pay rate,work email address,and direct supervisors remained the same.thompson alleges that no employees were laid off during this transition,although some of her colleagues continued to receive paychecks from security atlantic.
the basis for this lawsuit against both security atlantic and remn is thompson allegation that between june and the end of her employment with remn on august,
d efendants suffered and permitted plaintiff and other underwriters,closers and hud reviewers to regularly work more than eight hours per day and more than forty hours per week without overtime compensation for all overtime hours worked.employees were given turnaround times for assignments and employees routinely worked through lunch and at home to meet these requirements.
app.thompson also alleges that d efendants uniformly misrepresented to plaintiff and other mortgage underwriters,closers and hud reviewers that they were exempt,salaried employees and,therefore,ineligible to receive overtime pay.app.the misconduct was allegedly widespread,repeated and consistent.id.
aside from her claims against security atlantic and remn,thompson also seeks relief from defendants samuel lamparello the and president of security atlantic and noel chapman the and executive vice president of security atlantic.the amended complaint alleges that throughout the time periods at issue,chapman and lamparello made decisions concerning security atlantic and remn operations,hiring,firing,promotions,personnel matters,work schedules,pay policies,and compensation.app.when a work or personnel issue arose at security atlantic or remn that thompson immediate supervisor could not address alone,the supervisor would consult with,among others,chapman or lamparello.id.
in june,thompson directly asked chapman about overtime compensation.he responded that he did not pay overtime to underwriters.app.in july,chapman sent an email to all departments stating,in part,so many of you worked long hours,late nights and even weekends to make sure that all remn customers are happy customers.app.thompson quit her job at remn on august.in,both chapman and lamparello became officers of remn.
thompson filed her class and collective action complaint on march,on december,the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to state a claim.
thompson filed her amended complaint on january.she asserts that all four defendants violated the flsa by failing to properly compensate plaintiff,failing to pay plaintiff overtime pay for time worked in excess of hours in a workweek,and misclassifying plaintiff as exempt from the overtime wage requirements of the flsa.app.thompson further seeks to hold remn liable for samc own statutory violations under theories of joint liability and successor liability.she also contends that chapman and lamparello were her employer s joint employer s by virtue of their positions with the defendant companies,and therefore are personally,jointly and severally liable for the violations of the flsa and the new jersey wage and hour law by security atlantic and remn.app.
on august,the district court dismissed without prejudice the entirety of thompson amended complaint.thompson filed a timely notice of appeal and has not sought leave to file a second amended complaint.
we have jurisdiction under over a district court dismissal without prejudice where,as here,the plaintiff elects to stand on the dismissed complaint without further amendment.hagan rogers,cir our review of a district court dismissal under rule b is de novo.fowler upmc shadyside,cir.under the notice pleading standard embodied in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a plaintiff must come forward with a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.as explicated in ashcroft iqbal,d,a claimant must state a plausible claim for relief,and a claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.although f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,bell atlantic twombly,d,a plaintiff need only put forth allegations that raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element.fowler,at quotation marks and citations omitted see also covington int l ass of approved basketball officials,cir.
the flsa and its counterpart,the new jersey wage and hour law,allow employees to sue their past or present employers for various causes of action.like the district court and parties,we will distinguish between thompson claims and claims only as necessary.
relevant here,the flsa provides 
n o employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.
a for employees who have been wrongly denied overtime pay,the flsa offers a private cause of action to recover the corpus of the unpaid compensation along with equivalent liquidated damages,costs,and attorney fees.id.b.
our first inquiry in most flsa cases is whether the plaintiff has alleged an actionable relationship.an employer is any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee id.d.an employee is any individual employed by an employer.id.e.to employ means to suffer or permit to work.id.g.as we have recently recognized,the breadth of these definitions is both intentional and obvious 
when determining whether someone is an employee under the flsa,economic reality rather than technical concepts is to be the test of employment.under this theory,the flsa defines employer expansively,and with striking breadth.the supreme court has even gone so far as to acknowledge that the flsa definition of an employer is the broadest definition that has ever been included in any one act.

thompson first challenges the district court dismissal of her most straightforward claims,that security atlantic committed statutory violations by failing to compensate thompson appropriately between her date of hiring in june and her transfer to remn in february,and remn committed entirely separate statutory violations by failing to compensate thompson appropriately between her date of hiring in february and the conclusion of her employment in july.the district court did not explain its reasoning for dismissal of these claims.nor did defendants below mount a serious argument for such dismissal.accordingly,we are left without the benefit of an articulated legal basis for the district court ruling.defendants now attempt to justify the dismissal of these claims by arguing that thompson allegations improperly group all defendants individual and corporate together and fail to differentiate between them as to alleged wrongful conduct.appellees br.at.
the pleadings here put the corporate defendants on fair notice that the alleged violations began during thompson employment with security atlantic and persisted throughout her relatively brief tenure with the two companies.accordingly,we will vacate the district court dismissal of thompson claims against security atlantic and remn under a theory of primary liability.
thompson also appeals from the district court dismissal of her claims insofar as they depend on a theory of joint employment between security atlantic and remn.under the flsa,multiple persons or entities can be responsible for a single employee wages as joint employers in certain situations.one such scenario occurs where both employers exert significant control over the employee,browning ferris indus.of,cir,by reason of the fact that one employer controls,is controlled by,or is under common control with the other employer.b.under these circumstances,each joint employer may be held jointly and severally liable for the flsa violations of the other,in addition to direct liability for its own violations.
we have recently treated this topic in some depth,see in re enterprise,at,and in so doing announced a directive that we described as the enterprise test.when assessing whether a joint employer relationship exists,a court should consider the following list of relevant factors 
the alleged employer authority to hire and fire the relevant employees the alleged employer authority to promulgate work rules and assignments and to set the employees conditions of employment compensation,benefits,and work schedules,including the rate and method of payment the alleged employer involvement in employee supervision,including employee discipline and the alleged employer actual control of employee records,such as payroll,insurance,or taxes.
id.at.as with the existence of an relationship in the first instance,however,the determination depends on all the facts in the particular case.a.
here,the district court emphasized that thompson employment by security atlantic was separate and distinct from her employment by remn.this may be correct if one considers only the name of the payor appearing on thompson pay stubs.but thompson alleges more.the amended complaint states that an employee of remn conducted thompson training immediately after she was hired by security atlantic in june,indicating that remn had at least some authority to promulgate work rules and assignments even before remn formally hired thompson in february.the employee responsible for thompson training allegedly described remn as security atlantic sister company,a term which suggests some broader degree of corporate intermingling.and the scenario described by thompson,in which she and virtually all other security atlantic employees were abruptly and seamlessly integrated into remn commercial mortgage business while some of those same employees continued to be paid by security atlantic,supports thompson claim that the two companies shared authority over hiring and firing practices.
we caution that our assessment rests heavily on the procedural posture of this litigation.thompson,a employee with each of the defendant companies,has had no opportunity for discovery as to payroll and taxation documents,disciplinary records,internal corporate communications,or leadership and ownership structures.it may well be that a fully developed factual record will preclude a finding that security atlantic and remn were joint employers of thompson for any of the pay periods at issue.but under these circumstances,we can not say that thompson amended complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.we will vacate the district court dismissal of thompson claims in this regard and remand for further proceedings.
thompson alternatively seeks to hold remn liable for security atlantic alleged violations not only on a joint employer theory,but also on the theory that remn,as an alleged successor in interest to security atlantic,is obligated to assume that company debts and liabilities.the parties dispute which law,state or federal,governs thompson flsa successor liability claims 
defendants urge that we apply new jersey law,which holds that successor corporations are legally distinct from their predecessors and do not assume any of the debts or liabilities of the prior entity,except where 
the purchasing corporation expressly or impliedly agreed to assume such debts and liabilities 
the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the seller and purchaser the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation,or the transaction is entered into fraudulently in order to escape responsibility for such debts and liabilities.
ramirez amsted.here,thompson claims that remn is a mere continuation of security atlantic,and is therefore accountable for its legal liabilities.we have previously summarized new jersey law pertaining to the mere continuation rule as follows 
factors relevant to the mere continuation exception include continuity of ownership continuity of management continuity of personnel continuity of physical location,assets and general business operations and cessation of the prior business shortly after the new entity is formed.also relevant is the extent to which the successor intended to incorporate the predecessor into its system with as much the same structure and operation as possible.thus the court should determine whether the purchaser holds itself out to the world as the effective continuation of the seller.however,the proponent of successor liability need not necessarily establish all of these factors.

thompson urges that,as to her flsa claim,we apply a federal common law standard for successor liability that has slowly gained traction in the field of labor and employment disputes over the course of almost fifty years.that standard,which presents a lower bar to relief than most state jurisprudence,was designed to impos e liability upon successors beyond the confines of the common law rule when necessary to protect important policies,einhorn ruberton constr,cir,and dictates consideration of only the following factors continuity in operations and work force of the successor and predecessor employers notice to the of its predecessor legal obligation and ability of the predecessor to provide adequate relief directly.brzozowski corr.physician,cir quoting rego arc water treatment of,cir.
the supreme court crafted the federal common law standard in the context of a claim under the labor management relations act,see john wiley sons,livingston,d,and later applied the standard to claims under the national labor relations act.see golden state bottling,d.in the past decade we have further extended the federal standard to claims brought under title vii,see brzozowski,at,and erisa,see einhorn,at.
two of our sister circuits have addressed the merits of this issue and concluded that application of the federal standard to claims under the flsa is the logical extension of existing case law.see,teed thomas betts power solutions,cir steinbach hubbard,cir.we agree.in teed,judge posner,writing for the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,stated the following case for the ongoing vitality of the standard itself and for its applicability to claims under the flsa
