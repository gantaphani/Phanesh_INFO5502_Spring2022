the district court granted summary judgment for defendants upon concluding that kohn harassment of plaintiff could not be imputed to defendants.duch kohn,civ,wl.although we agree with the district court that plaintiff was not deprived of all reasonable avenues of complaint,we hold that a reasonable jury could conclude that defendants knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,of the harassment directed at plaintiff and failed to take appropriate remedial action.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
during the time period relevant to this case,duch was employed as a court officer by the new york state unified court system ucs.duch,wl,at.oca is the administrative branch of the ucs.id.on august,she was assigned to midtown community court mcc.id.the personnel at the mcc consisted of a judge,a lieutenant,a sergeant,approximately twelve court officers,and four court clerks.id.one of the court officers,rosemary christiano,was also the equal employment opportunity eeo liaison at the mcc.id.other personnel of note included defendant jakubek,who was the court officer at the mcc,and chief court clerk don vasti vasti,who was the administrative official at the mcc.id.during the relevant time period jakubek was supervisor to both duch and defendant kohn.
in may,kohn began working at the mca as a court the same position and rank as duch.id.on september,duch and kohn engaged in a consensual sexual encounter at duch apartment this encounter did not involve intercourse.id.according to duch,she informed kohn the next day that the encounter had been a mistake and that she did not want to pursue further relations with him.following that encounter and continuing until january,kohn allegedly made a series of unwanted sexual advances towards duch.duch,wl,at.these allegedly included physical contact,sexually graphic language,and physical gestures.id.
in october,after learning that she was scheduled to work alone with kohn on an upcoming saturday,duch approached jakubek and asked him for the day off.she did not inform jakubek at that time that kohn was reason she sought to change her schedule.later that same day,jakubek called duch back into his office and said that he had heard that she wanted to change her schedule to avoid working with kohn.jakubek explained that he had spoken to kohn and had asked him directly why duch would feel uncomfortable working with him and that kohn had responded,well,maybe i did something or said something that i should not have.according to duch,jakubek said that he had told kohn to cut it out,to grow up.id.jakubek then asked duch if she had a problem working with kohn and,because kohn asserts she was becoming emotional at this point in the conversation and was trying to maintain her composure,she responded by saying,i ca talk about it.id.at.duch claims that jakubek replied,that good because i do want to know what happened,and then laughed.id.following this exchange,jakubek offered to change duch schedule so she would not have to work alone at night with kohn,and thereafter did not schedule duch to work with kohn alone.duch,wl,at.
later in october,duch spoke with christiano about kohn first of several conversations on the subject.id.duch admits that,prior to this occasion,she was unaware that christiano was an eeo liaison.id.however,during their first conversation about the alleged harassment,christiano asked duch if she was speaking to her as a friend or because christiano was an eeo liaison.id.duch responded,i think i telling you as a friend.id.according to christiano,she asked duch whether duch wanted her to report kohn behavior and duch responded absolutely not.id.duch nevertheless maintains that she told christiano of the harassment,hoping that christiano would stop or report the conduct.id.throughout this time,christiano did not report the harassment to anyone.instead,christiano allegedly gave duch inappropriate advice,including asking why duch did just grab kohn and hurt him.
duch claims that,during the months that followed,kohn continued to harass her and she became seriously ill and started avoiding work.specifically,duch claims that she became depressed,stopped eating,and experienced suicidal ideations.she also cut and dyed her hair in order to make herself less attractive.
in december,court officer david joseph replaced christiano as eeo liaison.duch,wl,at.within a few days of his becoming eeo liaison,duch came to joseph to inform him that she wanted to file a formal complaint about kohn conduct.because he understood that he was supposed to go through the chief clerk,joseph contacted vasti to arrange a meeting for duch.
on january,duch spoke with vasti about kohn alleged conduct.duch,wl,at.on january,she filed a claim of discriminatory treatment with the oca office of the special inspector general for bias matters.id.that day,the special inspector general began an investigation into duch complaint,which came to include interviews of twenty individuals and an administrative hearing.id.on the basis of the investigation,disciplinary charges were brought against kohn.id.all charges against kohn were eventually dismissed,however,because duch failed to submit to.id.duch claims that the reason she did not submit to is that she was medically unfit to testify at that time.id.although the parties do not agree on the precise date or terms of duch departure,it is undisputed that she ceased to work for the ucs in december.id.
on january,duch commenced this action,alleging that kohn,jakubek,oca,and the state of new york had violated title vii,as well as the nyshrl and the nychrl,by creating a hostile work environment.in an august,memorandum and order,the district court dismissed duch claims under the nyshrl and the nychrl as barred by the eleventh amendment,and denied as futile duch motion to amend her complaint to assert a claim against jakubek in his individual capacity under the nyshrl and the nychrl.duch,wl,at.as noted above,the district court granted summary judgment in defendants favor on duch title vii claims on the grounds that the oca provided a reasonable avenue of complaint to its employees,no reasonable could conclude that employer defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged harassment,and even assuming that employer defendants did know or should have known of the alleged harassment,their response was reasonable.id.at.the district court also dismissed duch title vii claim against kohn,declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claims against him,and denied duch cross motion for partial summary judgment.id.at.final judgment was entered on august.this timely appeal followed 
discussion 
we review de novo an order granting summary judgment.see,miller wolpoff abramson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
title vii hostile work environment 
in order to prevail on a hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must make two showings that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment and that there is a specific basis for imputing the conduct creating the hostile work environment to the employer.feingold new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
abusive working environment 
proving the existence of a hostile work environment involves both objective and subjective elements.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,a plaintiff must show that the misconduct was severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive.id.quoting alfano costello,cir.
because defendants did not seek,nor did the district court grant,summary judgment on this ground,we do not address it further.see duch,wl,at the court declines to address whether plaintiff has established the first element of a hostile work environment claim because,for the reasons discussed below,the claim fails as a matter of law on the second element.
imputing the conduct to the employer 
at issue on this appeal is whether duch can impute the conduct that created the hostile work environment to her employer.in a situation such as this,when the harassment is attributable to a coworker,rather than a supervisor,the employer will be held liable only for its own negligence.distasio perkin elmer,cir.accordingly,duch must demonstrate that her employer failed to provide a reasonable avenue for complaint or that it knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,about the harassment yet failed to take appropriate remedial action.howley town of stratford,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
reasonable avenue of complaint 
the district court concluded that no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the employer defendants failed to provide plaintiff with a reasonable avenue of complaint.duch,wl,at.we agree.
duch argues that the district court improperly focused on the fact that oca had a sexual harassment policy in place and that duch had received a booklet on sexual harassment.see id.according to duch,the district court failed to consider whether eeo liaison avenue of complaint that duch chose to inadequate because of her alleged lack of training.christiano testified that w hen the time came that i was supposed to go for the training,i could go because we were short of officers and i just could go,so i never got the training.moreover,according to duch,in response to her complaints,christiano inappropriately inquired why duch did just grab kohn and hurt him.
even assuming that christiano response rendered her an inadequate avenue for complaint,the relevant inquiry is not whether a particular avenue of complaint was effectively blocked but,rather,whether defendants provided no reasonable avenue of complaint.see distasio,at emphasis added quoting murray.college of dentistry,cir see also howley,at explaining that employers must provide a reasonable avenue of complaint emphasis added.as duch herself acknowledges in her brief,according to the deputy director of human resources at oca,a victim of discriminatory conduct could seek assistance from at least five different sources in addition to the eeo office recently renamed the workforce diversity office,including the inspector general office,an panel member,a supervisor,someone in charge,and a representative of the work life assistance program.appellant br.accordingly,regardless of christiano response,oca provided numerous alternative avenues of complaint that duch could,and eventually did,pursue.
we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in holding that no reasonable jury could conclude that defendants failed to provide duch with a reasonable avenue of complaint.
knowledge and failure to act 
despite offering a reasonable avenue of complaint to plaintiff,employer defendants can still be held liable if plaintiff can show that they knew,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,about the harassment yet failed to take appropriate remedial action.howley,at internal quotation marks omitted.this standard requires a plaintiff to show that someone had actual or constructive knowledge of the harassment,the knowledge of this individual can be imputed to the employer,and the employer response,in light of that knowledge,was unreasonable.with respect to imputing the knowledge of employees to an employer,we have explained that 
a n official actual or constructive knowledge of harassment will be imputed to the employer when principles of agency law so dictate.that will be the case when a the official is at a sufficiently high level in the company management hierarchy to qualify as a proxy for the company,or b the official is charged with a duty to act on the knowledge and stop the harassment,or c the official is charged with a duty to inform the company of the harassment.
torres pisano,cir internal citations and footnote omitted.for who lack authority to counsel,investigate,suspend,or fire the accused harasser the inaction does not spark employer liability unless that has an official or strong de facto duty to act as a conduit to management for complaints about work conditions.id.quoting lamb household credit.
here,duch seeks to impute knowledge of kohn harassment to her employer based on the alleged knowledge of two individuals christiano and jakubek.we review the evidence with respect to each below.
christiano 
it is clear from the record that christiano had actual knowledge of kohn harassment of duch.as a without supervisory authority,however,christiano knowledge can be imputed to her employer only if she had an official or strong de facto duty to act as a conduit to management for complaints about work conditions.see id.at emphasis omitted.however,we need not decide whether christiano had an official or de facto duty to convey duch complaints to management.even assuming that as eeo liaison christiano had such a duty,duch can not satisfy the final requirement under torres that christiano response,in light of her knowledge,was unreasonable.see id.at holding that plaintiff supervisor did not act unreasonably by honoring plaintiff request to keep complaints of harassment confidential.
although duch testified that she told christiano about kohn harassment hoping that christiano would stop or report the conduct,wl,at emphasis removed,christiano uncontradicted testimony was as follows i said do you want me to tell jakubek and duch said absolutely not,emphasis added we must therefore determine whether christiano acted reasonably by keeping that information confidential,notwithstanding duch unspoken expectations.
in torres pisano we were presented with nearly identical circumstances and held that a supervisor did not breach his duty to remedy harassment by honoring an employee request to keep her complaint confidential.at.we explained that 
the law will not presume in every case that harassed members of title vii protected classes do not know what is best for themselves and can not make reasonable decisions to least for a harassment claims,perhaps for privacy or emotional reasons,until they are ready to do so.
id.at.we also noted,however,that this is not a question that we can answer categorically and that t here is certainly a point at which harassment becomes so severe that a reasonable employer simply can not stand by,even if requested to do so by a terrified employee.id.
duch argues that the conduct to which she was allegedly subjected passes that point at which an employer is compelled to act regardless of the expressed wishes of the harassed employee.we disagree.although duch testified that she told christiano about most incidents involving kohn,and although the harassment was allegedly causing serious harm to leading her to contemplate is no evidence that christiano was aware of the psychological toll that kohn harassment was allegedly inflicting on duch.see,i did feel karen duch was threatened whatsoever.she was very adamant that she was able to handle this herself.i believe that she could.see also torres,at finding defendant employer re
