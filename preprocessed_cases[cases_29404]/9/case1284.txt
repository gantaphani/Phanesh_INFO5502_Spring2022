factual background 
starr dawson dawson,deborah macdonald macdonald,pauline deans deans,deloris cherry cherry,millicent mcfarlane mcfarlane,and velma lee lee were female corrections officers cos employed at a male correctional facility the facility in westchester county.deborah johnson johnson and phillip banks banks or banks were both sergeants at the facility,a rank superior to that of.
the events at the center of this suit began on or about october,when co kelli reckard gave deans a letter apparently written by inmates at the facility addressed to all female.the typed document contained degrading,explicit,and violent sexual references to individual female cos,including the plaintiffs,reckard,and others.it also featured an obscene drawing.deans showed the letter to macdonald,who made photocopies for dawson and johnson.macdonald and johnson gave a copy of the document to warden william decuiceis decuiceis,who said he would investigate the matter.
on or about october,a second letter of a similar sort was found in the facility.co donna alford showed it to deans,who gave a copy to banks,apparently at his request.the parties agree that banks expressed indignation at the letters and told deans that if their author could be identified,banks would have him transferred and written up.according to his own testimony,however,banks never reported the letters to his captain or to the warden.
plaintiffs allege that banks was responsible for the subsequent dissemination of the letters throughout the facility.on october or,plaintiffs assert,banks circulated the letters among various personnel in the mess hall.cherry testified in her deposition that she witnessed co middleton asking banks to show him that letter,and that after banks complied,cherry told him,i know what you are doing,distributing the letters.upset,cherry reported the incident to johnson.in his deposition,banks gave a different account of his encounter with cherry in the mess hall.he testified that cherry had approached the table where banks was eating with reynolds,and that banks had said,you look down,cherry.i hope those letters are getting you down,to which she responded in the negative and joked that the authors of the letter were mistaken about the size of her breasts.
mcfarlane also testified that she saw banks showing what she believed were copies of the letters to other officers in an area of the jail known as the bubble.plaintiffs further contend that banks directed co carol merrill to make copies of the letter for distribution to personnel in the facility booking office macdonald alleges that a sergeant hittman informed her that banks was disseminating the letters to other personnel in the control or tac room.
plaintiffs complain of various inappropriate remarks by banks in connection with the letters.thus,mcfarlane alleges,on october banks asked her in the presence of reynolds what other body parts did she have pierced,to which mcfarlane responded,i find this line of conversation offensive and i wish you would stop.when banks repeated the question,and mcfarlane gave a similar answer,reynolds advised banks to cease and desist,warning him that mcfarlane had filed a harassment complaint against another officer in the past.mcfarlane reported her encounter with banks in a statement to the facility special investigations unit siu on october 
also on october,lee returned from vacation and allegedly witnessed banks giving a piece of paper to co bush in the lobby of the department of corrections.according to lee,banks said to her,i see you made the top,asked lee if she had her sense of humor with her,and told bush to show her the letter.lee claims that banks commented to her,at least yours was the mildest of them all.lee reported this incident to a union representative,another co,and two captains,and wrote a statement for the siu.other female cos apparently reported to johnson that banks made similar top list remarks to them,and johnson testified that she advised warden decuiceis that banks was distributing the letters throughout the facility.several of the plaintiffs contend that banks would stop and stare inappropriately at them,and lee claims that banks approached her work area unnecessarily to ask,how are you,miss lee everything all right with you today,miss lee 
plaintiffs claim that,as a result of the letters dissemination,they were subjected to a barrage of inappropriate stares,whispers,laughter,and remarks from their colleagues.thus,deans alleges that after the letters circulated throughout the facility,male officers made countless lewd and demeaning comments to her.deans described constant stuff being said that had no business in the workplace,including sexually charged references to her physical appearance.the atmosphere grew worse,deans said,when she returned from a scheduled vacation.remarks were then made such as did you enjoy your vacation we hear you a mean dick on your days off,when is your next day off,could we hook up and i take you to victoria secret and you can get whatever you want as long as you wear it for me.
dawson,too,testified that male officers taunted her with comments such as is it true you about that,you do things like the sexual acts described in the letters ew,that nasty,you nasty.she recalled that at morning briefings after the letters circulated,officers,mostly male,gathered in groups and laughed about their contents,and that the letters were a prevalent topic of conversation for civilian workers at the facility as well.
the plaintiffs also report that the dissemination of the letters led to a diminution of their authority over the facility inmates.deans asserted that while she had never experienced problems with inmates in the past,after the letters i t became difficult to tell them the littlest thing,clean your room,and they would give me attitude.
the plaintiffs sought and received medical treatment for various mental health problems allegedly resulting from stress caused by the letters and their impact on the plaintiffs workplace environment.some took job injury leave others continued to work while receiving treatment.
the record reveals that the defendants did take steps to investigate both the letters source and plaintiffs complaints about banks subsequent behavior.on october,shortly after the letters were found in the facility,sergeant bizzarro filed a special report indicating that he had interviewed a commissary staff member who had found one of the letters in the commissary bin on october,plaintiffs and other female employees submitted a written complaint to warden decuiceis regarding the letters,banks distribution of them,and the hostile work environment plaintiffs perceived.the female officers requested banks immediate suspension and called for formal charges of sexual harassment to be filed against him.on october,decuiceis asked commissioner rocco pozzi to authorize a special investigation based on the october complaint.pozzi approved the request,instructed that the investigation be expedited,and referred the matter to his special assistant,anthony czarnecki,for assignment to the siu on october.subsequently,various female cos,including plaintiffs,made statements to the siu in connection with the letters and their dissemination.
on november,the siu submitted a report to czarnecki,concluding that it appears that banks did not investigate anything related to these letters.if anything,he just continued to show them to other people creating an atmosphere of distrust and frustration to the women described in the letters.czarnecki reviewed the siu report and submitted a recommendation to commissioner pozzi on november.czarnecki found that it appears that banks failed to report the slanderous letter to a authority,failed to conduct any credible investigations about its authorship or circulation,engaged in inappropriate conversations with supervisors and officers about the of the defamatory letter,and essentially abandoned his duties as a supervisor.noting that several female officers had claimed job injuries and alleged a hostile and offensive work environment,he recommended that banks face formal disciplinary action for misconduct,negligence,and sexual harassment,and that banks be transferred out of the jail division immediately.
after obtaining two additional statements from interviewees,the siu issued a second report on february.the report noted that officer joseph young had stated that he saw stacks of copies of the obscene letters on a desk in the tac room,but that he had not observed banks distributing the copies on march,czarnecki prepared a new summary for pozzi.in it,czarnecki concluded that there was at least one other sergeant in addition to banks who failed to take appropriate action,and that several other cos had engaged in misconduct.while czarnecki recommendations had changed somewhat from those of his initial report,his recommendation that banks be formally counseled and transferred stood.subsequently,pozzi apparently ordered that banks be formally counseled for failing to bring the letters to the attention of a officer in the chain of command,and for attempting to conduct an investigation that should have been handled by siu.according to defendants,after being formally counseled by decuiceis,banks was transferred to the penitentiary division in june.
in addition to their hostile work environment claims,several of the plaintiffs also allege that they suffered from various adverse employment actions in retaliation for their complaints of harassment.cherry asserts that the formal counseling she received after her encounter with banks in the mess hall was retaliatory.dawson,deans,and johnson claim that they were subjected to excessive phone calls and home visits while on job injury leave.dawson,deans,and macdonald complain that they were directed to appear at hearings to determine their continued eligibility for wages and medical benefits while on leave.deans contends that charges of insubordination and disobeying a direct order for refusing to work overtime in november were retaliatory.johnson claims that her transfer to the women facility after she returned to work from her injury leave was retaliatory 
finally,the plaintiffs argue that the allegations stated above also support claims of retaliation for speech on a matter of public concern,in violation of the first amendment,and discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,see.
ii.the district court decision 
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs federal claims.acknowledging that plaintiffs subjectively felt there was a hostile work environment,and accepting arguendo that banks had participated,at least to some degree,in the dissemination of the letters,the court found that the alleged comments by plaintiffs from one particularly crude utterance directed at deans amounted to no more than innocuous badinage of the type to be expected between coworkers of different sexes.dawson county of westchester,d.this conduct,the court ruled,was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an unlawfully hostile work environment.
the court also stated 
plaintiffs chose a career as correctional officers in male correctional institutions where they would be in close contact with prisoners,men not distinguished for commendable deportment or courtly display of social graces.it is clearly not a suitable occupation for women of unusually delicate sensitivity.those who choose it must expect to be exposed at least occasionally to an embarrassing remark or situation it is difficult to believe that these incidents really rendered the workplace atmosphere so emotionally devastating to female cos that several of them were disabled from work for lengthy periods id.at.
the court also noted that several of the plaintiffs took lengthy work injury leaves,during which their base pay apparently continued,which obviously removed a strong incentive to return to the job.id.at.under such circumstances,the court could not conclude that the work environment was so abusive or hostile that plaintiffs are entitled to still further compensation by way of monetary damages.id.
additionally,after finding that none of the plaintiffs had shown sufficient evidence that any of the alleged retaliatory steps constituted an adverse employment action,the district court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs retaliation claims.finally,the court rejected plaintiffs first amendment and equal protection claims,and declined to exercise jurisdiction over their state law claims.it therefore dismissed both the federal and state claims,the latter without prejudice.

standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.giano senkowski,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no disputed issues of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d see also.c.in reviewing grants of summary judgment,we may not weigh the evidence,but are instead required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment,to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party,and to eschew credibility assessments.weyant okst,cir citing liberty lobby,at.as such,the this case,the plaintiffs will have their allegations taken as true,and will receive the benefit of the doubt when their assertions conflict with those of the movant.samuels mockry,cir internal quotation marks omitted.still,t he mere of existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiffs.liberty lobby,at.
retaliation claims 
plaintiffs assert that defendants retaliated against them,in violation of title vii,section,and the first and fourteenth amendments,for complaining of the harassment they allege.we agree,for substantially the reasons stated by the court below,that summary judgment for defendants on these retaliation claims was appropriate,and affirm its ruling with respect to them.
hostile work environment claims 
when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated.harris forklift,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.courts look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a plaintiff has established a hostile work environment claim,considering factors including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.at.while each of these elements is relevant to the inquiry,no single factor is required.id.because the crucial inquiry focuses on the nature of the workplace environment as a whole,a plaintiff who herself experiences discriminatory harassment need not be the target of other instances of hostility in order for those incidents to support her claim,cruz coach stores,cir.
