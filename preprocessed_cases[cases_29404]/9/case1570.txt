opinion of the court 
brenda erdman challenges the district court summary judgment in favor of her former employer,nationwide insurance company.the principal issue on erdman accumulated sufficient hours to qualify for leave under the family and medical leave act fmla raises questions of first impression in this court.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no genuine issues of material fact such that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see mcternan city of york,cir.
nationwide hired erdman in and she held various positions until,when she asked to work so she could care for her daughter amber,who was born with down syndrome.nationwide granted this request,as well as erdman request four years later to switch to a work week,which rendered erdman a employee under federal law.according to patty sarno,erdman supervisor at the time,erdman was a reliable employee who regularly worked extra hours outside the office.indeed,sarno consistently authorized payment for these hours or allowed erdman to use them as comp time.
in early,soon after erdman switched to a work week,sarno informed her that she should put in the hours that you supposed to put in and nothing more than that.in september,erdman stella getgen,who had replaced sarno as erdman supervisor some five months earlier,to request clarification whether she was still allowed to work extra hours for use as comp time.there is no record of any response by getgen,who,despite this,claims that she first heard the phrase comp time in a january meeting with erdman regarding a discrepancy in erdman accrued vacation time.after erdman explained that she had used comp time,getgen conceded that erdman vacation time calculation was correct,and made no objection to her use of comp time.
a week later,on january,getgen erdman to admonish her for three reasons erdman overtime was unapproved erdman failed to consult getgen before visiting a policyholder residence and employees in erdman position were not authorized to conduct fieldwork.getgen concluded as much as we are tempted to do a simple field investigation,there are legal and logistical reasons that prohibit us from doing so.two weeks later,on february,getgen for the first time advised erdman that she could no longer use extra hours for comp time.
soon after getgen admonished her,nationwide informed erdman that her position would be eliminated,but she could work instead.erdman accepted the position,but nationwide claims that erdman became angry and erratic because she was unhappy with her return to status.over the next several weeks,nationwide contends that erdman inappropriately questioned other employees about confidential salary information,encouraged others to work slowly to avoid driving up production standards,made malicious accusations against getgen,and committed various other acts of insubordination.erdman disputes these claims.
at the time erdman accepted the position,she sought clarification that nationwide would honor her request for vacation during the entire month of august,which erdman had typically taken to prepare amber for school.nationwide informed erdman that it was unlikely she would be allowed to take vacation in august because of the pressing need for employees in light of the unusually large number of employees requesting vacation that month.erdman announced that if she could not use vacation time in august,she would request fmla leave instead.
on april,erdman began working and a week later she submitted paperwork requesting fmla leave from july to august.a human resources employee responded to this request by telling erdman that as far as the fmla,i probably do see any problems with this.
nationwide fired erdman on may,citing her purported behavioral problems which culminated on may when erdman used profanity during a phone conversation that was monitored for quality control purposes.company policy states that personal calls are not monitored,and erdman prefaced a personal call with a profane disclaimer this is a personal call and should not be reviewed for quality purposes,assholes.
alleging that nationwide stated motives were pretextual and that she was actually fired for requesting fmla leave,erdman brought federal claims under the fmla and the americans with disabilities act ada initially,the district court granted summary judgment on the fmla claim,finding that erdman could not establish a cause of for interference or she had not accumulated the hours necessary to qualify as an eligible employee under the statute.the district court also granted summary judgment on the ada claim,but only to the extent that it was based on a failure to accommodate theory.nationwide was denied summary judgment on erdman ada association claim.
nationwide filed a motion for reconsideration.after briefing and oral argument,the district court reversed itself and granted nationwide summary judgment on the ada claim in its entirety,concluding that the ada association provision prohibits only employment decisions based on unfounded stereotypes and assumptions against employees who associate with disabled people.erdman nationwide ins,dist.lexis at,quoting den hartog wasatch.finding that nationwide actions were motivated by erdman prior modifications to her work schedule instead of stereotypes or unfounded assumptions,the district court held erdman could not establish an ada association claim.
erdman filed this timely appeal,arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the fmla and ada claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
an employee is eligible for fmla leave if she has worked at least hours of service with her employer during the previous month period.a.according to erdman records,she worked hours in the relevant period,including hours from home.in its calculation,the district court excluded hours worked from home prior to erdman september to getgen asking whether she was allowed to work extra hours for use as comp time,and hours worked from home after getgen january to erdman admonishing her for doing fieldwork.the district court found that nationwide could not have had constructive notice of any hours erdman worked from home prior to the september because erdman had previously been told to put in the hours that you supposed to put in and nothing more than that.the district court also found that constructive notice was dispelled by the january.consequently,the district court counted only of the hours erdman worked from home in calculating the total number of hours she worked in the previous year,which left erdman hours short of fmla threshold requirement.
the first question is whether a reasonable jury could have concluded that nationwide had actual or constructive notice that erdman worked at least hours,making her eligible under the fmla.for fmla purposes,all work that the employer knows or has reason to believe is being performed counts toward the threshold requirement.the parties agree that hours worked or beyond an employee regular schedule count if the employer knows or has reason to believe that an employee is continuing to work extra hours.a n employer need not have actual knowledge of such work constructive knowledge will suffice.holzapfel town of newburgh,cir.
nationwide does not dispute that erdman regularly worked outside of the office for many years,and that sarno consistently authorized payment for these hours or allowed erdman to use them as comp time.nevertheless,nationwide cites three reasons why it had no actual or constructive knowledge that erdman continued to do so during the relevant time period.first,sarno testified that when erdman position changed from exempt to status in,she told erdman to put in the hours that you supposed to put in and nothing more than that.second,sarno was the only one with personal knowledge that erdman worked outside the office,and sarno was replaced by getgen in.finally,getgen told erdman in january that she was not authorized to work outside her standard work hours.
despite the superficial appeal of nationwide arguments,they fail to persuade because they do not account for erdman use of comp time.to be sure,nationwide was on record that erdman could not be paid for any additional hours.but this begs the question whether she could she had done for so many years in the work outside the office to accrue comp time.after erdman became a nonexempt employee in,sarno expressed concern about the number of hours that erdman put in.this could reasonably be interpreted to mean that erdman was prohibited from putting in any hours for nationwide outside of the office.or,it could reasonably be interpreted to mean that erdman would no longer be paid for more hours than she was scheduled to work on a weekly basis.allowing erdman to put in extra hours for later use in lieu of vacation would be entirely consistent with a desire to eliminate overtime pay,or to ensure salary uniformity.comp time did not allow erdman to earn overtime pay or increase her net salary it merely allowed her to accumulate hours while working at home.absent any clear indication to the contrary from nationwide,a reasonable jury could conclude that the purpose of sarno communication was to prohibit erdman from being paid for more hours than she was scheduled to work each week,without regard to whether erdman could continue to accrue comp time.
getgen january to erdman illustrates this point.read in its entirety,the message has nothing to do with erdman working from home or accumulating comp time.getgen enumerated three specific concerns unapproved overtime pay unapproved visits to private residences and employees in erdman position conducting fieldwork.this email does not preclude a reasonable jury from finding that nationwide had actual or constructive knowledge of erdman working from home to accrue comp time.there is no mention of comp time anywhere in the,and the message may be interpreted as entirely consistent with the company continued acquiescence to erdman accrual of comp time.
erdman september to getgen casts further doubt on nationwide claim that the company prohibited erdman from accruing and using comp time.therein,erdman specifically asked about comp time in light of ambiguous communications regarding her hours.nationwide never responded to this pointed inquiry,which raises an inference adverse to nationwide position.a similar negative inference may be drawn from the january meeting between erdman and getgen,in which erdman claims that getgen tacitly acquiesced to her continued accrual and use of comp time.erdman version of what transpired at this meeting could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that nationwide had actual or constructive knowledge of erdman continued use of comp time.
nationwide correctly notes that erdman subjective beliefs about company policy are irrelevant.the issue is not what erdman thought,but what nationwide communicated to her,and whether the company acquiesced in the work.the record is equivocal on this point,however.a reasonable jury could find that nationwide intended to categorically prohibit all work outside of the office,in which case nationwide could not be charged with constructive knowledge that erdman continued to work outside the office.see davis food lion,cir holding that employer did not have constructive knowledge of secret hours worked after repeated instructions not to do so.nevertheless,a reasonable jury could also find that nationwide intended to preclude erdman from earning overtime,while allowing her to continue to accrue comp time.
nor does the fact that getgen replaced sarno as erdman supervisor carry the day for nationwide.first,the january meeting could show that getgen had personal knowledge of erdman comp time practices after that point.second,as previously discussed,getgen stated concerns about erdman hours are susceptible to an interpretation that is entirely consistent with the approval of comp time.finally,even though getgen may have lacked personal knowledge of erdman previous use of comp time under sarno,that has no bearing on the knowledge imputed to nationwide.it is undisputed that sarno allowed erdman to accrue and use comp time for many years.it is equally clear that in early,nationwide prohibited erdman from working overtime for pay.what remains unclear,when we consider the record in the light most favorable to erdman,is whether nationwide required her to cease and desist her longstanding practice of accruing and using comp time.
finally,we must address a policy concern raised by nationwide.erdman argues that her productivity,coupled with the company aggressive performance goals,evidence nationwide constructive knowledge of her extra hours.nationwide objects that drawing such an inference would effectively impute constructive knowledge of undocumented hours whenever an employer established aggressive productivity standards or encountered a particularly good employee.
it is conceivable that stellar productivity may be probative of an employer constructive knowledge of extra work hours in rare cases,but in this case the argument is foreclosed by erdman reliance on comp time.because every hour of comp time is effectively exchanged for an hour of paid vacation at some point in the future,erdman could work no more than her scheduled hours in the long run.therefore,erdman productivity can not reflect constructive notice of extra hours on nationwide part.
in sum,when read in the light most favorable to erdman,the record indicates that a reasonable jury could conclude that nationwide had constructive notice of hours that erdman worked from home until february,when erdman concedes that getgen finally addressed the issue and prohibited her from accruing and using comp time.counting all of the hours that erdman worked at home prior to that date,the record indicates that erdman accumulated total hours in the year before her requested leave was scheduled to begin.therefore,erdman was eligible for fmla leave for purposes of summary judgment.
having determined that erdman is an eligible employee for purposes of summary judgment,we shall address two alternative arguments because they will affect the district court instructions to the jury.
can erdman claim remedial eligibility 
erdman argues that d renders her eligible for fmla leave regardless of how many hours she worked because nationwide failed to notify her of her eligibility.the version of d in effect at the time of erdman dismissal stated i f the employer fails to advise the employee whether the employee is eligible prior to the date the requested leave is to commence,the employee will be deemed eligible.
in spite of the plain language of d,the district court rejected erdman argument,citing decisions from courts of appeals that have invalidated the regulation as expanding fmla eligibility beyond the statutory language.see,brungart bell south,cir dormeyer commerica bank,cir.erdman cites no authority to support a contrary conclusion,but she urges us to disagree with our sister circuits and uphold the regulation.
we find persuasive the seventh circuit analysis of this question in dormeyer 
although the department of labor has,like other administrative agencies,the authority to issue regulations to carry out the duties that congress has assigned to it in the fmla,it has no authority to change the act.but that is what the regulation tries to do.it does not address an interpretive issue that the statute leaves open,and so the principle of the chevron case is not in play.the statutory text is perfectly clear and covers the issue.the right of family leave is conferred only on employees who have worked at least hours in the previous months.yet under the regulation a worker who had worked hours before seeking family leave would be entitled to family leave if the employer neglected to inform the employee promptly that he or she was ineligible.and this regardless of whether the employee had incurred any detriment as a result of the employer silence.
at internal citations omitted.
for the reasons stated in dormeyer,we hold that the version of in effect at the time of erdman dismissal was invalid.by requiring one to work at least hours in the previous twelve months,congress has define
