opinion of the court 
appellants barbara walters and judith kromenhoek filed these civil rights actions under the fair housing act.walters and kromenhoek sought accommodations for their disabilities in the form of emotional support animals,which were not permitted under the rules of their condominium association.they allege violations of their right to a reasonable accommodation of their disabilities,f b,and interference with the exercise of their fair housing rights.they also allege supplemental territorial claims.
among other issues,these cases raise the question whether a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party.we hold that the district court improperly answered this question by applying a limited statute,a,and,in turn,territorial law.we conclude that the survival of claims under the fair housing act is not governed by section a,but rather by federal common law,under which a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party.accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment against walters executrix.
on the merits of the summary judgment motions,we will reverse in part and vacate in part.we will remand to the district court with instructions to consider whether to permit substitution for two deceased appellees.
appellants walters and kromenhoek suffered from disabilities,for which each was prescribed an emotional support animal.each woman obtained a dog.this violated the no dogs rule of their condominium association,cowpet bay west.cowpet no dogs rule provided that dogs and farm animals are prohibited,and owners will be fined as specified by the board of directors.app.the rule had no exceptions and cowpet had no policy regarding assistive animals,such as emotional support animals the no dogs rule was enforced by the cowpet board of directors,which has the authority to enforce the cowpet rules and regulations with monetary fines and other sanctions app.
walters and kromenhoek each attempted to request an accommodation for an emotional support animal by filing paperwork with cowpet office manager,louanne schechter.the paperwork included a doctor letter prescribing an emotional support animal,and a dog certification.each certification stated that the dog was prescribed and deemed necessary to assist the confirmed disabled handler and that property managers and landlords are required to make reasonable accommodation under the fair housing act.app.walters submitted her paperwork in february and kromenhoek in july.cowpet took no action at the time.
the presence of dogs at cowpet drew the ire of some residents.one resident,appellee lance talkington,fanned the flames by writing about dogs at cowpet on his blog about the community.in october,talkington wrote on his blog that barbara walters has a dog and claims to have papers that allow her to have it.app.he also wrote that he had asked the office manager whether the office has barbara walters paperwork in their files and whether monetary fines have been assessed if not,but had not received an answer.id.
in response to this blog post,appellee alfred felice posted the first of many inflammatory comments on talkington blog felice wrote that dog owners might be happier in another community rather than ostracized at cowpet,which would be another fine recourse,besides a significant 
walters,having been named by talkington,responded on the blog.she wrote that s ince you so tactfully used my name in this blog,i am required to defend myself,not as a violator of any laws,but a person with a disability app.walters also wrote that she was mortified,that my personal business has been laid out over the internet without my permission or forewarning.app.felice replied that someone who needed an emotional support dog might go off gourd without the pet at side in a violent reaction.we do even know we need protection bad law app.talkington also commented that walters has a pet and should be fined.app.
there followed a flurry of emails among the cowpet board,walters and kromenhoek.on october,walters emailed the members of the board that m y paperwork is on file in the office,but my medical information is no ones sic business and since this board has a history of violating confidentiality,how the hell can i trust any one of you to keep their mouth shut.am i going to find my information on lance talkington blog again app.
on october,the board president,appellee max harcourt,notified walters and kromenhoek by email that they were in violation of the no dogs rule.harcourt wrote that the office manager tells me that both you have papers in the office regarding service dogs however you have not applied for an exception to the rule.app.harcourt gave walters and kromenhoek ten days to submit a request to the board or be fined.harcourt copied his email to talkington,who posted it on his blog.
the same day,walters emailed the board that i am in possession of a service dog,and under the disabilities act set forth in the fair housing amendment i qualify to keep a service animal even when policy explicitly prohibits pets.if any medical information is disclosed to anderson,talkington or any one sic else,that will be taken as violation of privacy,and will be dealt with accordingly.app.
kromenhoek also emailed harcourt,although the copy of the email in the record is undated.like walters,kromenhoek wrote that she had filed the necessary paperwork in the office and according to the disabilities act set forth in the fair housing amendment i qualify to keep a service animal even when policy explicitly prohibits pets.app.she further wrote that she trusted the office manager with her medical information,but not the board as you have proved time and again that you can not be trusted.this is not a request for you to consider but this is informing you that i have a service dog and i am not in any violation.id.kromenhoek wrote that she would disclose my history and paperwork to harcourt provided you sign a confidentiality agreement with a monetary penalty for disclosure app.kromenhoek avers that she personally spoke to harcourt and invited him to review her paperwork and to sign a confidentiality agreement,which he refused to sign.app.
significantly,the parties dispute how the board responded.according to walters and kromenhoek,harcourt did review their paperwork in the cowpet office.they point to the affidavit of the office manager,schechter,who avers that harcourt came to the office and reviewed the documents app.schechter further avers that harcourt also sent his representative bill canefield,another board member to review the documents.app.
appellees deny that the board reviewed the paperwork on file in the cowpet office.they rely on the affidavit of board treasurer,sharon koehler,who avers that the board neither reviewed nor discussed the content of walters and kromenhoek medical verification and accommodation request,until march,when plaintiff submitted same to then president,ed wardwell.app.there is no testimony from harcourt,who died while the case was pending in the district court.
the board did not grant an accommodation to walters or kromenhoek in the fall of.to the contrary,at a january board meeting,appellee vincent verdiramo moved to impose fines on dog owners.the board voted to fine walters and kromenhoek for violating the no dogs rule.the fine was fifty dollars per day.these fines were held in abeyance,pending legal advice 
on talkington blog,felice and talkington continued to denigrate dog owners at cowpet.for example,in november,felice wrote if you ca remove the guilty,you can certainly ostracize them.app.in december,talkington wrote a blog post naming and labeling walters and kromenhoek as known violators and their emotional support animals as illegal neighborhood puppy dogs.app.talkington also reported that a neighbor heard one dog barking and added,sarcastically,that trained service dogs are specifically trained to not bark unless the owner is in imminent danger.maybe one of the pups pooped in the owner unit and was warning the owner to watch out app.
talkington subsequently wrote a blog post stating that walters and kromenhoek have certified emotional support dogs,but that such certifications are issued without verify ing either the animal credentials or the purported disability.app.talkington later posted that t hese r i diculous puppy dog diplomas from the paper mills are out of line.app.talkington wrote that the diploma mill would accept stress as a disability that qualifies for their certification without any doctor confirmation.app.felice echoed this sentiment in belligerent terms.he wrote pay a few on the internet and presto a service dog is born i could certify my ceramic toy with that process.app.
later that winter,talkington wrote on his blog that cowpet should go on the offensive and lawyer up to pursue an action against owners who are noncompliant with the policy on service dogs.this is the type of action where each party will bear their own legal costs regardless of the outcome,so each party will have to decide how badly they want to pursue it.app.felice then posted a comment,describing walters and kromenhoek as miscreants.app.felice wrote that failure to comply with the no dogs rule must lead to liens and even foreclosure,if needed,for compliance to be effective.these ungracious owners are totally selfish,spoiled,brats,willing to flaunt their illegality in every one s face such gall and nerve require full responce sic,with ostracizing the offenders in every manner at our disposal isolate them completely to their little dog patch on the beach and ignore them at every venue or occasion id.talkington followed up by writing that walters and kromenhoek are playground bullie s attempting to hang onto their puppies.app.he wrote that it is time for the association to go on the offensive and file suit in a court of law to force the issue.when these ladies have to start spending their own cash the rubber will meet the road on how far everyone is willing to go on this issue.app.
the ferment finally came to a close after harcourt completed his term as president of the cowpet board and was succeeded by a new president,ed wardwell.in march,walters and kromenhoek submitted to wardwell formal requests for accommodation.in april,the board granted the requests and waived the accrued fines.
walters and kromenhoek,nevertheless,filed these civil rights cases under the fair housing act.they raised two federal claims that cowpet denied their reasonable requests for accommodation in violation of f b and that cowpet and three individual appellees talkington,felice and harcourt interfered with the exercise of their fair housing rights in violation of.walters and kromenhoek also asserted supplemental territorial law claims against all appellees 
tragically,walters committed suicide while her case was pending in the district court appellees moved for summary judgment.the district court dismissed walters fair housing act claims entirely due to her death.as to kromenhoek,the district court denied her fair housing act claims on the merits.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the territorial claims in both cases because no federal claims remained.see c.
walters and kromenhoek now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims at summary judgment.in addition,walters and kromenhoek have filed motions to substitute representatives for appellees felice and harcourt,who died while these cases were pending in the district court 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and a.we have jurisdiction under.
the existence and scope of our jurisdiction are disputed issues because,some appellees contend,walters and kromenhoek filed their notices of appeal prematurely.however,to the extent that the initial judgment walters and kromenhoek appealed was,it was later replaced with revised judgments on both dockets that ended the litigation on the merits for all parties.see morton int l,staley,cir.explaining that a decision is final under when all claims against all parties have been resolved.within thirty days of the entry of the revised judgments,and at the request of the clerk of our court,walters and kromenhoek filed jurisdictional statements identifying these final judgments as the decisions to be challenged on appeal.
the simplest route to finding jurisdiction and defining its scope is thus through smith barry,under which we may consider a document to be the equivalent of a notice of appeal so long as it meets the requirements of federal rule of appellate procedure c and is filed within the time limits of federal rule of appellate procedure a.see id.at in re fmc.packaging,cir.treating petition for mandamus that satisfied rule as notice of appeal provided that it was filed,as it was,within the limit set by fed.app.a see also benn first judicial dist.of,cir.emphasizing liberal construction of rule intel terabyte int l,cir.treating opening brief as amended notice of appeal that extended appellate jurisdiction over attorney fees order.the jurisdictional responses were both timely under rule and appropriately fashioned under rule.we thus have jurisdiction over the appeal extending to all of the appellees 
we exercise plenary review over the question whether a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party,as this is an issue of law.we also exercise plenary review over a grant of a motion for summary judgment.goldenstein repossessors,cir.we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.at.we will affirm if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.
the fair housing act was enacted in to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of our nation economy.texas dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive communities project.the stated policy is to provide,within constitutional limitations,for fair housing throughout the united states.in,congress extended the fair housing act to protect against discrimination on the basis of disability.city of edmonds oxford house,fair housing amendments act of,pub,stat.this was a clear pronouncement of a national commitment to end the unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps from the american mainstream.hovsons,twp.of brick,cir.emphasis and citations omitted.the supreme court has held that when construing the fair housing act,we are to give a generous construction to the statute broad and inclusive language.lakeside resort,lp bd.of supervisors of palmyra,cir.quoting trafficante metro.life ins.
these cases require us to address an issue of first impression whether claims under the fair housing act survive the death of a party the fair housing act is silent as to survival.in the face of this interstice,the district court answered the survival question by applying a limited statute,a,which in turn led the district court to apply territorial law.the district court applied a virgin islands statute,code ann.tit,under which it held that walters fair housing act claims did not survive her death 
we disagree with the district court decision to apply section a and,in turn,territorial law.for the reasons below,we conclude that section a does not apply to the issue of whether a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party.rather,we apply a uniform rule of federal common law.we will reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing walters case due to her death.
section a of title provides 
the jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters conferred on the district courts by the provisions of titles,and of the revised statutes for the protection of all persons in the united states in their civil rights,and for their vindication,shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the united states,so far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object,or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law,the common law,as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the state wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is held,so far as the same is not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states,shall be extended to and govern the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause,and,if it is of a criminal nature,in the infliction of punishment on the party found guilty.
a emphasis added 
section a provides that where certain federal laws are deficient the federal courts may apply common law,as modified and changed by the constitutions and statutes of the state,provided that the state law is not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.a.for the reasons below,section a does not apply to the fair housing act.
our holding is based on the text of section a.on its face,the statute applies to certain statutes those found within three titles of the revised statutes,titles,and.a.if the fair housing act had been contained within one of these three titles,it would fall within section a.of course,the fair housing act was enacted almost a century after the revised statutes.it was never codified in its titles,or.trafficante,at citing civil rights act of,pub,stat.therefore,section a by its plain meaning does not apply to the fair housing act.carlson green,observing that section does not in terms apply to bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,actions.
cowpet concedes this point,but urges us to ignore the plain text of the statute.for the reasons below,we will not do so.
our conclusion that section a does not apply to the fair housing act is consistent with the legislative history,which shows that section a has always applied to designated statutes only.section a has never applied globally to any statute that could be labelled a civil rights law.
section a was enacted as section of the civil rights act of april.moor cty.of alameda,citing civil rights act of april,ch,stat.current version at a.it was intended to do nothing more than to explain the source of law to be applied in actions brought to enforce the substantive provisions of the same act,including section.moor,at.those substantive provisions later became and.cbocs west,humphries,citation omitted.
in and,congress directed that would guide courts in the enforcement of particular statutes,which later became and.moor,at citing act of may,ch,stat,current version at and act of april,ch,stat,current version at.
finally,in the revised statutes of,congress made section more generally applicable to three specified titles of the revised statutes.moor,at.those three titles are this title the judiciary,and of title civil rights,and of title crimes.of these three,title civil rights contains the civil rights statutes,including what are now,and.original version at original version at original version at.
here the amendments end.congress has never again amended the phrase this title the judiciary,and of title civil rights,and of title crimes.as a result,section a continues to apply only those laws codified within these three titles,titles,and,of the revised statutes of 
congress inaction with regard to section a stands in contrast to its frequent amendment of section b,which relates to attorney fees.congress enacted section b in and then amended it repeatedly to provide for attorney fees in cases under sections,and of this title,title ix,the religious freedom restoration act of,the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of,title vi of the civil rights act of,or section of this title b.see,religious land use and institutionalized persons act of,pub,d,stat.violent crime control and law enforcement act of,pub,title iv,stat.religious freedom restoration act of,pub,a,stat.civil rights attorneys fees awards act of,pub,stat.in short,congress has repeatedly amended section b,but not section a.this supports our holding that congress intentionally applied section a only to titles,and of the revised statutes.lewis united states,considering repeated amendments as evidence of congressional intent.
our decision is consistent with prior decisions interpreting section a.the supreme court has applied section to determine survival of a claim under section,a law.robertson wegman,citing moor,at.it does not follow that section also applies to the fair housing act.the supreme court has,in general,rejected linkage between the civil rights acts,and,and other federal statutes,emphasizing the independence of the remedial scheme established by the acts.burnett grattan,citations omitted.for example,there are vast differences between section and the fair housing act.jones alfred mayer.see also fleming postal,cir.holding section inapplicable to claims under title vii of the civil rights act of or the rehabilitation act of smith galesburg crown fin,cir.holding section inapplicable to a claim under the truth in lending act,overruled on other grounds by pridegon gates credit union,cir.but see slade postal,cir.holding in a cursory decision that section applies to title vii claim.
for all of these reasons,we will follow the plain text of section a,under which section a does not apply to the fair housing act.we must turn elsewhere to determine whether a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party.
a fair housing act claim is a federal statute,and therefore whether a claim survives the death of a party is a question of federal law.carlson,at see also united states kimbell foods.as congress has not provided statutory guidance,we resolve the survival issue according to federal common law.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.jerry smith,moore federal practice.however,this does not resolve the matter.the more difficult question is not whether federal common law applies,but what its content should be.kimbell foods,at.specifically,we must determine whether to apply a uniform rule of federal common law or adopt state law.id.at.
developing a federal common law rule is the exception rather than the rule.in re columbia gas,cir.in general,a bsent a demonstrated need for a federal rule of decision,the court has taken the prudent course of adopt ing the readymade body of state law as the federal rule of decision until congress strikes a different accommodation.am.power,connecticut,quoting kimbell foods,at.
but while the term and concept of federal common law may strike some as anathema to federal court jurisprudence in the wake of erie railroad tompkins,in some areas of the law federal common law still exists to provide direction.wallach eaton,cir.citations omitted.one area where courts consistently apply a uniform rule of federal common law is survival of a federal claim.see federal practice and procedure,supra federal practice and procedure,supra moore federal practice,supra.indeed,numerous cases have applied a uniform federal rule to the issue of survival.see figueroa sec y of health human,fed.cir.survival of claim under the vaccine act harrow prudential ins.of,cir.survival of an erisa claim united states land,winston,cir.survival of forfeiture claim under sinito dep t of justice,cir.survival of claim under the freedom of information act united states nec,cir,as amended,survival of qui tam action under the false claims act smith dep t of human,cir.survival of claim under the age discrimination in employment act mallick int l of workers,cir.survival of a claim under the reporting and disclosure act of james home constr.of mobile,cir.survival of claim under truth in lending act.
we find these decisions persuasive.whether a fair housing act claim survives the death of a party is an issue where a uniform federal common law rule is appropriate to fulfill the overall purposes of the statute.wallach,at quoting gulfstream iii,gulfstream aerospace,cir.greenberg,concurring and speaking for the majority.the federal interest at stake in the fair housing act,to provide for fair housing throughout the united states,warrants displacement of state law on the confined issue of survival.empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh.thus,we will apply a uniform rule.
as to the content of a uniform federal rule,we are cognizant that we lack the creative power akin to that vested in congress.am.power,at see also wallach,at adopting as uniform common law rule set forth in the restatement of contracts.for this reason,we will follow the weight of authority,which applies the railroad tompkins common law rule of survival,under which remedial claims survive,but penal claims do not.see moore federal practice,supra ex parte schreiber,penal claims do not survive.we are persuaded by the numerous cases that have applied this rule.see,harrow,at erisa claim remedial land,winston,at forfeiture claim under remedial nec,at qui tam action under the false claims act remedial kilgo bowman,cir.holding that if federal law applies,title vii is remedial,but declining to decide whether federal law applies james,at truth in lending act remedial 
a fair housing act claim is remedial.as we have stated,t he fair housing act was intended by congress to have broad remedial intent.alexander riga,cir.quoting havens realty coleman,see also holly gardens citizens in action,twp.of mount holly,cir.the fha is a broadly remedial statute,cert.dismissed.thus,under the common law rule,fair housing act claims survive the death of a party.
we now reach the merits of the first of two fair housing act claims whether cowpet refused to provide a reasonable accommodation for walters and kromenhoek disabilities,in violation of the fair housing act,f b.we find that there are genuine issues of material fact.therefore,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment for cowpet.
the fair housing act makes it unlawful t o discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap.f.d iscrimination includes a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b.to determine whether an accommodation is reasonable,we consider whether the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing,zoning bd.of adjustment of the twp.of scotch plains,cir.citation omitted.
a reasonable accommodation under the fair housing act may include the use of an emotional support animal in one own home,despite the existence of a rule,policy or law prohibiting such an animal.see,castillo condo.ass dep t of hous.urban,cir.anderson city of blue ash,cir.bhogaita altamonte heights condo.ass n,cir.in emotional support animal cases,a housing provider may contest whether the accommodation is reasonable.cowpet does not.there is no dispute that walters and kromenhoek are disabled and that the use of an emotional support animal was reasonable and necessary for their enjoyment of their homes.
rather,what cowpet does dispute is the additional statutory requirement that there be a refusal to provide the reasonable accommodation.f b.to this requirement,we now turn.
whether there has been a refusal to provide a reasonable accommodation under the fair housing act depends on the circumstances.as several of our sister circuits have held,a refusal may be actual or constructive.groome res.par.of jefferson,cir.accord austin town of farmington,cir.bhogaita,at.an undue delay in granting a reasonable accommodation may amount to a refusal.bhogaita,at astralis condo.ass sec y,dep t hous.urban,cir.groome res,at.moreover,a refusal occurs when the disabled resident is first denied a reasonable accommodation,irrespective of the remedies granted in subsequent proceedings.groome res,at quoting bryant woods inn,howard,cir.
however,we note that the same action,a denial,may sometimes amount to a refusal and,at other times,mere enforcement of a housing rule.for a housing provider action to be considered a refusal under the fair housing act,the provider must have had a prior opportunity to accommodate.taylor harbour pointe homeowners ass n,cir.citing tsombanidis haven fire dep t,cir,superseded by regulation on other grounds,c,as recognized in mhany,cty.of nassau,cir.the defendants must have had an idea of what accommodation the plaintiff sought prior to their incurring liability for refusing it.id.citing tsombanidis,at.for example,a housing provider may have an opportunity to accommodate because a plaintiff petitions for an accommodation or declares that she is entitled to it.see,castillo,at,resident requested an accommodation by providing a doctor note and advising housing provider that he planned to keep his emotional support dog in his condominium unit and that he was entitled to do so under federal law.in other circumstances,the disability and need for accommodation may be known or obvious to the provider.brady stores,cir.considering such a situation in the context of the ada.these examples are 
cowpet contends that it did not refuse a reasonable accommodation because walters and kromenhoek were never deprived of their emotional support animals.this argument fails.cowpet did not have to deny walters and kromenhoek their emotional support animals in order to refuse a reasonable accommodation.as a matter of law,cowpet may have refused a reasonable accommodation by declaring walters and kromenhoek in violation of the no dogs rule,by fining them fifty dollars a day or through undue delay.astralis,at refusal occurred where condominium association cited residents for parking infractions.
whether cowpet actions constituted a refusal,however,depends upon whether cowpet was given an opportunity to accommodate.on this issue,the parties dispute material issues of fact.there are two disputes of fact that preclude summary judgment.
first,the parties dispute whether walters and kromenhoek barred cowpet from reviewing their paperwork.the basis for the dispute is a series of emails sent by walters and kromenhoek.although the content of the emails is undisputed,there is a disagreement over the inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the facts windsor,hartford life ins,cir.viewing the emails in the light most favorable to walters and kromenhoek,they are susceptible to two inferences.on one hand,walters kromenhoek may have barred cowpet from reviewing their paperwork.on the other hand,walters kromenhoek may have only asked cowpet to respect the privacy of their medical information.if the factfinder concludes that the latter inference prevails that cowpet was not barred from reviewing the paperwork then cowpet had an opportunity to accommodate,which it refused.
second,the parties dispute whether the cowpet board president,harcourt,actually reviewed their paperwork on file in the cowpet office.the office manager,schechter,avers that harcourt did so the board treasurer,koehler,avers that he did not.if harcourt reviewed the paperwork,then cowpet had an opportunity to accommodate,which it refused.for both of these reasons,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment for cowpet on walters and kromenhoek fair housing act reasonable accommodation claims.
walters and kromenhoek also allege interference with the exercise of their fair housing rights,in violation of.the district court granted summary judgment for appellees.we will reverse in part and vacate in part.
under the fair housing act,i t shall be unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed any right granted or protected by section,or of this title.
a section claim does not require a substantive violation of sections.hidden village,llc city of lakewood,cir.bloch fritschholz,cir.en banc united states city of hayward,cir.a claim may arise before or,as here,after a plaintiff acquires housing.bloch,at see also hidden village,at permitting section claim to proceed to trial.
walters and kromenhoek cases involve one type of section claim alleged interfere nce with fair housing rights.see also c setting forth examples of unlawful conduct,including interference with enjoyment of a dwelling.a section interference claim requires proof of three elements that the plaintiff exercised or enjoyed any right granted or protected by sections that the defendant conduct constituted interference and a causal connection existed between the exercise or enjoyment of the right and the defendant conduct.see also quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment and liability for discriminatory housing practices under the fair housing act,fed.reg.
the term interference is not defined by the fair housing act or the implementing regulation.therefore,the word must be understood by its ordinary meaning.united states piekarsky,cir.the ninth circuit has construed interference for the purposes of section according to a dictionary definition as,the act of meddling in or hampering an activity or process.walker city of lakewood,cir.quoting webster third new int l dict.ed.see also brown city of tucson,cir.observing that walker involved alleged retaliation.interference is broadly applied to reach all practices which have the effect of interfering with the exercise of rights under the federal fair housing laws.walker,at citation omitted.interference does not require force or threat of force.id.at citing.yet the prohibition on interference can not be so broad as to prohibit any action whatsoever tha t in any way hinders a member of a protected class.brown,at quoting michigan prot.advocacy,babin,cir.
interference under section may consist of harassment,provided that it is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to create a hostile environment.quigley winter,cir.see also honce vigil,cir.same.numerous decisions of our sister circuits have recognized such a cause of action in the housing context.see neudecker boisclair,cir.bloch,at quigley,at krueger cuomo,cir.dicenso cisneros,cir.honce,at.harassment that intrudes upon the,tranquility,and privacy of the home is considered particularly invasive.frisby schultz,citation omitted 
walters and kromenhoek raised section claims against four appellees cowpet,felice,talkington and harcourt.we address each appellee in turn.
as to cowpet,we previously explained that there is a material dispute as to whether walters and kromenhoek barred it from reviewing their accommodation requests.we addressed this factual dispute in the context of section f b.we now address the same facts under an entirely different legal standard.we conclude that the factual dispute is material to the section interference claim.if walters and kromenhoek barred cowpet from reviewing their accommodation requests,then cowpet did not interfere with their rights.but if there was not such a ban,then cowpet did interfere with their rights by failing to review their requests for a reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.thus,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of cowpet on the section claim.
walters and kromenhoek allege that felice,their neighbor,violated section by posting derogatory,harassing and,at times,threatening comments on talkington blog.felice wrote that dog owners might be happier in another community rather than ostracized at cowpet,which would be another fine recourse,besides a significant 
felice posted at least nine harassing messages,over a period of more than five months,from october through march all of these writings were made public on the internet.felice continued his postings even after walters responded,on the blog,that she was mortified,that my personal business has been laid out over the internet without my permission or forewarning.app.
we conclude that there are genuine disputes of material fact over the inferences that can be reasonably drawn from felice blog posts.windsor,at.a reasonable jury could find that felice harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive as to interfere with walters and kromenhoek fair housing rights under.a reasonable jury could also infer that there was a causal connection that felice engaged in harassing conduct on account of walters and kromenhoek exercise of their fair housing rights.id.accordingly,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment for felice.
walters and kromenhoek allege that talkington,their neighbor,interfered with their fair housing rights by writing on his blog talkington named walters and kromenhoek and made public and derided their requests for accommodation of their disabilities.he posted that barbara walters has a dog and claims to have papers that allow her to have it.app.he wrote that walters has a pet and should be fined.app.talkington posted an email from harcourt to both walters and kromenhoek stating that they were in violation of the no dogs rule.talkington wrote that walters and kromenhoek were known violators and that their emotional support animals were illegal neighborhood puppy dogs.app.he wrote that walters and kromenhoek certifications for their emotional support animals were issued by disreputable websites without verify ing either the animal credentials or the purported disability.app.he suggested that walters and kromenhoek obtained their emotional support animal certifications from diploma mill s that would accept stress as a disability.app.talkington wrote that cowpet should go on the offensive and sue walters and kromenhoek.app.he explained that this would force them to spend their own cash,and the rubber will meet the road on how far everyone is willing to go on this issue.app.
overall,talkington posted numerous harassing blog posts and comments over more than five months.he posted these comments publicly on the internet.he continued to do so after walters expressed her mortifi cation that her need for an emotional support animal was made public.app.
we hold that there are genuine disputes of fact over the inferences that can be drawn from talkington blog posts.windsor,at.a reasonable jury could find that his conduct constituted harassment that was sufficiently severe or pervasive as to interfere with walters and kromenhoek fair housing rights.a reasonable jury could also find that there was a causal connection between talkington conduct and walters and kromenhoek exercise of their fair housing rights.as such,we will reverse the grant of summary judgment for talkington.
walters and kromenhoek also alleged a section claim against harcourt.the district court did not analyze this claim,but rather dismissed it on the ground that the claim was purportedly identical to the claim against cowpet.as we reverse the section claim against cowpet,we will vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of harcourt.on remand,the district court must determine whether or not to substitute a party for harcourt.see infra section vii.if the district court grants substitution,the court may be called upon to readdress the section claim in light of this opinion.

in our recitation of the facts,we consider as affidavits walters and kromenhoek sworn verified complaints,to the extent that they are based upon personal knowledge and set out facts that would be admissible in evidence.see fed.civ.c see also reese sparks,cir.treating verified complaint as affidavit for summary judgment purposes.
