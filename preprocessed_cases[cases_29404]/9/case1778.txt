opinion of the court 
carl smith,an inmate at the pennsylvania state correctional facility at frackville filed this civil rights action under alleging that certain corrections officers and prison employees denied him due process of law violated his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.the district court dismissed smith due process claims against some of the defendants under.b,but smith was allowed to proceed on his eighth amendment claims.the court subsequently granted summary judgment against smith and in favor of the defendants on all of smith claims.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse in part and affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the misconduct reports 
sometime during the morning of june,corrections officer robin mensinger issued a misconduct report citing smith with refusing to obey an order to return to his cell after cell cleanup,and for using foul language towards a corrections officer.later that afternoon,mensinger cited smith in a second misconduct report for allegedly punching her in the eye.that evening,sergeant paulukonis issued a third misconduct report against smith.that report cited smith for assaulting corrections officers as they were escorting him to the restricted housing unit rhu.
smith denies that he assaulted mensinger or struggled with other corrections officers later that evening.he admits that he did not return to his cell when mensinger requested him to,but claims that he only refused because his cell was still wet.according to smith,mensinger was drunk and out of control when she issued the first misconduct report.he claims that as he was leaving his cell during an organized prisoner movement later that day,he heard a whistle blow and looked up to see mensinger pointing at him.a few seconds later,corrections officers jones and yoder purportedly arrived on the cell block.smith claims that mensinger told the corrections officers that smith had punched her in the eye.smith maintains that yoder then handcuffed him behind his back,and walked him to a bench where smith was ordered to sit down.according to smith,other corrections officers including androshick,zubris and mccole entered the area a few minutes later.the officers then purportedly grabbed smith by both arms and followed corrections officer novitsky to the unit manager office.there,smith claims that yurkiewicz and jones joined the group and yoder left.
once inside the unit manager office,the officers allegedly rammed smith head into walls and cabinets and knocked him to the floor.he claims that while he was on the floor,yurkiewicz kicked and punched him,and novitsky pulled him to his feet,pushed him against the wall,punched him in the stomach,and choked him with both hands brief for appellant at.smith alleges that paulukonis saw the beating,but did nothing to intervene or restore order.
smith further alleges that after the beating in the unit manager office,two or three guards took him to the rhu where yurkiewicz placed him on a bench,tightened the handcuffs as much as possible,and hit him on the back of the head while verbally threatening him and showering him with racial epithets.
smith injuries 
smith alleges that his head was bleeding and the beating also resulted in pain in his ribs,ears,and right eye.his ribs were purportedly red and bruised and remained sore for a couple of weeks after the beating.smith was seen by the medical staff each of the following two days,but according to the medical records,he was treated only for chronic asthma.in his deposition,smith stated that a doctor gave him ice for his ribs and told him to keep a wet towel against them the day after the incident.however,a report prepared by the defendants medical expert states that an examination of smith soon after the incident failed to disclose any wounds,marks,or bruises near his rib cage or anywhere else.
c.the aftermath of the june,incident 
on june,pennsylvania state trooper leo luciani interviewed smith regarding smith alleged attack of mensinger.during that interview luciani purportedly showed smith a photograph of mensinger that smith claims supports his claim that he never hit her in the face.nevertheless,the commonwealth filed a criminal complaint against smith based upon mensinger allegation,and luciani testified for the prosecution at the preliminary hearing on those charges.the charges included assault,assault by a prisoner,and retaliation for past official action.the commonwealth subsequently added the charge of disorderly conduct,and smith eventually pled nolo contendere to that charge.the trial court then granted the commonwealth request to nol pros the remaining charges.
meanwhile,a hearing on the three misconduct reports was scheduled at,and smith completed a request for representation form listing two inmates he wanted to call as witnesses at that hearing.he claims that those two inmates would have testified that he did not strike mensinger as she had charged.when smith arrived at the hearing,hearing officer mary canino informed him that his witnesses were not available and that the hearing would be delayed until that afternoon however,the hearing did not proceed that afternoon,and smith was transferred to the state correctional institution at mahoney the next day.
smith misconduct hearing reconvened at a few days later.however,since smith witnesses remained at,canino offered to continue the hearing to afford smith an opportunity to submit written statements from his witnesses.smith refused the offer because he did not trust that prison officials would obtain accurate statements.rather than submit those statements,smith sought a continuance in order to attempt to recover the allegedly exculpatory photograph that trooper luciani had shown him.canino denied smith request for a continuance,and smith hearing on the misconduct reports proceeded without his witnesses.
canino credited the testimony against smith,and found smith guilty of the conduct charged in all three misconduct reports.he received seven months disciplinary confinement for assaulting mensinger and for resisting the officers who were escorting him to the rhu.canino also ordered that smith prison account be assessed for medical and other expenses to pay for contact lenses for officer mensinger even though no evidence of any such expenses had been produced at the hearing.app.at.accordingly,was deducted from smith inmate account.smith challenged that action by filing a grievance in which he complained that there was insufficient evidence to debit his account to buy mensinger lenses.he also unsuccessfully appealed to the program review committee,and to superintendent dragovich.
ii.procedural history 
on may,smith filed the instant pro se civil rights action under against corrections officers mensinger,novitsky,and paulukonis as well as hearing officer canino,and business manager burgard.the defendants were each sued individually and in their official capacity.smith later joined corrections officers yurkiewicz,androshick,mccole,zubris,and jones as well as superintendent dragovich.
smith claimed that several corrections officers used excessive force during the june incident,and that they thereafter falsified reports regarding that incident in order to cover up their use of excessive force.smith also claimed that canino violated his due process rights by improperly assessing his inmate account,and that burgard and dragovich did not adequately investigate his grievance on appeal.
although the district court granted smith request to amend his complaint to join dragovich as a defendant,the court later dismissed the claim against dragovich as well as smith claim against unknown defendant,john doe.mensinger,paulukonis,canino,and burgard thereafter moved to dismiss smith claims against them pursuant to.b.the district court granted that motion.in an unreported opinion,smith luciani,nos,wl.march,hereinafter smith i,the district court explained that since smith did not have a liberty interest in remaining in the general prison population,he could not establish a due process claim based upon being placed in disciplinary custody.the court also dismissed smith claim against mensinger based in part upon its belief that the claim constituted an improper collateral attack on smith disorderly conduct conviction.
the district court allowed smith to proceed against the remaining corrections officers on his eighth amendment claim,but later granted defendants motion for summary judgment,dismissing that claim,as well.in a second unreported opinion,smith mensinger,no,wl.march,hereinafter smith ii,the court concluded that smith could not prevail under the eighth amendment because the minimal nature of his injuries established that any force that may have been used against him must have been de minimis and therefore insufficient to constitute an eighth amendment violation.the court also concluded that whatever force the corrections officers had used was justified by smith assault of mensinger,and the fact that he struggled with the other corrections officers.the court did note that smith denied assaulting mensinger and struggling with corrections officers.however,the court refused to credit that denial because smith offered nothing to support it,and the hearing officer had found him guilty of the charged misconduct.this appeal followed 
iii.discussion 
smith argues the district court erred in dismissing both his due process claim,and his eighth amendment claim.in addressing smith challenge to the dismissal of his eighth amendment claim,we must first decide if he can prevail despite the de minimis nature of his injuries.if we decide that he can,we must then decide if a corrections officer paulukonis can be found liable under the eighth amendment merely because he failed to intervene in the beating allegedly administered by his fellow corrections officers 
standard of review 
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see brooks kyler,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
a motion to dismiss under.b,on the other hand,should not be granted unless it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle to relief.see conley gibson,d.in undertaking that analysis,we must construe complaints of pro se litigants liberally.see zilich lucht,cir.the issue of an officer duty to intervene presents a question of law,which we review de novo.see holland new jersey dep t of corrections,cir stating that questions of law are reviewed de novo.
we will first address smith eighth amendment claims and then examine his due process claim.
b.the eighth amendment claim based upon excessive force 
the district court correctly noted that prison guards who maliciously and sadistically use force against an inmate violate contemporary standards of decency even if the resulting injuries are not significant.smith ii,wl,at internal quotations omitted.however,after noting that smith could establish an eighth amendment violation even absent evidence of serious physical injuries,the district court then focused exclusively on the severity of smith injuries in denying his claim.the court stated 
even assuming that plaintiff could show that defendants acted with the requisite state of mind,the court concludes that the alleged wrongdoing by defendants was not objectively harmful enough to establish a constitutional violation.initially,the court notes that the injuries suffered by plaintiff were relatively minor.
additionally,accepting as true plaintiff version of the facts,including being handcuffed,punched,kicked,and thrown into cabinets and walls,and given the slight injuries suffered by plaintiff,the court finds that the incident between plaintiff and defendants involved a de minimis use of force that was not repugnant to the conscience of mankind.
id.at.thus,although the court acknowledged that the absence of severe injuries did not preclude smith eighth amendment claim as a matter of law,the court concluded that the evidentiary value of the absence of injuries was too compelling to ignore.see id.citing smith alleged attack on mensinger,the court also noted that the record shows that defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff to be a threat and the need for application of force was apparent.id.at.
we begin our analysis of that ruling with the supreme court decision in hudson mcmillian,d.there,an inmate sued prison guards under alleging that they had used excessive force in violation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment even though he had not suffered serious injuries during the alleged assault.the court therefore had to decide whether the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment when the inmate does not suffer serious injury.hudson,at.emphasis added.the court answer ed that question in the affirmative.id.
we applied the teachings of hudson in brooks kyler,cir.there,an inmate sued four prison guards under alleging that they had beaten him in violation of the eighth amendment.although the undisputed medical evidence showed that the plaintiff suffered only a few scratches on his neck and hands,he testified that he was repeatedly punched in the head,stomped about the back and neck,slammed into a cell wall,choked,threatened,and nearly rendered unconscious.all of this was allegedly done while he was handcuffed.see brooks,at.in reviewing the claim,we noted that it was apparent that the type of vicious,prolonged attack alleged by brooks would have resulted in far greater injuries than those which he indisputably sustained.id.at.nonetheless,we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment,stating a ccepting brooks allegations as true,as we must,a jury could find that the defendants acted not merely in to maintain or restore discipline,but rather out of malice for the very purpose of causing harm.id.at.
the district court dismissed smith claims before we decided brooks.accordingly,the court did not have the benefit of that analysis when,in denying smith claims here,it focused almost exclusively on the lack of a serious physical injury smith ii,wl,at,quoting eppers dragovich,wl,at.july.it is now clear that the district court erred in focusing so narrowly on the absence of serious injuries in deciding if smith could establish a claim based upon excessive force.as we clearly stated in brooks,the eighth amendment analysis must be driven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in which it is applied not by the resulting injuries.
requiring objective or independent proof of minor or significant injury,would ignore this teaching and place protection from injury,instead of protection from wanton force,at the hub of the eighth amendment.
brooks,at,citing moore holbrook,cir.
nevertheless,it is true that the eighth amendment does not protect an inmate against an objectively de minimis use of force.see hudson,at.rather,as noted above,the pivotal inquiry in reviewing an inmate claim for excessive force is whether force was applied in a effort to maintain or restore discipline,or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.brooks,at,citing hudson,at.however,injuries are only one of several factors that a court must consider in answering that question.
in determining whether a correctional officer has used excessive force in violation of the eighth amendment,courts look to several factors including the need for the application of force the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used the extent of the injury inflicted the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates,as reasonably perceived by responsible officials on the basis of facts known to them and any efforts made to temper the severity of the forceful response.
brooks,at,citing hudson,at.therefore,de minimis injuries do not necessarily establish de minimis force.
if we were to adopt the district court reasoning,a prisoner could constitutionally be attacked for the sole purpose of causing pain as long as the blows were inflicted in a manner that resulted in visible or palpable or diagnosable injuries that were de minimis.
we do not,of course,suggest that a fact finder could not consider the de minimis nature of injuries along with all of the other circumstances in concluding that the force that was employed could not have risen to the level required for an eighth amendment violation.a properly instructed fact finder could,after considering all of the evidence,conclude that smith injuries were so minor that the defendants account of the incident is more credible than smith,that the force used was not of constitutional dimension.that may have been exactly what the district court did here.however,that is an issue of fact to be resolved by the fact finder based upon the totality of the evidence it is not an issue of law a court can decide 
punching and kicking someone who is handcuffed behind his back and under the control of at least six prison guards as he is being thrown into cabinets and walls is repugnant to the conscience of mankind,absent the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify that kind of force.hudson,at.smith alleges he was the victim of an unprovoked and unjustified beating.the district court dismissed his eighth amendment claims,noting that the record shows that defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff to be a threat and the need for the application of force was apparent.smith ii,wl,at.the court reached that conclusion in part because it found that smith had created a disturbance by allegedly punching mensinger twice in the eye,as well as continually struggling with the defendants id.emphasis added.however,smith alleges that he was handcuffed behind his back during the disturbance,and he maintains he did not hit mensinger or struggle with the guards as they punched and kicked him,and rammed his head into the wall.if we accept smith version of the facts as true,as we must,there was simply no justification for the defendants conduct,and the district court ruling to the contrary can not stand 
defendants argue that we should nevertheless affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of officers androshick,mccole,zubris,and jones because smith concedes that he is not sure that they participated in the beating at all.however,the fact that smith has acknowledged that he could not see those defendants during the beating neither negates their involvement nor their liability as a matter of law.smith testified officer yurkiewicz,zubris,androshick,mccole,jones,all of them was in back of me and they were pushing my head,right,into the cabinets in the wall,cabinets and walls.and then after that,i was knocked to the floor.app.at emphasis added.he further testified the full force of all the guards was behind me,they rammed my head into the cabinet and into the wall no,i did say he yurkiewicz did.i said all of them.id.at emphasis added.that testimony is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to each of those defendants.see brooks,at.
moreover,it is undisputed that all of the named officers were in the vicinity at some point when smith alleges he was beaten.the extent of each officer participation is thus a classic factual dispute to be resolved by the fact finder.accordingly,we will vacate the judgment in favor of defendants novitsky,yurkiewicz,androshick,mccole,zubris,and jones and remand the matter for further proceedings.
officer paulukonis duty to intervene 
as noted earlier,smith does not allege that paulukonis took part in the beating.rather,smith claims that paulukonis can be liable under the eighth amendment if he failed to intervene.we agree.we hold that a corrections officer failure to intervene in a beating can be the basis of liability for an eighth amendment violation under if the corrections officer had a reasonable opportunity to intervene and simply refused to do so.furthermore,we hold that a corrections officer can not escape liability by relying upon his inferior or rank the other officers.
courts have held that a police officer has a duty to take reasonable steps to protect a victim from another officer use of excessive force,even if the excessive force is employed by a superior.if a police officer,whether supervisory or not,fails or refuses to intervene when a constitutional violation such as an unprovoked beating takes place in his presence,the officer is directly liable under section.byrd clark,cir accord putman gerloff,cir byrd brishke,cir.however,an officer is only liable if there is a realistic and reasonable opportunity to intervene.see clark,at instructing the district court upon remand to determine whether the officer was in a position to intervene brishke,at liability for failure to intervene exists only if the beating occurred in the officer presence or was otherwise within his knowledge putman,at liability exists only if the officer saw the beating or had time to reach the offending officer.
in baker monroe township,cir,we held that a police officer who was the senior officer involved in executing a search warrant could be liable in a suit under even though he did not personally use excessive force,nor direct anyone else to.we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to permit an inference that the officer knew of and acquiesced in the treatment the plaintiffs were receiving at the hands of the other officers acting under his supervision.baker,at.the specific circumstances in baker required us to determine if the plaintiff had shown that the senior officer had actual knowledge and acquiescence.id.at,quoting rode dellarciprete,cir.although the specific context of our analysis only involved an officer liability for the actions of police officers under his supervision,we do not interpret baker as suggesting that liability for failure to intervene is solely limited to supervisors or officers who outrank their offending colleagues.
the duty to uphold the law does not turn upon an officer rank.it is neither affected by,nor proportional to,a officer relationship to an offending colleague.the approving silence emanating from the officer who stands by and watches as others unleash an unjustified assault contributes to the actual use of excessive force,and we can not ignore the tacit support such silence lends to those who are actually striking the blows.such silence is an endorsement of the constitutional violation resulting from the illegal use of force it is incompatible with the restrictions imposed under the eighth amendment,and is therefore unacceptable.we will not immunize such conduct by suggesting that an officer can silently contribute to such a constitutional violation and escape responsibility for it.the restriction on cruel and unusual punishment contained in the eighth amendment reaches just as readily as it reaches the more demonstrable brutality of those who unjustifiably and excessively employ fists,boots or clubs.
although our case law refers to police officers,not corrections officers,this does not change our analysis both are law enforcement officers,both are sworn to uphold the law,and both are authorized to use force even deadly force toward that end.we are,of course,aware of the obvious security concerns inside the close confines of a prison.however,that is simply one factor that must be considered in determining if a particular application of force is reasonable.it does not suggest a different eighth amendment inquiry for corrections officers as opposed to police officers.the law does not allow either to condone or cover up the use of excessive force.similarly,neither can escape liability by turning either a blind eye or deaf ear to the illegal conduct of their colleagues.
therefore,if smith can show at trial that an officer attacked him while paulukonis ignored a realistic opportunity to intervene,he can recover.miller smith,cir.moreover,neither rank nor supervisory status is a factor in assessing whether paulukonis had a realistic opportunity to intervene.id 
there is some evidence that paulukonis witnessed the beating that his fellow officers allegedly administered to smith.smith alleges that paulukonis stated in his misconduct report that t he minimum amount of force was used to place inmate smith onto the floor.app.at.this appears to be based upon observations paulukonis made while standi
