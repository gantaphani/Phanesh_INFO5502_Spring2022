this appeal concerns the federal bureau of investigation fbi response to appellant american civil liberties union aclu request for information under the freedom of information act foia.the aclu claims that the united states district court for the district of new jersey district court erred in allowing the fbi to withhold pages of responsive material pursuant to certain exemptions under the foia.the aclu also challenges the in camera procedure employed by the district court for determining whether the fbi reliance on the foia exclusion provision was justified,if such reliance in fact occurred,and urges us to remand to employ a procedure instead.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court and decline to adopt the aclu novel proposal.
in the wake of september,there have been efforts to restructure the fbi as the domestic equivalent of the central intelligence agency.see the comm n,the commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states.part of this restructuring has involved an overhaul of the fbi longstanding internal guidelines in the form of a revised manual known as the domestic investigations and operations guide diog released by the attorney general of the united states in.fbi,domestic investigations and operations guide.among other things,the diog authorizes fbi agents to engage in limited racial and ethnic profiling when conducting proactive assessments of criminal and terrorist threats.id.at.specifically,the diog allows fbi agents to identify and map locations of concentrated ethnic communities if doing so would reasonably aid the analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities and assist domain awareness for the purpose of performing intelligence analysis.id.the diog also allows the fbi to collect and map data related to f ocused behavioral characteristics reasonably believed to be associated with a particular criminal or terrorist element of an ethnic community.id.at.
prompted by a concern that the new diog would encourage unlawful racial profiling,the aclu launched an initiative entitled mapping the fbi that included a series of coordinated foia requests seeking records related to the fbi use of ethnic and racial data.am.civil liberties union,mapping the fbi uncovering abusive surveillance and racial profiling,am.civil liberties union.one such request targeted six fbi field offices in new jersey and sought information concerning the fbi implementation of its authority to collect information about and map racial and ethnic demographics,behaviors,and life style characteristics in local communities.
in response,the fbi searched its files and identified pages of potentially responsive records.of these,the fbi eventually released pages some of which were partially redacted withheld pages as duplicative,and,most importantly for our purposes,withheld pages as exempt from disclosure.the withheld records included ten domain intelligence notes dins,a newark annual baseline domain assessment domain assessment,an electronic communication from october,ec,and five newark domain management team maps maps.
unsatisfied with this response,the aclu,after exhausting its administrative remedies,filed suit against the fbi and the department of justice doj in the district court for the district of new jersey,seeking an injunction for release of the withheld records.on december,the fbi and doj moved for summary judgment,contending that the withheld documents were exempted from disclosure under b exemption,b a exemption,b c exemption,b d exemption,and b e exemption in support of this motion,the fbi submitted declarations by david hardy,the section chief of the fbi dissemination section hardy declarations that describe in detail each piece of information withheld and explain why it was exempted from disclosure under the foia,as well as a vaughn index that conveys similar information in table format.
on january,the aclu filed a for summary judgment.the aclu argued that the fbi failed to demonstrate that it had segregated and disclosed all material from the withheld documents and that the fbi explanations for withholding certain documents were insufficiently detailed.additionally,the aclu sought a court order requiring the fbi to submit an in camera declaration explaining whether it had relied on c the foia exclusion provision to withhold additional,unidentified records,and the justification for this exclusion if it occurred.the fbi submitted such a declaration on february.
the fbi released six additional pages on february,and moved for summary judgment with respect to these pages on march.on april,the aclu again submitted a for summary judgment,but at that point argued that as briefing ha d progressed,it ha d become clear that the in camera procedure it had originally requested on the section c issue was inadequate and urged the district court to adopt a procedure akin to the glomar procedure established by the circuit in phillippi cia.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment for the fbi.the district court held that the withheld documents were exempted under exemptions,and,and that the fbi had satisfied its burden of demonstrating that none of the withheld information could be segregated and disclosed.the district court also held,without confirming or denying the fbi reliance on foia exclusion provision,that if an exclusion was invoked,it was and remains amply justified.the district court based this conclusion on the fbi in camera declaration originally requested by the aclu and declined to address the aclu argument for adopting the procedure.the aclu timely appealed.
we first address the district court ruling on the fbi motion for summary judgment.the district court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to a b,and and we exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.due to the unique configuration of summary judgment in a foia case,in which the opposing party generally the requester does not ordinarily have the factual information upon which the moving party generally the agency has relied,this circuit has held that the familiar standard of appellate review promulgated by federal rule of civil procedure c does not apply.mcdonnell united states,cir.instead,w e employ a test under which we first determine whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its determination and,if we find such a basis,must then decide whether that determination was clearly erroneous.abdelfattah united states of homeland,cir.because we conclude that ample evidence supported the district court conclusion that the fbi satisfied its burden under exemption,we will affirm.accordingly,we need not decide whether the fbi reliance on exemption or exemption e was proper 
the foia requires any agency,upon any request,to make records promptly available to any person.a a.the purpose of this requirement is to facilitate public access to government documents,and therefore its dominant objective is disclosure,not secrecy.sheet metal workers int l ass n,local union united states dep t of veterans affairs,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because p ublic access to government information is not all encompassing,however,the foia exempt s nine categories of documents from its broad disclosure requirements.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the dispositive exemption in this case is exemption,which authorizes the withholding of records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.b a.the agency bears the burden of justifying the withholding,and the district court reviews the agency claims of exemption de novo.osha united states dep t of labor,cir.this burden may be satisfied by affidavits that describe the material withheld and why that material falls under a particular exemption.mcdonnell,at.an agency is entitled to summary judgment when these affidavits describe the withheld information and the justification for withholding with reasonable specificity,demonstrating a logical connection between
