in the present case,lamont wilson appellant or wilson filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc against his employer,dollar general corporation appellee or dollar general.wilson alleged dollar general failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability in violation of the americans with disabilities act of,ada.
while awaiting the eeoc notice of his right to sue,appellant wilson filed for chapter bankruptcy.he then filed the present suit in district court,and dollar general moved for summary judgment.dollar general argued,unsuccessfully,that the filing of wilson chapter bankruptcy petition deprived wilson of standing to maintain his ada claim.dollar general also argued,and the district court agreed,that wilson claim failed on the merits.wilson appealed the district court determination that although he had standing to maintain his claim,his claim failed on the merits.
we align ourselves with our sister circuits and conclude that because of the powers vested in the chapter debtor and trustee,a chapter debtor may retain standing to bring his petition claims.we also conclude that because appellant was unable to show he could perform the essential functions of his position with a reasonable accommodation,the district court properly granted summary judgment in dollar general favor.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
wilson is a former employee of dollar general.in his youth,long before his employment with dollar general,wilson suffered a detached retina in his right eye,causing complete and permanent blindness in his right eye.
in september,wilson began working at one of dollar general distribution centers,located in south boston,virginia.wilson worked the night shift,processing inventory and loading merchandise for transportation to dollar general many retail locations.his responsibilities included sorting smaller products as well as lifting and loading heavier products.by all accounts,wilson was an excellent employee.he was chosen to serve in an unpaid capacity as head employee safety representative,acting as a liaison between employees and management on matters of employee safety and working conditions.his work ethic is unchallenged a testament to his industriousness,perseverance,and good nature,despite his physical limitation.
unfortunately,within five months of gaining employment with dollar general,in february,wilson developed a serious inflammatory condition in his left eye.threatened with the prospect of losing his vision entirely,wilson sought immediate treatment at the dominion eye center in danville,virginia.crews of the dominion eye center diagnosed wilson with iritis crews initially prescribed eye drops and advised that wilson refrain from strenuous activities.as a side effect of the prescription eye drops,wilson vision became blurred,further limiting his abilities.
with the onset of his medical condition in february,wilson took leave from his position with dollar general.during his leave,wilson continued to receive treatment from doctors at the dominion eye center,including his primary physician,odom.wilson also continuously provided dollar general with notes from odom and crews dated february,february,february,february,february,and march,indicating he was still receiving treatment and was unable to return to work.dollar general initially granted wilson six weeks of leave pursuant to its medical leave policy,followed by two weeks of additional medical leave at the conclusion of wilson treatment,wilson again received eye drops and odom cleared wilson to return to work as of today.odom april note did not indicate whether wilson return should have been subject to any restrictions.
the night of april,however,wilson vision did not fully return and instead remained blurred.that night,wilson called dollar general human resource officer niki stinespring to inform dollar general of his condition.wilson explained to stinespring that although earlier in the afternoon he had been cleared to return to work by his doctor,he was still having significant problems with his vision that prevented his return to work that night.dollar general then granted wilson an additional day of leave and permitted him to return to work on april.
wilson condition worsened,and on april,he sought treatment from hoang at the emergency room of the danville regional medical center.hoang treated wilson with additional eye drops and prescription pain medication,but wilson vision problems did not subside.
immediately after receiving treatment at danville regional medical center on april,wilson traveled to dollar general facility.wilson informed stinespring that he would be unable to return to work that evening as he had previously indicated.wilson provided stinespring with hoang patient discharge instructions note,which read this notice verifies that your employee,lamont wilson was seen in this facility on.may return to work on.hoang note left blank a section identifying whether or not wilson return to work was subject to any restrictions.the note concluded with the following boilerplate instruction if symptoms continue and the employee is unable to perform the full duties of their job by this date,please advise the employee to return to this facility or make an appointment with the referral physician for further evaluation.id.wilson also informed stinespring that he had additional upcoming medical appointments with the duke medical center to help treat his condition.
according to wilson,stinespring responded by offering him an ultimatum return to work that evening on april as he previously indicated he would or be terminated and reapply after his condition improved.wilson then admitted that he was unable to return to work that evening.at this point,it became clear to wilson that he had been terminated 
following his termination,wilson vision did not immediately improve.wilson testified that he was unable to specifically give you a date as to when he would have been able to return to work at dollar general.he did,however,begin making other job contacts,as a condition to receive state unemployment benefits,approximately a week or a week and a half later,after his termination on april.id.
shortly after his termination,wilson contacted the eeoc and inquired about his options for legal recourse.on june,wilson filed a charge of discrimination.later that month,on june,wilson filed for chapter bankruptcy in the western district of virginia.
during the course of his bankruptcy proceeding,wilson filed an amended schedule b with the bankruptcy court,identifying his personal property.the schedule included as wilson personal property,a potential claim against dollar general related to termination of debtor employment,value,if any unknown.amended schedule b pers,in re wilson,ecf.on november,wilson chapter bankruptcy plan was confirmed 
around the same time,wilson suffered a second medical setback he was diagnosed with a detached retina in his left eye that required surgery.on november,wilson underwent surgery at the university of virginia medical center to repair his detached retina.the surgery left wilson blind for seven weeks,and required months of rest and recovery thereafter.eventually,wilson vision returned,he recovered from the surgery,and in march he began looking for employment.
on march,the eeoc issued wilson a notice of his right to sue dollar general.on june,wilson filed the suit underlying this appeal in the western district of virginia.wilson alleged dollar general had unlawfully discriminated against him by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability,resulting in his discharge,in violation of the ada.
on february,dollar general moved in district court for summary judgment on wilson ada claim.dollar general argued wilson,as a chapter debtor,lacked standing to maintain his claim and,therefore,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear wilson claim.dollar general also argued wilson failed to establish genuine issues of material fact as to his underlying ada claim.on march,the district court by memorandum opinion,denied dollar general motion with respect to standing.the district court granted summary judgment,however,in dollar general favor as to the underlying ada claim.wilson filed a motion to reconsider,which was denied on april.wilson then timely filed this appeal.
as the district court grant of summary judgment was a final order disposing of wilson claims,we possess jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to.
we review de novo the legal question of whether a plaintiff has standing to maintain his cause of action.clatterbuck city of charlottesville,cir see smith rockett,cir reviewing de novo chapter debtor standing to maintain claims under the fair debt collections practices act,and various state laws.
we also review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,viewing all the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.halpern wake forest.health,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine disputes of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
first,given that appellant standing was challenged below,the district court addressed standing in its opinion granting summary judgment,and because this court has not yet considered to what extent a chapter debtor may possess standing to assert an independent cause of action,we find it appropriate to lay the issue to rest here.second,because we conclude wilson retained standing,once he filed for chapter bankruptcy,to file his ada claim for unlawful discrimination,we then consider whether the district court erred in concluding dollar general was entitled to summary judgment on wilson ada claim.
the threshold issue here is whether wilson,as a chapter debtor,retained standing to file his cause of action under the ada.
we begin our analysis by acknowledging a few basic bankruptcy principles.the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates a bankruptcy estate,a.the bankruptcy estate is comprised of a broad range of both tangible and intangible property interests.id.a.such property interests include causes of action that arose out of events occurring prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.see wissman pittsburgh bank,cir.while the bankruptcy code is silent as to the debtor capacity to maintain these causes of action,the bankruptcy trustee,as representative of the estate,a,generally has capacity to sue and be sued.id.b.
as a result,in the chapter bankruptcy context which requires liquidation and distribution of assets by the trustee we have recognized,i f a cause of action is part of the estate of the bankrupt then the trustee alone has standing to bring that claim.am.ins.ruppert landscaping,cir.we have applied this principle to causes of action that are part of the estate when brought by creditors and by chapter debtors alike.see tignor parkinson,cir,superseded by statute,ann.west,as recognized in in re cassell,wl at,cir unpublished table decision see also in re richman,cir citing stanley sherwin williams,
but the breadth of our precedent has been limited.we have only considered the abilities of chapter debtors and trustees to maintain causes of action that are part of the estate.we have not yet considered to what extent the chapter debtor who,unlike the chapter debtor,retains possession of the bankruptcy estate may also possess standing to assert a cause of action,either exclusive of,or concurrent with,the authority vested in the trustee.
all of the five circuit courts to have considered the question have concluded that chapter debtors have standing to bring causes of action in their own name on behalf of the estate.see smith rockett,cir crosby monroe,cir cable ivy tech state college,cir olick parker parsley petroleum,cir.united jersey bank,cir opinion sur panel rehearing,reinstating.united jersey bank,cir see also love tyson foods,cir haynes,dissenting rejecting the majority equitable estoppel analysis.
we find the authority of our sister circuits persuasive and conclude that,unlike a chapter debtor,a chapter debtor possesses standing concurrent with that of the trustee to maintain a cause of action on behalf of the estate.the nature of chapter bankruptcy when compared to chapter supports this conclusion.
chapter and chapter provide two distinct methods for an individual to cure his indebtedness.chapter adopts the much more radical solution,cable,at,of requiring the debtor to relinquish possession of the estate to the trustee for liquidation and distribution to creditors.see.to effectuate this purpose,the trustee management of the estate including causes of action that are part of the estate must necessarily be free from interference by the debtor.cable,at.thus,under rule requirement,it is the chapter trustee,but not the chapter debtor,who may possess standing on behalf of the estate to bring a claim.see,auday wet seal retail,cir concluding chapter debtor lacked standing to maintain age discrimination suit against her former employer but remanding to district court to determine whether rule permitted the chapter trustee to join or substitute itself into the action dunmore united states,cir concluding the chapter estate was the real party in interest and thus chapter debtor lacked prudential standing to maintain action for refund of federal taxes,but remanding to the district court to determine whether debtor could cure his rule defect.
chapter,however,provides a different framework.under chapter,the debtor remains in possession of the property of the estate and cures his indebtedness,under the supervision of the trustee,by way of regular payments to creditors from his earnings through a court approved payment plan.see b,olick,at.
chapter also modifies other powers generally given to the debtor and trustee.for example,not only does the chapter debtor retain possession of the property of the estate,the chapter debtor also assumes exclusive of the trustee,the rights and powers of a trustee,found in many of the provisions of regarding the general administration of bankruptcy estates.in other words,in addition to his power to possess property,the chapter debtor is explicitly given the authority,exclusive of the trustee,to use,sell,or lease property of the estate in certain circumstances.as the seventh circuit recognized,i t would frustrate the essential purpose of to grant the debtor possession of the chose in action yet prohibit him from pursuing it for the benefit of the estate.cable,at.
implicit in that act of possession,as authorized by statute,is the right of the chapter debtor unlike the chapter debtor to sue in his own name in such actions pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.see.a g permitting a party authorized by statute to sue in his or her own name without joining the person for whose benefit the action is brought.accordingly,because the chapter debtor is explicitly given the power to possess and use the property,and implicit within that use is the permissible maintenance of a cause of action that is part of the estate,the chapter debtor has standing to maintain a prepetition claim.
federal rule of bankruptcy procedure envisions the same result.under rule the trustee or debtor in possession may prosecute or may enter an appearance and defend any pending action or proceeding by or against the debtor fed.see smith,at recognizing that although debtor in possession is a term of art in the chapter context,a chapter debtor possesses the chapter estate and has thus been considered analogous to a chapter debtor due to their enhanced representative and operational capacities cable,at same.in this sense,the chapter debtor steps into the role of trustee and exercises concurrent authority to sue and be sued on behalf of the estate.cable,at citing fed.
therefore,we find wilson had standing in the district court to bring his claim for violation of the ada.
we now turn to the merits of wilson appeal.the ada performs a number of laudatory functions,not the least of which is to protect disabled individuals from insidious discrimination by requiring employers to reasonably accommodate their disability.the law,however,can not remedy every misfortune.it can only correct that which it prescribes to correct.
under the ada,an employ
