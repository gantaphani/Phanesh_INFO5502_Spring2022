this case requires us to explore an important question related to corporate liability in an age discrimination case whether a corporation can be held liable for discrimination when neutral decisionmakers,free of any animus,rely on information that is manipulated by another employee who harbors discriminatory animus.
here,the plaintiff,john cariglia,brought suit against the hertz equipment rental corporation for terminating him because of his age in violation of.ch.and against his supervisor,james heard,for intentionally interfering with his advantageous relationship with hertz.following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for defendants on both counts.after a careful review of the arguments and the record,we vacate and remand.
cariglia was first hired to work for hertz in as the boston branch manager.by,after three promotions,cariglia held the position of national equipment sales manager.in,however,that position was eliminated and hertz president daniel kaplan asked cariglia to return to boston to revive that branch financially.cariglia expressed reservations about assuming the administrative paperwork required of a branch manager,and he also was concerned that returning to a branch manager position would be a step back for him.kaplan proposed to appoint bill simmons,a salesman at the boston branch,to serve as cariglia assistant branch manager and to handle those administrative tasks.additionally,kaplan and cariglia agreed that cariglia compensation would be no lower than it was in his position as national equipment sales manager.under these terms,cariglia agreed to return to boston as branch manager.
from to,cariglia significantly improved the financial condition of the boston branch.while the branch had suffered losses for at least the three previous years,it showed income of in and million in.the branch gross profits grew to million in and was on pace for million in,the year in which cariglia was terminated.every year the branch exceeded its profit goals by a considerable percentage,and the boston branch became the most profitable in the northeast.not surprisingly,this financial turnaround earned cariglia commendation from hertz,including letters of praise from kaplan and gerry plescia,hertz of operations.cariglia direct supervisor during this time was defendant james heard,hertz division for the northeast region.heard gave cariglia overall rates on three successive performance evaluations from to.
at the end of,which was a profitable year,heard told cariglia that hertz wanted to mitigate tax liability by incurring expenses to offset some of the branch profit.the men discussed expending between and to paint large lifts,called booms,that the company eventually planned to sell.however,cariglia testified that he told heard that booms could not be painted immediately since they were being rented to customers,and heard responded that he did not care when the booms were actually painted so long as the painting was expensed for the tax year.as the district court noted,heard did not contradict this testimony.in his testimony,heard agreed that it is general practice to only paint rental booms before resale and that it was within cariglia discretion as branch manager to keep the booms out on rent earning money and satisfying customers rather than being painted.heard also testified that he expected the booms to be painted as they became available.ultimately,the booms were not painted by the time cariglia was fired in september.
during cariglia tenure at the boston branch,several witnesses testified that heard denigrated cariglia,who was born in,because of his age.the district court found that evidence shows that heard,cariglia supervisor,made statements rife with discriminatory animus.the district court also found that in june,heard ordered an audit of the boston branch motivated not by sound business reasons,but by a desire on the part of heard to get the goods on cariglia because heard believed cariglia was over the hill,not our kind and should not be here.
this audit,conducted by ken eyerman,hertz northeast regional controller,was atypical in four regards.first,eyerman usually scheduled branch audits himself,and this audit of the boston branch was the only time heard had directed him to conduct an audit.second,according to eyerman,whose testimony the district court credited,heard told him to go up to boston and get the goods on cariglia so he could get him out of there.third,while the scope of a typical audit usually covered the preceding ninety days,eyerman went back eighteen to months because,according to his testimony,a fter completing the audit guidelines,heard said keep digging,dig deeper.he said just keep looking.find it.find something.he asked me to see if i could get any more information about anything that was going on at the branch so that we could try to get rid of cariglia.fourth,eyerman spent three weeks performing the boston audit,in contrast to the usual three to five days.
the result of the extended audit was a poor rating for the boston branch.five items were specifically mentioned,all related to internal controls missing control copies of billing documents improper check acceptance and credit approvals inadequate safeguarding of equipment failure to follow purchasing procedures completely and missing documents from personnel files.eyerman testified that the audit was accurate and contained his independent conclusions.after simmons,the assistant branch manager who was directly responsible for the branch paperwork,wrote a response memo to eyerman,a plan was put in place to correct these internal control issues.however,eyerman also took the unusual step of including with the audit a note to plescia,of operations,stating that i think there is more going on at this branch than can be detected through paper trails and internal control weaknesses.
around the same time,plescia received a copy of a letter from the attorney of boston branch employee,george harrington.this letter alleged improper business practices at the boston branch,including equipment rented without proper rental agreements,money offered in exchange for ignoring improper rentals,equipment leased to customers without accounts,and equipment rented to customers but returned by others.
the harrington letter,in conjunction with the eyerman audit results,spurred plescia,kaplan,and of employee relations don steele to request an internal corporate security investigation.hertz local investigator,graham morgan,conducted the investigation.morgan interviewed harrington and four other boston branch employees in the course of preparing his report.he was unable to substantiate harrington allegations,writing in his report that 
n one of the others interviewed has any proof that equipment is leaving the yard without rental contracts.no one interviewed was ever told to look the other way or offered money to look the other way to enable a piece of equipment to leave the yard concerning equipment that is rented by one company and returned by another,not one of the individuals could provide a concrete example of activity in this regard none of the people interviewed could accurately provide any information that would substantiate suspicion that john cariglia is taking kickbacks.
morgan report did,however,identify five areas of concern that emerged as a result of the interviews slipshod internal controls b ooms that were to be painted by a vendor named new england truck were never completed after money was paid to have this work done cariglia failure to forward a low bid to rehabilitate the branch site favoritism in assigning saturday overtime work and a hostile environment created primarily by the branch manager.morgan report,dated august,was forwarded to both steele and heard.
on september,plescia,kaplan,and three other members of hertz senior management decided that morgan and eyerman should interview cariglia regarding the outstanding issues and conduct a audit.morgan asked cariglia about each of the five areas of concern he had identified in his august report.cariglia essentially denied the substance of each item,with the exception of the painting of the booms.morgan wrote that in response to that issue,cariglia said that bob zechello handles the scheduling of the booms to be painted.records in his office and elsewhere are available for review in this matter.cariglia agrees that he made these statements,but he testified that morgan neglected to mention that cariglia told him that the booms had not been painted.plescia and heard received morgan second report.
eyerman audit concentrated on the vendor files related to new england truck,the company that had been paid to paint the booms.after reviewing the relevant paperwork,he concluded that the booms had been out on rental and not available for painting.eyerman sent the results of the audit to heard.there is no indication in the record that any other party received a copy of this audit.
on september,plescia and steele instructed heard to go to the boston branch and ask cariglia about the booms.the next day,heard met with cariglia in boston and asked him if he had forgotten to paint the booms.cariglia told him that his plans were to,as they had always been,to paint the booms when i got ready to sell them.heard then told cariglia that he,heard,needed to call his supervisors and asked if cariglia wanted to add anything to what he had said.cariglia declined,and heard called plescia and steele.according to plescia,heard informed them that the booms were not painted,and that there was no accountability for the money that was paid.plescia,steele,and kaplan then decided to terminate cariglia and directed heard to inform cariglia that he was to be terminated for gross misconduct.the district found as a factual matter that plescia,steele,and kaplan were free of any personal animus towards cariglia when they made this decision.
after his conversation with the three executives,heard called cariglia back into the office and informed him that he was fired for gross misconduct.when cariglia asked him what gross misconduct meant,heard did not provide an answer.heard replaced cariglia with benjamin robin,who was under years of age at the time and had been the manager of hertz newark branch.
cariglia subsequently filed suit against hertz and heard in massachusetts superior court.the case was removed to federal court.following a bench trial,the district court ruled in favor of both defendants.cariglia appeal followed.
on appeal,cariglia urges that the district court made three errors finding that heard was not a decisionmaker,declining to impose liability on hertz for heard animus under.ch,and denying his intentional interference with advantageous relations claim against heard because his termination was not a result of heard actions.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.kinan cohen,cir.
heard as a decisionmaker 
as noted,the district court found that heard desire to terminate cariglia as a hertz employee was motivated by animus.in cariglia view,this finding alone means that hertz itself was motivated by animus because hertz response to an interrogatory constitutes an admission that heard was a decisionmaker,having caused or participated in the decision to fire cariglia.cariglia also claims that heard agreed with and adopted questions explicitly identifying him as a decisionmaker throughout the trial.because neither hertz nor heard disputed the premise of these heard made,ordered,caused or participated in the decision to fire reasons that the district court was required to find that heard was a decisionmaker.
a close reading of the interrogatory and questions posed at trial reveal that the defendants did not admit or acquiesce to statements implying that it was heard who made the decision to terminate cariglia.the interrogatories asked,inter alia,whether heard participated in cariglia termination,and the defendants never denied that he did.instead,they argued,and the district court found,that heard fired cariglia pursuant to the instructions of plescia,steele,and kaplan.therefore,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the ultimate decision to terminate cariglia was made by heard supervisors,and not by heard.
hertz liability under.ch.even though heard was not a decisionmaker 
cariglia argues that even if heard is not deemed a decisionmaker,his animus impermissibly tainted the decisionmaking process when he withheld from plescia,steele,and kaplan exculpatory information regarding the circumstances surrounding the painting of the booms.indeed,this alternative basis for liability is the critical issue in this case whether corporate liability can attach if neutral decisionmakers,when deciding to terminate an employee,rely on information that is inaccurate,misleading,or incomplete because of another employee discriminatory animus.
cariglia summarized his argument to the district court as follows 
defendants can not launder the decision to terminate cariglia by attempting to remove heard completely from the termination decision hertz regional vice president heard orchestrated the termination and caused it by admittedly failing to inform gerry plescia,his superior,that cariglia had been instructed by heard to pay for painting the booms upon the end of,that it was customary to only paint booms upon resale,that it was within the branch manager discretion to keep the booms out on rent rather than pulling them out of productive use for repainting.thus,heard presented or intentionally let stand a completely false and misleading impression that cariglia had somehow engaged in financial misconduct 
as a legal proposition,this argument has merit under first circuit precedent and persuasive case law from other circuits.it is also faithful to the massachusetts supreme judicial court instruction that the primary purposes of.ch.are to protect citizens of the commonwealth from adverse employment decisions based on their age and to discourage,and punish,unlawful discrimination in the work place.knight avon products,citations omitted.however,as we will explain infra,the district court did not address this alternative basis for hertz liability.as a result,it did not make a factual finding that is critical to the applicability of this corporate liability doctrine.
massachusetts general law sets out four elements membership in a protected class,harm,discriminatory animus,and causation.lipchitz raytheon.here,there is no question that cariglia was a member of a protected class because of his age,that his termination constituted harm,and that discriminatory animus was present in the workplace.the appropriate focus,then,is on the causation issue whether his termination was because of discrimination.as the district court noted,when assessing whether a plaintiff has established causation,f or cases brought under.laws ch.that are based on circumstantial evidence,the supreme judicial court has adopted the burden shifting framework established by the united states supreme court under the provisions of title vii.the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that he is a member of a class protected by he performed his job at an acceptable level he was terminated and his employer sought to fill the plaintiff position by hiring another individual with qualifications similar to the plaintiff.blare,at.this prima facie case creates a presumption of discrimination.id.in the second stage,the employer can rebut the presumption created by the prima facie case by articulating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision.id.we agree with the district court that the parties addressed the requirements of the first and second stages.
at the third stage,the presumption created by the prima facie case drops from the case and the employee must show that the basis of the employer decision was unlawful discrimination.abramian president fellows of harvard.the district court found that cariglia case founders at the third stage,holding that his termination was not because of discrimination.the massachusetts supreme judicial court summarized in lipchitz raytheon,the various formulations that court has used when discussing the because of causation requirement in.ch.
