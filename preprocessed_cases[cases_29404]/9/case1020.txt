this case arises from the involuntary commitment of brett bolmer.he sued various individuals and entities involved in his commitment in the united states district court for the district of connecticut arterton.as relevant to this appeal,bolmer claimed that joseph oliveira violated his fourth amendment and substantive due process rights enforceable under,and falsely imprisoned him in violation of connecticut law,when he ordered bolmer committed.bolmer also alleged that the connecticut department of mental health and addiction services dmhas violated title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,by stereotyping bolmer as an unreliable individual who manifested delusions because of his diagnosed mental illness.
oliveira and dmhas moved for summary judgment on the grounds that oliveira,as a state officer,has qualified immunity to bolmer claims and has sovereign immunity to the false imprisonment claim and dmhas is immune to the title ii claim under the eleventh amendment.the district court granted summary judgment on oliveira defense of sovereign immunity to bolmer false imprisonment claim,but denied summary judgment on the qualified immunity and eleventh amendment immunity defenses.
on interlocutory appeal,raise several arguments we have no jurisdiction to review under the collateral order doctrine,and we dismiss the appeal as to these arguments.however,their central thrust raises reviewable challenges to the legal standards the district court employed in denying them summary judgment on their qualified immunity and eleventh amendment immunity defenses.
first,oliveira argues that the test set forth in rodriguez city of new york,cir for determining whether an involuntary commitment violates substantive due process is inconsistent with county of sacramento lewis.he contends that it imposes liability for conduct that does not shock the conscience.we disagree,and hold that rodriguez is consistent with lewis.
second,dmhas believes that,under garcia health sciences center of brooklyn,cir,the district court should have required a showing that it acted with discriminatory animus or ill will before denying it summary judgment on its eleventh amendment immunity defense to bolmer title ii claim.absent such a showing,dmhas argues,congress abrogation of dmhas immunity is invalid.because garcia was based on congress enforcement of the equal protection clause,we hold that it is not applicable when congress abrogation is supported by its enforcement of the substantive due process right not to be involuntarily committed absent a danger to self or others.
because we can not conclude as a matter of law that are entitled to qualified immunity or eleventh amendment immunity,we affirm the denial of summary judgment on these defenses.
background 
brett bolmer has a history of mental illness.in,the greater danbury mental health authority gdmha began providing housing to bolmer through its transitional housing program the program.gdmha is a local agency of dmhas that provides services to patients in its care.as part of the program,bolmer was assigned a case manager,lisa kaminski.bolmer and kaminski had known one another before,having grown up in the same town.upon kaminski appointment,the two began communicating frequently through text messages and phone calls.
according to bolmer,he began a sexual relationship with kaminski in february.he claims that they would meet once or twice per week at kaminski apartment.
on september,bolmer placed roses on kaminski car.he asserts that when he saw kaminiski later that day,she told him that their relationship was over.
the next day,bolmer told the director of the program,rick hammond,that he had been involved in a sexual relationship with kaminski.he also told a gdmha caseworker,mike anello.around the same time,kaminski notified hammond that bolmer had left flowers on her car and had called her twice.gdmha staff questioned whether bolmer was manifesting erotomania,a psychiatric syndrome characterized by a false belief that there exists a romantic relationship with another person.no one believed in the alleged sexual relationship with kaminski.a gdmha caseworker,joe halpin,informed bolmer probation officer of the situation.the officer called bolmer and told him to return to the gdmha facility.bolmer complied.
the facts surrounding bolmer return to gdmha are controversial.according to bolmer,he was annoyed when he had to return,so he was speaking loudly to the staff,but was not yelling.joseph oliveira,a gdmha psychiatrist whom bolmer had never met,entered the room and,without introducing himself,told bolmer that he was there to conduct a mini mental health exam.oliveira asked bolmer to repeat three words motor,tree,giraffe,but barely asked him any questions.at this point bolmer realized that oliveira was considering whether to have him committed.bolmer tried to explain his feelings about his breakup with kaminski to those in the,halpin,and they kept looking at him as if he was crazy to be thinking that a case worker could possibly have an affair with a crazy person.oliveira rolled his eyes at bolmer.
frustrated that no one believed him,bolmer began talking about other injustices he had suffered.after someone told him to calm down,bolmer attempted to convey that he was not angry.he stated that if he was really angry that he would pick up the chair in the room and throw it.oliveira then opened the door and police and ambulance workers came rushing in.bolmer claims that the examination lasted no more than five minutes.
according to dmhas and oliveira,when bolmer returned to the gdmha facility he was yelling loudly enough for oliveira to hear him in the next room.out of concern for everyone safety,oliveira had a staff member call the police.during the evaluation,bolmer exhibited increasing anger and hostility,stating that if he were angry,he would pick up the fan in the room and throw it and go over and kick joe halpin in the head.at this point,oliveira determined that the examination could not continue safely.according to oliveira and gdmha staff,the examination lasted at least minutes.
the parties do not dispute that,at the conclusion of the examination,oliveira executed a physician emergency certificate ordering bolmer involuntarily committed for no more than days care and treatment in a mental hospital.oliveira noted on the certificate that bolmer was having erotomanic delusions about kaminski,and appeared angry and hostile.he concluded,patient at this time,in my clinical opinion,is dangerous and poses a threat to others.
the ambulance workers transported bolmer to danbury hospital,a private institution providing psychiatric care to gdmha clients under a contract with the state.at the hospital,staff strapped bolmer to his bed and injected him with geodon,an medication.after a staff member discovered that bolmer cell phone contained numerous text messages between him and kaminski,the hospital discharged bolmer two days later.
phone records later revealed that bolmer and kaminski had a history of communicating frequently,and that the communications were initiated by both parties.kaminski conceded that she used poor judgment in her extensive communications with bolmer,but denied any sexual relationship.
in october,dmhas fired kaminski for violating dmhas work rule number the development of sexual or otherwise exploitive relationships between employees and clients is prohibited.
in february,bolmer sued oliveira,dmhas,and certain others involved in his involuntary commitment.bolmer claimed under,that oliveira violated the fourth and fourteenth amendments by ordering him committed that oliveira falsely imprisoned him in violation of connecticut law and that dmhas violated title ii of the ada by stereotyping bolmer as an unreliable individual who manifested delusions because of his diagnosed mental illness.
in january,oliveira and dmhas together,the state defendants moved for summary judgment.the state defendants and bolmer both submitted expert affidavits on the issue of whether oliveira examination was consistent with generally accepted medical standards.not surprisingly,the state defendants expert believed that the examination was consistent,and bolmer expert did not.
in his response to the state defendants motion,bolmer indicated that he did not intend to pursue his fourth amendment claim against oliveira.
in august,the district court granted summary judgment to oliveira on bolmer false imprisonment claim,but denied it on the and title ii claims.first,the court found that oliveira,as a state officer,was shielded from bolmer false imprisonment claim by sovereign immunity.the court stated 
although bolmer allegations,if true,could support a finding of negligence on the part of oliveira,he points to no acts or statements which demonstrate malice or wantonness the evidence which bolmer has marshaled in support of his claims may point to indifference,but there is no evidence of extreme conduct which could satisfy the intentionality required by the connecticut supreme court to eliminate oliveira immunity against suit on the state law claims in this court.
bolmer oliveira,d.
second,the district court denied summary judgment on oliveira qualified immunity defense to the fourteenth amendment claim.bolmer claim was that oliveira violated his right to substantive due process by ordering him committed based on a deficient examination.the district court applied rodriguez city of new york,cir,which held that an involuntary commitment violates substantive due process if the decision to commit is based on substantive and procedural criteria that are substantially below the standards generally accepted in the medical community.id.at.here,the parties experts based their opinions on differing versions of the facts,and disagreed on the applicable medical standards.thus,the question whether oliveira decision fell substantially below those standards remained for trial.
third,the district court found that material issues of fact also precluded summary judgment on dmhas defense of eleventh amendment immunity to the title ii claim.as the court saw it,the issue turned on whether congress abrogation of dmhas immunity to bolmer title ii claim was appropriate.under united states georgia,the abrogation was valid if dmhas violated both title ii and the fourteenth amendment.because there were material issues of fact as to whether such violations occurred,the validity of congress abrogation could not be resolved on summary judgment.
last,the district court denied summary judgment to oliveira on bolmer fourth amendment claim without discussing the claim.
the state defendants appeal the denial of summary judgment,resting on the collateral order doctrine as the basis for our jurisdiction.specifically,oliveira contends that he has qualified immunity to the substantive due process claim for four reasons bolmer expert offered insufficient evidence of the applicable medical standards to create a genuine issue of fact as to what those standards are oliveira conduct did not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation because it did not shock the conscience under county of sacramento lewis,danbury hospital staff,and not oliveira,were responsible for bolmer commitment and an involuntary commitment will not violate substantive due process when a more specific constitutional,the fourth.
oliveira also argues that the district court should have granted him summary judgment on bolmer fourth amendment claim because the claim was abandoned.
dmhas contends that the eleventh amendment bars litigation of bolmer title ii claim because he failed to show that dmhas acted with discriminatory animus or ill will under garcia health sciences center of brooklyn,cir,and therefore congress abrogation of dmhas eleventh amendment immunity is invalid.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction and standard of review 
though neither party contests our appellate jurisdiction,we are obligated to consider the issue sua sponte.joseph leavitt,cir.
orders denying summary judgment are generally not immediately appealable final decisions under.see finigan marshall,cir.pursuant to the collateral order doctrine,however,we have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of orders denying claims of qualified immunity and eleventh amendment immunity.mitchell forsyth,qualified immunity puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,eleventh amendment immunity.the principal justification for allowing such appeals is that t he entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.puerto rico aqueduct sewer,at quoting mitchell,at.
however,to avoid running afoul of the collateral order doctrine requirement that a reviewable order involve a clai m of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,we may review immunity denials only to the narrow extent they turn on questions of law.mitchell,at quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan,see komlosi state office of mental retardation and developmental disabilities,cir.in short,where the district court denied immunity on summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remained,we have jurisdiction to determine whether the issue is material,but not whether it is genuine.jones parmley,cir.stated differently,we may determine whether a defendant is entitled to immunity on stipulated facts,or on the facts that the plaintiff alleges are true,or on the facts favorable to the plaintiff that the trial judge concluded the jury might find.salim proulx,cir.but we may not review the district court ruling that the plaintiff evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue on the facts relevant to the defendant immunity defense.id.at.cabined by these constraints,our review is de novo.jones,at.
where we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of one ruling,we have the discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over other district court rulings that are inextricably intertwined or necessary to ensure meaningful review of the first.ross am.express,cir quoting swint chambers county comm n.we recognize,however,that pendent appellate jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly,if ever.mancuso state thruway,cir.
here,assert the collateral order doctrine as the sole basis for appellate jurisdiction.they are correct that the doctrine provides for jurisdiction to the extent their appeal turns on questions of law related to their immunity defenses.however,they ask us to delve deeper.
first,offer their version of the contested facts surrounding bolmer commitment.we lack jurisdiction to compare their factual evidence with bolmer.see salim,at.indeed,contention that bolmer failed to provide evidence sufficient to create an issue of fact as to the applicable medical standards falls squarely within the category of arguments we may not review.see id.at see also grune rodriguez,cir.we therefore dismiss the appeal as to this argument,and confine our review to the facts favorable to bolmer that the trial judge concluded the jury might find,including those it did not explicitly identify but likely assumed.salim,f d at quoting johnson jones.
second,seek to reverse the denial of summary judgment on bolmer fourth amendment claim.they assert that the claim was abandoned.do not explain how the district court apparent denial of summary judgment on this claim constitutes an appealable collateral order,nor how the issue is inextricably intertwined or necessary to ensure meaningful review of the immunity denials such that we should exercise pendent jurisdiction.ross,at quoting swint,at.it was their duty to do so.see fed.a.having failed to explain a basis for appellate jurisdiction,and none being apparent,we also dismiss the appeal to the extent it challenges the denial of summary judgment on the fourth amendment claim.
ii.qualified immunity 
government actors have qualified immunity to claims insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.okin vill.of police dep t,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald.as a state actor,oliveira is immune to bolmer substantive due process claim if the reviewable facts do not make out a violation of bolmer right to substantive due process,or the right was not clearly established at the time of bolmer commitment.see pearson callahan.oliveira does not argue that bolmer substantive due process right was not clearly established he is therefore entitled to qualified immunity only if,on the facts favorable to bolmer that the district court concluded a jury might find,he did not violate bolmer right to substantive due process.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment has a substantive component that bars certain state actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.county of sacramento lewis,quoting daniels williams.substantive due process prohibits states from involuntarily committing nondangerous mentally ill individuals.see donaldson.it does not,however,require a guarantee that a physician assessment of dangerousness be correct.rodriguez city of new york,cir.rather,we held in rodriguez that an involuntary commitment violates substantive due process if the decision is made on the basis of substantive and procedural criteria that are substantially below the standards generally accepted in the medical community.id.at.what those standards are is a question of fact.see also olivier robert yeager mental health,cir.
some three years after our decision in rodriguez,the supreme court held in county of sacramento lewis that for executive action to violate substantive due process,it must be so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.at.the court indicated,however,that the inquiry is not a test for determining whether particular executive conduct violates substantive due process rather,it provides a framework for making such a determination.see id.at while the measure of what is conscience shocking is no calibrated yardstick,it does,as judge friendly put it,poin t the way.quoting johnson glick,cir.several principles support this framework.
first,the constitutional concept of conscience shocking duplicates no traditional category of fault,but rather points clearly away from liability,or clearly toward it,only at the ends of the tort law spectrum of culpability.id.at.thus,liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process,but injuries produced with culpability falling within the middle range,following from something more than negligence but less than intentional conduct,such as recklessness or gross negligence,is a matter for closer calls.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
second,whether particular executive action shocks the conscience is highly.
the phrase due process of law formulates a concept less rigid and more fluid than those envisaged in other specific and particular provisions of the bill of rights.its application is less a matter of rule.asserted denial is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case.that which may,in one setting,constitute a denial of fundamental fairness,shocking to the universal sense of justice,may,in other circumstances,and in the light of other considerations,fall short of such denial.
id.at quoting betts brady.thus,concern with preserving the constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an exact analysis of circumstances before any abuse of power is condemned as conscience shocking.id.
in lewis,a sacramento county sheriff deputy attempted to stop two teenage boys who were speeding on a motorcycle.id.at.when the teenagers refused to pull over,a chase ensued.the chase ended when the motorcycle tipped over during a sharp turn.the pursuing deputy was unable to avoid skidding into the motorcycle passenger,phillip lewis,at miles per hour.lewis was pronounced dead at the scene.lewis family sued the county,its sheriff department,and the deputy under,claiming that the deputy conduct violated lewis right to substantive due process.id.at.the case reached the supreme court on the issue of what level of culpability a law enforcement officer must reach to violate substantive due process in a pursuit case.id.at.
the court held that chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability under the fourteenth amendment,redressible by an action under.id.at.analogizing a chase to a prison riot,the court noted that in neither instance was there time for a responding officer to ponder,and thus deliberate indifference was an inappropriate standard for determining whether the officer conduct shocked the conscience.id.at.a higher degree of culpability was required because the officer was supposed to act decisively and show restraint at the same moment.id.at.
in this case,oliveira contends that the district court erred by applying rodriguez test instead of determining whether oliveira conduct shocked the conscience under lewis.we conclude that the district court did not err by applying rodriguez,as that case imposed a rule for determining when an involuntary commitment violates substantive due process that is consistent with lewis framework.in other words,a physician decision to involuntarily commit a mentally ill person because he poses a danger to himself or others shocks the conscience,thereby violating substantive due process,when the decision is based on substantive and procedural criteria that are substantially below the standards generally accepted in the medical community.rodriguez,at.the principles enunciated in lewis support our conclusion.
first,rodriguez test does not impose constitutional liability for conduct that is merely negligent.in requiring that the commitment decision be the product of criteria substantially below those generally accepted in the medical community,rodriguez imposes liability for conduct that is at least grossly negligent.lewis does not preclude liability for such culpability.see at.
oliveira contends,however,that the district court found his conduct to be no more than negligent,and thus even if rodriguez provides the applicable rule,the district court erred in applying the rule in this case.he points to the district court language granting him summary judgment on bolmer false imprisonment claim.according to oliveira,since the false imprisonment claim was based on the same conduct as the substantive due process claim,the court finding precluded liability on the latter.oliveira reads too much into the district court language.the court found that bolmer allegations could support a finding of negligence or indifference,but not malice or wantonness sufficient to overcome sovereign immunity.bolmer oliveira,d.this does not constitute a finding that bolmer allegations could show negligence but nothing more.
second,the circumstances of an involuntary commitment support the application of rodriguez test.see lewis,at.like the new york law in rodriguez,the connecticut statute governing bolmer emergency involuntary commitment requires that the decision to commit be made by a physician.see.as we stated in rodriguez,i mplicit in the statute requirement that the decision be made by a physician is the premise that the decision will be made in accordance with the standards of the medical profession.at.a substantial departure from those standards shocks the conscience because it removes any reasonable justification for intentionally depriving the person of his or her liberty.lewis,at emphasis added see also youngberg romeo,holding that a mentally disabled person could show a violation of substantive due process if the decision to deny him training and rehabilitation is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,practice,or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.
finally,the case law does not convince us that rodriguez should be overruled.the ninth circuit has adopted rodriguez objective analysis,jensen lane county,cir,and we have consistently applied it,see olivier,at hogan fox mem,wl,at cir,summary order.we are aware that other circuits have employed different analyses.see benn.health,cir explaining that,in view of the events that led to the plaintiff commitment and the steps taken after his arrival at the psychiatric hospital,the
