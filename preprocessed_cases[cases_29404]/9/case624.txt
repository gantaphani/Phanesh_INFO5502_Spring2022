judgment and opinions en banc 
this appeal having been considered by the court en banc,the judgment of the district court is affirmed by an equally divided court.the opinions that follow reflect the views of the participating judges.
the plaintiffs,all of whom were arrested in rhode island for,misdemeanors,were subjected to unconstitutional searches of their persons incident to their detention at the adult correctional institutions the aci.these searches,conducted pursuant to a longstanding institutional policy,encompassed both strip searches,visual inspections of the naked body and visual body cavity searches,inspections of the anal and genital areas after the courts struck down the strip search policy,the plaintiffs sued the state of rhode island and a number of prison officials for damages sustained as a result of the illegal intrusions.
the plaintiffs suit invoked.because the state is immune from suits for damages under section,see will.dep t of state police,d johnson rodriguez,cir,the controversy before us focuses on the liability vel non of the individual defendants.after some preliminary skirmishing,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of those defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.a panel of this court reversed that ruling,but the full court subsequently granted rehearing en banc and as is customary in such instances ordered the panel opinion withdrawn.the court now divides equally and thus affirms the district court ruling.the judges who subscribe to this opinion believe that affirmance is fully warranted upon a broad review of the preexisting law and its application to the unusual situation at the aci,we conclude that,when the underlying events occurred,prudent prison officials reasonably could have believed that rhode island strip search policy was constitutional.
background 
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we rehearse the facts in the light most sympathetic to the parties here,the plaintiffs,indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor.see,suarez pueblo int l,cir.here,however,that praxis has little bearing,for the facts upon which our decision turns are largely undisputed.
unlike other states,rhode island has no regional or county detention facilities.it operates only a single,penitentiary the aci.centrally located in cranston,rhode island,the aci comprises seven separate maximum security facilities.two of those for women and the other for all persons committed to the custody of the department of corrections regardless of the nature of their offenses.at the times material hereto,these intake facilities housed an array of prisoners ranging from newly sentenced felons to convicts under protective custody to pretrial detainees to arrestees.all of these individuals,except for detainees held in protective custody,were commingled while in various parts of the intake facilities.detainees held in protective custody used the same areas as other inmates but at different times.
during the currency of this arrangement,rhode island maintained written policies that required all new entrants into the aci,including misdemeanant arrestees,to undergo strip and body cavity searches.in,craig roberts ran afoul of this policy.local police,having made a routine stop of a motor vehicle in which roberts was a passenger,learned that the rhode island family court had issued a body functional equivalent of a writ of to him.although roberts protested that the body attachment had been withdrawn and produced what purported to be documentation to that effect,the police detained him.
in accordance with the customary procedure,the police transported roberts to the aci.upon his admission,he was twice subjected to strip and body cavity searches.these searches uncovered no drugs,weapons,or other contraband.shortly thereafter,a sheriff verified that the body attachment had been withdrawn.roberts was released.
roberts was gone but not forgotten.he brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the strip searches had violated his constitutional rights.upon for summary judgment,the district court ruled that the strip searches had offended roberts rights under the fourth amendment and enjoined the state from continuing to enforce the written policies then in effect.roberts rhode island,d,roberts i.we affirmed.roberts rhode island,cir roberts ii.
rhode island abandoned the proscribed policy from and after the date of the district court decision march.thereafter,eighteen of whom had been arrested for,misdemeanors and subjected to strip and body cavity searches prior to that a new action in the federal district court on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.in their complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their constitutional rights and sought money damages.
the suit named as defendants the state and a galaxy of prison officials.upon the defendants motion,the district court dismissed roberts claim for damages based on the doctrine of res judicata.see,allen mccurry,d stating that res judicata precludes a plaintiff from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in an earlier action against the same defendant prescinding from the same set of operative facts kale combined ins,cir same.the court thereafter entered summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs.the court reasoned that,prior to the decision in roberts i,it was not clearly established that prison officials needed some particularized suspicion before misdemeanant arrestees who were about to be introduced into the general population at a maximum security prison and,therefore,that the defendants enjoyed the protection of qualified immunity.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review orders granting summary judgment de novo.plumley container,cir.where,as here,a party entitlement to summary judgment hinges on a claim of qualified immunity,we must balance the need to vindicate constitutional rights against the need to insulate public officials from civil litigation that might unduly inhibit the assiduous discharge of their duties.see anderson creighton,d.in balancing those competing needs,we employ a algorithm.suboh dist.att y office,cir hatch dep t for children,youth and their families,cir.the threshold question is whether the plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation.hope pelzer,d saucier katz,d.the second question deals with fair warning it asks whether the law was clearly established at the time of the constitutional violation.hope,at.anderson,at.the final question is whether a reasonable official,situated similarly to the defendant s,would have understood that the conduct at issue contravened the clearly established law.saucier,at.
in this case,the first part of the algorithm need not detain us.we acknowledge that strip searches are intrusive and degrading and,therefore,should not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officers.the roberts decisions exemplify this thinking they hold unequivocally that the aci policy of persons arrested for,misdemeanors,in the absence of particularized suspicion,violated the constitution.see roberts ii,at roberts i,d at.the questions on which this appeal turns,therefore,involve the second and third branches of the qualified immunity algorithm.we must determine whether the law was clearly established,prior to march,to the effect that prison officials need at least reasonable suspicion before subjecting misdemeanant arrestees to strip searches when introducing them into the general population of a maximum security prison,and whether a reasonable prison official,situated similarly to the defendants,would have understood at that time that the policy in place at the aci transgressed the constitution.
although the bases for these determinations often overlap,the instant plaintiffs can not prevail unless we determine both questions favorably to them.thus,we begin our analysis with an examination of whether the law can be said to have been clearly established at or before the critical time march,the degree to which the law was clearly established as of a particular date is a matter for the court to determine.elder holloway,d siegert gilley,d diaz martinez,cir.
the fundamental justification for the qualified immunity defense is that public officials performing discretionary functions should be free to act without fear of punitive litigation except when they fairly can anticipate that their conduct will give rise to liability for damages.davis scherer,d.that anticipation depends,in large part,on the extent to which legal rules are clearly established.harlow fitzgerald,d.the standard is an objective one.anderson,at.iacobucci boulter,cir.it follows,then,that an inquiry into the reasonableness of an officer conduct must focus on the discernible contours of the law at the time of the alleged act or omission.hatch,at.
to attain the necessary perspective,an inquiring court must look back in time and conduct the juridical equivalent of an archeological dig.the court must canvass controlling authority in its own jurisdiction and,if none exists,attempt to fathom whether there is a consensus of persuasive authority elsewhere.see wilson layne,d brady dill,cir.
this exploration is not limited to cases directly on point.because officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,hope,at,overcoming a qualified immunity defense does not require a plaintiff to show that either the particular conduct complained of or some materially indistinguishable conduct has previously been found unlawful.see united states lanier,d mitchell forsyth,d.still,the relevant legal rights and obligations must be particularized enough that a reasonable official can be expected to extrapolate from them and conclude that a certain course of conduct will violate the law.saucier,at.consequently,if the operative legal principles are clearly established only at a level of generality so high that officials can not fairly anticipate the legal consequences of specific actions,then the requisite notice is lacking.the bottom line is that the qualified immunity defense prevails unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct is apparent.anderson,at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the degree of clarity in the law relevant to this case.in conducting our appraisal,we have endeavored to take into account all the decisional law,in and out of our own circuit,that was on the books at the time of the events in question.see lanier,at.hatch,at.
at the margins,the lines are easily plotted.on the one hand,courts long have viewed blanket strip searches as extreme intrusions upon fourth amendment rights.see,bell wolfish,d mary beth city of chicago,cir.on the other hand,security is a paramount concern in prison environments,and courts long have recognized that unpleasantly intrusive security measures,up to and including blanket strip searches,may be proper in such settings.see bell,at.bonitz fair,cir.the constitutional line that separates permissible from impermissible uses of these methods is imprecise and.in the last analysis,plotting that line requires a determination of what is reasonable under a given set of circumstances.bell,at.united states chamorro,cir.
the difficulty,of course,is that this formulation,while legally respectable,does not go very far toward curing the imprecision with which decisionmakers must grapple.this is nearly the subject matter.in the best of circumstances,t he test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.bell,at.indeed,the supreme court itself has acknowledged,in a qualified immunity case,the difficulty of determining whether particular searches or seizures comport with the fourth amendment.anderson,at.and that difficulty is compounded where,as here,the determination involves gauging whether a serious intrusion is reasonable in an incarcerative environment.see swain spinney,cir.
with these basic tenets in mind,we examine the two first circuit decisions that bear most closely on this case.neither comparison is very exact.
we start with swain.there,police arrested a woman on suspicion of narcotics possession and temporarily held her in a jail cell by herself.id.at.the officers,following institutional practice,her.id.at.we declared the strip search unconstitutional,holding that an arrestee ordinarily requires at least reasonable suspicion that the person arrested is concealing contraband or weapons.id.at.we pointed out that,in swain case,there was no basis for any such suspicion.id.at.moreover,she was being held in virtual isolation,so there was no risk that she would come in contact with other prisoners and,thus,succeed in smuggling contraband or weapons into the jail.id.at.
the plaintiffs contend that swain clearly established the law relevant to this case.it is,however,an oversimplification to say that,because we applied the reasonable suspicion standard to strip searches in a particular custodial context,the handwriting was on the wall that the same standard would apply to the aci as well.there are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an arrestee into the general population of a maximum security prison.
making this point brings us to our second decision that the defendants insist has decretory significance here.that case is arruda fair,cir breyer.there,we upheld a blanket strip search policy with regard to prison inmates.id.at.we reasoned that because the searches involved the most dangerous of prisoners as they departed from,and entered into,a particularly sensitive area of a maximum security prison,security concerns provided a compelling justification for the institution policy.id.at.
as in arruda,the defendants in this case attempt to justify their blanket strip search policy as a necessary or,at least,reasonable means of ensuring institutional security.they maintain that the unique nature of the aci intake facilities,in which arrestees are intermingled with maximum security prisoners,raises concerns similar to those raised in arruda and warrants the implementation of such a policy.this argument has considerable force,for arruda reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum security facility might receive weapons or contraband from visitors,renegade guards,or others is enough to justify a blanket strip search policy.but despite its broad language,arruda involved strip searches of convicted felons,not misdemeanant that disparity can not idly be brushed aside.
in the end,we recognize that both swain and arruda offer valuable insights,but that neither is a very exact match.while swain makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged,the factual context of the case presented rather minimal security concerns.and while arruda makes clear that institutional security needs may require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting,that case dealt not with persons arrested for relatively innocuous misdemeanors,but,rather,with hardened criminals.so long as the facts in these cases are distinguishable in a fair way from the facts at we believe that they neither of them can be said to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case.see saucier,at.
we recognized much the same point in roberts ii,at noting that t he institutional security concerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in swain,which were insufficient to support a search,and those in arruda and bell,which made searches without individual suspicion reasonable.to be sure,we ultimately placed the case on the swain side of the constitutional line.id.but our acknowledgment that the aci strip search policy fell into the gray area between swain and arruda carries more weight for present purposes than our actual holding.a holding on the merits is not dispositive on the issue of qualified immunity.see cookish powell,cir morales ramirez,cir.the law does not expect a public official,faced with the need to make an objectively reasonable judgment,to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that will be reached by a panel of federal appellate judges after briefing,arguments,and review.see wilson,at.
the plaintiffs,ably represented,go beyond swain and arruda in an effort to convince us that reasonable correctional officials should have realized the unconstitutionality of the aci strip search policy prior to march.they point to a line of cases stating that blanket strip searches of misdemeanant arrestees,conducted without particularized suspicion,are unconstitutional.see,masters crouch,cir weber dell,cir stewart lubbock county,cir giles ackerman,cir hill bogans,cir.these cases come as no surprise we cited many of them in roberts ii,at.for qualified immunity purposes,however,there are important distinctions between these cases and the case at hand.
in the first place,all the cases upon which the plaintiffs rely deal with detentions in local jails and police stations.in contrast,the case before us involves detentions in a maximum security prison.this distinction is quite meaningful the case law emphasizes that prison regulations may constitutionally impinge upon fundamental rights so long as such regulations are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.see,overton bazzetta,d turner safley,d.within the walls of a maximum security prison,the need to preserve internal security is compelling.hudson palmer,d wood clemons,cir.we think it follows that rhode island correctional officials reasonably could have regarded the stark differences between local lockups and maximum security prisons as pivotal in deciding whether a particular policy was necessary.we explain briefly.
the population of a maximum security prison tends to be much more volatile and much less transient than that of a county jail.see shain ellison,cir.thus,it is fairly debatable whether inmates in such a facility may be likely to arrange for an outsider to bring them weapons or other contraband by being arrested for a minor offense.compare,watt city of richardson police dep t,cir declaring that a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity,if not searched,to smuggle in weapons or contraband,so that such suspects is not an irrational attempt to foster security,with,walsh franco,cir declaring that the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee introducing contraband into the general jail population simply d oes not warrant a strip search of all arrestees.the debatable nature of the question argues in favor of qualified immunity.see goyco de maldonado rivera,cir stating that an official need show no more than that the question is close to prevail on his qualified immunity defense vazquez rios hernandez colon,cir noting that the closeness of the call suggests that the law could not have been clearly established.
the cases upon which the plaintiffs rely are distinguishable in yet another salient respect.those cases do not gainsay that the security concerns arising out of the intermingling of inmates are a significant counterweight in the balance that must be struck between personal rights and practical necessities.read for all they are worth,the plaintiffs cases at most deny that this counterweight is a sufficient justification in particular circumstances invariably,circumstances attending an arrestee detention at facilities such as jails and police stations.see,masters,at hill,at logan shealy,cir.given the unique features of the aci intake facilities,the composition of the inmate population,and the fact that the misdemeanant arrestees generally were not searched prior to their arrival at the aci,it was hardly unreasonable for rhode island correctional officials to calibrate the balance differently.
in point of fact,a separate line of cases has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials in addressing institutional security needs.see,overton.at procunier martinez,d hay waldron,cir see also bell,at.after all,institutional security is perhaps the most legitimate of all penological goals.overton.at accord pell procunier,d.
in an opinion that is closer to this case than any other,the second circuit upheld a policy in which a prison facility conducted random strip searches of all inmates,including pretrial detainees.see covino patrissi,cir.adverting,among other things,to the fact that the plaintiff a pretrial detainee commingled with sentenced inmates who had histories of violence and substance abuse,the court concluded that the prison policy was a reasonable response to the officials concerns id.at.
the short of the matter is that,throughout the last quarter of the twentieth century,courts had pursued two divergent lines of precedent.this case,as we said in roberts ii,at,fell along neither axis,but,rather,into the tenebrious middle.we are mindful that there is a distinction for qualified immunity purposes between an unconstitutional but objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act.saucier,at.anderson,at.here,the lack of any direct precedent and the undulating contours of the law during the relevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional violation was not obvious the defendants reasonably could have thought,prior to roberts i,that there was room in the law for the aci strip search policy.
the plaintiffs pose one last challenge to the assertion of a qualified immunity defense.they note that,rather than all arrestees,officials at the aci could have employed less extreme measures such as conducting searches or segregating misdemeanant arrestees from the rest of the prison population.in support of this view,they point to our conclusion that the search policy was almost entirely unnecessary to control the entry of contraband into the aci.see roberts ii,at.but this too involves a judgment call.in the relevant time frame,some cases indicated that blanket strip searches are never constitutional when the security needs they address could be met by less intrusive means,giles,at sostre preiser,cir.other cases suggested that the availability of less intrusive means is irrelevant to the analysis so long as officials reasonably could have concluded that such measures were more burdensome and less efficacious than blanket strip searches.see,bell,at.hay,at blackburn snow,cir see also turner,at.emphasizing that prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the claimant constitutional complaint given this split in authority,we find that the law on this matter was also not clearly established.therefore,the defendants reasonably could have believed until the federal court declared rhode island blanket strip search policy unconstitutional that they were under no legal obligation to resort to alternative measures.
our brethren suggest that we require an exact match with the facts of previously decided cases before we will deny a defendant the shield of qualified immunity.that is simply not so.what is so is that t he meaning of reasonableness of a search for fourth amendment purposes is highly situational and requires a balancing of the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.wood,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the cases that our brethren cite in an effort to show that reasonable suspicion was clearly established as a condition precedent to a strip search of a person in custody are no more on point than the cases,cited above,that authorize various exceptions to that generality.given this cacophony of voices,a reasonable prison official,faced with the novel factual situation that confronted those who were in charge of the aci,had no way of knowing which voice should guide him in drawing the fourth amendment balance.it is the absence of clear guidance,not the absence of a perfect precedential match,that makes qualified immunity appropriate here.
in this regard,our colleagues reprove us for attributing significant weight both to the dangers inherent in commingling violent felons with misdemeanant arrestees and to distinctions between jails and maximum security prisons.we plead guilty to that charge.but we attach weight to those factors because of our respect for those who must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings.correctional officials charged with the operation of maximum security prisons have an unenviable courts should be reluctant casually to impose on them personal liability for damages in the absence of standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with a fair prospect of surviving judicial months and years later.atwater city of lago vista,d.
to sum up,the district court mortally wounded the aci blanket strip search policy in roberts i,and we administered the last rites in roberts ii.that policy is now dead and buried.while we have found the defendants resolution of the fourth amendment balance incorrect,see roberts ii,at,we conclude that,given the mixed signals sent by the case law,the difficulties inherent in fourth amendment balancing in the prison context,the special features of the aci,and the wide berth called for by the qualified immunity doctrine,the defendants,prior to march,reasonably could have believed the aci policy to be both justified and constitutional.put another way,the defendants did not have fair warning,prior to march,that their conduct was unlawful.if judges can span the spectrum on this sort of constitutional question,it would certainly be unfair to hold the defendants liable for doing nothing more blameworthy than guessing incorrectly about how the courts ultimately would resolve the issue.see wilson,at.
iii.conclusion 
we need go no further.this is a close case,but we do not require public officials to foretell the course of constitutional law with absolute accuracy in order to obtain the balm of qualified immunity.id.at.to the contrary,the doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to protect all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.concluding,as we do,that the law as it existed when the events at issue occurred did not clearly establish that the aci policy authorizing blanket strip and body cavity searches violated the plaintiffs fourth amendment rights,we would uphold the entry of summary judgment in the defendants favor on the basis of qualified immunity.
the defendants in this case were granted qualified immunity because,according to the district court,the law did not clearly establish that reasonable suspicion was needed to strip search people arrested for,related minor offenses.our four respected colleagues agree with this analysis.we do not.the opinion of our colleagues is wrong on the law,the logic that they adopt is at odds with recent supreme court precedent regarding qualified immunity,and we believe their reasoning will put constitutional rights at risk.
it is important to keep in mind what we are dealing with in this case.the strip searches conducted here are perhaps the greatest personal indignity searching officials can visit upon an individual.blackburn snow,cir quoting bell wolfish,d.according to rhode island written policies,these searches included a visual examination of the groin and rectum.male arrestees were required to lift their penises and testicles on the officer command to provide a clear view of the groin area.both male and female arrestees were required to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.moreover,these searches were conducted against harmless individuals.all of the plaintiffs in this case were arrested for,related minor offenses.by way of example,one of the plaintiffs,george barber,loaned his car to his son in and the son received a traffic ticket that was never paid.six years later,barber was arrested because of the unpaid ticket,held at the adult correctional institutions the aci overnight and strip searched twice.another plaintiff,stephanie clark,called police for assistance after an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check showed an outstanding arrest warrant for her failure to appear at a probation review.clark had already finished her probation and the warrant was issued in error.she was taken to the aci and strip searched twice.
with these facts in mind,we turn to the legal issues in this case.we begin with whether it was the clearly established law in this circuit,as of march,that prison officials needed reasonable suspicion to strip search,related minor offense arrestees one tried and true way of determining whether a right was clearly established is to ask whether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that their conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.suboh dist.attorney office of the suffolk,cir.our colleagues describe this inquiry as an archeological dig,yet focus on only the top and bottom layers of the excavation.see swain spinney,cir arruda fair,cir.our colleagues choose to ignore the cases that lie in the layers in between,thereby omitting consideration of relevant precedent.a proper qualified immunity analysis requires a court to look at all available case law.hatch dep t for children,youth and their families,cir.we will therefore briefly trace the development of this circuit reasonable suspicion standard as it applies to strip searches.
the place to start is the supreme court decision in bell wolfish,d.in that case,the court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees who had contact with prison visitors.id.at.in doing so,the court conducted an analysis that balanced the need for the searches against the invasion of personal rights.id.although the court said that the practice of strip searching individuals instinctively gives us the most pause,it found the searches constitutional because of the security needs of the prison,the realistic possibility that contraband could pass from visitor to detainee.id.at.but the court was clear to delineate the scope of its holding 
w e deal here with the question whether visual inspections can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates,we conclude that they can.
id.at emphasis in original.in other words,bell established the ceiling it made clear that prison officials did not necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial detainees.but bell left the floor undefined.still unanswered was the question of whether prison officials needed any level of particularized suspicion that detainees were carrying contraband or weapons or in a position to receive them from others before conducting strip searches.
our early cases applying bell to the prison environment dealt largely with situations involving prison visitors.in one of our first prison visitor cases,blackburn snow,cir,we held that 
t he constitution requires a more particularized level of suspicion to justify the humiliating and intrusive searches conducted here.while we need not define here precisely what level of individualized suspicion is required a rule unabashedly requiring none can not be reconciled with the fourth amendment.
id.at see also cochrane quattrocchi,cir.it is also noteworthy that we surveyed the legal landscape as it existed at the time and grouped arrestees into the category of strip search scenarios in which particularized suspicion was necessary.see blackburn,at.this grouping was merely a foreshadowing of things to come.
in wood clemons,cir,we clarified that the level of particularized suspicion required before subjecting prison visitors to strip searches was reasonable suspicion.id.at.we said that a strip search can not be justified absent some quantum of individualized suspicion.in determining the level of individualized suspicion courts have converged upon one common benchmark the standard of reasonable suspicion.id.at emphasis in original citations omitted.
our cases addressing the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of strip and visual body cavity searches were not limited to prison visitors.we required reasonable suspicion for strip searches at border crossings.see united states,cir.and most significantly for this case,we held in swain spinney,cir,that there must be reasonable suspicion to conduct strip searches of arrestees.id.at.
in swain,we examined our prior cases dealing with prison visitors and border searches,as well as relevant cases from other circuits.we concluded that it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.id.this ruling was consistent with cases from numerous other circuits 
our brethren mischaracterize the holding in swain.they paraphrase swain as holding that reasonable suspicion is ordinarily required for arrestees and that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged.we respectfully disagree with our colleagues description of swain holding.swain holding is clear and unqualified.swain does not say that reasonable suspicion is only sometimes required.rather than paraphrase the words of swain,we shall quote its holding directly a strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified,at the least,by a reasonable suspicion.at.it is hard to imagine a more clear statement of the law.
our colleagues fail to mention that swain contained another holding that is especially relevant to this case.when analyzing the issue of qualified immunity we stated 
furthermore,while some courts have suggested that a higher standard may be necessary to justify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection,it was clearly established at the time of the search may,that the fourth amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of searches.
id.emphasis in original.this ruling too was in accord with decisions by other circuits 
in short,swain states unequivocally that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees and that this requirement was clearly established as early as,well before the dates in question here.these rulings were in conformity with circuits across the country.
despite this overwhelming precedent,our colleagues claim that swain holdings could not have given the defendants fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would apply to them.they say that swain involved an arrestee who was held alone in a single cell,whereas the plaintiffs in this case were commingled with other prisoners.admittedly,our precedent does not speak to commingling specifically.but that fact does not mean that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.see hatch,at although o ur own precedents are inconclusive,the law was clearly established by an emerging body of decisional law outside our own circuit.commingling may not always pose a security risk.it is not commingling,per se,that presents a security problem it is commingling that involves a risk of illegal traffic among the commingled inmates.
as early as blackburn,we rejected the argument that the security needs of a prison can,standing alone,properly justify the complete withdrawal of fourth amendment rights from all who enter a prison.at emphasis in original see also logan,at an indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees can not be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.
cases from other circuits are more explicit in rejecting the commingling argument advanced by the defendants most notable is the sixth circuit holding in masters crouch,cir 
t he fact of intermingling with other prison inmates alone has never been found to justify such a search without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons or other contraband into the institution.
id.at.in short,the cases from other circuits,when read in conjunction with our own precedent,would not permit a reasonable prison official to conclude that minor offense arrestees could be strip searched without reasonable suspicion simply because the prison officials decide to mix the arrestees with other prisoners.
our colleagues say that swain could not have provided fair warning for another reason.according to our brethren,swain,as well as the cases from other circuits upon which it relied,involved local jails rather than prisons,like the aci.the distinction between jails and maximum security prisons is a crucial leg upon which our colleagues opinion rests.it is here that their incomplete archeological excavation which we mentioned earlier becomes important.the cases that our colleagues ignored involved the early development of our reasonable suspicion standard as it applied to strip searches of prison visitors.at issue in those cases were both jails and prisons.see wood,at prison blackburn,at county jail.
even more relevant is the fact that one of those cases dealt with the aci.see cochrane,at.in cochrane,we vacated a judgment granting directed verdicts for aci officials defending the strip search of an inmate daughter.we said that 
a bsent any evidence that appellant ever violated a prison visitation rule,or even supplied cochrane with drugs,a reasonable juror could have concluded that cochrane contraband drugs were supplied by prison officials or other inmates.thus,the jury could have found that the strip search of appellant was unreasonable because it was based on no individualized suspicion.
id.at emphasis in original.our colleagues maintain that the defendants were justified in believing that no reasonable suspicion was required in this case in part because the defendants must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings.yet the same setting and security considerations were not enough to defeat the requirement for individualized suspicion in cochrane.we do not understand on what legal basis our colleagues can now say that those same security needs made the defendants unconstitutional strip searches reasonable.certainly the defendants had fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would be applied to them because,in fact,they had already been held to that standard in the past.
of course,one difference between cochrane and the present case is that cochrane involved prison visitors,not minor offense arrestees.but this fact does not help the defendants if anything,it further highlights why the defendants had fair warning that their strip search policies were unreasonable.
the supreme court has explained that prison visitors invite a host of security problems because they can pass weapons and contraband to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.block rutherford,d.it is well recognized,however,that individuals arrested for,related minor offenses do not present the same security risk as prison visitors.see roberts ii,at giles,at.this is because arrests,unlike visits,are not planned events.they are random and do not afford an arrestee the opportunity to hatch a scheme to smuggle contraband into a prison.as the second circuit has explained 
it is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily orifices.unlike persons already in jail who receive contact visits,arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide something.for the example,a person who is allowed to visit the bathroom unescorted before an suspicion may well exist.
shain ellison,cir.our brethren overlook the important fact that the court in bell authorized strip searches of detainees only after the detainees had come into contact with prison visitors.see at.the present case involves people brought to the aci because they were arrested,sometimes mistakenly as the record reveals,for,related minor offenses.they did not come into contact with prison visitors.
our colleagues concoct a hypothetical situation in which an inmate arranges for an outsider to bring weapons or contraband inside the prison by staging an incident that would lead to the outsider being arrested for a minor offense.with due respect,this is chimerical.the only case our colleagues have exhumed to support their scenario is watt city of richardson police dep t,cir.they claim watt stands for the idea that a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity,if not searched,to smuggle weapons or contraband.id.at.the very next sentence from watt,however,shows that the quote upon which they rely is applicable only to those arrestees charged with weapons,shoplifting or drug offenses or those with a history of such offenses.see id.limiting the searches generally to those offenders charged with o
