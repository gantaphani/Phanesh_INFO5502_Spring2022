sandra hicks brought this employment discrimination action against the secretary of homeland security,claiming that the secretary failed to promote her to the position of housing manager in the united states coast guard housing office at air station cape cod on account of her race and gender.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment,finding that hicks failed to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the secretary reason for choosing another candidate.prior to granting summary judgment,the court also denied hicks motion to reopen discovery.
in response to hicks appeal,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying hicks motion to reopen discovery.we also agree that hicks failed to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of pretext.we therefore affirm.
hicks,an african american woman,has been a civil service government employee for over twenty years.a majority of her service has been in the united states coast guard housing office at air station cape cod,located on the otis air force base.the housing office staff consists of one housing manager and approximately six subordinates.before the events at issue here took place in,hicks had served nine years in the housing office in two years as housing management assistant and three as off base housing management specialist.the general schedule gs levels of those positions were gs and gs respectively 
in late,hicks supervisor,evelyn norton,announced her retirement from the housing manager position.the official job posting for norton replacement listed,among others,the following required qualification one year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the gs level or or equivalent doctoral degree or full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree.a list was compiled of the candidates eligible for merit promotion to the position.the top two candidates were hicks and terry krout,a white man who was serving in the same office as a housing inspector.krout was a retired chief warrant officer in the united states coast guard who had entered civil service in.when the housing manager position became available in,krout had been serving as a gs housing specialist for approximately years.his primary responsibility in that position was inspecting housing units.
a panel consisting of coast guard commander paul rendon,area housing officer kevin sullivan,and director of morale,wellbeing,and recreation bruce blackman was charged with making a recommendation to commander john newby who would ultimately make the promotion decision the panel interviewed the top two and krout.during the interviews,the candidates were asked the same twenty questions and the interviewers independently scored the interviewees answers to each question on a scale with being the highest the scores for all of the questions were then added up to produce total interview scores for each candidate.the result was a split decision.commander rendon scored the interview for krout by a margin of.sullivan scored the interview for hicks by a margin of.blackman scored the interview for krout by a margin of.tallying all these scores,krout had and hicks.on that basis the panel recommended krout for promotion.commander newby adopted that recommendation.
commander rendon met with hicks in person to communicate the promotion decision and discuss the reasoning behind it.hicks was understandably disappointed,and she was offended by commander rendon suggestion that she should have practiced her interview skills beforehand.after exhausting her administrative remedies,hicks commenced this action on august,alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of race and gender.
after proceeding pro se through the discovery period,hicks retained attorney richard reiling,who entered an appearance on january,on the eve of the deadline for responding to the secretary motion for summary judgment.hicks also moved on that same date to reopen discovery pursuant to rule d or,in the alternative,to extend the summary judgment opposition deadline by days.on february,having heard oral argument from the parties,the district court issued the following order the court will not reopen discovery but,in order to give plaintiff counsel sufficient time to familiarize himself with the case and prepare a response,will extend by days the deadline to oppose defendant motion for summary judgment.
after obtaining an additional extension,hicks filed her opposition to summary judgment on march.the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment in an order dated may.this appeal followed.

denial of d motion 
rule d allows,in certain circumstances,for supplemental discovery after a motion for summary judgment has been filed.see.d.we have previously cautioned that rule d relief is not to be granted as a matter of course.ayala gerena,at.as we have explained 
to benefit from the protections of rule d,a litigant ordinarily must furnish the nisi prius court with a timely statement if not by affidavit,then in some other authoritative manner that i explains his or her current inability to adduce the facts essential to filing an opposition,ii provides a plausible basis for believing that the facts can be assembled within a reasonable time,and iii indicates how those facts would influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.

hicks decision to seek supplemental discovery shortly after retaining counsel is understandable.as a pro se litigant,she likely had little understanding of the discovery process and had not conducted any depositions.the secretary had already made affidavits from commander rendon,commander newby,blackman,and sullivan part of the record at the time of her motion,as well as a significant amount of documentary evidence.specifically,in addition to requesting an opportunity to conduct depositions of those individuals,hicks sought to depose krout,who was awarded the position over her,and norton,her former supervisor.neither of those individuals were involved in the process on the promotion at issue.hicks did not specify the evidence that she expected to obtain from any of this additional discovery.
hicks request to reopen discovery came late in the process.she also sought vague information from deponents,some of whom were not even relevant to her case.furthermore,it is far from clear that the requested depositions of the decisionmakers would yield any useful information beyond what was in their affidavits.the district court,while sympathetic to hicks situation
