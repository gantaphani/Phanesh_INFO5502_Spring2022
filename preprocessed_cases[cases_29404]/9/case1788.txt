opinion of the court 
antonio torres,a former state prisoner who is no longer in custody within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute appeals the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing his action,which alleged,inter alia,that his due process rights were violated when he was sanctioned for violating prison rules.the sanctions imposed on torres did not revoke any credits or otherwise affect the fact or length of his confinement he was placed in disciplinary detention for days and administrative custody for days.yet the district court ruled that his due process claim was not cognizable under because of the favorable termination rule announced in heck humphrey,d,and extended to prison disciplinary sanctions that alter the duration of a prisoner incarceration in edwards balisok,d.under that rule,a plaintiff can not seek damages for harm caused by actions the unlawfulness of which would necessarily render the fact or length of his confinement invalid,unless he can prove that the conviction,sentence,or prison disciplinary sanction that resulted from those actions has been reversed,invalidated,or called into question by a grant of federal habeas corpus relief in other words,terminated favorably to the plaintiff.heck,at.edwards,at.
torres appeal presents a question that neither the supreme court nor our court has decided whether someone no longer in custody and thus unable to petition for a writ of habeas corpus can seek damages under for an allegedly unconstitutional prison disciplinary sanction that did not affect the fact or length of his confinement.we hold that the favorable termination rule does not apply to claims that implicate only the conditions,and not the fact or duration,of a prisoner incarceration.we thus hold that the district court erred in ruling that torres due process claim is not cognizable under.
nonetheless,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on a different ground.the sanctions imposed on torres were within the scope of his sentence and,under sandin conner,d,and our recent decision in fraise terhune,cir,did not impinge a liberty interest protected by the constitution due process clause.
factual and procedural history 
on july,torres,a former inmate at new jersey bayside state prison bsp,appeared before the bsp classification committee the committee while still in prison.the committee informed torres that it had granted him full minimum status,which in this instance meant placement in a minimum security prison for a work detail.that minimum security prison,known as the farm unit,is located outside the walls surrounding the main prison at bsp.
after leaving the committee,torres,a paranoid schizophrenic,entered a delusional state and became convinced that placement in the farm unit would harm him.he asked defendant percy garner,the prison guard escorting him from the committee hearing,if he could return to the committee and ask for reconsideration of his reassignment.after his request was denied,torres informed garner that if he was reassigned to the farm unit he would try to escape.garner authored a disciplinary report based on torres statement,charging him with violating new jersey administrative code a attempting to plan an escape.as a result,torres was placed in detention.he subsequently requested and received a consultation with defendant lisa little,the staff psychologist,who determined that he was mentally fit for the general prison population.
on july,defendant lance meehan,a hearing officer,conducted a disciplinary hearing with regard to the escape charge against torres.meehan found torres guilty of attempting to plan an escape,sentenced him to days of disciplinary detention and days of administrative segregation,and referred him for a psychological evaluation.meehan did not revoke any of torres credits.
torres appealed meehan decision to defendants calvin neubert and conrad dilks,the prison administrators,who affirmed it.torres did not appeal to the new jersey superior court,appellate division,as permitted under new jersey court rule a 
on december,torres was released from custody.a year and a half later,he filed a pro se action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,alleging that the defendants acted unlawfully in connection with the disciplinary decision he subsequently retained counsel and filed an amended complaint on june.in that complaint,torres alleged that william fauver the commissioner of the new jersey department of corrections,meehan,neubert,and dilks violated his right to due process because he was found guilty of the disciplinary charge and sanctioned even though the charge was not supported by substantial evidence.he also alleged eighth amendment violations that are not pertinent here.
on january,the defendants moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fauver,meehan,neubert,and dilks on torres due process claim,and denied torres for summary judgment against meehan.the court relied on edwards balisok,d,to find that torres claim was not cognizable because its success necessarily would imply the invalidity of the disciplinary decision to place him in detention and administrative segregation.in addition,the court dismissed torres eighth amendment claims against all of the defendants except neubert and dilks.after further discovery,on june,the court granted summary judgment in favor of neubert and dilks on the remaining claims.torres filed a timely notice of appeal,and we subsequently appointed pro bono counsel for him 
torres sole claim on appeal is that the district court erred in concluding that the favorable termination rule bars a former prisoner from using to challenge a prison disciplinary sanction that did not affect the length of his confinement.we have jurisdiction under.

iii.section and prison disciplinary sanctions 
whether torres due process claim is cognizable under raises two separate questions whether the favorable termination rule applies to prison disciplinary sanctions that do not affect the fact or length of a prisoner confinement,and,more generally,whether the rule applies to persons who can not seek habeas relief.only if both questions are answered affirmatively does the favorable termination rule bar torres claim if the answer to either question is no,his claim is cognizable.
with respect to the first question,the supreme court has consistently distinguished between claims that necessarily implicate the fact or duration of confinement which it has repeatedly held are subject to the favorable termination rule and claims that relate only to the conditions of incarceration which it has not suggested are subject to the favorable termination rule.edwards balisok,d heck humphrey,d preiser rodriguez,d.this line of cases instructs,and all but one of the circuit courts to consider the issue have held,that both current and former prisoners can use to raise claims relating only to the conditions,and not the fact or duration,of their confinement without satisfying the favorable termination rule.because torres raises such a claim and thus the answer to the first question above is no,we need not consider the second,broader question of whether the favorable termination rule applies to persons unable to petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
in preiser,the first case to address the overlap between and the federal habeas laws,state prisoners deprived of credits as a result of disciplinary proceedings sought restoration of the credits,which would have resulted in their immediate release,under.at.the supreme court held that in light of the specific federal remedy provided by,the prisoners request for injunctive relief was not cognizable under the broad language of.id.at.the court explained that state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement must proceed in federal court under the habeas laws,which expressly require exhaustion of adequate state remedies,and may not use to circumvent this requirement id.at.however,the court emphasized that a action is a proper remedy for a state prisoner who is making a constitutional challenge to the conditions of his prison life,but not to the fact or length of his custody.id.at.
damages are not available in habeas proceedings,so preiser left open whether a prisoner can use a damages action to challenge the constitutionality of his conviction.the supreme court addressed this issue in heck,where a state prisoner sought not speedier,alleging that his conviction was obtained through unlawful investigatory practices and the destruction of exculpatory evidence.at.it held that the prisoner had no cause of action under because the success of his suit would effectively invalidate his underlying conviction and sentence.id.at.the court reasoned that the prisoner action was analogous to the tort of malicious prosecution,an essential element of which is that the prosecution terminated in the accused favor.id.at.this requirement eliminates the potential for conflicting resolutions arising from parallel civil and criminal proceedings,and prevents a prisoner from mounting a collateral attack on his conviction.id.citations omitted.
the heck court concluded that the principle that civil tort actions can not be used to undermine outstanding criminal judgments applies to damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,just as it has always applied to actions for malicious prosecution.id.at.heck thus adopted the favorable termination rule if the success of a damages suit would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,the plaintiff claim is cognizable only if he can prove that his conviction or sentence was reversed,invalidated,or called into question by a grant of federal habeas corpus relief.id.at.emphasis added on the other hand,if the district court determines that the plaintiff action,even if successful,will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff,the action should be allowed to proceed,in the absence of some other bar to the suit.id.at.footnotes omitted emphasis in original 
in edwards,the supreme court applied heck favorable termination rule to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect the duration of a prisoner incarceration.the case involved a state prisoner who lost days of credits and was placed in restrictive settings isolation for days,segregation for after a hearing officer found him guilty of violating prison rules.at.alleging that the officer was biased against him and dishonestly suppressed exculpatory evidence,the prisoner sought declaratory relief and damages under.id.at.in contrast to heck,where the prisoner directly attacked the constitutionality of his conviction,the prisoner in edwards did not seek restoration of his credits,and thus did not request relief that would alter the term of his confinement.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that his claims were not cognizable under because t he principal procedural defect he alleged the bias of the hearing officer would,if established,necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his credits.id.at.importantly,nothing in edwards indicates that the favorable termination rule would have applied if the prisoner sanction had not affected the duration of his confinement.indeed,the court carefully framed the question presented as whether a claim for damages and declaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging the validity of the procedures used to deprive him of credits is cognizable under.id.at.
other circuit courts decisions and a recent ruling by our court show that the favorable termination rule does not apply to prison disciplinary sanctions that affect only the conditions,and not the fact or duration,of a prisoner confinement.in brown plaut,the circuit held that a prisoner could seek damages under for allegedly being placed in administrative segregation without due process id.at.the court explained that t he supreme court has never deviated from preiser clear line between challenges to the fact or length of custody and challenges to the conditions of confinement.id.at.it noted that edwards repeatedly characteriz ed the plaintiff claim as one that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his credits and that heck observed that the damages action in that case was in effect an attack on the fact or length of confinement.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also anyanwutaku moore,holding that a prisoner claim that prison officials miscalculated his parole eligibility date was cognizable under because parole decisions are entirely discretionary and the success of the claim thus would not necessarily accelerate the prisoner release 
similarly,in jenkins haubert,cir,the second circuit held that a prisoner could seek damages and injunctive relief under for being sentenced to keeplock,a particularly strict form of administrative segregation,allegedly in violation of due process id.at.the court agreed with the circuit that heck and edwards do not bar a prisoner from using to challenge a prison disciplinary sanction that did not affect the fact or length of his confinement.id.at.the second circuit explained that preiser assumed that prisoners could challenge being placed in disciplinary segregation under,and that neither heck nor edwards suggested that the favorable termination rule applies when the fact or duration of a prisoner incarceration is not implicated id.
the seventh circuit joined the second and circuits in dewalt carter,cir,holding that a state prisoner could seek damages under for being subjected to a disciplinary sanction that cost him his prison job,allegedly based on his race and in retaliation for activities protected by the first amendment.id.at.the court explained that,unlike preiser,heck,and edwards,the prisoner claims did not relate to the fact or duration of his confinement id.at accord sheldon hundley,cir stating in dicta that prisoners who challenge disciplinary rulings that do not lengthen their sentence are probably outside the habeas statute and able to seek damages under without showing favorable termination.
most recently,we held in leamer fauver,cir,that a sex offender incarcerated indefinitely at a specialized treatment center could bring a suit alleging that state officials violated his constitutional rights by placing him on restrictive status and depriving him of therapy id.at.we explained that the favorable termination rule applies only if a prisoner claim necessarily implicates the fact or duration of his confinement.id.at.although the disciplinary sanction prevented the offender from obtaining treatment that might expedite his release,it did not necessarily affect the length of his incarceration,and thus heck and edwards did not apply.id.at 
in this context,we hold that torres due process claim is cognizable under.preiser concluded that a prisoner may use to attack the conditions of his prison life,at,and both heck and edwards adhered to preiser clear line between challenges to the fact or length of custody and challenges to the conditions of confinement.brown,at.the favorable termination rule does not apply when a prisoner claims can implicate only the conditions,and not the fact or duration,of his confinement.this is regardless whether he remains in custody,as in leamer,at,and dewalt,at,or is no longer in custody,as in jenkins,at,and brown,at.torres claim challenges the procedures by which he was sentenced to disciplinary detention and administrative segregation.because these punishments did not alter the length of his incarceration,the success of his claim would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the fact or duration of his confinement.edwards,at.heck,at.thus the district court erred in concluding that the
