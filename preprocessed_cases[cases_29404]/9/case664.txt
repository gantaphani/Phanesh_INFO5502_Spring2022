this matter comes on before this court on bean appeal from the district court order entered november,denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the order of the district court and uphold the jury verdict in favor of eileen crowley.
background 
we briefly describe the facts at the outset,but discuss them in greater detail where applicable and essential to explain our determinations.since,crowley has worked for bean,a major catalog retailer based in freeport,maine,specializing in outdoor apparel and merchandise.in,she began working as an order picker operator in bean warehouses and in this capacity drove machines called transtackers that collect merchandise for packing and shifting.crowley claims that from until july,her,paul juhl,stalked and harassed her.
evidence at trial supported a conclusion that during the period involved,juhl engaged in disturbing and sometimes peculiar behavior around crowley,including grabbing her foot and massaging it against her will at an bean pool party,continually following her at work even when they were not scheduled to work in the same warehouse,physically blocking her path and thereby forcing her to squeeze by him,giving her gifts designed to let her know that he was watching her,dancing in the aisles near her,waiting in the dark for her to come upon him,following her home,and even breaking into her house.crowley reported most of these incidents to her team leaders or supervisors,but she claims that bean did not take timely effective action to protect her from juhl and therefore maintained a hostile work environment.bean finally terminated juhl employment,but did so only after crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against juhl in july.
on december,crowley filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the maine human rights commission,claiming that bean had engaged in sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,and the maine human rights act.ann.tit,west.after the eeoc issued a letter and the maine human rights commission determined that bean had not engaged in either sex discrimination or retaliation,crowley filed her complaint in the district court on june,asserting that bean had engaged in sex discrimination in violation of title vii and the maine human rights act predicated on her assertion that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment.
the jury trial began on june,and concluded on june,bean moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.at the conclusion of crowley and renewed the motion after both parties rested.before submitting the case to the jury,the court partially granted the motion but only as to crowley claim for punitive damages under the maine human rights act.
after one day of deliberations,the jury returned its verdict on june,finding that bean had violated title vii by sexually discriminating against crowley through acts occurring on or after february.the february,date was critical because crowley filed her eeoc claim days after that date and she was required to file the charge within the period for it to be timely the jury also found that the unlawful discrimination was the result of a systemic violation,but not of a serial violation.the jury found,however,that bean had not violated the maine human rights act by sexually discriminating against crowley through acts occurring on or after june.the june,date was applicable because the maine human rights act has a statute of limitations,and crowley initiated this action on june.see.ann.tit,c west.finally,the jury awarded crowley in compensatory damages,but denied her any punitive damages.
on june,bean filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to.and.on november,the district court denied the motion and entered an amended final judgment.on december,bean filed a notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and,and we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
standard of review 
to the extent that bean appeals from the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,our review of the district court ruling is plenary,and we must apply the same standard that the district court applied in considering the motion.see mangla brown,cir.accordingly,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to crowley,drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,we must resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.united states scharon,cir.
our review,however,is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,for we must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see also white dep t of,cir once a jury returns a verdict,a heavy burden is placed on one who challenges it.indeed,we should not set aside a jury verdict as a matter of law unless there was only one conclusion the jury could have reached,mcmillan,at,and that result was contrary to the verdict,see white,at we may reverse only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.
bean argues that in the event that we do not grant it judgment as a matter of law,we should grant it a new trial based on juror bias,erroneous evidentiary rulings,and improper jury instructions.bean motion for a new trial in the district court predicated on juror bias was committed to the discretion of the district court.mcdonough power,greenwood,d.therefore,i n reviewing the district court denial of appellant request for a new trial,we consider only whether the district court abused its discretion.dall coffin,cir.

iii.discussion 
judgment as a matter of law 
bean challenges the jury verdict as to both crowley hostile work environment claim and her systemic sex discrimination claim.it contends that crowley failed to present sufficient evidence to support either of the jury findings.crowley argues,however,that bean has not met its demanding burden of demonstrating that no reasonable jury,presented with the evidence adduced at trial,could have found bean liable for maintaining a hostile work environment and committing a systemic violation.
hostile work environment claim 
title vii of the civil rights act of provides,in relevant part,that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.the supreme court has stated that t he phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.harris forklift,d some internal quotation marks omitted quoting meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated.oncale sundowner offshore,d internal quotation marks omitted quoting harris,at.at.
to prove a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment,a plaintiff must establish 
that she or he is a member of a protected class that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment that the harassment was based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment and create an abusive work environment that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been established.
city of providence,cir.bean asserts that crowley presented insufficient evidence at trial to satisfy three elements of her hostile work environment,that crowley perceived juhl behavior as subjectively abusive,that juhl conduct was severe and pervasive,and that bean knew or should have known about juhl alleged harassment,but failed to take prompt or appropriate action to remedy the situation.br.of appellant at.
before addressing the specifics of each claim,however,it is important to point out that bean predicates its argument on two critical suppositions title vii administrative filing requirements precluded the jury from considering allegations of harassment that occurred before february,and the jury verdict on the state law claim established that crowley was not harassed after june.thus,bean effectively seeks to cabin crowley claim to the end that it is based only on events occurring during a period.bean then argues that the handful of incidents that occurred during that period between february,and june,are insufficient to support the jury verdict.br.of appellant at.
the supreme court recent decision in national railroad passenger morgan,d,severely undermines bean argument.in morgan,the court held that consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim,including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period,is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability,so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.id.at.the court explained that a hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.id.at.thus,p rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.id.
therefore,in the wake of morgan,the jury not only could consider juhl conduct prior to february,as relevant background evidence,united air lines,evans,d,but also could hold bean liable for the alleged acts of harassment that fell outside the period for filing an eeoc charge of sexual discrimination provided that it found that there was an act contributing to the hostile environment within the filing period notwithstanding the thrust of bean argument that crowley allegations of harassment included only a few brief encounters between her and juhl that were scarcely threatening,br.of appellant at,crowley offered evidence at trial establishing that juhl harassment began in the fall of and continued into july,and thus bean argument is flawed.consequently,we must review all such evidence offered at trial when determining whether the jury verdict is supported by the evidence.
as we have indicated,bean also asserts that we must disregard any evidence of sexual harassment on or after june,because the jury found that it had not violated the maine human rights act by sexually discriminating against her by acts occurring on or after that date.although this evidence appears to be of limited significance inasmuch as crowley alleges only a few incidents of alleged harassment by juhl after june,bean is wrong on this point,too.in basing its argument on the portion of the jury verdict that bean had not sexually discriminated against crowley on or after june,bean assumes that the jury concluded that the hostile work environment ceased to exist on june.
but the jury determination that bean was not liable for maintaining a hostile work environment under the state statute based solely on incidents that occurred on or after june does not mean that the jury,therefore,this court from considering any evidence relating to juhl conduct when determining bean liability under title vii.as crowley argues in her brief,t he fact that the number of incidents from june forward do not constitute a violation of state law by themselves has no logical connection to whether those incidents can be considered,together with earlier incidents,under federal law.br.of appellee at.
moreover,bean draws too many conclusions from the jury verdict.for instance,the jury may have found for bean on the state law claim because it concluded that crowley had not satisfied the employer liability element of the hostile work environment claim perhaps because it decided that bean finally took appropriate remedial measures to end the hostile work environment on or after june,not because the jury believed that crowley failed to prove that juhl conduct on or after june,was severe or pervasive.in other words,the jury may have believed that crowley was subject to a hostile work environment on or after june,but that bean nevertheless should not be held liable for juhl conduct on or after that date.because we have no way of knowing the jury reason for rendering its verdict on the state law claim,bean argument that we can not consider evidence relating to events on or after june,must fail.therefore,we will consider all of the evidence offered at trial regarding juhl harassment from the fall of through july of in determining whether the evidence supports the jury verdict that bean maintained a hostile work environment.
subjectively abusive 
bean first argues that the jury verdict should be overturned because crowley did not offer any evidence demonstrating that juhl conduct was subjectively abusive.it asserts that s ince crowley did not believe that juhl was sexually harassing her until june,crowley did not subjectively believe that she was being subjected to a hostile work environment during the statutory period.br.of appellant at citations to the record omitted.bean seizes on the june,date because crowley testified that until that date,she thought the team leaders adequately were taking care of the juhl situation and therefore she had no complaints regarding what bean was doing.
we reject this argument,as bean misapprehends what crowley was required to subjectively perceive.as crowley points out in her brief,although the victim must subjectively perceive the harasser conduct to be hostile or abusive,the victim need not subjectively believe that the conduct met the legal definition of unlawful sexual harassment.see br.of appellee at.at trial,crowley testified that she was frightened and feared for her safety because juhl was stalking her.see tr,she was scared she was scared to death,she was shaking she was breaking down she felt real shaky inside she was r eally upset she felt like she was going to get hurt.furthermore,crowley offered into evidence a copy of bean written warning to juhl,in which it informed juhl that he has created a hostile environment in which crowley felt physically threatened.app.
therefore,although crowley may not have realized until june that juhl conduct actually constituted sexual harassment,she did present evidence establishing that she earlier considered juhl behavior threatening and hostile.consequently,contrary to bean assertion,crowley presented sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that she perceived juhl conduct to be hostile or abusive.
severe or pervasive 
bean next argues that crowley eight encounters with juhl during the period were not objectively severe and pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment,insisting that crowley allegations are so trivial,so isolated,and so far from the paradigmatic case of sexual harassment that judgment as a matter of law is clearly appropriate.br.of appellant at quoting hartsell duplex,cir.bean contends that crowley hostile work environment claim is supported merely by 
evidence that juhl gave her a book,came to the wrong building where she was working on three occasions,operated his machine in her vicinity on occasion and told her once it will cost you when she asked him to move,and came out of a tunnel dancing on one occasion.
reply br.of appellant at.as we explained above,morgan fatally undermines this argument,for crowley allegations do not merely include eight incidents,but involve alleged acts of harassment and stalking that spanned nearly one and a half years.accordingly,we will review evidence relating to all of crowley just those of acts that occurred between february,and june,determine whether juhl conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute actionable harassment.
crowley presented the following evidence to support her hostile work environment claim.in,at an bean pool party,juhl grabbed her foot and massaged it against her will.he told her that she was the perfect woman and that she had perfect women feet.juhl also gave crowley gifts intended to let her know that he was watching her both at and outside of work.he even followed her home one evening by turning off his headlights and pursuing her car in the dark.at an bean party in december,he again stated that crowley was the perfect woman and pinpointed the exact location of her house on a map,letting her know that he knew exactly where she lived.crowley reported these incidents to her team leader,david baker.
in january,juhl followed crowley at work and bothered her,sometimes lurking in the dark outside the women bathroom while he waited for her to emerge.he often parked next to her car in the parking lot and followed her to her car when she was leaving work.he also used bean computer units to track crowley movement within the warehouse.juhl frequently blocked her in the aisles and forced her to squeeze by him.crowley reported all of these incidents to her supervisor,tim marong,who remarked that juhl was stalking her.
on february,juhl broke into crowley home while she was there.he tried to get her to touch his clothing,and he grabbed her wrists in an attempt to bring her upstairs with him.he not only told her that he wanted to date her,but admitted that he had been at her house previously and described what outfits she had been wearing on those occasions.crowley explained that she had a boyfriend,but juhl responded,but he never here.after he finally left,crowley saw him outside peering in different windows of her house.she hid in the bathroom until he left.
as she had done previously,crowley reported this incident to her supervisors.she told her team leaders,her supervisor tim marong,and bean human resources personnel that she believed she was being stalked.indeed,marong testified that he thought that juhl conduct could have constituted sexual harassment.marong contacted pat,a human resources supervisor,who met with crowley several weeks later.crowley informed not only about juhl uninvited entry into her home,but also about his intimidating behavior at work.when crowley asked whether she should notify the plant manager,frank johnson,about juhl conduct,advised her not to break the chain of command,but to continue reporting her complaints to her immediate supervisor.one month after crowley met with,juhl was reassigned to a separate work area.
from march until the summer of,juhl continued to work near crowley,even when he was scheduled to work elsewhere.he also continued his familiar conduct of blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker and dancing near her.she reported juhl disturbing and sometimes bizarre behavior to her team leader and human resources,which assured her that juhl would be scheduled to work in a different warehouse.despite these assurances,however,in may,bean permitted juhl to volunteer to work shifts in her warehouse.
during the summer of,juhl conduct did not change,as he kept trying to be near crowley.he not only continued to corner her and make her ask him to move out of the way,but also began hiding in dark areas of the warehouse where crowley would come upon him.crowley notified her team leader,leo davis,about juhl conduct,but he did nothing,even though he promised to investigate the matter.meanwhile,juhl behavior continued unabated.in july,he appeared unexpectedly in her work area or more times,lingered around the time clock at the end of crowley shift,and stood close to her on numerous occasions.
during the fall and early winter of,crowley saw juhl so often in her work area that she assumed that they were working the same shift.she later learned that juhl actually was working the wrong shift with management knowledge.also noticed juhl conduct,prompting one witness to remark,wherever she was,he was.in fact,one bean witness testified that he believed juhl was sexually attracted to crowley,explaining that it was kind of obvious the way he handled himself.
in january,crowley briefly was assigned to work an shift and therefore maintained little contact with juhl.this respite was,however,for bean soon placed her back on the third shift with juhl.she notified her supervisor,bob anderson,that she was scared and asked for a parking space closer to the building so that she would not be alone with juhl.anderson stated that he was aware of her problems with juhl,but that he had to put her back on juhl shift for business reasons.
in february,juhl contact with crowley intensified.he gave her a book on holistic cancer therapy after her friend mother died of cancer.crowley maintains that juhl could have known about the death of her friend mother only by following crowley.crowley told her team leaders about the incident and reported that he had grabbed her hands when he tried to give her the book.juhl also drove his transtacker up and down the aisle,shadowing her movements in the adjacent aisle,and used his transtacker to block her in aisles.crowley reported these incidents to her team leaders,david baker and steve mccourt,who assured her that bean was taking her concerns seriously.
in march,bean consolidated the first and third shifts of its distributions operation and consequently transferred juhl to the morning shift.despite being assigned to a different building,juhl showed up at crowley building on march and,and april.as one testified,juhl would constantly show up in the wrong building during march and april,and was constantly following her all the time,he never stopped.
in april,juhl continued showing up in crowley work area,following her,and physically obstructing her from doing her work.one time,he danced in the aisle in front of her.another time,he prevented her from passing,and when she asked him to let her by,he responded that it would cost her.when crowley reported these incidents to her new team leader,peter farley,he joked about juhl conduct and referred to him as her little stalker.
from april until june,crowley interaction with juhl was limited,as the two worked on different shifts.juhl nevertheless loitered around the time clock and the warehouse entrance,waiting for crowley to come and go.on june,juhl was returned to crowley shift.shortly thereafter,juhl lapsed back into his familiar pattern of behavior,blocking her in the aisles,making her beg him to move,and forcing her to squeeze by him.
on june,a team leader,leo davis,witnessed juhl blocking crowley,but did nothing.instead,davis laughed with juhl in front of crowley and then looked at her,smiled,and left.furthermore,ken libby,a fellow employee,warned supervisor anderson that crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop juhl.in addition,bennett schlaack,a trainer,advised three team andretta,steve mccourt,and david juhl was shadowing crowley and that he was concerned for her safety.bean,however,took no action.frustrated with bean ineffectiveness in protecting her from juhl,crowley went to the police a few days after davis saw juhl block crowley.
in the meantime,leo davis was assigned to investigate a confrontation between crowley and juhl that occurred on the same day that davis witnessed juhl blocking crowley.aside from davis,two other employees witnessed the incident and reported the matter to management.crowley explained to davis that juhl conduct was longstanding,but davis indicated to her that bean had to protect paul rights.during the course of davis investigation,crowley was restricted to the dock area,while juhl enjoyed full access to the warehouse.notwithstanding crowley complaints,management made no effort to keep juhl away from crowley.
on june,bean issued a written warning to juhl,stating that he had created a hostile work environment in which crowley felt physically threatened and that his threatening,intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.the warning indicated that juhl must take action to avoid further contact with eileen crowley.the human resources official who issued the warning,rebecca batchelder,testified that she did not know that bean already had issued a directive in the spring of requiring that juhl and crowley work in separate buildings.
during davis investigation when crowley and juhl were separated at work and even after juhl received his written warning instructing him to stay away from crowley,juhl continued following crowley around at work.sometime after june,crowley again complained to her team leader,peter farley,that juhl was violating the standing order that he and crowley be kept separated,but farley took no action other than to suggest that crowley have her boyfriend give juhl a blanket party.on july,after farley again allowed juhl and crowley to work in the same area,crowley returned to the police department and obtained a temporary protection order against juhl.the police served juhl with the order at work on the same day.
thereafter,bean placed juhl on paid leave pending the court hearing on crowley request for a protection order.on july,crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against juhl.on july,bean terminated juhl employment.
as is quite evident,crowley presented evidence relating to more than just eight innocuous encounters between her and juhl.in fact,she provided ample evidence to establish that juhl engaged in a longstanding pattern of hostile and intimidating behavior towards her that spanned over one and a half years.to prevail on this appeal,bean must demonstrate that no reasonable person could have reached the conclusion of the jury,even after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.based on the evidence adduced at trial,it can not be said that a reasonable person could not have concluded that juhl conduct towards crowley was severe or pervasive.indeed,as the eeoc wrote in its amicus brief,by focusing only on the specific incidents which occurred after february,bean fails to capture the residual and cumulative effect that juhl campaign of harassment had on crowley working conditions even on days when she did not encounter him.amicus br.of eeoc at.consequently,crowley presented sufficient evidence at trial to satisfy this element of her hostile work environment claim.
employer liability 
bean finally argues with respect to the hostile work environment claim that crowley failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish employer liability.although this appears to be bean best argument to the extent that it challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict,it nevertheless is unable to meet the onerous burden of proving that a reasonable person could not have concluded that,after it learned of juhl behavior,it failed to take appropriate steps to stop juhl harassment and stalking of crowley.
a plaintiff must satisfy different standards for establishing employer liability in a hostile work environment case depending on whether the harasser is a supervisor or of the victim.in this case,it is beyond dispute that juhl and crowley were.to establish employer liability for a,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.white,at quoting blankenship parke care,cir.bean maintains that crowley did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy either prong.
whether bean knew or should have known 
the evidence offered at trial,if viewed in the light most favorable to crowley,clearly supports a jury finding that bean knew or should have known that juhl was harassing and stalking crowley.bean bases its misguided argument to the contrary on its restricted temporal view of the evidence,but as we explained above,the statute of limitations did not preclude the therefore does not preclude considering evidence relating to harassment before february,and the jury verdict on the state law claim does not preclude us from considering evidence relating to harassment on or after june.therefore,we must consider all of the evidence,from until july,to determine whether it was sufficient to support a jury finding that bean knew about juhl conduct.
crowley presented ample evidence that she reported juhl behavior to her team leaders,supervisors,and human resources.crowley began notifying her supervisors of juhl disturbing behavior in,when she informed her team leader,david baker,that juhl was harassing and following her both on and off bean premises.in january,she told her team leader,john andretta,and her supervisor,tim marong,that juhl was bothering her at work,tracking her movements with the computers,waiting for her in the dark outside the women bathroom,blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker,and forcing her to squeeze by him.after juhl broke into her home in february,she reported the incident to team leaders andretta and steve mccourt,supervisor marong,and human resources.
in the spring of,crowley advised her new team leader,baker,that juhl was continuing to show up in her building and block her in the aisles.in april and may,after crowley twice told human resources about juhl stalking behavior,human resources assured her juhl would be scheduled for work in a different warehouse.
in the summer of,crowley notified her team leader,leo davis,that juhl always was trying to be near her and that he hid in the dark,waiting for her to come upon him.in september,she told her team leader,keith menard,that juhl was showing up repeatedly in her work area,even though he was working a different shift.
in january,after being put back on the first shift with juhl,crowley informed her supervisor,bob anderson,that she was scared of juhl and had concerns about working on the same shift with him.in february,crowley reported to her team leaders,baker and mccourt,that juhl was shadowing her movements in his transtacker.during bean shift consolidation in march,crowley complained to baker that juhl had come to the wrong building three days in a row.
in april,crowley told her new team leader,peter farley,that juhl was physically blocking her from doing her work,but farley laughed about juhl behavior and referred to him as her little stalker.in late june,crowley again complained to farley that juhl was violating the standing directive that he and crowley be kept separated at work,but farley did nothing to remedy the situation.in july,after juhl was issued a written warning requiring him to stay away from crowley but before bean placed him on unpaid leave,farley allowed juhl to work in crowley vicinity despite her previous complaints.
in addition to crowley repeated complaints to her team leaders and supervisors about juhl conduct,crowley also reported juhl behavior and expressed their concerns for her safety.see,sims health midwest physician servs,cir notification of sexual harassment to an employer need not come solely from the victim of the harassment for knowledge to be imputed to the employer.for instance,ken libby,a fellow employee,warned supervisor anderson that crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop juhl.another fellow employee,alan coffin,alerted anderson to juhl odd practice of dancing near crowley.in addition,bennett schlaack,a trainer,advised three team,mccourt,and juhl was shadowing crowley and that he was concerned for her safety.
furthermore,crowley presented evidence that bean managers,team leaders,and supervisors were aware of juhl conduct and that at times they even characterized it as harassment.for example,after juhl broke into crowley home in february,crowley spoke with both her supervisor,tim marong,and a human resources supervisor,pat.marong memo notes that crowley felt that paul was stalking her,and notes state that eileen crowley feels like she is being stalked.the security department investigated a complaint crowley advanced in may and described her grievance as a sexual harassment complaint in a document distributed to management specifically,to manager tim parker.after crowley asked her supervisor,bob anderson,to put her back on the first shift in january because she was concerned about juhl,anderson sent an email to other management personnel stating that everyone was fully aware of the situation between crowley and juhl.crowley team leader,john andretta,testified at trial that it was obvious everybody knew of the situation and how he was following her around,always being where she was.finally,the written warning to juhl on june,indicated that he had created a hostile work environment in which crowley felt physically threatened and that his threatening,intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.
at bottom,bean contention that crowley did not properly notify management of her complaints because she bypass ed the reporting requirements under bean harassment policies,br.of appellant at,is without merit,for crowley and her repeatedly alerted team leaders and supervisors about juhl conduct.bean representatives admitted that the proper procedure for an employee to report a claim of harassment was to notify his or her team leader.once a team leader received a complaint from an employee,it was the team leader duty to report the complaint up the chain of command to his or her supervisor.therefore,by maintaining a policy that permitted workers to report sexual harassment claims to team leaders,bean provided these team leaders with actual authority to receive notice of sexual harassment complaints on behalf of the company,and their knowledge was imputed to it.see,sims,at stating that employer liability could attach if information of the harassment had come to the attention of someone who is reasonably believed to have a duty to pass on the information.as such,crowley provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that bean knew or should have known about juhl harassment.
ii.whether bean took prompt and appropriate action 
bean contends that the evidence offered at trial did not support a jury finding that it failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action after receiving crowley complaints.in fact,it asserts that w hen crowley conveyed her concerns previously to a supervisor or a human resources representative,bean took immediate action.br.of appellant at.bean argues 
ultimately,crowley argument boils down to a claim that bean is strictly liable for any encounter between crowley and juhl because its prior warnings to juhl to stay away from crowley and not to bother her,and its prior actions in separating them,were not percent effective in preventing crowley and juhl from ever crossing paths again.suffice it to say,this is not the law.
to be sure,reasonable jurors might have agreed with bean argument that,although its remedial actions were not effective,it did take prompt and appropriate action and therefore should not be liable for juhl unlawful conduct.there is some force to its argument that inasmuch as crowley actually conceded in her testimony that she was pleased with bean responses to her complaints prior to june,it should escape liability.see br.of appellant at.having said that,however,we do not review the jury findings de novo,but instead must uphold the jury verdict unless no reasonable person could have reached its conclusion.
the jury obviously concluded that bean did not take prompt and appropriate action to protect crowley from juhl,and this conclusion was not unreasonable.aside from suspending and eventually terminating juhl after crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against him,the only significant remedial action bean ever took to protect crowley from juhl was to schedule crowley and juhl in different buildings or on different shifts.for instance,after juhl broke into crowley home in february,human resources ordered that juhl and crowley be kept separated.then,after disregarding numerous complaints by crowley over the ensuing year and a half,bean finally issued a written warning to juhl in june for creat ing a hostile work environment in which crowley felt physically threatened and ordered him to take action to avoid further contact with eileen crowley.in short,bean adopted the same remedial action in june as it had in february,even though the earlier action had proven ineffective,crowley repeatedly had complained to her team leaders and supervisors that juhl wantonly ignored the directive,supervisors often failed to abide by the policy and permitted juhl and crowley to work together,and the cumulative effect of juhl conduct over the period only had exacerbated the hostile work environment in which crowley was forced to work.
consequently,although bean may have made a good faith effort to implement an effective remedial measure in february,it could not turn a blind eye towards the measure ineffectiveness over the following months,only to reinstitute the same inadequate remedial measure in response to its finding that juhl had subjected crowley to a hostile work environment.thus,based on bean pattern of indifference towards crowley complaints about juhl between february and june,it can not be said that a reasonable jury could not find that bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to protect crowley from juhl.
furthermore,notwithstanding bean assertion that it took immediate action in response to each of crowley complaints,crowley offered ample testimony supporting her position that bean ignored many complaints she and her submitted concerning juhl behavior.rather than reiterate each instance in which bean failed to respond to crowley complaints,we simply will direct the parties to our summary of the evidence above.see supra part.there,one will see that bean did not respond to crowley complaints to human resources in may,to leo davis in the summer of,to bob anderson in january,to david baker and steve mccourt in february,to peter farley in april,to leo davis again in june,and to peter farley again in june.
in the end,we believe that a determination of whether bean should be liable for juhl conduct by reason of its failure to take prompt and appropriate action to protect crowley from juhl raised a question that the jury might have resolved either way.as already noted,however,our task is not to determine whether we agree with the jury verdict,but to determine whether a reasonable person could have arrived at its conclusion.in light of the heavy burden placed on bean to overturn the verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence grounds,we conclude that crowley presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to put an end to juhl stalking of crowley.therefore,we will not upset the verdict based on bean argument that the evidence was insufficient to support it,and thus,we will not reverse the order of the district court denying bean judgment as a matter of law on this basis.
systemic violation claim 
bean next challenges the jury finding that it committed a systemic violation.it argues that crowley failed to present evidence that it maintained a discriminatory policy or practice.it also contends that its alleged failure to recognize that juhl was stalking and sexually harassing crowley is not sufficient to hold it liable for a systemic violation.see br.of appellant at.
as already explained,title vii required crowley to file her charge of employment discrimination with the eeoc within days of the alleged sexual harassment.see e.the continuing violation doctrine,however,creates an equitable exception to the limitation when the unlawful behavior is deemed ongoing.provencher cvs pharmacy,div.of melville,cir.traditionally we have recognized that c ontinuing violations may be serial or systemic and have distinguished between such violations.id.systemic violations occur where an employer maintains a discriminatory policy,responsible for multiple discriminatory acts that fall outside the limitations period.frito lay snacks caribbean,cir citing pilgrim trustees of tufts college,cir.on the other hand,there is a serial violation where the plaintiff experiences a number of discriminatory acts arising from the same discriminatory animus.id.at.in this case,the district court in recognition of the case law at the time of the trial instructed the jury on the distinction between continuing and systemic violations.the jury then found that bean had committed a systemic violation,but not a serial violation.
crowley submits that the jury verdict is supportable because bean sexual harassment policy is fundamentally flawed insofar as it prohibits only sexually offensive behavior,not nonsexual conduct motivated by gender bias.crowley contends that bean sexual harassment policy by definition fails to address a wide range of illegal harassment that is directed at a victim because of gender but that does not fall within the stereotypical scenario of,and lewd comments.br.of appellee at.consequently,according to crowley theory,bean committed a systemic continuing violation by maintaining a sexual harassment policy that led its managers and supervisors to identify juhl stalking and harassment of crowley as conduct that did not warrant investigation or remediation.
clearly there is factual support for crowley argument inasmuch as bean sexual harassment policy focuses primarily on conduct,rather than on motivated by gender.indeed,bean employee guide provides,in relevant part 
generally speaking,sexual harassment is defined as conduct or behavior that is intimidating,hostile,offensive interferes with an employee work performance.it includes conduct that creates a hostile work environment.
some examples of harassing behaviors include,but are not limited to 
offensive sexual flirtations 
verbal or physical abuse of a sexual nature 
sexually suggestive gestures 
advances or propositions 
the display of sexually suggestive objects,pictures,or written materials 
lewd nicknames 
sexual practical jokes or horseplay 
app.furthermore,a human resources manager testified that bean sexual harassment policy related to sexual acts rather than nonsexual conduct motivated by gender and that bean policy did not prohibit an employee from stalking a person because of his or her gender.
nevertheless,it does not appear that bean itself maintained a discriminatory policy or practice,megwinoff banco bilbao vizcaya,cir,but simply developed and implemented an harassment policy that does not adequately protect its employees from all forms of actionable sexual harassment.bean failure,therefore,is distinguishable from traditional discriminatory polices and practices such as refusing to hire women or paying women less than men.moreover,bean ineffective sexual discrimination policy does not discriminate against a certain class of individuals,such as women or minorities,but rather treats all employees equally inasmuch as it provides every employee the same inadequate protection.crowley has cited no case that supports her theory that maintaining a substandard sexual harassment policy constitutes a discriminatory policy or practice,and we were unable to find any caselaw supporting this novel theory.in the circumstances,we are satisfied that based on the evidence presented at trial,the jury conclusion that bean committed a systemic violation is problematic.
we need not resolve the point definitively,however,for we are satisfied that the jury possible error in concluding that there was a systemic violation was harmless in the wake of the supreme court decision in morgan.under the rule of that case it is no longer necessary for a jury to determine whether a violation is systemic or serial when considering the timeliness of a hostile work environment claim.the court in morgan explained that a hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.morgan.at.based on that premise,the court held that consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim,including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period,is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability,so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory period.id.at.see also id.at provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.
inasmuch as under morgan the entire period during which a victim is subjected to a hostile work environment now constitutes one unlawful employment practice,morgan supplants our jurisprudence on the continuing violation doctrine in hostile work environment claims,making it no longer necessary to distinguish between systemic and serial violations.and because the hostile work environment created by juhl extended into the statutory,after february,satisfied the standard morgan set forth and therefore was able to pursue her hostile work environment claim based partially on events that occurred outside the limitations period 
bean argues that in the event we do not grant it judgment as a matter of law,in the alternative we should reverse the district court order denying it a new trial.bean bases for a new trial include juror bias,erroneous evidentiary rulings,and improper jury instructions.we reject bean request for a new trial,as none of its arguments has merit.
juror bias 
bean argues that it is entitled to a new trial because one of the jurors neglected to disclose her possible bias during voir dire by failing to reveal that she is a lawyer affiliated with the new england research institute who not only represented a female plaintiff in a sex discrimination suit in federal court,but also investigates and researches legal topics relating to women health and quality of life issues.crowley responds that bean charges of possible bias are purely speculative and that it has not even tried to demonstrate that the juror background would have affected the outcome of the trial.
to secure a new trial based on a juror inaccurate answers during voir dire,a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for cause.mcdonough power,at.at.when seeking a new trial based on of information by a juror during voir dire,however,a party must do more than raise a speculative allegation that the juror possible bias may have influenced the outcome of the trial.dall,at.
bean sets forth the following facts and assertions to support its argument that the juror failed to disclose her possible bias.following the trial,the juror wrote a letter to the trial judge asking permission to speak with crowley attorney,explaining that she found the case to be most interesting,in particular because of my training as a psychologist and my interest as a research scientist.after the judge shared the letter with the parties,bean discovered that the juror worked for the new england research institute investigated and researched women issues,including topics on women health as well as child custody in cases and as a family lawyer,represented a woman in a federal sexual discrimination case
