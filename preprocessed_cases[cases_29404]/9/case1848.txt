police officer randall brickey was fired for comments he made as a candidate for town council that were critical of his employer,the saltville police department,and its police chief,rob hall.brickey filed suit under for retaliatory discharge in violation of the first amendment.the district court denied hall qualified immunity,and this interlocutory appeal followed.because it was debatable at the time of brickey dismissal that his speech interests as a citizen outweighed hall interests as a public employer,we conclude that hall is entitled to qualified immunity.we therefore reverse.
brickey was an officer with the saltville police department from december,to may,the day his employment was terminated.hall became police chief in july,taking over a department struggling with problems of financial mismanagement,officer misconduct,and a general lack of professionalism.in an effort to improve the department operations and public image,hall instituted several policy changes,including increased foot patrols,a stricter dress code,and new payroll procedures.
in early,brickey decided to run for saltville town council.he discussed the plan with hall,who indicated that the campaign would not cause employment problems so long as brickey did not campaign in uniform or disparage the department in contravention of departmental policy.
during the campaign,two local newspapers posed questions to the candidates,inviting them to submit responses for publication.one paper provided this prompt motivation for seeking should the voters choose you.after identifying himself as a member of the saltville police department with years of experience as a police officer,brickey responded in relevant part as follows 
i teach the,drug abuse resistance education program at saltville elementary school.i went in to talk to chief rob hall about ordering the supplies for the graduation.i was told there was no money to place the order.after checking with the accounts payable clerk to see where the in the police department budget had been spent,i was shown several invoices that were charged to the account.the items on the invoices had nothing to do with the program.i also found,from looking at a copy of the budget that i obtained from the town,that the town receives in highway maintenance funds from the state.only is approved in the budget for paving.seeing this,along with the other misuse of taxpayers money,shows me that we have a very poor management at the council level and there needs to be a change.
next,in response to a question about the town greatest needs,brickey noted road paving,improved management of the town pool,and the following changes to the saltville police department the town police department needs to be more professional.officers need to do more foot patrols during the day shift and become more familiar with business owners.the police department needs to be more aggressive on investigations and focus more on drug trafficking.id.
finally,brickey responded to a question as to how to meet those needs.he first noted that he had been told by some business owners in town during his campaign for town council that they would like to see more foot patrols from the police department,and would like to see the chief during daytime hours.id.he went on to propose the addition of a investigator,stating that the town had a serious drug problem and that he knew of cases that need to be investigated by the police department.id.brickey statements were printed in late april.
about a week later,hall informed brickey that he believed brickey statements violated departmental policy.the alleged violations of the police department policy manual included a failure to display respect for his superior officers,subordinates,and associates speak ing rumors detrimental to the department or another employee us ing or attempt ing to use his official position,badge or credentials for personal or financial gain or advantage communicat ing information concerning operations,activities or matters of police business,the release of which may have an adverse impact on the department image,operations,or administration and criticiz ing or ridicul ing the department,its policies,or other employees by speech that undermines the effectiveness of the department,interferes with the maintenance of discipline,or is made with reckless disregard for truth or falsity.
hall hired gary reynolds an,former police chief to investigate the allegations and to determine whether brickey in fact violated departmental policies.reynolds interviewed hall,brickey,assistant chief erik puckett,the saltville town auditor,and the other five officers in the police department.in speaking with reynolds,brickey withdrew or attempted to clarify some of his statements.asked about his comments on the professionalism of the department,brickey said,it not that i meant they are unprofessional,we just need to be on patrol more.regarding the comments,brickey admitted that the was in fact accounted for in a different line item of the budget.he also conceded that he should have said mismanagement of funds versus misuse of funds.brickey insisted that his statements regarding the dare account were not about chief hall,they were about the town council members.
according to reynolds investigation,brickey statements caused concern within the saltville government and police department.a town auditor interpreted brickey statements as alleging that chief hall was misusing funds.this upset the auditor,who,after looking into the matter,found no misuse of taxpayer money by chief hall.id.some police officers believed that the comments reflected poorly on the department,though at least two officers told reynolds that they had not read brickey comments.
in reynolds final estimation,brickey statements to the newspapers violated departmental policies.according to reynolds,brickey statements regarding the misuse of funds clearly bad mouthed the police department and especially the police chief,and thus were harmful to the public trust of chief hall as well as his integrity.id.moreover,reynolds faulted brickey for failing to investigate properly or verify his allegations that police funds were being misused.specifically,reynolds found that brickey overlooked the fact that the budget line item also included funds for community relations,and that the invoices brickey observed were for legitimate expenses.id.
after notifying brickey of the results of the investigation,hall held a meeting with brickey,reynolds,and puckett in which brickey was given an opportunity to respond to the allegations and the findings of the report.on may,hall terminated brickey employment.brickey pursued the department grievance procedures to no avail.
brickey filed suit under,naming as defendants hall and a number of other individuals who played a role in his dismissal.in addition to his first amendment claim,brickey also asserted procedural and substantive claims.the claims were dismissed on a b motion,as was a request for punitive damages.the claim survived,and the defendants later moved for summary judgment,attacking the claim on the merits and also asserting qualified immunity.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.brickey hall,wl,at.summary judgment was granted as to all defendants except chief hall none of the other officials,the court held,had caused brickey injury,as hall was the lone decisionmaker.id.at.
as to hall,the district court denied qualified immunity.id.the district court first held that,taking the record in the light most favorable to brickey,hall violated brickey first amendment rights.id.at.having found a violation,the district court determined that brickey right not to be fired for his speech was clearly established at the time of his termination.id.at.relying on citizens united fec,the court stated that political speech was clearly entitled to strong protection.id.at.and relying on durham jones,cir,the court stated that public employees speech regarding governmental misconduct warrants protection.id.
this interlocutory appeal followed 
we review de novo the denial of qualified immunity.altman city of high point,cir.
qualified immunity shields government officials from personal liability when their conduct does not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.smith gilchrist,cir.quoting stanton sims,per curiam.that is,qualified immunity protects government officials when they act in legal gray areas.id.quoting occupy columbia haley,cir.an official is entitled to qualified immunity unless the allegations underlying the claim,if true,substantiate a violation of a federal statutory or constitutional right and this violation was of a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have known.id.at quoting ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir.while a case directly on point is not required for a court to conclude that the law was clearly established,existing precedent must have placed the constitutional question beyond debate.id.quoting ashcroft.the burden of proof rests with the official asserting the defense.durham,at.
brickey alleges retaliatory discharge in violation of the first amendment.on appeal,hall does not challenge the district court holding that brickey has properly alleged a constitutional violation the first prong.instead,hall contends that the right brickey asserts was not clearly established in when brickey was terminated.our review,therefore,is confined to the question of what law was clearly established we do not reach the merits of brickey constitutional claim.
a first amendment retaliation claim poses three questions 
whether the public employee was speaking as a citizen upon a matter of public concern or as an employee about a matter of personal interest whether the employee interest in speaking upon the matter of public concern outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public and whether the employee speech was a substantial factor in the employee termination decision.
mcvey stacy,cir.the third question is not in dispute hall concedes that he terminated brickey because of his speech.but hall contends that the law was not clearly established on the first two questions.
because we hold that the law was not clearly established as to the second question the balancing of the employee and employer interests hall is entitled to qualified immunity.consequently,we need not reach the question of whether it was clearly established that brickey spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.
under the supreme court decision in pickering board of education,a court charge in a first amendment retaliation case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.the public interest in hearing the employee speech also weighs in the balance a stronger showing of public interest in the speech requires a concomitantly stronger showing of government employer interest to overcome it.mcvey,at murnaghan,concurring 
the pickering balance requires full consideration of the government interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public.connick myers.prior to brickey termination,the test for striking the appropriate balance was clear 
w e must take into account the context of the employee speech and the extent to which it disrupts the operation and mission of the institution.factors relevant to this inquiry include whether a public employee speech impaired the maintenance of discipline by supervisors impaired harmony among coworkers damaged close personal relationships impeded the performance of the public employee duties interfered with the operation of the institution undermined the mission of the institution was communicated to the public or to coworkers in private conflicted with the responsibilities of the employee within the institution and abused the authority and public accountability that the employee role entailed.
ridpath,at citation omitted quoting mcvey,at.the employer need not prove actual disruption,but only that an adverse effect was reasonably to be apprehended.maciarello sumner,cir.quoting jurgensen fairfax,cir.
it was clearly established in that police officials are entitled to impose more restrictions on speech than other public employers because a police force is paramilitary discipline is demanded,and freedom must be correspondingly denied.id.quoting jurgensen,at granting qualified immunity to a police official who terminated two officers for conducting an unauthorized investigation into alleged evidence tampering in the police force.because of this heightened need for discipline,police officials have greater latitude in dealing with dissension in their ranks.id.
the key comments in this case involve the allegedly missing funds as an initial matter,despite brickey claim that he did not intend to impugn his chief,hall could reasonably have read the comments as some others in saltville did to accuse him of incompetence or even malfeasance.a town auditor,for example,read the comments to allege misuse on the chief part,and according to declarations given by hall,assistant chief puckett,and the town manager some members of the police force and the public expressed concerns of police misconduct in the wake of the articles.see hall some residents also construed brickey comments as accusing me and the department of corruption and misusing funds.puckett i was asked questions about the articles from members of the public who expressed concern that officers were engaging in misconduct.town manager officers expressed their belief that brickey had accused them of improper behavior id.many people who commented about the articles expressed concern that someone was stealing money from the town.
the clearly established principles outlined above did not put the outcome of the pickering balancing in this case beyond debate.the context and the extent of disruption of the comments weighed on both sides of the scale.first,brickey spoke as a political candidate in a public forum.in general terms,speaking as a political candidate weighs in favor of speech.at the same time,however,the public nature of brickey comments increased their capacity for disruption.second,brickey speech criticized a superior officer.as our cases reflect,discipline and respect for superior officers are critical in a police force.because speech accusing a superior officer of incompetence or malfeasance goes to the heart of the superior authority,hall could reasonably have believed that brickey comments would undermine his authority in the eyes of the public and within the police department.see town manager stating that b ased on my observations of officers in the police department,brickey comments hampered morale and discipline in the department.such a concern is amplified in the close working conditions of a small police force,where mutual confidence and are essential.cooper johnson,cir.furthermore,hall was working to restore credibility to the department.he reasonably could have believed that brickey comments would set back his efforts and increase public distrust in him and the department as a whole.finally,reynolds conducted an independent investigation of brickey statements and concluded that they were harmful to the public trust of chief hall as well as his integrity.such a finding supports the conclusion that hall reasonably apprehended disruption.
in sum,the parties have not directed us to any case that would have clearly warned hall that terminating brickey for his comments about the funds would violate his first amendment rights.on the contrary,our case law had stressed the broad discretion granted police officials to limit speech when discipline is at stake.as a result,we can not say that it was beyond debate that brickey interests outweighed hall.
brickey are unpersuasive.he relies principally on citizens united fec,which held that the government may not prohibit corporate expenditures to support or criticize political candidates.in brickey view,n othing could have been more clearly established in may than the sanctity of political speech.appellee br.at.however,such a
