we consider here an appeal from a february,judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont jerome niedermeier,magistrate judge granting plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and permanently enjoining the implementation and enforcement of several sections of vermont act.stat.ann.tit,et,which the district court held facially discriminated against mentally disabled individuals in violation of title ii of the americans with disabilities act of ada,et,and section of the rehabilitation act of.
the principal questions presented by this appeal are i whether plaintiffs have alleged a sufficient to support standing to challenge act ii whether this suit is ripe for adjudication iii whether act violates the ada by distinguishing between qualified individuals on the basis of mental illness and iv if so,whether the district court injunction prohibiting enforcement of certain provisions of act effects a fundamental alteration to the discriminatory service,program,or activity.we hold that the suit is ripe for adjudication,that plaintiffs have standing,and that act does facially discriminate against mentally disabled individuals in violation of the ada and the rehabilitation act.we also hold that defendants have failed to submit evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the injunction fundamentally alters the discriminatory state program.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
under vermont law,an adult may execute a durable power of attorney for health care dpoa,which allows him to guide health care providers in the event of his incapacity by appointing a guardian and,if desired,by articulating preferences for or limitations on treatment.stat.ann.tit,et.until,vermont statutes provided two principal mechanisms for overriding dpoas first,individuals could revoke their own previously executed dpoas id.a.second,a third party could petition the probate court to suspend an individual dpoa in conjunction with that court appointment of a guardian for the individual,id.a.
in,the vermont legislature passed act.stat.ann.tit,et,the subject of this challenge,which established a third procedure for overriding the dpoas of certain patients who are committed or imprisoned.under act,health care professionals may petition in family court for authority to medicate involuntarily individuals who have been civilly committed or prisoners who have been judged mentally ill.id.a.when the proposed involuntary medication would contravene a patient validly executed dpoa,act requires the court to suspend judgment until the patient has been treated or not treated in accordance with his dpoa for a period of days.id.c.if the court concludes that,after days,the patient has not experienced a significant clinical improvement in his or her mental state,and remains incompetent,the court may proceed to determine whether he should be involuntarily medicated according to the factors otherwise relevant under act,with no further regard for his dpoa,id.c.
in passing act,the vermont legislature expressly intended to supersede the previously existing procedures for involuntarily medicating individuals civilly committed for the treatment of mental illness,which were established by a consent decree in miller,no.washington county may.stat.ann.tit,d this act will render the miller consent judgment no longer applicable.miller provided that,before a health care professional may medicate a committed patient involuntarily,the vermont human service board must conduct an adjudicatory hearing at which a hearing officer must first find the patient incompetent,then ascertain and effectuate the decision the patient would have made if competent.miller,no,at.the miller consent decree did not specifically provide for circumstances in which patients had dpoas,but it is not disputed that a validly executed dpoa constitutes relevant and substantial evidence of the decision an incompetent patient would make if competent.
following the enactment of act,vermont attempted to apply the procedures set forth in act to patients who had dpoas,instead of those established by miller,but the family court dismissed petitions filed under act for involuntary medication on the ground that the miller consent decree would govern until vacated or modified.see miller.
vermont subsequently petitioned for relief from the consent decree.the petition was denied by a state trial court in,miller,no.washington county,whereupon vermont officials ceased to seek involuntary medication under act pending an appeal to the vermont supreme court.on october,the vermont supreme court ruled in the state favor,reversing the trial court and granting the state relief from judgment with respect to the consent decree,at.the vermont supreme court specifically noted that,u ntil,in a proper case,one or more provisions of act are successfully challenged as unconstitutional or otherwise invalid,act takes precedence over the consent decree.id.here we consider just such a challenge,brought in the district court.
ii.factual and procedural history 
plaintiff nancy hargrave is a resident of vermont who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia,for which she has been hospitalized multiple times since in the vermont state hospital.while hospitalized in,she was twice the subject of proceedings for involuntary medication the earlier proceeding yielded a finding that hargrave was competent to refuse medication,but the later one resulted in a finding that she was incompetent to do so.upon the second finding,she was administered psychiatric medication over her objection in a situation.
on april,hargrave executed a dpoa designating a guardian in the case of incapacity and refusing the administration of any and all,neuroleptic,psychotropic or psychoactive medications,and electroconvulsive therapy hargrave then initiated this suit on april,raising claims pursuant to against the state of vermont,the vermont department of developmental and mental health services,and susan besio,in her capacity as commissioner of that department collectively,defendants.she claimed that the provisions of vermont act that permit the abrogation of dpoas executed by patients who have been committed violate title ii of the ada and section of the rehabilitation act and she sought to enjoin enforcement of the relevant provisions.
on june,defendants moved to dismiss hargrave claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because she had not alleged an sufficient to support standing.the district court denied their motion on january.see hargrave state of vermont.in the same order,the district court granted a motion to intervene filed by vermont protection and advocacy,a corporation authorized by state and federal law to pursue legal remedies on behalf of the mentally ill.id.on july,upon hargrave motion,the district court certified as a plaintiff class all individuals within the state of vermont who have been or in the future will be diagnosed as having a mental illness and who either have or will execute a durable power of attorney for health care or have been or in the future will be deterred from executing such an advance directive for health care as a result of act.hargrave state of vermont,at.july,
on for summary judgment,the district court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs,holding that act facially discriminates against the mentally disabled in violation of title ii of the ada and section of the rehabilitation act.hargrave state of vermont,at.on october,defendants moved for alteration or amendment of the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and on december,the district court issued a further opinion and order specifying that portions of act facially discriminated against the mentally disabled to the extent to which the provisions allow their lawfully executed dpoas to be abrogated in situations when they have been determined to be incompetent to make their own health care decisions.hargrave state of vermont,at.final judgment was entered on february,and defendants timely appealed.
discussion 
we review district court determinations on motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment de novo.see,miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
defendants appeal the district court denial of their motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims for lack of standing.in particular,they allege that hargrave and the rest of the plaintiff class have not suffered an.the supreme court has defined an as an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual and imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d emphasis added.
it is undisputed that,at the time of filing,hargrave had a history of commitment and involuntary medication,and that she had executed a dpoa refusing certain forms of psychiatric treatment.defendants nevertheless argue that the threat of act enforcement was not sufficiently imminent to constitute an for the purposes of standing.specifically,defendants argue that,in light of the vermont trial court refusal to enforce act,neither hargrave nor anyone else has suffered an under act.defs.br.at.
at the time hargrave filed her complaint the state lawsuit challenging the miller consent decree was already pending.accordingly,hargrave had reason to believe that vermont would soon be permitted to enforce the act.this belief was clearly reasonable in light of the fact that,after hargrave filed the instant action,the vermont supreme court ruled in favor of vermont enforcement of act in miller,we can not hold,in such circumstances,that the threat of act enforcement was too conjectural or hypothetical,see lujan,at,to constitute an when hargrave originally filed her complaint.
whatever questions regarding this suit ripeness existed at the time of briefing due to the of act have been mooted by the vermont supreme court decision of october,in miller,which held that the act supersedes the consent decree.see blanchette connecticut ins,d s ince ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,it is the situation now rather than the situation at the time of the district court decision that must govern.american motorists ins.united furnace,cir i t is irrelevant whether the case was ripe for review when the complaint was filed.we therefore proceed to the substance of defendants claims under the ada.
ii.applicability of the ada and rehabilitation act 
title ii of the americans with disabilities act provides,in relevant part,that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.to prove a violation of title ii,a party must therefore establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability that he was excluded from participation in a public entity services,programs or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by a public entity and that such exclusion or discrimination was due to his disability.id.these requirements apply with equal force to plaintiffs rehabilitation act claims.see rodriguez city of new york,cir because section of the rehabilitation act and the ada impose identical requirements,we consider these claims in tandem.citing lincoln cercpac health hosps,cir.
does act exclude qualified individual s from a service,program,or activity under the ada 
a qualified individual under the ada is an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies or practices meets the essential eligibility requirements for participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.defendants do not dispute that a person with a mental illness may be qualified to prepare and rely upon a dpoa.defs.br.at.nor do they contest that hargrave in particular was qualified to execute her dpoa.rather,they urge us to find that hargrave and the rest of the plaintiff class fall into an exception to the ada for otherwise qualified individuals who pose a significant risk to the health or safety of others.defs.br.at.
at least in the context of employment,the ada permits qualification standards for employees to take into account whether an employee or potential employee poses a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.b see also school board of nassau county,florida arline,d holding that whether a teacher infected with tuberculosis was otherwise qualified to teach depended in part on the extent to which she posed a risk of harm to third parties.
vermont civil commitment statutes require a judicial finding that a person poses a danger of harm to himself or others,or that he is substantially likely to pose such a danger if treatment is discontinued,before he can be civilly committed see.stat.ann.tit.defendants argue that,because act only authorizes state courts to override the dpoas of individuals who are subject to standing orders of civil commitment,every patient subject to act poses a direct threat of harm to others and,therefore,falls outside the protections of the ada.in sum,defendants invite us to hold that a vermont court determination of dangerousness at the time of civil commitment is sufficient to exclude an otherwise qualified individual from the protections of the ada under the direct threat exception for the entire length of her commitment.
in the employment context,it is the defendant burden to establish that a plaintiff poses a direct threat of harm to others,see at citing legislative history of the ada,pt,at,reprinted in,and that determination requires an individualized assessment of the employee present ability based on medical or other objective evidence,id.quoting albertson,kirkingburg,d emphasis added alteration in original.to determine whether an individual poses a direct threat,we consider the duration of the risk the nature and severity of the potential harm the likelihood that potential harm will occur and the imminence of potential harm.id.
it is unclear whether the direct threat defense applies outside of the employment context.even if it does,however,we agree with the district court that defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating that each and every patient subject to act necessarily poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others sufficient to exclude them from the protection of the ada.first,the state court legal determination of dangerousness can be based on a finding that the individual merely poses a danger of harm to himself.stat.ann.tit,whereas the direct threat defense requires the person to pose a risk of harm to others.further,the state does not make an individualized and objective determination of the danger posed by a particular patient at the time it abrogates her dpoa.between the time a patient commitment order is entered and the time her dpoa may be abrogated under act at least days later,many factors may affect the level of danger the patient poses,including,most notably,the fact of commitment itself.as the district court noted,defendants have offered no evidence that a period of commitment would not significantly not threat posed by some or most patients.see hargrave state of vermont,at.defendants have therefore failed to demonstrate that every person subject to act procedures poses a direct threat of harm to others sufficient to exclude her from the protections of the ada.
we therefore conclude that act excludes from the state dpoa program qualified individuals who meet the essential eligibility requirements for maintaining dpoas.
does act discriminate on the basis of disability 
for purposes of the ada,the term disability includes a ny mental or psychological disorder,such as emotional or mental illness.h see also hunt transport,cir.act may be applied only to the mentally ill.see.stat.ann.tit,a identifying three categories of individuals subject to act,each of which relies on a finding that an individual is a person who is suffering from mental illness under.stat.ann.tit,defining a person in need of treatment.nevertheless,defendants argue that the act does not discriminate on the basis of mental illness because it does not affect all the mentally ill within the state of vermont,but rather,only the small class of people who are mentally ill,dangerous,committed to state custody,and incompetent to make treatment deci
