this appeal stems from the tragic deadly shooting of a boy named anthony mcgrath anthony by a plymouth police officer.following the untimely death of her son,denise mcgrath mcgrath filed a action,alleging the police officers involved had used excessive force in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the two named police officers moved for summary judgment.finding no constitutional violations on the part of the police officer who fired the lethal shot at anthony,the district court granted the police officers motion and dismissed all claims.mcgrath appeals the entry of summary judgment.after reviewing the record anew,we affirm.
factual background 
because this is an appeal from the entry of summary judgment,we relate the facts in the light most flattering to the nonmoving party in this case,mcgrath as the record will reasonably allow.mcardle town of pub,f d,cir.
the events surrounding anthony death took place in the early morning of january,in plymouth,massachusetts.around,plymouth police officers edwin almeida and richard tavares responded to an activated burglar alarm at a liquor store near the intersection of samoset and court streets.at the time the dispatch came in,the officers were in their two respective police cars at standish plaza on samoset street.as told by the officers,the following sequence of events transpired in a time span of approximately five minutes.
officer almeida course 
having received the dispatch,officer almeida headed east on samoset street towards the liquor store with his police cruiser blue lights activated.as he approached the intersection of samoset and court,he saw a westbound toyota camry stopping at the traffic light.the light in officer almeida direction was red,but turned green as he approached the intersection.simultaneously to the eastbound light turning green,the westbound camry turned left,and headed south on court street.believing various traffic violations had been committed,officer almeida decided to pull over the camry he took a right on court street,turning on his cruiser siren and wigwags he radioed dispatch,informing them he had spotted a vehicle leaving the liquor store vicinity,and was trying to pull it over.
officer almeida headed south behind the camry,but the car did not pull over.it did eventually slow down at an intersection roughly four city blocks later,at which point almeida was able to get a quick look at the driver.but the camry then took off again.officer with his police cruiser lights,siren,and wigwags now in active pursuit he radioed dispatch,advising that the driver he was attempting to pull over was refusing to do so,and was on the run.officer almeida witnessed the camry drive through a bank teller window in the wrong direction.almeida lone pursuit of the camry continued through the streets of plymouth until officer tavares who had heard the earlier liquor store alarm broadcast entered the fray.
officer tavares course 
hearing the initial dispatch to the liquor store and being in the area,officer tavares responded as backup for officer almeida alarm investigation.as he was drawing near to the liquor store,he heard officer almeida radio in that he was pulling over a driver in the vicinity of the business.but tavares continued heading towards the liquor store in response to the activated burglar alarm.it was not until officer tavares heard officer almeida tell dispatch the driver was refusing to stop and was running that he changed course,and told dispatch he would head towards almeida location.with his police cruiser lights and siren on,officer tavares quickly joined the pursuit.
officers almeida and tavares shared course 
officers almeida and tavares pursued the speeding zigzagging camry up water street until it reached the t intersection with nelson street,where the speeding driver was not able to make the turn on time,and crashed into a stone wall.the two police officers pulled up behind the camry officer almeida parked his cruiser to the rear of the driver side,and officer tavares to the rear of the passenger side.almeida then exited his cruiser,drew his gun,and began shouting commands at the driver to put his hands up and step out of the camry.the driver failed to comply with any of officer almeida commands.instead,he revved the engine and maneuvered the camry in reverse between the two police cruisers.the reversing camry hit almeida cruiser,and continued a couple of yards before it crashed into a telephone pole.
the camry then remained on the telephone pole for a few seconds.officer tavares was now the one shouting commands.he approached the camry from the front passenger side,instructing the driver to turn off the engine and get out.officer almeida was to officer tavares right,also facing the camry.both police officers had their weapons drawn and aimed at the driver.the driver,again,did not comply this time,he was looking straight at officer tavares with his hands on the steering wheel.continuing to ignore the police officers directives to turn off the car,the record reflects the driver revved the camry engine and accelerated forward towards officer tavares.tavares then fired his weapon twice,striking the car front windshield.one of the shots hit the driver in the upper right arm.as the camry passed officer tavares on his right,and continued in officer almeida direction,tavares fired two more shots.the fatal shot entered the camry through the front passenger window and struck the driver in the back.officer almeida then fired seven shots,but none struck the driver.after hitting the curb and becoming airborne,the camry came to a complete stop.
officer tavares immediately radioed police dispatch,indicating that shots had been fired,and that an ambulance was needed.he simultaneously approached the camry from the rear,while officer almeida closed in from the front.the driver door was open and the driver was slumped to the left of the steering wheel.officer tavares again yelled at the driver to turn off the car and get out,but the driver did neither.tavares pulled the driver from the vehicle and both officers began to handcuff him.officer tavares asked the driver several times if he had been shot.there was no response.once the driver was handcuffed and placed face down on the ground,the officers began to check him for weapons,and noticed his labored breathing.they removed the handcuffs and began to cut his clothing to look for injuries.this was when the officers noticed the gunshot wounds.
officer stephen mclaughlin arrived on the scene,and the three officers began to administer first aid.officers mclaughlin and almeida maintained pressure on the wounds and operated the ambu bag while officer tavares performed chest compressions.other police officers who had been rushing to the scene when the camry initially attempted to flee also arrived,as did an ambulance.the paramedics took over.the driver,anthony,was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead less than two hours later at 
ii.procedural history 
on january,mcgrath as administratrix of her son estate sued officer tavares,officer almeida,chief of plymouth police department robert pomeroy,and the town of plymouth in the federal district court for the district of massachusetts she alleged officers tavares and almeida defendants used excessive force in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.
officers tavares and almeida moved for summary judgment,averring mcgrath ha d not established that the use of deadly force violated anthony mcgrath fourth amendment constitutional rights and,in any event,they were entitled to qualified immunity.mcgrath opposed the entry of summary judgment,asserting the existence of genuine disputes of material facts.
on july,the district court heard the motion for summary judgment and took it under advisement.on september,it granted summary judgment in defendants favor,holding that officer tavares use of deadly force was objectively reasonable as a matter or law,and thus,no constitutional violation had occurred it found no need to address the issue of qualified immunity 
mcgrath now appeals.

iv.discussion 
fourth amendment 
a claim that officers used excessive force to effect a seizure is governed by the fourth amendment reasonableness standard.plumhoff rickard.d etermining the reasonableness of a particular seizure requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.id.quoting graham connor.to establish a fourth amendment violation based on excessive force,a plaintiff must show that the defendant officer employed force that was unreasonable under the circumstances.kenney floyd,cir quoting jennings jones,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this reasonableness inquiry is an objective one it is not a question of subjective intent.graham,at t he question is whether the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.we evaluate the reasonableness of a particular use of force from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.kenney,at quoting graham,at.our assessment must account for the fact that police officers are often forced to make judgments in circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly evolving about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.id.quoting graham,at.in the fourth amendment context,the use of deadly force is not excessive if an objectively reasonable officer in the same circumstances would have believed that an individual posed a threat of serious physical harm either to the officer or others.estate of bennett wainwright,cir citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
mcgrath argues the fourth amendment did not allow officer tavares to use deadly force because he lacked probable cause under tennessee garner,where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others,it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force,id.at.she has maintained from the start that officer tavares and officer almeida were never in any danger of physical injury or death particularly,at the time tavares fired the shot that killed her son when the camry accelerated forward from the telephone pole because neither officer was in or anywhere near the camry path of travel unfortunately for mcgrath,the record says otherwise.and she is unable to put forth competent evidence to dispute it 
what she points us to are police photographs of the resulting bullet holes in the camry in an attempt to show the officers were never in front of the accelerating car.she argues that from the state police photographs a lay person could reasonably conclude that the penetration holes in the windshield from tavares first and second shots were not made from shots taken directly in front of the camry,but from off to the right or passenger side of the camry.and that,likewise,p hotographs of the bullet holes caused by almeida shots into the camry establish that he was never located in front of the camry or in its path of travel.but without expert testimony on the trajectory of a bullet,these photographs are not enough to show where an officer was standing when he fired his gun.the rules of evidence simply do not permit it.see.if a witness is not testifying as an expert,testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to one that is not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge.moreover,the massachusetts state police collision analysis reconstruction section forensic mapping report the only expert testimony on record cuts against mcgrath assertion,concluding that d ue to a variety of factors it is not possible to accurately represent the exact dynamic trajectories of the bullets as they entered the vehicle.
mcgrath also points to a pattern of shattered glass illustrated in both the dowd forensic and a sketch of the scene by lieutenant in another attempt to show the officers were not in front of the camry.mcgrath contends that the pattern of shattered glass is a result of tavares third shot hitting the camry front passenger window,when he was no longer in the car path,and that it conclusively establishes that as the camry proceeded from the utility pole across water street,its course of travel was directly westerly,well to the south of where tavares and almedia claim ed to have been standing when tavares fired shots one,two,and three.after scouring mcgrath briefs and filings in district court,however,it is not clear how she purports to establish this.for the copies of the dowd map place the shattered glass on the ground past the point where officer tavares was standing when he began to shoot,which the record evidence shows occurred once the camry was already accelerating forward from the pole.and officer tavares testified anthony was no longer driving towards him,but towards where he believed almeida to be,when he fired his third shot which mcgrath claims shattered the front passenger window.thus,even employing mcgrath theory,the pattern of shattered glass does not contradict the police account that the camry initially drove towards the officers.this is particularly so,given tavares testified the camry veered away from him,and towards almeida,after he fired his first two shots.as for gilardi sketch,the only mention as to the officers whereabouts is not in the sketch,but in the accompanying official report,which states a s plymouth police officers approached the camry,it drove forward in a westerly direction,toward the officers who began shooting at the operator of the camry.emphasis added.
accordingly,despite mcgrath claims to the contrary,the uncontroverted facts in the record,as established by the police incident report,and the deposition testimony and map of each officer,show that when officer tavares fired shots one and two,anthony was driving towards him the choices were to shoot or risk being run over.this is the type of judgment police officers are forced to make,and which we must take into account in assessing an officer actions.a reasonable officer in this situation could reasonably believe he was facing a threat of serious physical harm,if not death.after all,a car can be used as a deadly weapon.scott harris,t he threat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect is not even remotely comparable to the extreme danger to human life posed by a car chase.
the police report,the officers deposition testimonies,and the maps also establish that when officer tavares fired shots three and four,he believed officer almeida was to his right,and the camry was headed in that direction.contrary to mcgrath contention,officer tavares had no duty to turn around and pin down officer almeida exact location.plumhoff.at stressing an officer had not violated clearly established law when she fired at a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm to other officers on foot who she believed were in the immediate area alteration in original emphasis added.again,any reasonable officer in tavares position,faced with the same reckless driver who had almost run him over a fraction of a second earlier,could reasonably believe that officer almeida was in grave physical harm way.see id.at the fleeing suspect outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk.remember,protecting oneself or others from serious physical harm justifies a police officer resort to deadly force.see wainwright,at.
from officer tavares perspective,anthony was dangerous,and he acted accordingly.he faced a driver who led him and another officer in a car chase through downtown plymouth in the wee hours of the morning,and was refusing to heed to legitimate police officer directives not only had anthony refused to stop when police officers attempted to pull him over,but he had refused to follow any police officer commands thereafter.throughout the car chase,anthony acted with complete disregard for officer tavares and officer almeida safety or the safety of anybody else that might have been on the street.see scott,at looking at the actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present,to other civilian motorists,and to the officers involved in the chase when assessing the governmental interest in ensuring public safety.we point out that the chase was still ongoing when tavares fired his weapon.it did not conclude with the stone wall collision,seeing as anthony quickly picked up his flight by reversing the camry in between the police cruisers.see plumhoff.at finding a car chase had not concluded when the suspect car collided with a police car and came temporarily to a near standstill,because l ess than three seconds later,the suspect resumed maneuvering his car.nor did it end when the camry hit the telephone pole,as anthony quickly resumed driving forward after that.see id.under these circumstances,we can not say officer tavares acted unreasonably by shooting at anthony.a t the moment when the shots were fired,all that a reasonable police officer could have concluded was that anthony was intent on resuming his flight and that,if he was allowed to do so,he would once again pose a deadly threat for the officers,as well as for others on the road.id.at.this threat to officer and public safety is precisely the probable cause garner refers to.
in sum,for mcgrath to succeed on her fourth amendment claim,she must establish that officer tavares shooting at anthony was not objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and the facts known to him at the time.calvi knox county,cir.she can not.as we just mentioned,officer tavares use of deadly force was objectively reasonable because a reasonable officer in the same circumstances could have believed anthony posed a threat of at the very least serious physical harm to his person when he fired shots one and two,and an identical threat to officer almeida when he fired shots three and four.see wainwright,at.a reasonable officer could have likewise concluded anthony would once again pose a deadly threat for others if he had resumed his flight.see plumhoff.at.moreover,officer tavares third and fourth shots are also justified by anthony failure to abandon his attempt to flee after the initial two shots were fired,continuing to pose an imminent threat to the public.see,id.because the record does not establish a fourth amendment violation,mcgrath claim can not survive summary judgment.
qualified immunity 
in any event,even if a constitutional violation was established,defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because they did not violate clearly established law.we explain.
an official sued under is entitled to qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.plumhoff.at internal quotation marks omitted.and a defendant can not be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant shoes would have understood that he was violating it.id.e xisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question confronted by the official beyond debate.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the burden of demonstrating the law was clearly established at the time of the alleged constitutional violation is on the plaintiff,mcgrath.see cort√©s reyes salas quintana,f d,cir.although mcgrath admittedly did not intend to develop her qualified immunity argument on appeal in her reply brief,she points us to garner and whitfield mel√©ndez rivera,cir,arguing a reasonable police officer in would have been aware that it is a constitutional violation to seize an unarmed,nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead.but these cases in no way clearly establish that officer tavares conduct was in violation of the fourth amendment.mainly because the material facts in both are very different from the ones here.garner and whitfield involved unarmed suspects who were shot while fleeing on foot,and who posed no immediate threat to the lives of the officers or others around them.and as we just discussed,the record in the present case establishes anthony did pose a significant threat of death or serious physical injury when officer tavares shot him.his weapon was his car,which he was driving at the police officers.plus,and more importantly,according to garner,w here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others,it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.at.
the supreme court discussion of qualified immunity in plumhoff which involved a suspect who was killed by police amid a car chase,during which the suspect almost hit an officer with his car sheds more light on our particular inquiry.referring to its decision in brosseau haugen,per curiam,the court outright confirmed that as of february,it was not clearly established that it was unconstitutional to shoot a fleeing driver to protect those whom his flight might endanger.plumhoff.at.brosseau,in turn,had held 
that a police officer did not violate clearly established law when on february,she fired at a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm to other officers on foot who she believed were in the immediate area,occupied vehicles in the driver path,and any other citizens who might be in the area.
id.alterations and ellipses omitted quoting brosseau,at internal quotation marks omitted.the brosseau court had deemed the reasonableness of deadly force by a police officer in response to a car chase to be an area in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case and the caselaw by no means clearly established that the officer conduct violated the fourth amendment.id.citing brosseau,at alterations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
on account of this,the plumhoff court tells us that to overcome a qualified immunity defense in a case where a police officer fired at a fleeing driver to protect those whom his flight might endanger,a plaintiff would have to show at a minimum that the officer conduct is materially different from the conduct in brosseau or that between february,and the date of the alleged constitutional violation there emerged either controlling authority or a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority that would alter our analysis of the qualified immunity question.id.citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.mcgrath can not show either.
the facts in this case are more favorable to the shooting police officer than the facts in brosseau.first,the police officer in brosseau fired at the driver when he had just begun to flee and had not yet driven his car in a dangerous manner.id.whereas here,officer tavares fired his weapon during a car chase that indisputably posed a danger both to the officers involved and to any civilians who happened to be nearby.id.second,the suspect driver in brosseau was not driving towards the police officer when the officer shot him,and thus,did not present as imminent of a threat to the police officer as in this case.
the only,and,case mcgrath cites as authority for her clearly established argument is whitfield,which we already addressed a few pages back.all things said,mcgrath does not point us to any case since brosseau that clearly establishes the unconstitutionality of using deadly force to end a car chase that threatened the physical safety of the police officers and others in the
