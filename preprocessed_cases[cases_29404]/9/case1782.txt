this interlocutory appeal of the district court order denying class certification is before us on this court grant of a petition for review pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.the issue framed by the petition is 
w hether the commencement of a class action tolls the limitations period for intervening class members to bring claims on behalf of a class where a determination has not been made whether those claims are appropriate for class certification 
bernard cutler appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment against cutler class claims alleging violations of section of the securities act of,which creates a private right of action for claims of material misrepresentation or omission in a registration statement.the district court concluded that although the statute of limitations was tolled for cutler individual claims,his claims on behalf of the class were.
under the supreme court decision in american pipe construction utah,d,the filing of a class action complaint tolls the statute of limitations for all members of the putative class who,following the denial of certification,intervene or file an independent action.see also crown,cork seal parker,d.it is therefore established that american pipe tolling applies to intervenors who assert claims in their individual capacity,but this court has not yet decided whether american pipe tolling applies to an intervenor as a proposed class representative where the class has neither been certified nor definitively rejected.
background 
in december,jasmine,a shoe importer headquartered in new jersey,completed an initial public offering ipo of common stock.in november,harry berger,a shareholder,filed suit in federal court on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated purchasers alleging violations of federal and state securities laws in connection with the ipo according to berger,jasmine and members of its management,irving mangel,samuel mangel,melvin twersky,edward maskaly and thomas ciocco,jasmine auditors,arthur andersen llp and fishbein,the ipo underwriter,sands brothers,and two of its principals,jasmine buying agent in hong kong,mckowan lowe,and two of its officers,evelyn wong and tony ngai,and a corporation controlled by the mangels,lujaco,all participated in a scheme to misstate jasmine financial statements to conceal jasmine substantial debt to mckowan lowe.based on similar charges,in the sec had obtained consent judgments against members of jasmine former management,under which they agreed to pay fines ranging from to.securities exchange commission irving mangel,litigation release,docket,available at.tony ngai and evelyn wong of mckowan lowe also settled with the sec.ngai king tak,securities act of release,docket,available at.jasmine itself is currently in chapter liquidation proceedings.
the statute of limitations for liability created under section,the only claim implicated in this appeal,is one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.the district court found that berger was first given inquiry notice by jasmine may,form which disclosed irregularities discovered by bdo seidman,and that warnings in the prospectus by themselves did not create notice.app.at.berger complaint was filed in november,and was thus within the applicable statute of limitations.the district court found a class would present common questions of law and fact,and would be sufficiently numerous,but it rejected berger motion for class certification in august of based on its determination that berger claims failed to meet rule typicality requirement and because berger would not provide adequate representation of the class.app.at.
on september,promptly after the district court opinion was filed,bernard cutler successfully moved to intervene.absent tolling,cutler claims would be,as he did not intervene until well over the expiration of the statute of limitations.the district court determined that cutler could maintain his individual claims because from november,when berger filed his complaint,until august,when berger motion for class certification was denied,the statute of limitations was tolled under american pipe.app.at.the district court declined to evaluate cutler qualifications to represent a subclass of the original berger class,as it rejected cutler proposed section class claim only on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.on november,this court granted cutler rule f petition.rule f was adopted under the power conferred by e.f advisory committee notes.the parties agree that this court reviews de novo the district court summary judgment dismissal of cutler class claims for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.see,lusardi xerox,cir davis thornburgh,cir.
discussion 
on appeal,cutler asserts that the district court erred in refusing to toll the statute of limitations for his class claims.he contends that tolling his class claims is most consistent with the policies undergirding american pipe,and is supported by the authority of the majority of the courts to consider the issue.cutler concedes that his case would be considerably more problematic if the district court had conclusively determined that this case were inappropriate for resolution via class action.to distinguish his own circumstances from that situation he points out that the district court rejected berger prior motions to certify a class based entirely on its perception of berger inadequacies as the proffered representative.he suggests that this case,like many securities actions,presents a paradigmatic example of the sort of claims the class device was designed to help claims too numerous and small to warrant individual action but conjoined representing a substantial case.see,eisenberg gagnon,cir observing c lass actions are a particularly appropriate and desirable means to resolve claims based on the securities laws,since the effectiveness of the securities laws may depend in large measure on the application of the class action device quoting kahan rosenstiel,cir john coffee,understanding the plaintiff attorney the implications of economic theory for private enforcement of law through class and derivative actions,applying economic theory to explain frequent use of class procedure in securities litigation.
the supreme court has enunciated two rationales for the american pipe rule,which tolls the statute of limitations for putative members of a class pending denial of class certification.first,class actions are designed to avoid,rather than encourage,unnecessary filing of repetitious papers and motions.american pipe,at.if the claims of unnamed plaintiffs were not tolled,claimants would have an incentive to file claims themselves to protect their causes of action,precisely the multiplicity of activity which rule was designed to avoid.id.at.see also crown cork seal,at.
the american pipe rule encourages unnamed plaintiffs to rely on the class action already filed on their behalf.the class action procedure is protective of passive,even unwitting,members of the class.as the court observed,n ot until the existence and limits of the class have been established and notice of membership has been sent does a class member have any duty to take note of the suit or to exercise any responsibility with respect to it in order to profit from the eventual outcome of the case.american pipe,at.
second,the court in american pipe held that the tolling rule is consistent with the twin functions of statutes of defendants with timely notice and avoiding stale the action is tolled only by timely service of the class complaint on the defendants by the named plaintiffs.id.at.see also crown cork seal,at.noting l imitations periods are intended to put defendants on notice of adverse claims and to prevent plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights.
cutler argues that the same rationales are equally applicable to tolling his class claims.he finds support in two decisions of this court.in haas pittsburgh national bank,cir,we approved american pipe tolling for a later class representative on a claim that the original representative was without standing to pursue.in,mary haas had filed a class complaint against three banks,one of which was equibank,claiming they had charged usurious interest rates.although she had accounts at the two other banks,she had never had an account at equibank.nonetheless,in a order the district court granted haas class representative status as to all three banks.later,on january,in light of decisions by the supreme court and ninth circuit,the district court determined it had improperly certified haas as to equibank.in the same order the court permitted the amendment of the complaint to add a new class representative who had had an account with equibank.that named plaintiff,john mitchell,was added shortly thereafter.
the district court which had permitted mitchell addition subsequently ruled his claims were.the relevant statute of limitations was two years.equibank had discontinued the practice that was the subject of the complaint more than two years prior to january,the date the district court had first permitted substitution of a new class representative.
on appeal,this court agreed with the district court that haas was not a proper plaintiff as to equibank.however,we reversed and remanded the dismissal of the class claim.we held,based on american pipe,that the statute of limitations for mitchell was tolled from november,the date haas had filed her original complaint.looking to american pipe,we noted that haas complaint provided equibank with notice of the claims against which it would be required to defend and also the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs.id.at.we concluded by observing t hese plaintiffs were in existence at the time the action was originally brought and were described as claimants in the complaint.the only change effectuated by the district court january,order was the prompt addition of a nominal plaintiff who held an equibank card.id.even were haas not controlling,it certainly suggests that american pipe tolling applies to class claims.
in the other case cutler cites,goodman lukens steel,cir,this court reviewed the district court grant of injunctive relief on behalf of a class in a title vii case.we determined as to one claim on which the plaintiffs had prevailed that none of the named representatives were adequate to represent the class.based on the lack of a qualified class representative,we vacated the underlying findings on that claim.id.at.however,in the interest of judicial economy,we directed that the district court explore the possibility of intervention by qualified class representatives on remand,concluding that s uch a suit would be timely since the commencement of the class action tolled the statute of limitations as to members of the class under american pipe,id.at.
defendant arthur andersen seeks to distinguish haas based on our emphasis in that case on the district court certification of a class,and characterizes our observation in goodman as dictum,pointing out that there too the district court had certified a class.andersen also argues that in both haas and goodman a change in the law caused the class representatives to become unfit after the district courts certifications.andersen points out that no class has been certified in this case,and thus no change in the law could prejudice potential class members nor could absent class members have relied on a prior certification.
andersen,joined by sands brothers,cites as authority for its position a number of courts of appeals decisions which treat a related,although cutler argues distinguishable,situation.in those cases the issue was the application of american pipe tolling to subsequent intervenors or sequential class actions after there had been definitive denials of class certification in the original action.for example,in korwek hunt,cir,an early case in this line,the had 
filed a complaint alleging class claims identical theoretically and temporally to those raised in a previously filed class action suit which was denied class certification mainly because of overwhelming manageability difficulties.appellants ignored the district court express finding that the original action was unwieldy,first when attempting to intervene and expand the limited gordon class,and again when filing,what was essentially a duplicate of the original complaint.
id.at.the second circuit refused to extend tolling under those circumstances,concluding,the supreme court in american pipe and crown,cork certainly did not intend to afford plaintiffs the opportunity to argue and reargue the question of class certification by filing new but repetitive complaints.id.
the underlying concern in korwek and the articulated basis for the result was that application of american pipe tolling to successive attempts to certify a previously rejected class would sanction an endless succession of class filings.korwek held that american pipe tolling does not operate to permit plaintiffs to relitigate the propriety of a class action.the great weight of authority has adopted similar reasoning and has rejected the applicability of american pipe tolling to such successive class actions.see,basch ground round,cir an action held to be inappropriate for class treatment does not toll statute of limitations for subsequent class actions andrews orr,cir same robbin fluor,cir same presidio valley farmers ass n,cir rejecting american pipe tolling for two subsequent actions that depended on a first action for their timeliness.
we agree with the rationale of those cases and cutler does not argue that they were decided incorrectly.instead,cutler insists that his situation is different.unlike the korwek plaintiffs,cutler is not attempting to resuscitate a class that a court has held to be inappropriate as a class action.the class certification motion of cutler predecessor,berger by whose complaint cutler would have his claims tolled,was not rejected because of any defects in the class itself but because of berger deficiencies as a class representative.in fact,in its evaluation of berger attempt to certify,the district court found that a class would present common enough questions of law and fact and be sufficiently numerous to merit class treatment.thus cutler argues that although the korwek policy against perpetual relitigation of decided class issues is a sound one,it does not apply to him.
only a handful of courts have considered whether class claims should be tolled when the class device has not been definitively rejected,and they have generally concluded that american pipe tolling is permitted in that situation.many of those cases presented a situation,such as that here,where the original motion for class certification was denied because the class representative was inadequate.
for example,in in re quarterdeck office systems.securities litigation,ghkx,wl,two investors filed a securities fraud action against quarterdeck,its officers and directors,and three venture capital firms following the fall of the company stock shortly after its ipo.id.at.the court rejected their motion for class certification based on their inadequacies as class representatives.however,the court permitted intervention by other investors after the statute of limitations had run,holding that the intervenors class claims were tolled under american pipe.id.at.
the court recognized there were two groups of cases applying the american pipe rule to subsequent class actions.the first group,exemplified by korwek and the ninth circuit decision in robbin fluor,involved either an attempt to file an entirely separate class action lawsuit after the dismissal of an earlier action,or an attempt to bring a later class action after the court had determined that proceeding as a class action was an inappropriate method of resolving the lawsuit.id.at.the district court recognized that the courts have universally refused to extend american pipe tolling to the subsequent class but stated that that group of cases differs from cases involving a later class action that is brought in an attempt to find a more appropriate class rep
