plaintiff angel david morales brought this action against the united states postal service usps or the postal service alleging that he was the target of retaliatory and discriminatory acts provoked by complaints that he filed with the occupational safety and health administration osha.morales also sued the american postal workers union apwu or the union and its president,daniel soto,in the same action,claiming that the union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to submit and process his grievances against usps.
the united states district court for the district of puerto rico referred the case to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the court grant motions for summary judgment submitted by defendants usps and the union.morales filed a lengthy objection to the report and recommendation,essentially restating the allegations in his amended complaint,but also incorporating new exhibits that had not previously been brought to the magistrate judge attention.concluding that plaintiff failed to raise any material issue not adequately addressed by the magistrate judge in his report,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and granted the defendants motions for summary judgment.after careful review,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
we summarize the relevant facts from the summary judgment record,reciting them in the light most favorable to morales.see diaz city of fitchburg,cir.in,morales was hired to work as a distribution and window clerk at the caparra heights,puerto rico,station of the united states postal service.on april,plaintiff filed a letter with osha complaining of dust accumulation,rodent infestation,and other unsanitary conditions at the caparra heights station.osha ordered the station manager to correct the violations by june,but to no avail.morales renewed his osha complaint through certified letters to the osha area director on august,february,and april.finally,on june,osha conducted a formal inspection of the caparra heights station and confirmed plaintiff allegations.osha cited the caparra heights station for at least five violations,and directed the station to remedy the safety and health hazards by october.
at this point,we bifurcate our chronology of the subsequent events for purposes of clarity,turning first to the circumstances that spawned morales claims against the postal service,and concluding with an account of the events underlying plaintiff claims against the union.
events underlying the claims against usps 
throughout the osha complaint process,the agency assured morales that his identity as an osha complainant would be kept confidential,and that federal law forbade usps from retaliating or discriminating against him for.nevertheless,plaintiff amended complaint alleges that by july other employees at the caparra heights station were aware that he had filed osha complaints,and were retaliating against him.that month,morales alerted the postal inspection service that he had received two threats from,but no remedial steps were taken.
in january,plaintiff expressed interest in an available distribution and window clerk position with saturdays and sundays off usps then allegedly the position to offer only sundays and thursdays off so as to decrease its desirability to plaintiff.on march,enrique lopez,the caparra heights station supervisor,issued a letter of warning to morales for unsatisfactory performance,citing the plaintiff abuse of coffee breaks.two months later,lopez removed morales from his position as a business reply mail clerk,postage due clerk and express mail clerk and replaced him with a female.in july,tires on morales car were punctured on two separate occasions while the car was parked in the secured caparra heights station parking lot.
on october,morales contact at osha informed him that the agency had no authority to protect postal employees from retaliation,and urged the plaintiff to request usps to conduct an internal investigation.without seeking morales consent,osha forwarded his file to the postal service,thereby confirming to usps that plaintiff was in fact the.from that point on,the retaliation and discrimination directed at plaintiff worsened considerably.morales alleged that in december he was victimized by episodes of and bullying,and later that month he was suspended one week for violating a new uniform policy instituted by lopez.in january,a postal employee poured sugar into the gas tank of plaintiff car,nearly resulting in a traffic accident.on at least three occasions in february,plaintiff supervisor dismissed him from work without pay because there was no work available for him.finally,on february,plaintiff was transferred from the caparra heights station to the general post office in san juan.morales alleges that he was removed from the caparra heights station because accused him of being a safety hazard and a homosexual.
these events prompted morales to file four equal employment opportunity eeo complaints with the usps plaintiff filed his first precomplaint on february,in the aftermath of usps decision to alter the allotted days off for the available distribution and window clerk position.his second eeo precomplaint,submitted april,alleged that a new coffee and lunch break policy instituted at the caparra heights station unfairly discriminated against male postal employees.after the usps failed to respond to his first precomplaint,morales filed a formal eeo complaint on april,alleging that usps unlawfully retaliated against him by posting the available window clerk position with rest days rather than rest days.he subsequently filed a second formal eeo complaint on september,citing the discriminatory break policy and another episode of retaliation.plaintiff finally left the employ of the usps in early september,allegedly as the result of a constructive discharge.
events underlying the claims against apwu 
in,long before the events at issue here,morales had been appointed shop steward of the caparra heights station by defendant soto predecessor,but was removed shortly thereafter for reasons that are unclear.six years later,the union elected soto as its new president,and morales petitioned him repeatedly for a second tour as shop steward.soto capitulated,appointing morales to the position on january.however,plaintiff tenure ended abruptly three weeks later after soto received complaints that morales was acting inappropriately toward,and abusing his union status to avenge himself on usps management.
morales alleges that his dismissal as union shop steward was motivated by a conspiracy between usps and apwu to remove him from his job at the caparra heights station,in violation of the union bylaws.plaintiff also claims that the union failed to process his grievances arising from two february dismissals from work,or take any action with respect to his constructive discharge.
morales filed an amended complaint consolidating his numerous allegations of wrongdoing into four counts.count i,entitled retaliation and discrimination,alleges that usps unlawfully retaliated against plaintiff for filing osha claims,eeo complaints,and unfair labor practice charges.count ii,entitled conspiracy,accuses the usps and apwu of conspir ing against plaintiff to cause his removal as caparra heights shop steward and later on his removal from caparra heights station.count iii alleges that usps violated the collective bargaining agreement cba,and that apwu breached its duty of fair representation by arbitrarily,capriciously,in bad faith invidiously failing to process timely plaintiff grievances through usps grievance procedure.finally,count iv claims intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the outrageous acts and omissions,retaliatory conduct,and discrimination perpetrated by usps and apwu.
as a preliminary matter,plaintiff failure to cite any statutory basis for relief in his amended complaint complicates our review of his claims.however,under the liberal notice pleading requirements of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,this deficiency is not fatal to plaintiff case 
a complaint need not point to the appropriate statute or law in order to raise a claim for relief under rule a complaint sufficiently raises a claim even if it points to no legal theory or even if it points to the wrong legal theory as a basis for that claim,as long as relief is possible under any set of facts that could be established consistent with the allegations.

this query is not the protections built into the cba parallel those of title vii,the two remedial schemes contain discrete exhaustion requirements that may bar their availability to plaintiff as sources of relief.appellees urge us to find that morales amended complaint relied entirely on the cba,and failed to allege properly a title vii claim.that contention ignores both the substance and structure of morales amended complaint.not only is the complaint replete with references to plaintiff eeo initiatives,see infra note,but the retaliation and discrimination claims are set forth in a separate count to distinguish them from morales claims for violations of the cba.moreover,morales cited to title vii both in his opposition to summary judgment and in his appellate brief.therefore,we believe the more prudent course is to broadly construe the allegations in plaintiff amended complaint as alleging a cause of action under both the cba and title vii.see.f all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.foster med.employees pension plan healthco,cir with this approach in mind,we turn to the counts of the amended complaint.
breach of collective bargaining agreement 
in accepting the recommendations of the magistrate judge,the district court properly characterized count iii of morales amended complaint as advancing a hybrid breach of contract and fair representation claim.the supreme court has observed that 
s uch a suit,as a formal matter,comprises two causes of action.the suit against the employer rests on of the labor management relations act,since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement.the suit against the union is one for breach of the union duty of fair representation,which is implied under the scheme of the national labor relations act.yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent.to prevail against either the company or the union,must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating a breach of duty by the union.
delcostello int l broth.of teamsters,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also local terry,d fant new eng.power serv,cir.the dual requirements for alleging a hybrid claim are predicated on the theory that an employee working under a cba is ordinarily required to exhaust the grievance procedures provided in that agreement before bringing suit.delcostello,at.a rigid exhaustion requirement,however,works an injustice to the employee when the union representing the employee in the procedure acts in such a discriminatory,dishonest,arbitrary or perfunctory fashion as to breach its duty of fair representation.id.at.under these circumstances,an employee who has not exhausted the grievance procedures outlined in the cba may nonetheless file suit against the employer if he can demonstrate that the union breached its duty of fair representation,such that the grievance procedures mandated by the cba provided no meaningful recourse.id.
courts conduct a tripartite inquiry to determine whether a union breached its duty of fair representation so materially as to render the cba grievance procedures inadequate.the three separate levels of inquiry are as follows did the union act arbitrarily did the union act discriminatorily or did the union act in bad faith.ooley schwitzer,household,cir citing air line pilots ass n,int l,d.in order to successfully defend against a motion for summary judgment on a duty of fair representation claim,the plaintiff must point the court to record evidence supporting any one or all of these elements.griffin air line pilots ass n,int l,cir.the supreme court has stressed that our evaluation of any such evidence must be highly deferential to the union,at.quoting ford motor huffman.
the deference accorded unions defending hybrid claims imposes a heavy burden on employees like morales alleging a breach of the duty of fair representation.against this backdrop,the district court did not err in its determination that morales submissions failed to provide the requisite record evidence of irrational union activity falling outside a wide range of reasonableness.id.plaintiff amended complaint and opposition to summary judgment instead raise bare allegations that apwu violated its bylaws by perfunctorily dismissing him from his position as shop steward,and unduly delayed or failed to process several of plaintiff grievances.in response,apwu motion for summary judgment references specific provisions in the union bylaws authorizing the union president to dismiss a shop steward without providing any prior process the exhibits appended to apwu summary judgment motion also include letters to morales meticulously documenting the progression of his various grievances against usps,and reflect that apwu had previously sought and obtained time extensions from usps to ensure that any grievances that were delayed were not defaulted.
in short,after reviewing the summary judgment record,we conclude that morales failed to proffer sufficient evidence that the union breached its duty of fair representation by acting arbitrarily,discriminatorily,or in bad faith,at.consequently,plaintiff fails to satisfy the first of the dual hybrid claim requirements,see delcostello,at,and we need not separately assess morales allegations that usps violated the cba.
retaliation and discrimination under title vii 
adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court concluded that morales retaliation and discrimination claims were only actionable under the collective bargaining agreement.however,it is well settled that title vii of the civil rights act of provides relief independent of the remedial scheme outlined in the cba.in alexander,d,the supreme court concluded that 
the legislative history of title vii manifests a congressional intent to allow an individual to pursue independently his rights under both title vii and other applicable state and federal statutes.the clear inference is that title vii was designed to supplement rather than supplant,existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.
id.at.the alexander court accordingly ruled that plaintiffs who invoke the grievance procedures of the collective bargaining agreement do not thereby forfeit their private right of action under title vii.id.at.hence,alexander and its progeny,see wright universal.serv,d,support the proposition that the presence of an provision in a collective bargaining agreement does not foreclose a postal employee private right of action under title vii.
the seventh circuit decision in roman postal service,cir,relied upon by the district court,is not to the contrary.in roman,the postmaster of the post office where roman worked accused him of falsifying his employment application form,and allegedly promised him a position at another postal facility if he chose to resign from his current job rather than be fired.after the postmaster failed to deliver on this promise,roman filed suit in federal district court alleging that usps violated his procedural due process rights by fraudulently inducing him to resign from his employment.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected the plaintiff argument that the constitution itself furnished a right of action for his procedural due process claim,observing that congress has expressly authorized the adoption of final and binding grievance procedures in the postal service collective bargaining agreements.id.at quoting ellis postal service,cir.accordingly,roman reco
