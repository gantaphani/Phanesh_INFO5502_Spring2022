karen balas appeals the district court denial of relief on her claims of discrimination,retaliation,and hostile work environment,brought under title vii of the civil rights act of,title vii,as well as wrongful discharge,assault,and battery,brought under virginia law,against huntington ingalls industries,huntington ingalls,the successor to her former employer,northrop grumman corporation on appeal,balas argues that the district court erred in construing the scope of her charge of discrimination,denying her leave to amend her complaint,and granting summary judgment to huntington ingalls on her claims of retaliatory discharge,assault,and battery.for the reasons ably articulated by the district court,we affirm.
according to balas,huntington ingalls subject ed her to an ongoing sexually hostile work environment that included unwanted requests from her supervisor for sex,numerous sexual comments,sexually explicit posters knowingly being allowed in her workplace,employees massaging one another,sexually offensive pictures,and unwanted touching.her complaint centers on the actions of her supervisor,brad price,who,she alleges,frequently and repeatedly commented to her about how much he liked her attire and physical appearance referred to her as a good woman frequently and repeatedly entered her small work space and her personal space and frequently talked about his sex life to her.according to balas complaint,i n or around april,price solicited sex from her.
in august,balas wore a pair of ripped jeans to work.price,apparently in response to a complaint,sent her home to change into more appropriate work attire.balas alleges that men dressed in similarly ripped jeans were not asked to change.she alleges that upon returning to work,she complained to price that his request for her to change clothes was discriminatory.
in january,price hugged balas.balas alleges that price trapped her in her work space and willfully,wantonly and forcibly put his arms around her,hugging her against her will.it is undisputed,however,that this hug occurred after balas had given price a gift of christmas cookies for his family,and that immediately prior to the hug,price had thanked her for the cookies and told her,you never cease to amaze me.
balas alleges that she repeatedly complained of gender discrimination and a hostile work environment.she asserts that because of these complaints,she was repeatedly denied promotions.
on february,balas was fired for falsifying her february,time records.another female employee was fired the same day for the same infraction.it is undisputed that balas did not properly account for taking off over an hour of time.price alerted cindi wolfe,his human resources representative,and roger lowman,the department manager,of the infraction.the three of them undertook an investigation of the incident.lowman,who was never made aware of balas alleged complaint to price about the jeans incident,was solely responsible for the decision to fire balas.
on july,balas submitted an intake questionnaire to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.she attached to her questionnaire a letter laying out her complaints in greater detail,including being denied opportunities for promotions,a personal vendetta wolfe held against her,and the circumstances of the jeans incident.the eeoc prepared a charge on her behalf,alleging sex discrimination and retaliatory termination,which balas signed on july.the only specific occurrences referenced in the charge were her termination and the jeans incident.the eeoc charge listed february,the date of her termination as the earliest and latest date of discrimination.the continuing action box on the charge was left blank.
on october,balas sent a second letter to the eeoc providing further details related to price and the alleged sexual harassment.later that month,the eeoc prepared an amended charge,which included the allegation that price inappropriately hugged her in january.the hug was the only additional fact alleged in the amended charge.the earliest date of discrimination section was left blank,but,again,the continuing action box was not checked.
the eeoc dismissed balas charge and issued her right to sue letter on february.she subsequently filed suit in the district court pro se.in her complaint,balas alleged title vii claims for failure to promote,retaliatory termination,and hostile work environment based on sexual harassment.she also alleged state law claims for wrongful discharge,assault,battery,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
huntington ingalls filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,which the district court granted in part.the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider allegations in balas title vii claim that were not included in her eeoc charge.in determining the scope of that charge,the court declined to consider balas intake questionnaire or letters to the eeoc.the court concluded that balas only properly alleged discriminatory or retaliatory termination and harassment by her supervisor.it went on,however,to dismiss her harassment claim.
in her complaint,balas alleged that huntington ingalls wrongfully discharged her by terminating her in order to silence her opposition to discrimination and harassment in the workplace,in violation of what she asserted is the public policy articulated in the virginia human rights act vhra,et.balas sought to amend her complaint to include other sources of public policy in support of her claim.the district court determined that balas proposed amendments would be futile because the complaint,even if amended,would not sufficiently state a claim for wrongful discharge.the court thus denied balas leave to amend her complaint and dismissed her wrongful discharge claim.
the court found that balas had stated a claim of retaliatory termination under title vii and denied huntington ingalls motion for judgment on the pleadings as to that claim.in considering the merits of balas retaliatory termination claim on summary judgment,the court concluded that balas sufficiently alleged that she had engaged in a protected activity in complaining to price about discrimination and that huntington ingalls took an adverse employment action against her by firing her.it determined,however,that she failed to present more than merely colorable evidence of a causal link between the two events,and granted summary judgment to huntington ingalls.
the court also determined that balas had stated claims for assault and battery.upon considering the merits of those claims,however,it concluded that price hug could not amount to either a battery or an assault,and granted summary judgment to huntington ingalls.
balas now appeals the district court dismissal of the majority of her title vii claims on the basis of lack of jurisdiction,its denial of leave to amend her complaint,and its grant of summary judgment to huntington ingalls on her retaliatory termination,assault,and battery claims 
balas first argues that the district court erred by considering only her eeoc charge and not the intake questionnaire and letters she sent to the eeoc in evaluating her title vii claims.she also argues that she should have been granted leave to amend her complaint to include additional sources of public policy upon which to base her wrongful discharge claim.
balas further challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to huntington ingalls.with respect to her title vii retaliatory discharge claim,she argues that a reasonable person could find a connection between her alleged complaints to price regarding sexual harassment and discrimination and lowman decision to fire her.she also argues that she presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that price committed the torts of assault and battery.
we address each of these arguments in turn.
we first take up balas argument that the district court erred in considering only her amended eeoc charge,and not the contents of her intake questionnaire or the two letters she submitted to the eeoc.the import of her argument derives from the fact that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over title vii claims for which a plaintiff has failed to exhaust administrative remedies.jones calvert,cir.we review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc.
an employee seeking redress for discrimination can not file suit until she has exhausted the administrative process.see b.the requirement of filing a charge with the eeoc against the party sued serves two principal purposes first,it notifies the charged party of the asserted violation.secondly,it brings the charged party before the eeoc and permits effectuation of the civil rights act primary goal,the securing of voluntary compliance with the law.dickey greene,cir,rev on other grounds,cir quoting bowe colgate palmolive,cir.the filing of an administrative charge,therefore,is not simply a formality to be rushed through so that an individual can quickly file his subsequent lawsuit.chacko patuxent,cir.rather,the charge itself serves a vital function in the process of remedying an unlawful employment practice.
an employee complaining of illegal discrimination must first contact the eeoc and present it with information supporting the allegations.b.after receiving an employee intake questionnaire and any other information the employee has provided,the eeoc typically assists the employee with filing a charge.this assistance often includes drafting a charge as it did here and then asking the employee to sign it.see equal employment opportunity comm n,the charge handling process,available at last visited.
the eeoc sends a notice and copy of the charge to the employer.b.this notice gives the employer the chance to voluntarily conduct its own investigation and attempt to resolve any discriminatory actions internally.see chacko,at.concurrently,the eeoc investigates the charge.
the filing of a charge also initiates settlement,the primary way that claims of discrimination are resolved.id.this procedure reflects a congressional intent to use administrative conciliation as the primary means of handling claims,thereby encouraging quicker,less formal,and less expensive resolution of disputes.chris tenet,cir.prior to making any determination as to the merit of a charge,the eeoc may encourage and facilitate settlement between the parties.
if the eeoc finds reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,the commission shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference,conciliation,and persuasion.b.if the eeoc can not reach a voluntary settlement with the employer,the agency may file a lawsuit or issue a notice of right to sue to the employee.if the eeoc does not make a reasonable cause determination or the employee requests a right to sue,the agency may issue one,thus allowing the employee to file suit.
in any subsequent lawsuit alleging unlawful employment practices under title vii,a federal court may only consider those allegations included in the eeoc charge.see evans techs.applications serv,cir the allegations contained in the administrative charge of discrimination generally operate to limit the scope of any subsequent judicial complaint.if the plaintiff title vii claims exceed the scope of the eeoc charge and any charges that would naturally have arisen from an investigation thereof,they are procedurally barred.chacko,at quoting dennis cnty.of fairfax,cir.
in determining what claims a plaintiff properly alleged before the eeoc,we may look only to the charge filed with that agency.we have noted that it would be objectively illogical to view a private letter from a complaining party to the eeoc as constructively amending a formal charge,given that one of the purposes of requiring a party to file charges with the eeoc is to put the charged party on notice of the claims raised against it.sloop mem.l mission,cir.sloop reasoning applies here,despite balas contentions to the contrary.balas argues that her letters,written before formal charges were filed,should be treated differently.we disagree.given that balas employer was never apprised of the contents of her letters nor could she expect it to have been,the point at which they were written makes no difference for the goals of putting her employer on notice or encouraging conciliation.
while we recognize that eeoc charges often are not completed by lawyers and as such must be construed with utmost liberality,alvarado bd.of trs.of montgomery cmty,cir quoting kaplan int l alliance of theatrical stage,cir,we are not at liberty to read into administrative charges allegations they do not contain.instead,persons alleging discrimination have a different form of recourse if they determine that their initial charge does not read as they intended they may,as balas did,file an amended charge with the eeoc.see b the intake questionnaire and the letters balas submitted to the eeoc can not be read as part of her formal discrimination charge without contravening the purposes of title vii.
balas also argues that she should not be penalized for the eeoc negligence in failing to send a copy of her intake questionnaire and letters to the eeoc to her employer however,she points to no authority and we find none requiring the eeoc to undertake such an action or providing the eeoc with the discretion to do so we decline to impose such an obligation upon the eeoc.
any title vii claims based on allegations included only in balas intake questionnaire and letters are therefore outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.the district court properly declined to consider those allegations not included in balas eeoc charge.
we next consider the district court denial of leave for balas to amend her complaint.leave to amend a pleading should be freely given when justice so requires.a.l eave to amend a pleading should be denied only when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party,there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party,or the amendment would be futile.edwards city of goldsboro,cir quoting johnson oroweat foods,cir.the court determined that balas proposed amendments would be futile.we review the denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion.hcmf allen,cir.
virginia generally adheres to the common law doctrine of employment.miller sevamp.however,an employee may bring a tortious wrongful discharge claim if her termination violates a state public policy as expressed in a statute.bowman state bank of keysville.the supreme court of virginia has consistently characterized this exception as narrow.city of virginia beach harris.that court has recognized a discharge based on an employee refusal to engage in a criminal act as a basis for a wrongful discharge action.rowan tractor supply.
balas contends that she was discharged for refusing to engage in illegal activity and sought to amend her complaint to reference additional crimes she declined to commit.specifically,she would have amended her complaint to allege that her discharge followed from her refusal to commit three crimes under virginia law fornication,see lewd and lascivious behavior,see and sexual assault,see.we consider each in turn.
in support of her argument regarding the first of these policies,balas cites mitchem counts.there,the supreme court of virginia determined that a plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for wrongful discharge based on virginia statutes proscribing fornication and lewd and lascivious behavior.however,as the district court correctly determined here,mitchem application of virginia code,prohibiting fornication,was abrogated by martin ziherl,making balas proposed amendment futile.in martin,the virginia supreme court struck down as unconstitutional,because by subjecting certain private sexual conduct between two consenting adults to criminal penalties it infringes on the rights of adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.at quoting lawrence texas,d.
amending her complaint to reference virginia public policy against lewd and lascivious behavior would likewise be futile.virginia code,which makes it illegal to lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit and to engage in open and gross lewdness and la
