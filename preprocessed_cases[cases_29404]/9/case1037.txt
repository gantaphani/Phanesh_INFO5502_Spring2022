sandra mcbride appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,granting the motion of bic consumer products manufacturing company,bic for summary judgment.mcbride complaint alleged that bic violated the americans with disabilities act of ada,et,by terminating her employment rather than reasonably accommodating her disability.the district court rejected mcbride sole claim on the ground that she had entirely failed to identify any accommodation that bic could have pursued to allow mcbride to continue in her current position or any vacant position for which mcbride was qualified.we affirm for the same reason,regardless of whether bic engaged in a sufficient interactive process at the time of mcbride termination.
background 
bic produces writing instruments,shavers,and lighters.in the course of the manufacture of these products,bic uses a variety of materials with regard to which it must have on file a material safety data sheet on the ground that they present either a physical or health hazard.see g requiring employers to have a material safety data sheet in the workplace for each hazardous chemical which they use id.c defining the term hazardous chemical to mean any chemical which is a physical hazard or a health hazard.fumes from some of these materials are present in the manufacturing areas of bic facility.
as of june,mcbride,an employee of bic since,was working as a utility operator in the cartridge assembly area of bic ink systems department.her work in this position involved exposure to various chemical fumes.at that time,mcbride reported to bic that she had become ill,suffering from a respiratory ailment as well as panic and anxiety attacks.she accordingly began treatment under the care of a variety of medical and psychiatric practitioners,who recommended that she be placed on medical leave.shortly thereafter,mcbride took such a leave of absence,as allowed by her employment contract,for a period of up to twelve months.while mcbride was on leave,bic received periodic updates on her condition from her treating psychiatrist,james ciarcia.on may,ciarcia cleared mcbride to return to work,following which mcbride contacted bic about the possibility of resuming her employment.in connection with this request,bic received instructions from ciarcia regarding restrictions that should be placed on the conditions of her employment these restrictions included,among others,complete avoidance of chemical,solvent or ink fumes,as well as any other hydrocarbon fumes,and avoidance of any inappropriate hassles or threatening confrontations.
on june,mcbride met with a bic supervisor after having been examined by a doctor in bic employ.during this meeting,the supervisor offered to provide mcbride with a respirator that would deliver breathable air in order to accommodate ciarcia requirement.mcbride,however,rejected this offer.neither party appears to have discussed any additional potential accommodations.at the conclusion of the meeting,the bic supervisor instructed mcbride not to report for work the next day.roughly one month later,following the expiration of the period during which mcbride was contractually entitled to remain on medical leave,she received notice that bic was terminating her employment on the grounds that she had refused to accept bic proposed accommodation of her disability and failed to propose any alternative accommodation that would allow her to return to work.
mcbride subsequently filed this action in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,asserting,as described above,a claim for failure to accommodate under the ada in the course of discovery,bic revealed that a variety of its positions of employment were vacant at or around the time of mcbride termination.reassignment to many of these positions,however,would have involved a promotion from mcbride current position.moreover,nearly all of the remaining jobs required extensive experience in the relevant field of work,proficiency in the use of various business software packages,and,in many cases,a college degree.of particular relevance,each of the several available secretarial positions required at least three years of secretarial experience.finally,although a vacant quality assurance technician position did not require substantial related experience and reassignment thereto would not have involved a promotion,performance of the duties of that position would have required mcbride to spend time in bic manufacturing areas,where she would be exposed to chemical fumes.
ultimately,the district court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by bic and entered judgment against mcbride on the basis that she had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an accommodation of her disability that bic could have pursued to allow her to continue her employment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see pilgrim luther,cir.summary judgment is warranted only where,construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also mathirampuzha potter,cir.
as a preliminary matter,the district court concluded that mcbride should be deemed to have admitted a variety of facts described in a request for admission submitted by bic on the basis that she had failed to respond to the request in a timely fashion and that withdrawal of such admissions would prejudice bic.a a matter is admitted unless,within days after being served,the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney.mcbride failed to raise any challenge to this ruling in her primary brief.although she briefly mentioned the district court determination in her reply brief,we ordinarily will not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.see jp morgan chase bank altos hornos de,de,cir.mcbride,moreover,did not genuinely challenge the district court decision,asserting instead merely and somewhat confusingly that it is inappropriate for bic to rely upon any of the purported admissions on appeal in light of the district court simultaneous conclusion that it would have granted summary judgment even in their absence.that being said,we,like the district court,would reach the same conclusion regardless of the resolution of this matter.accordingly,we need not address it further.
the ada prohibits discriminat ion against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to,inter alia,discharge of employees.a see also sista cdc ixis,cir.claims alleging disability discrimination in violation of the ada are subject to the analysis originally established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see sista,at.a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case the employer must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence a legitimate reason for the discharge and the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext.id.
discrimination in violation of the ada includes,inter alia,not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.b a see also brady stores,cir.in addition,for the purposes of the ada,a qualified individual is an individual who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.in light of this substantive standard,a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of disability discrimination arising from a failure to accommodate by showing each of the following 
p laintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ada an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability with reasonable accommodation,plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue and the employer has refused to make such accommodations.
graves finch pruyn,cir quoting rodal anesthesia group of onondaga,cir internal quotation mark omitted.the parties do not dispute that mcbride has made a sufficient showing that she was disabled at the time of her termination and that bic was covered by the ada and on notice of mcbride disability.our inquiry therefore concerns only whether mcbride made a sufficient showing that,with reasonable accommodation,she could perform the essential functions of the relevant job and that bic failed to make the appropriate accommodations.
mcbride manifestly failed to make such a showing.in the context of the ada,reasonable accommodation may include,inter alia,modification of job duties and schedules,alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed,acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties,and,under certain circumstances,reassignment to a vacant position.b see also jackan state dep t of labor,cir.the plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment,including the existence of a vacant position for which she is qualified see jackan,at borkowski valley cent.sch,cir.mcbride provided no evidence that there existed any potential accommodation that would have allowed her to continue to work,regardless of the form such an accommodation would have taken.
putting aside for the moment the possibility of reassignment to a vacant position,mcbride entirely failed to present any evidence of an accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position.at her june,meeting with a representative of bic,she suggested no potential accommodations that bic could pursue and rejected the potential accommodation,use of a respirator,that was proposed by bic.even after substantial opportunity for discovery in the course of this action,mcbride did not identify either to the district court or to this court any potential accommodation.indeed,both at the hearing before the district court on bic motion for summary judgment and at oral argument in this appeal,she conceded that she was unaware of any such accommodation.her claim,then,necessarily rests on the availability of reassignment.
mcbride,however,has also failed to identify a suitable position to which she could have been transferred.an ada plaintiff does not satisfy her burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that her employer could have reassigned her.instead,she must demonstrate the existence,at or around the time when accommodation was sought,of an existing vacant position to which she could have been reassigned.see jackan,at see also shannon city transit,cir t he position sought must be vacant within a reasonable amount of time.citing pt,app.o norville staten island,cir a n employer need not reassign an employee if no position is vacant.nor is the employer obliged to create a new position to accommodate the employee.citation omitted.
additionally,the identified position must be one for which she was qualified.see norville,at.an employee is qualified for a position only if she can perform its essential functions.see rodal,at jackan,at norville,at see also.although the term essential functions is not defined by the ada,regulations promulgated by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc indicate that it encompasses the fundamental job duties of the employment position.n see also rodal,at.evidence of whether a particular job duty constitutes an essential function includes,inter alia,the employer judgment as to what functions of a job are essential and a written description prepared by the employer before advertising and interviewing applicants.see also n.indeed,a court must give substantial deference to an employer judgment as to whether a function is essential to the proper performance of a job.see rodal,at shannon,at.eeoc regulations further indicate that,to be qualified for a position,a plaintiff must in addition satisf y the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements of the employment position.m see also mulloy acushnet,cir noting that,in order to establish that she is qualified for a particular position,an ada plaintiff must show,inter alia,that she possesses the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements for the position cravens blue cross blue shield of.city,cir noting that the determination of whether an employee is qualified for a particular position involves,inter alia,inquiry into whether the individual meets the necessary prerequisites for the job,such as education,experience,training,and the like dalton,cir the critical factor is the match between the employee knowledge,skills,and abilities,and the legitimate requirements for other positions with the employer.finally,the identified position can not be such that reassignment to it would have involved a promotion see office of the architect of the capitol office of compliance,lucas grainger,cir cravens,at smith midland brake,cir en banc malabarba chi.tribune,cir cassidy detroit edison,cir shiring runyon,cir see also pt,app.o a n employer is not required to promote an individual with a disability as an accommodation.
mcbride has presented no evidence that,at or about the time of her termination,there existed a vacant position at bic for which she was qualified and reassignment to which would not have involved her promotion.the record indicates that reassignment to most of the jobs that were vacant at the time of mcbride termination would have required bic to promote mcbride.in addition,bic descriptions of the vast majority of vacant positions indicate that they required extensive applicable professional experience,proficiency with a variety of business software packages,and,in many cases,a college degree.mcbride has provided no evidence challenging the conclusion that reassignment to such positions would have amounted to a promotion or indicating either that bic job descriptions do not adequately describe the essential functions of and requisite qualifications for the identified positions or that she possessed the requisite educational background or professional skills and experience.neither her conclusory assertion in an affidavit that she was qualified for the positions nor her counsel unsubstantiated statements before the district court remedy this defect.moreover,mcbride initial application for employment at bic,while admittedly many years old,suggests that she does not possess the necessary qualifications for the positions bearing these characteristics.these positions,then,can not qualify as positions to which mcbride could have been reassigned as an accommodation for her disability.
indeed,mcbride appears to recognize as much in her argument before this court,as she focuses here entirely on the three positions of quality assurance specialist,secretary,and receptionist,rather than the broad swathe of vacant positions identified through discovery.despite mcbride protests,however,none of these positions qualifies as a vacant position to which she should have been reassigned as an accommodation of her disability.the uncontroverted evidence establishes that the quality assurance technician position,like mcbride position,required the employee to be physically present in the manufacturing areas of bic facility where she would have been exposed to chemical fumes,a condition which would have been incompatible with mcbride disability and presumably,in light of mcbride representations regarding accommodations,could not have been ameliorated.all of the vacant secretarial positions required extensive secretarial experience and familiarity with a variety of business software,which,as already noted,there is no evidence that mcbride possessed.finally,there is no indication in the record that there were any vacant receptionist positions at or about the time of mcbride dismissal.
mcbride argues that her failure to identify an accommodation of any form that would have allowed her to continue employment at bic should be excused in light of bic purported failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process intende
