after a jury found for gary bennett in a whistleblower action,his employer,the city of holyoke the city,sought to set aside the verdict by reason of the plaintiff failure to comply with a statutory notice requirement.alternatively,it asked the district court to defenestrate the ancillary award of prejudgment interest.the court rejected both of these overtures,and the city appealed.we affirm the city has not properly preserved the first issue and the massachusetts whistleblower statute broadly authorizes awards of prejudgment interest against municipal defendants.
background 
the plaintiff served as a holyoke police officer for years.the district court opinion on summary judgment,bennett city of holyoke,d,chronicles the long history of rancor between the plaintiff and the police department,and we need not rehearse that history here.for our purposes,it suffices to say that,during his tenure,the plaintiff became a crusader against what he perceived as corruption at the highest levels of the police department.in time,he filed a complaint on behalf of a fellow officer with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad and shared the results of his internal investigations with the state attorney general.
according to the plaintiff,these steps provoked immediate retaliation by those in power.they disciplined him for failing to comply with a departmental policy requiring officers to follow certain procedures before complaining to outside agencies.then,they twice passed him over for promotion to lieutenant despite his outstanding test scores.the plaintiff responded by filing another mcad complaint,this time on his own behalf.the relationship between the parties went steadily downhill from there.
in,the plaintiff retired.in short order,he sued the city,the mayor,and several police department hierarchs.his complaint,filed in a massachusetts state court,limned mainly claims but included a claim brought pursuant to.seizing upon this appendage,the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.see.
in due course,the district court disposed of several of the claims on summary judgment.bennett,d at.it then embarked upon a trial with respect to the remaining claims.the jury found for the defendants on most of those claims but returned a verdict against the city on the whistleblower claim.the court subsequently added in prejudgment interest and entered judgment accordingly.
the city responded with,inter alia,a motion to alter or amend the judgment.e,by striking the award of prejudgment interest.the district court denied the motion.the city subsequently moved for relief from the judgment.b,on the ground that the plaintiff had not complied with the notice provisions of the whistleblower statute.the court denied that motion as well.this appeal followed.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits of the appeal,we must address a threshold matter.the plaintiff notes that the city filed its notice of appeal a day late and maintains that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.the city parries this thrust by pointing to the district court extension of the filing date.the plaintiff replies that the extension was improvidently granted and,thus,impuissant.
we recount the background needed to resolve this impasse.the applicable rule requires the filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case,not involving the federal government,within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.this period does not begin to run until after the entry of the order disposing of a motion for attorneys fees so long as the district court extends the time to appeal under rule.fed.a a iii.the district court granted such an extension here,so that a notice of appeal would be considered timely if filed within thirty days of the court adjudication of the plaintiff application for attorneys fees.
on march,the court issued a memorandum and order in which it awarded attorneys fees to the plaintiff.that order started the running of the period.see fed.a a i providing that entry occurs at docketing for those orders the disposition of which does not require a separate document see also.a c stating that an order disposing of a motion for attorneys fees does not require a separate document.thus,the last day for filing a notice of appeal was monday,april.see.a explaining how time periods are computed.
on march,however,the district court issued an amended judgment that,in effect,replicated its march order.on april,day after the city filed its notice of appeal and moved for a extension.it asserted that it had been misled by the gratuitous entry of the amended judgment on march and had assumed erroneously,as matters turned out that the appeal period would run from the date of that amended judgment.
the district court accepted this explanation and granted the extension.in doing so,the court acknowledged that its own actions in particular,the entry of the amended judgment had created confusion over the date of the attorneys fee ruling.on this basis,the court determined that the city neglect,not filing its notice of appeal on or before april was excusable.the plaintiff challenges this determination.
although the time parameters for filing notices of appeal usually are deemed mandatory and jurisdictional,browder,dep t of,d,those time parameters may be extended upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.fed.a a ii.that is precisely what the lower court found in this instance.we review a trial court decision as to the existence vel non of excusable neglect for abuse of discretion.mirpuri act,cir.we discern none here.
under the excusable neglect rubric,courts are permitted,when appropriate,to accept late filings caused by inadvertence or mistake.see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d interpreting excusable neglect under the bankruptcy rules see also briggs stratton,cir holding that pioneer exposition of excusable neglect applies equally to fed.a.a trial court determination as to whether an instance of neglect is or is not excusable has a significant equitable component and must give due regard to the totality of the relevant circumstances surrounding the movant lapse.pioneer,at.
here,the circumstances plainly support the district court ruling.the delay in this case was very brief the entry of an essentially duplicative order obfuscated matters,rendering the delay as the district court put it understandable and there is no indication of either bad faith or undue prejudice.the lower court,which had the best coign of vantage,concluded that a delay,in these circumstances,constituted excusable there is no principled way that we can label that conclusion an abuse of discretion.where,as here,a district court takes an unusual procedural step and then admits that its actions have caused confusion over the proper time for filing a notice of appeal,an appellate court should not deem the decision to grant a brief extension of the filing date an abuse of discretion without some compelling justification for doing so.see,alpine state bank ohio casualty ins,cir see also mirpuri,at noting that a plausible misconstruction of a court order sometimes may satisfy the requirements for excusable neglect.there is no such justification here.
for these reasons,we conclude that we have jurisdiction over the city appeal.
iii.the whistleblower claim 
we turn next to the first of the city two assignments of error.to recapitulate,after judgment had entered on the whistleblower claim,the city sought to set it aside on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the notice requirement of the massachusetts whistleblower statute.laws ch.the district court denied the motion,ruling that t he notice issue,in the form now presented,was not raised with sufficient clarity before trial to justify disturbing the verdict.we review that ruling for abuse of discretion.see farm credit bank,cir.we will find an abuse of discretion when we are convinced that the district court has made an error of law or has reached a plainly erroneous decision.id.at.
the massachusetts whistleblower statute prohibits a public a municipality.laws ch.a from taking any retaliatory action against an employee who engages in protected activities.retaliatory action is defined to include discharge,suspension,demotion,or any other action that adversely affects the terms and conditions of the employment.id.a.protected activities include disclosing to a public body an activity,policy or practice of the employer that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law.id.b.the term public body is defined broadly to include legislative,judicial,administrative,and law enforcement agencies at the federal,state,and local levels.id.a.
the whistleblower statute gives an aggrieved employee a private right of action against his or her employer.id.d.most whistleblower are exceptions,but we shall assume for argument sake that none applies satisfy a statutory notice requirement.according to the requirement,the protection against retaliatory action shall not apply to an employee who makes a disclosure to a public body unless the employee has brought the allegedly illegal or corrupt activity to the attention of a supervisor by written notice and has afforded the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct the activity.id.c.since filing a suit constitutes disclosure to a public body,a prospective whistleblower plaintiff must give written notice of the alleged wrongdoing to the employer before filing a civil action.dirrane brookline police dep t,cir.
the city contends that the plaintiff failed to provide it with this advance notice before filing suit,and the record supports this claim.the rub,however,is that the city did not rely upon this notice defense in the pretrial proceedings,at the trial itself,during the charge conference,or in its motion for judgment as a matter of law.when a party persistently sleeps upon its rights,waiver almost inevitably results.amcel int l executive sales,cir finding waiver when affirmative defense was not raised in pretrial papers,during trial,or in motion for judgment as a matter of law correa hosp.san francisco,cir same.by the time that the city advanced the defense for the first time in a motion for relief from judgment,it was too late.
the city offers several rebuttal arguments.first,it notes that it referred to the notice requirement in its answer to the complaint.but this was,at most,a glancing the city never followed through.simply mentioning a possible defense in an initial pleading,without further development in subsequent stages of the proceedings,does not preserve it for review.violette smith nephew dyonics,cir wallace motor sales,am.motors sales,cir.
the city also points out that it successfully contended in its motion for summary judgment that the plaintiff failure to provide the statutorily required notice barred claims of retaliation stemming from the filing of charges with the mcad.see bennett,d at granting partial summary judgment for the city on this ground.the city now suggests that its raising of the notice defense in one context preserved that defense for all purposes.this is wishful thinking.the city notice defense was tailored to the plaintiff mcad complaints.it did not address the plaintiff failure to give notice either before complaining to the attorney general or before filing suit.see id.at.as a result,the whistleblower claim went to the jury solely on the allegation of retaliation for the plaintiff contacts with the state attorney general.
that effectively rebuts the city argument.because the city did not previously argue what it argues the plaintiff failure to provide written notice before filing suit bars his whistleblower action in waived that defense.raising a defense to a particular claim does not automatically preserve that defense with respect to other independent claims.see kelly foti,cir beddall state bank trust,cir explaining that a party can not preserve a claim by raising a related but factually distinct claim below.
the city next argument focuses on timing.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict on december,the city filed its original motions on december and and this court decided dirrane on december.based on this chronology,the city insists that we should excuse its lapses because it acted celeritously,it raised the defense on january,roughly two weeks after dirrane was decided.
this argument fails.while the rule is subject to a narrow equitable exception under which a party can not be deemed to have waived objections or defenses which were not known to be available at the time they could first have been made,holzsager valley,cir,this court has applied that exception with great circumspection.ordinarily,we will invoke the exception and excuse a party from failing seasonably to have raised a defense only if i at the time of the procedural default,a prior authoritative decision indicated that the defense was unavailable,and ii the defense became available thereafter by way of supervening authority say,an overruling of the prior decision or a legislative clarification.see united states,cir.put another way,we will excuse a party for failing to raise a defense only when the defense,if timely asserted,would have been futile under binding precedent.see id.refusing to excuse the failure to object when no binding rule in this circuit necessarily foredoomed an objection.other courts have followed this same general praxis.see curtis pub.butts,d holzsager,at.
that is not the situation here.dirrane interpreted the notice provision of the whistleblower statute to require written notice before the filing of a whistleblower action.dirrane,at.although that interpretation is certainly not the only possible reading of the statutory language,see,wagner city of holyoke,d,it did not contradict any previously binding precedent.when this case was tried,no court had authoritatively construed this aspect of the notice provision,and the question of whether filing a lawsuit constituted a public disclosure sufficient to trigger the notice requirement was wide open.under these circumstances,the defense was fairly available.accordingly,we adhere to prior practice,see,united states terry,cir,at,and hold the city to the natural consequences of its procedural default.the absence of precedent directly on point does not excuse a party failure to assert an available defense.
the city last,and most bruited,argument is equally unavailing.it invokes the familiar principle that the absence of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any point in the proceedings.see,kontrick ryan,d a litigant generally may raise a court lack of jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action,even initially at the highest appellate instance.mansfield,ry.swan.same capron van noorden,cranch.same see also.h.building on this solid foundation,the city hypothesizes that a plaintiff failure to give written notice as required by section c deprives the court of jurisdiction over any ensuing civil action under the whistleblower statute,see.laws ch,c stating that the protection against retaliatory action shall not apply to a plaintiff who fails to give the required notice emphasis supplied,and therefore can be raised for the first time.
we regard it as a bedrock principle that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and,thus,can not adjudicate a case in the absence of constitutional or congressional authority.ins.of ir.compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d.we have adhered to this principle in finding nonwaivable objections that go to a federal court power to adjudicate a case.see,halleran hoffman,cir united states avx,cir.but that principle has no application here the notice requirement in section c,while obligatory,is not jurisdictional in the requisite sense.
a rule does not become jurisdictional simply because it speaks in mandatory language.see prou united states,cir noting that if obligatory language were determinative of waiver,a whole range of constitutional and statutory provisions employing compulsory language would give rise to nonwaivable claims.jurisdictional requirements are those that affect a court constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate the case.steel citizens for a better,d.we conclude,without serious question,that the statutory notice requirement is not j
