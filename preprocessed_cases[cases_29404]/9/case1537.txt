opinion of the court 
appellant clifford newman,a convicted sex offender,argues that the parole board violated his first amendment right,his right to due process,and the ex post facto clause of the constitution by using his refusal to admit his guilt to adversely affect his eligibility for parole.
background 
in,newman was found guilty of committing two rapes and related sexual offenses after a jury trial in a pennsylvania state court.he was sentenced in to twenty to forty years imprisonment.newman ultimately exhausted his direct and appeals after more than a decade of litigation.he also sought federal habeas relief,which was denied notwithstanding his persistent and consistent claim that he is not guilty.
in,while newman was serving his sentence,the pennsylvania general assembly enacted.ann.that statute provides that certain sex offenders shall attend and participate in a department of corrections program of counseling or therapy id.a.a sex offender shall not be eligible for parole unless the offender has participated in the program id.b ii.the statute gives the department of corrections the sole discretion with respect to counseling or therapy program contents and administration id.c.the department of corrections administers a sexual offender program sop in accordance with.prior to the enactment of,there was no pennsylvania statute or regulation that required convicted sex offenders to attend a counseling or therapy program as a condition of parole eligibility.
according to newman complaint,the department requires all inmates to admit guilt in order to attend the sop.app.at.although an earlier version of the sop included a program,the department no longer offers the program at the state correctional institution at houtzdale,where newman is presently incarcerated.newman alleges that he is unable to attend the sop because he refuses to admit his guilt.
the parole process in pennsylvania is administered by the board of probation and parole,generally referred to as the parole board.see generally.ann.newman became eligible for parole in and met with a parole hearing examiner for an interview.according to newman complaint,the hearing examiner noted that newman ha d not attended the sop and stated that his failure to attend put him in a catch since the parole board required the completion of the sop before parole would be granted.app.at.on april,the parole board denied newman parole application.the parole board issued a written decision stating that y our best interests do not justify or require you being and,the interests of the commonwealth will be injured if you were.therefore,you are refused at this time.app.at.
the parole board gave the following reasons for denying newman parole 
your of the nature and circumstances of the offense s committed.
your refusal to accept responsibility for the offense s committed.
your lack of remorse for the offense s committed.
the negative recommendation made by the department of corrections.
your unacceptable compliance with prescribed institutional programs.
your need to participate in and complete additional institutional programs.
your interview with the hearing examiner.
the parole board written decision also stated that at newman next interview,
the board will review your file and consider whether you have successfully completed a treatment program for sex offender s,whether you have received a favorable recommendation for parole from the department of corrections,whether you have maintained a clear conduct record and completed the department of corrections prescriptive program s,and current mental health evaluation to be available at time of review.
newman has remained incarcerated since the decision and has not been granted parole.in,newman filed a pro se civil action under against various officials of the pennsylvania department of corrections collectively,the parole board challenging,inter alia,the adverse parole determination.he thereafter filed an amended complaint asserting three claims relevant to this appeal.
first,newman alleged that the parole board unconstitutionally required him to admit his guilt in violation of the first amendment.next,newman alleged that t he precondition of an admission of guilt and the completion of the sop made the parole process a sham where the parole board only went through the steps but did not give actual consideration to newman application which violates his fourteenth amendment due process rights.app.at.finally,newman alleged that the parole board retroactively applied.ann.to his parole application in violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution appellant br.at.newman sought injunctive and declaratory relief.
the parole board filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,and the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that recommended dismissal of the amended complaint.the magistrate judge determined that newman constitutional claims failed because there is no federal or state right to parole.the magistrate judge also determined that newman did not have standing to assert a due process claim based on.ann.because the statute does not apply to him.app.at.the district court summarily adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed the amended complaint.newman filed this pro se appeal,and we appointed counsel.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review of the district court order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.gelman state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.we accept all factual allegations as true,construe the amended complaint in the light most favorable to newman,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the amended complaint,he may be entitled to relief.see id.quotation and citation omitted.
discussiona.general principles 
the opinion in mckune lile,is of particular relevance to the issues presented in this appeal because the supreme court was presented with arguments somewhat analogous to those made by newman in this case.lile,like newman,was a convicted sex offender who persisted in maintaining his innocence and refused to participate in the state sexual abuse treatment program which required him to sign an admission of responsibility form.id.at.the court,in a plurality opinion,rejected lile claim that the consequential withdrawal of certain privileges violated his right against.id.at.his status would be reduced from level iii to level i,curtailing his visitation rights,earnings,work opportunities,ability to send money to family,canteen expenditures,access to personal television,and others.id.at.although the discussion was focused on the compulsion aspect of the fifth amendment,it is,if not directly precedential,certainly informative for our consideration of newman claims.
the mckune opinion recognized that s ex offenders are a serious threat in this nation.id.at.the opinion stated that t herapists and correctional officers widely agree that clinical rehabilitative programs can enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way reduce recidivism.an important component of those rehabilitation programs requires participants to confront their past and accept responsibility for their misconduct.id.at citation omitted.it quoted from sources that state that denial is generally regarded as one of the principal impediments to successful therapy.id.
we proceed to review newman claims in light of these considerations.
first amendment claim 
newman argues that the parole board violated his first amendment rights by requiring him to state a belief that he does not hold to be true,his order to obtain parole.appellant br.at.the parole board contends that i f it is not unconstitutionally compelled speech in violation of the fifth amendment,neither can it be such in violation of the first amendment.appellees br.at see const.amend.v no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.as a threshold matter,we decline the parole board invitation to cabin newman first amendment claim under a fifth amendment compelled speech framework.t he touchstone of the fifth amendment is compulsion,lefkowitz cunningham,and a violation of the first amendment right against compelled speech similarly occurs only in the context of actual compulsion,ridgewood bd.of,cir.the two amendments serve different purposes.the fifth amendment protects the right not to be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against one self,while the first amendment protects,among other things,the right to refrain from speaking at all.wooley maynard.newman has not been compelled to speak.if he did not seek parole voluntarily,he would remain in prison for the remainder of his sentence without admitting his guilt.ohio adult parole auth.woodard,it is difficult to see how a voluntary interview for clemency could compel the inmate to speak.thus,we reject the parole board suggestion that the fifth amendment is implicated in this case,a claim that newman disavows.
we turn instead to the first amendment which protects the right of freedom of thought and individual freedom of mind and encompasses both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.wooley,at citations omitted.thus,a state may not inquire about a man views or associations solely for the purpose of withholding a right or benefit because of what he believes.baird state bar of.
nevertheless,an inmate constitutional rights are necessarily limited.waterman farmer,cir.the fact of confinement and the needs of the penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights,including those derived from the first amendment,which are implicit in incarceration.jones prisoners labor union.the supreme court has repeatedly recognized the need for major restrictions on a prisoner rights,id.at citations omitted,and it is settled law that an inmate retains those first amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system,pell procunier,see also turner safley,w hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.
newman has not alleged that the parole board admission of guilt requirement serves no legitimate penological objectives or is not reasonably related to rehabilitation.pell,at.nor could newman have reasonably done so.as we noted above,a plurality of the supreme court recognized that states have a vital interest in rehabilitating convicted sex offenders and acceptance of responsibility for past offenses is a critical first step in a prison rehabilitation program for such offenders.mckune,at.the plurality further stated that a cceptance of responsibility is the beginning of rehabilitation.id.at.the dissenting opinion was not to the contrary.justice stevens,joined by three other justices,acknowledged that a sex offender program requiring an admission of guilt clearly serves legitimate therapeutic purposes.id.at stevens,dissenting.
in an apparent attempt to distinguish this authority,newman argues that r equiring false admissions of guilt from innocent prisoners does not facilitate rehabilitation.appellant br.at emphasis added.however,once the commonwealth met its burden of proving at trial that newman was guilty of the offenses,newman no longer come s before the court as one who is innocent,but,on the contrary,as one who has been convicted by due process herrera collins.it follows that the prison may structure its treatment programs and pursue legitimate penological objectives from that standpoint newman first amendment claim was therefore properly dismissed 
fourteenth amendment due process claims 
newman also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his due process claims.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits states from depriving any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.although newman pro se amended complaint does not distinguish procedural due process from substantive due process,we address both claims consistent with the parties briefing.
substantive due process 
t he due process clause contains a substantive component that bars certain arbitrary,wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.zinermon burch,quoting daniels williams.conduct can violate substantive due process if it shocks the conscience,which encompasses only the most egregious official conduct.chainey street,cir quoting united artists theatre circuit,twp.of warrington,cir.the conduct must be intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest cnty.of sacramento lewis.
newman substantive due process claim was properly dismissed because the parole board alleged conduct was not arbitrary and does not shock the conscience.chainey,at.as noted above,the parole board had legitimate penological reasons for requiring newman to admit guilt in the sop,the content of which is determined by the department of corrections in its sole discretion.ann.c.the parole board conduct was therefore not intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.lewis,at 
ii.procedural due process 
newman also challenges the dismissal of his procedural due process claim,arguing that the parole board review of his application was a sham that was inextricably tied to his refusal to admit guilt appellant br.at.the parole board responds that newman has no actual right to parole and thus no liberty interest sufficient to claim an entitlement to any procedural due process whatsoever.appellees br.at.
in analyzing a procedural due process claim,the first step is to determine whether the nature of the interest is one within the contemplation of the liberty or property language of the fourteenth amendment.shoats horn,cir citing fuentes shevin.once we determine that the interest asserted is protected by the due process clause,the question then becomes what process is due to protect it.id.citing morrissey brewer.the underlying liberty interest can be derived directly from the due process clause or from the state statutory scheme.see asquith dep t of,cir a protected liberty interest may arise from only one of two sources the due process clause or the laws of a state.
the supreme court has held that the constitution does not establish a liberty interest in parole that invokes due process protection.see greenholtz inmates of.penal corr.complex.thus,if newman has a protected liberty interest in some aspect of his parole,it must derive from the pennsylvania parole statute.see sandin conner,recognizing that states may create liberty interests which are protected by the due process clause.
the relevant pennsylvania parole statute provides that the parole board shall have the power,and it shall be its duty,to consider applications for parole by a prisoner,repealed by.laws.the statute further provides that the parole board shall have the duty to consider,inter alia,t he general character and background of the prisoner and the conduct of the person while in prison and his physical,mental and behavior condition and history,repealed by.laws 
the parole board concedes that newman is entitled to have his parole application fairly considered.appellees br.at.such a right is not without support.see vaughn,cir i discussing parole board duty to give the inmate a fair hearing in context of due process challenge jamieson commonwealth.bd.of prob.parole,a prisoner does have the right to apply for parole and have that application fairly considered by the board.citations omitted accord banks bd.of prob.parole.commw.however,as the pennsylvania supreme court has explained,the parole board decision to grant or deny parole does not affect an existing enjoyment of liberty.rogers.bd.of prob.parole,see also coady vaughn,t he decision to deny parole does not implicate any constitutionally protected interest.
newman procedural due process claim must fail because,to the extent that newman has a state law right to have his application fairly considered,the parole board gave his application all the consideration it was due.the parole board was permitted to consider newman g
