factual background 
in the spring of,nationwide began an investigation into allegations of fraudulent claims practices by one of its adjusters,quinones,after appellee baralt,claims manager in the puerto rico office npro,reported irregularities to company headquarters.nationwide assigned joanne mcgoldrick,an investigator in its corporate security department,to research the allegations.
during her investigation,which included three visits to puerto rico between october and april mcgoldrick learned of unrelated improper conduct allegedly committed by the vice president of the office,enrique lopez.those improprieties primarily concerned the unauthorized use of company cars,or pool cars,and salvage vehicles,including the regular borrowing of pool cars by lopez sons and sales of salvage vehicles to npro employees who had not paid for them.lopez also was accused of procuring an insurance policy at less than full cost for a plymouth sundance used by his son in ohio by falsely representing that it was being driven by his wife in puerto rico.
mcgoldrick initially verified the accusations against lopez by speaking with npro sales and marketing manager,blanca robles,and then further investigated the claims during her april visit to puerto rico.nationwide maintains that appellees were terminated in may because they interfered with the investigation into lopez conduct and because of their involvement in certain of the asserted improper practices.the company claims that gonzalez helped lopez to obtain the sundance insurance policy and also was aware of,and facilitated,the use of pool cars by lopez sons.baralt was linked to the alleged improprieties because he was in charge of salvage vehicles for npro.
baralt,npro claims manager,was and had been employed by nationwide for years gonzalez,who was,had worked for the company for years and was manager of the personal and commercial lines underwriting department.baralt and gonzalez were two of the six employees at npro known as the cabinet.two and the company comptroller,luis flores dieppa flores also were terminated for improper conduct.the remaining two cabinet members,one of whom was robles,left the company about a year after the terminations.the only evidence presented at trial explaining their departures was robles testimony that she took advantage of the company early retirement plan.five employees also were terminated.
at trial,in addition to presenting evidence of appellees involvement in practices the company deemed improper,nationwide attempted to show that both men interfered in the investigation after being instructed not to do so.mcgoldrick accused gonzalez of intimidating two female employees,whom she had found crying she also reported that on multiple occasions she found gonzalez standing near an office where she was interviewing employees.in a report admitted as a trial exhibit,mcgoldrick stated that another employee told her that baralt had contacted all of the claims division employees who possessed salvage vehicles and warned them of the scope of our investigation and advised them not to tell the truth or they would lose their jobs.she further reported that other employees had stated that baralt had discussed the interview he had with investigators even though he had been told expressly of the requirement of confidentiality 
appellees sought to rebut nationwide evidence of improper conduct in a variety of ways.they presented evidence that there was no company policy against use of pool cars by family members and that,moreover,giving lopez sons use of cars in the evening served to protect the vehicles from possible theft from the unsecured company lot,which was in a area.although gonzalez acknowledged arranging the sons use of the pool cars,he testified that he did so upon instructions from another cabinet member,rafael gonzalez,and further testified that it was rafael who had responsibility over the pool vehicles.in an effort to negate nationwide suggestion that company officials permitted employees to acquire salvage vehicles at no cost,plaintiffs also presented evidence that the company books showed the debts for the cars.testimony elicited on behalf of gonzalez distanced him from the insurance policy obtained by lopez on the plymouth sundance by suggesting that it was not issued under his authority,and there also was evidence indicating that the policy was not improper as noted,both plaintiffs denied that they had breached the confidentiality of the investigation.gonzalez defended his frequent appearance near the room where mcgoldrick was conducting interviews by explaining that he was using the nearby copy machine,not intimidating employees.
appellees also emphasized the abruptness and insensitivity exhibited in the circumstances leading up to and accompanying plaintiffs terminations.after mcgoldrick reported on her investigation to nationwide headquarters,lucas,the human resources officer,was sent to puerto rico with final authority.he had not reviewed plaintiffs personnel files,claiming that he did not want his decision to be influenced by anything in the files and noting that even a record of good employment could be wiped out by one serious improper act.he interviewed each plaintiff for only a brief time,and,at the end of the interviews,pronounced his decision to terminate.security personnel were standing by to escort each plaintiff with his personal belongings out of the building.
the sum total of evidence relating to age is the following 
baralt,was replaced by morales.although baralt at first testified that morales was replaced by a much younger man,he later admitted that he had no idea why morales left the company or whether his replacement was younger or much younger.
gonzalez,was replaced by guzman.
lopez,the npro vice president,was temporarily replaced by robles,also,indeed three weeks older than lopez.his permanent replacement was jack wood,whose age was not made of record.
flores,npro comptroller,was when he was terminated.there is no evidence of his replacement age.
the two cabinet members who were not fired were robles,and rafael gonzalez.
in addition to the above four cabinet members,there were five subordinate employees discharged for misappropriation of vehicles.nothing appears in the record concerning their ages or those of any replacements.
when gonzalez was asked directly what support he had for his age discrimination claim,he replied 
well,based on the performance that i was realizing or that i was doing,my devotion to the company,the success that the agency was having every year,over long years and always willing to make a maximum effort to the company benefit,to the benefit of our customers.i was in a good state of health,there was no reason.
the jury nonetheless found that age played a motivating role in the terminations of gonzalez and baralt in violation of both the adea and law,which prohibits employment discrimination based on a variety of factors,including age the jury also returned a verdict for plaintiffs on a third count for unjust dismissal under puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,which prohibits discharges made by the mere whim of the employer or without cause relative to the proper and normal operation of the establishment.id.at.the jury awarded baralt million in damages and gonzalez million,plus to each of their wives.the district court modified these amounts by reducing the wives damages to each and by doubling the compensatory awards,as prescribed by law,to million for baralt and million for gonzalez.the jury also awarded back pay in the amount of to baralt and to gonzalez.plaintiffs also were awarded more than in attorney fees,for a total of approximately million.
the court,which had taken under advisement nationwide motion for judgment as a matter of law,ruled first that the jury was entitled to find that the company reasons for the terminations were pretexts.baralt,d at.it then cited,as the evidentiary support for the jury finding of age discrimination,testimony by robles that nationwide had a retirement plan of which she had taken advantage id.
on appeal,nationwide challenges the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the federal and commonwealth age discrimination claims and further contends that,if it is unsuccessful in overturning the liability finding,the damage awards must be reduced because they are unsupported and excessive.plaintiffs filed,claiming that they are entitled to a higher amount of both damages and attorney fees.our disposition in favor of nationwide on the merits makes it unnecessary to address plaintiffs assertions or nationwide challenge to the amount of damages.
ii.discussion 
the primary issue we face is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding of age discrimination.the parties agree that,if we were to conclude that plaintiffs are not entitled to recover under law,they also would have failed to prove age discrimination under the adea because law offers a significantly more favorable standard to plaintiffs than does the adea.cardona jimenez bancomercio de puerto rico,cir.our analysis therefore begins with law,and,because we conclude that plaintiffs have not shown a violation of that statute,it also ends there.
under law,a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of age discrimination by demonstrating that he was actually or constructively discharged,and alleging that the decision was discriminatory.id.if this minimal showing is made,the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it had just cause for its actions.id.at pepsi cola of puerto rico bottling,lst cir.if the employer establishes just cause,the burden of proof returns to the plaintiff.bancomercio,at.if the employer fails to prove just cause,however,it bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision was not motivated by age discrimination.id 
nationwide acknowledges that the record permitted the jury to find that baralt and gonzalez were terminated without just cause requiring the company to prove that the dismissals were not motivated by animus.the company asserts that the total lack of evidence suggestive of age bias,together with nationwide substantial evidence of a inquiry into improper activities at the puerto rico office,required the jury to reject plaintiffs law claims.we review de novo the district court contrary judgment,taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.id.at.for nationwide to prevail,we must conclude that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the plaintiff s.id.at.
it is undisputed that the record contains no direct evidence of age discrimination,not even the sorts of stray remarks that are suggestive but often found insufficient to prove discrimination in the absence of more meaningful evidence.see,williams raytheon,cir rejecting age and gender claims where supervisor told colleagues that the company was run by old,white men,that she intended to change the corporate culture,and would favor the hiring of women and younger people shorette rite aid of maine,cir rejecting age discrimination claim where district manager had asked plaintiff how old he was and when he planned to retire.
although gonzalez,who was,was replaced by someone significantly successor also was within the protected age group,diminishing the force of the age difference as an indicator of bias.this solitary fact gains no strength from the evidence that baralt replacement was only two years his junior,a difference that is insufficient to support even a prima facie case of age discrimination.see raytheon,at.moreover,the two cabinet members who were not discharged also were over rafael gonzalez was and robles was.lopez,the office vice president,was immediately succeeded by robles,who was slightly older than he.the parties have not identified the ages of lopez ultimate replacement or the replacement for flores,the fourth cabinet member who was terminated.in addition,as noted earlier,there was no evidence of the ages of the five employees who were terminated.thus,plaintiffs affirmative showing of age discrimination consisted entirely of three facts they were within the protected class,they were fired,and one of them was replaced by someone significantly that individual was still within the protected age group.
nationwide rationale for the firings,on the other hand,was far from compelling.taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the company position was that the two with more than two decades of apparently high quality service to the terminated summarily for their peripheral involvement in a series of improper but relatively minor acts in which their boss and other employees had taken advantage of the company,and their discussions with,in violation of instructions,about the investigation into those improper acts.moreover,as we have noted earlier,the circumstances surrounding the terminations executed by lucas gave every appearance of an insensitive overreaction to a series of minor transgressions.
we have no problem accepting that a jury reasonably could conclude that a large,reputable company would not act as precipitously as nationwide could be found to have acted if its actual concern were the minor transgressions that it claimed underlay the terminations.in other words,we think the jury was entitled to disbelieve nationwide stated reasons for the firings.our problem,rather,arises from the absence of evidence that would permit a conclusion that the actual reason for the firings was plaintiffs ages.for,even in the face of law presumption,we conclude that the evidence presented by nationwide,in the context of the evidence presented by plaintiffs,was sufficient to meet its burden under law to demonstrate that the existence of discrimination was less probable than its nonexistence,belk arce martinez,official translation at.
the evidence was undisputed that nationwide began investigating the puerto rico office as a result of baralt report concerning quinones allegedly fraudulent conduct,and that the specific probe leading to plaintiffs dismissals was triggered by a tip from someone in the office about lopez personal use of a salvage vehicle.robles corroborated the tip for mcgoldrick before the investigator traveled to puerto rico in april.the inquiry into lopez actions led to gonzalez and former because of his involvement with the fraudulent automobile policy and the pool cars,and the latter because he was responsible for salvage vehicles.
that the investigation unquestionably was triggered by employees in the puerto rico office,rather than by the home office executives who carried out the terminations,makes it unlikely that the inquiry was fabricated as a ruse to accomplish terminations.moreover,the fact that the investigation was launched in rules out any rational theory that it was conceived as a device to target plaintiffs,each of whom had received letters of commendation in early a company seeking pretextual reasons to discharge employees on the basis of their advancing ages would be unlikely to offer thanks for those employees efforts and contributions to the successes of this past year.
plaintiffs presented no evidence to discredit the authenticity of the investigation.while,as we have noted,the callous severity of the punishment in all likelihood moved jurors to doubt that the discharges occurred for the stated reasons,the evidence was substantial that the firings were in some way a byproduct of the home office probe into the puerto rico operations.on this record,various explanations for terminating plaintiffs were much more likely than the completely unsubstantiated
