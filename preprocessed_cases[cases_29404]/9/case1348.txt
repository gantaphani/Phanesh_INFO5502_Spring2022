this interlocutory appeal by lieutenant christopher calabrese calabrese requires us to address the intersecting legal themes of qualified immunity and the use of informants to support probable cause to arrest.the united states district court for the southern district of new york,mcmahon,denied calabrese motion for summary judgment on rocco caldarola caldarola claim for false arrest.the district court concluded that it could not determine the reliability of the private investigation firms on whose reports calabrese relied in making his probable cause determination and declined to reach calabrese arguments that probable cause did,in fact,exist,and that he was entitled to qualified immunity.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the order of the district court.
background 
caldarola,a westchester county department of correction officer,injured his thumb in the line of duty,filed a disability claim and,pursuant to section of new york general municipal law,received medical and salary benefits for over a year.see mun.law.in january,newly elected westchester county executive andrew spano spano appointed rocco pozzi pozzi acting commissioner of the department of correction and later formalized the appointment.
in an effort to determine whether some corrections officers might be abusing the job injury benefits program,pozzi asked the head of the department of correction attendance management unit amu to provide him with a list of corrections officers suspected of falsely claiming or exaggerating injuries.caldarola name was on the list provided to pozzi.members of the department of correction had heard unconfirmed rumors that caldarola was operating a landscaping business while receiving benefits.if true,this likely would have constituted a violation of section because caldarola probably would have been able to return to his job.see id.municipality shall pay officer injured on the job the full amount of his regular salary or wages until his disability arising therefrom has ceased.
pozzi proposed conducting limited surveillance to determine whether the corrections officers on the list were,in fact,improperly receiving job injury benefits.to keep the investigations confidential,county executive spano authorized the use of private investigation firms to conduct the surveillance.the county selected the firms that were to do the investigations.
louis,the commissioner of the westchester county department of public safety,instructed paul stasaitis stasaitis,the commanding officer of the special investigations unit siu,to retrieve the investigatory files for five corrections officers from the westchester county attorney office.directed stasaitis to review the files to determine if they detailed any criminal acts by the corrections officers.stasaitis kept four files for himself and,with the permission of,assigned the caldarola file to calabrese,a lieutenant in charge of the major case squad but not a member of the siu.
instead of revealing that caldarola was operating a landscaping business,the information contained in the investigatory file led calabrese to conclude that caldarola had moved from new york to connecticut.if true,caldarola move would have constituted a violation of section of the new york public officers law.see pub.off.law d an office shall become vacant if the incumbent ceases to be an inhabitant of the state.at some point during his investigation,calabrese spoke with assistant district attorney mike hughes hughes to go over the investigative file that had been assembled on caldarola.calabrese recalled hughes expressing concern that he needed more probable cause to effect a prosecution of caldarola.calabrese understood hughes to mean that more evidence was necessary to secure a criminal conviction.calabrese then requested from stasaitis additional time to investigate caldarola.stasaitis denied his request.
when asked by commissioner whether there was enough information to arrest caldarola,calabrese responded in the affirmative and,on july,he effected the arrest of caldarola for grand larceny in the third degree.on july,caldarola was suspended without pay pending a hearing on disciplinary charges.caldarola filed a motion in state court seeking dismissal of the criminal charge because the prosecution could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.the district attorney did not oppose the motion.on february,the criminal charge was dismissed and,on february,the county withdrew the disciplinary charges and reinstated caldarola with back pay.
on april,caldarola filed this suit against calabrese,pozzi,spano,two other individuals and westchester county seeking money damages pursuant to.see,baker mccollan,d.on may,in response to a motion to dismiss by the defendants,caldarola voluntarily withdrew three of his claims,leaving only the claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.on june,pursuant to the same motion by the defendants,the district court dismissed without prejudice caldarola false arrest and malicious prosecution claims against pozzi,spano and another individual defendant.the only remaining claims were for false arrest and malicious prosecution against calabrese,the county and one other defendant.on the remaining defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court found that there was no evidence of malice on the part of the defendants and dismissed the malicious prosecution charge.caldarola deciuceis,d.finding that the private investigation firms could not be deemed reliable,the district court declined to decide whether the information contained in the investigative file established probable cause to arrest caldarola.id.the district court thus denied calabrese motion for summary judgment on caldarola false arrest claim,and calabrese timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
as the analysis required for summary judgment is a legal one,we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.giordano city of new york,cir citing tenenbaum williams,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the party against whom summary judgment is sought,however,must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts t he nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d quotation marks and citations omitted.
ii.qualified immunity 
qualified immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.saucier katz,d quoting mitchell forsyth,d.the principle of qualified immunity serves important practical purposes in our system.it shields government officials from liability for their performance of discretionary actions and offers them the benefit of avoiding costly,and,ultimately unsuccessful litigation.see anderson creighton,d martinez simonetti,cir.
when considering the issue of qualified immunity we must first determine in the light most favorable to the injured facts alleged demonstrate that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier,at.if so,we must determine whether that right was clearly established.in other words,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson,at.see harlow fitzgerald,d noting that a court should determine not only the currently applicable law,but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred.this inquiry is,in essence,a determination whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier,at.see malley briggs,d stating that qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.if the law was clearly established that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,qualified immunity is inappropriate.if,however,the law at that time was not clearly established,an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments,nor could he fairly be said to know that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.harlow,at.in such a case,courts must grant an officer qualified immunity.
the denial of summary judgment is ordinarily an interlocutory decision,not a final decision appealable under.marshall sullivan,cir.when a court denies a motion for summary judgment based on a denial of qualified immunity,however,that determination is appealable under the collateral order doctrine when it is a legal conclusion made with reference only to undisputed facts.johnson jones,d citing mitchell forsyth,d marshall,at.when an officer entitlement to qualified immunity hinges on a factual dispute,we lack appellate jurisdiction to determine the qualified immunity issue.see behrens pelletier,d.
caldarola claims that we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because the district court determination was not a legal one made with reference to undisputed facts.see johnson,at.a cursory glance at the district court memorandum and order belies caldarola contention.specifically,the district court stated,i can not conclude as a matter of law that the gates factors regarding the reliability of tips are satisfied.thus,i must deny the motion for summary judgment on the false arrest claim.caldarola,d at.the district court decision was a legal one it applied the undisputed facts in the record to a legal standard.we thus have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal and now turn to the merits of calabrese defense of qualified immunity.
caldarola claim for false arrest derives from an individual right to remain free from unreasonable seizures.this includes the right to remain free from arrest absent probable cause.weyant okst,cir.when viewed in the light most favorable to caldarola,saucier,at,his complaint alleges that he was arrested without probable cause,a violation of his constitutional rights.there is no dispute that this broad right to be free of arrest without probable cause was clearly established at the time of caldarola arrest.lee sandberg,cir the right not to be arrested without probable cause is a clearly established right.however,it was equally well established that the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense to a false arrest claim and affords the arresting officer qualified immunity from litigation.see weyant,at.we must determine whether a reasonable officer could conclude that the circumstances here established the necessary probable cause for calabrese to arrest caldarola in short,we must consider whether a reasonable officer could have believed that the specific action taken by calabrese was foreclosed by clearly established law.see saucier,at.this inquiry,it is vital to note,must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.anderson,at.stating that it was erroneous for the court of appeals simply to conclude that the right of a person to be free from warrantless searches was clearly established and to refuse to consider the argument that it was not clearly established that the circumstances with which the officer was confronted did not constitute exceptions to that general rule.
when determining whether probable cause exists courts must consider those facts available to the officer at the time of the arrest and immediately before it.lowth town of cheektowaga,cir see anderson,at.the relevant question is the objective albeit question whether a reasonable officer could have believed the officer conduct to be lawful,in light of clearly established law and the information the officers possessed.in general,probable cause to arrest exists when the officers have knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a crime.weyant,at citing dunaway new york,d.
a district court must look to the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether probable cause exists to effect an arrest.illinois gates,d bernard united states,cir.in looking to the totality of the circumstances,courts must be aware that probable cause is a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.gates,at.finally,we have said that in the context of a qualified immunity defense to an allegation of false arrest,the defending officer need only show arguable probable cause.martinez,at.this is because at its heart,t he concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct.saucier,at.officers can have reasonable,but mistaken,beliefs as to the facts establishing the existence of probable cause and in those situations courts will not hold that they have violated the constitution.id.at.therefore,in situations where an officer may have reasonably but mistakenly concluded that probable cause existed,the officer is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity.see lennon miller,cir i t is inevitable that law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present,and we have indicated that in such cases those officials should not be held personally liable.quoting anderson,at.
we are concerned here with determining the existence of probable cause based on information gleaned from informants.in the past,courts confronted with this situation traditionally employed a approach based on the supreme court decisions of aguilar texas,d,and spinelli united states,d.this approach a rather rigid the reliability or veracity of the informant and on the basis for the informant knowledge.see gates,at.after the supreme court decision in illinois gates,however,it is clear that these are but two of several relevant considerations when determining the existence of probable cause based on an informant tip.see id.at.a deficiency in one may be compensated for,in determining the overall reliability of a tip,by a strong showing as to the other,or by some other indicia of reliability.id.
the supreme court has recognized,for example,that if an unquestionably honest citizen comes forward with a report of criminal if fabricated would subject him to criminal liability rigorous scrutiny of the basis of his knowledge is unnecessary.id.at.citing adams williams,d.more recently,the supreme court noted in florida,d,that an anonymous tip is u nlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated.we have similarly recognized that the language in aguilar and spinelli was directed toward the reliability of professional criminal informants.united states rollins,cir united states burke,cir.in the case of an identified bystander with no apparent motive to falsify,however,the information they provide has a peculiar likelihood of accuracy.rollins,at see miloslavsky aes engineering society,i t is that a law enforcement official has probable cause to arrest if he received his information from some person,normally the putative victim or eyewitness,who it seems reasonable to believe is telling the truth,aff,cir see also people hicks,w e can not hold that citizen informers are as inherently suspicious individuals as the underworld denizen upon whose oath,out of necessity,law enforcement officials must often rely.to do so would be to denigrate the character of citizens.instead,such should be encouraged and applauded.
the investigative file given to calabrese by stasaitis,on which calabrese relied in making his probable cause determination,contained reports from two private investigation firms,attendance records from the amu and a videotape.one report,from copstat security,contained a brief overview of the firm conclusions based on its investigation and a more detailed summary of the specific actions taken during the investigation.the other report,from compass investigators and adjusters,concerned a deed and a mortgage agreement signed by caldarola for a house in new fairfield,connecticut.the attendance reports detailed
