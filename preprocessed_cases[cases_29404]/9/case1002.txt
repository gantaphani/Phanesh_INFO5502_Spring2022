this case presents questions of law regarding the enforcement of arbitration agreements.after the defendants announced their intention to waive enforcement of certain provisions of the arbitration agreement at issue,the district court koeltl,granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration.we affirm the district court because we believe that the arbitration agreement,as modified by the defendants waivers,will allow the plaintiff to vindicate her statutory cause s of action in the arbitral forum.mitsubishi motors soler.we emphasize,however,that it is not at all clear that we would reach the same result had the defendants attempted to enforce the arbitration agreement in its entirety.
rita ragone brings this employment discrimination action under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et.she also asserts claims under the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law et,and the new york city human rights law nychrl,admin.code et.specifically,ragone contends that the defendants,for whom she worked,subjected her to continuous sexual harassment which made her work environment hostile,abusive and intolerable 
ragone devotes a substantial portion of her brief on this appeal to setting forth the details of her allegations of harassment.but while this recitation would certainly be relevant if the instant appeal called for us to review the district court decision on a dispositive motion,such a motion is not under consideration here.rather,the instant appeal considers whether the district court correctly held that ragone claims should be heard in an arbitral forum.properly considered,this question takes no account of the merits of claims asserted in the complaint.see jlm,sa,cir determination of the arbitrability of claims does not in any way rest upon the strength of those claims.accordingly,whether or not they amount to a meritorious claim,the allegations of sexual harassment made by ragone are not relevant here.the facts that are relevant to this appeal are few and straightforward.
a.the arbitration agreement.ragone alleges that she is a and makeup artist and hairstylist to television and movie stars,dignitaries,athletes and houses of fashion.atlantic video avi,which apparently operates under the name,is alleged to be a digital broadcast and film production and post production company which maintains a large television studio in new york city.espn,the cable television sports news service,was a client of avi and operated various shows,including cold pizza,a morning sports news show,out of avi new york studio.
ragone was employed by avi as a artist from february,until april.ragone alleges that her termination by avi on this latter date was an act of retaliation taken in response to her numerous complaints regarding acts of sexual harassment.
ragone employment with avi was made subject to her assent to an arbitration agreement,which contains the following provision 
i shall submit to the american arbitration association aaa for final and binding arbitration by one arbitrator any and all claims or controversies arising out of my employment or its termination including,but not limited to,claims concerning discipline and discharge claims for discrimination claims of sexual harassment 
i further understand,acknowledge,and agree that this agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of new york,without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
the arbitration agreement also contains a number of provisions regarding not only the conduct of arbitration proceedings,but also the conduct of any court proceeding that ragone might initiate.ragone asserts that several of these provisions are unconscionable,and therefore unenforceable.specifically,as set forth by the district court,ragone asserts that the arbitration agreement 
a impermissibly shortens the statute of limitations for bringing any demand for arbitration to ninety days,b it requires that attorney fees must be awarded to the prevailing party,c it prevents the plaintiff from appealing the arbitrator award in court,and d it denies the plaintiff some of her rights in court by limiting her discovery rights and eliminating her right to a jury trial.

further,the arbitration agreement contains the following severability clause 
in the event that any provision of this agreement,or the application of such provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law,the remaining provisions of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect.if any provisions regarding discovery or the time to make a demand for arbitration of claims is deemed unenforceable,then such provision shall be modified automatically such that it comports with the applicable federal new york law.
b.the status of espn.it is undisputed that espn is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement.espn is also not mentioned,expressly or by implication,in either the arbitration agreement,or in any of the other documents relating to ragone initial employment that are contained in the record.nevertheless,ragone complaint contains numerous allegations which support the district court conclusion that her claims of unlawful harassment and retaliation against avi and espn rely on the concerted actions of both defendants and are therefore substantially interdependent.ragone,wl,at.
first,ragone asserts that she was hired by avi as a artist for one of its significant clients,defendant espn.specifically,she was hired to provide artistry and other services to espn talent.further,while she reported to avi general manager ted nelson,as well as to ed brancaccio and douglas sherman of avi,she was also required to follow the instructions and directives of espn talent and espn supervisors on the set in fact,lori berlin,who has at all relevant time s been the director of production for espn was ragone supervisor during her employment with avi and two espn panelists are alleged to have supervised her job duties during her employment with avi,
further,the central allegation of the complaint is that a lmost immediately after she commenced her employment with avi for espn cold pizza,she became the victim of severe,pervasive and continuous sexual harassment by cold pizza talent woody paige and jay crawford.in addition,it is alleged that espn supervisors and other espn cold pizza talent repeatedly witnessed the sexual harassment and condoned the repulsive behavior of defendants paige and crawford.this cause d her to complain on numerous occasions to both avi and espn management employees about the behavior.that is,ragone lodged numerous complaints to both avi and espn management in an effort to put an end to the sexual harassment.in sum,the complaint makes plain that both avi and espn subjected ragone to persistent and continuous sexual advancements and harassment by defendants paige and crawford.
c.the district court opinion.applying new york law,the district court held that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally unconscionable,in spite of ragone representation of her lack of relevant education or sophistication.the district court found that she has failed to show that avi engaged in tactics or deception in procuring her signature on the agreement.ragone,wl,at.further,even assuming the truth of ragone representation that she did not understand the arbitration agreement at the time she signed it,the district court found that this did not render the agreement unconscionable because ragone could have asked questions about the agreement and could have taken the employment documents home to study them and she could have consulted a lawyer if she chose.id 
as to the question of the substantive unconscionability of the arbitration agreement,the district court task was certainly made easier by the fact that the defendants explicitly waived any attempt to enforce various provisions of the arbitration agreement.specifically,the defendants agreed to waive the statutes of limitations and fee shifting provisions as set out in the arbitration agreement and therefore these provisions do not render the arbitration a greement substantively unconscionable.id.at.further,as to the provision of the arbitration award which forbids any appeal of the arbitrator decision,the defendants represented to the district court that this would not prevent the plaintiff from moving to vacate an arbitration award in federal court pursuant to the provisions of the federal arbitration act.id.moreover,the district court held that ragone objections to the provisions of the arbitration agreement limiting discovery in any court proceeding and waiving any right to a jury trial are moot.th ese provision s are directed at a situation where the parties proceed to litigation because the court invalidated the arbitration procedure.that is not the case here.id.at.
finally,applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel,the district court held that espn status as a did not preclude ragone being compelled to arbitrate her claims against espn.this holding was based upon the fact that this court has held that parties to an arbitration agreement may be compelled to arbitrate their claims against a if these claims are sufficiently intertwined with her claims against a signatory.in this case,the district court found that it is clear that ragone claims of unlawful harassment and retaliation against avi and espn rely on the concerted actions of both defendants and are therefore substantially interdependent.id.at.
we review the district court determination of the arbitrability of ragone claim de novo,while accepting the court factual determinations unless clearly erroneous.garten kurth,cir.ragone asserts claims under employment discrimination statutes and,as a general matter,c ourts have consistently found that such claims can be subject to mandatory arbitration.gold deutsche aktiengesellschaft,cir.specifically,ragone complains of acts of sexual harassment and,as noted above,the arbitration agreement at issue in this case expressly states that claims of sexual harassment are subject to arbitration.it is therefore here that it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.roby of lloyd,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the federal arbitration act faa,et,creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability applicable to arbitration agreements affecting interstate commerce.alliance bernstein inv.research,inc schaffran,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the parties do not dispute that the agreement at issue here affects interstate commerce and,accordingly,there is no question that the faa applies.
the faa is an expression of a strong federal policy favoring arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution.hartford accident indem.swiss reinsurance am,cir.in fact,this court has said that it is difficult to overstate the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,and it is a policy we have often and emphatically applied.arciniaga motors,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but emphatic application does not amount to automatic application.the faa provides that an arbitration agreement shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.accordingly,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unsconscionabilty,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements.doctor,casarotto.
unconscionability in general.ragone asserts that she can not be compelled to submit her claims against either avi or espn to arbitration because the arbitration agreement which the district court found that she signed as a condition of her employment is unconscionable and,therefore,unenforceable.as a general matter,even to the extent that the law recognizes that employers and individual employees do not possess equal bargaining power,the faa certainly does not preclude the enforcement of employment contracts which make employment conditional upon an employee acceptance of mandatory arbitration.see gilmer lane corp,m ere inequality in bargaining power is not a basis for declining to enforce arbitration agreements contained in employment contracts.still,it is possible that an arbitration agreement may contain terms so onerous as to render it unenforceable under section of the faa.further,i t is clear that questions of contractual validity relating to the unconscionability of an arbitration agreement must be resolved first,as a matter of state law,before compelling arbitration pursuant to the faa.cap gemini ernst young,nackel,cir per curiam.as already noted,the arbitration agreement at issue contains a choice of law clause which provides that new york law will govern the agreement construction and enforcement.
one of the district courts of our circuit has recently set forth the outlines of the new york law of unconscionability as follows 
under new york law,a contract is unconscionable when it is so grossly unreasonable or unconscionable in the light of the mores and business practices of the time and place as to be unenforcable sic according to its literal terms.gillman chase manhattan bank.generally,there must be a showing that such a contract is both procedurally and substantially unconscionable.see id.the procedural element of unconscionability concerns the contract formation process and the alleged lack of meaningful choice the substantive element looks to the content of the contract,per se.state wolowitz,n,see also desiderio national ass of sec.dealers,cir a contract or clause is unconscionable when there is an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.quotation marks omitted.

procedural unconscionability.ragone contention that the arbitration agreement was signed under procedurally unconscionable conditions is far short of convincing.ragone argues that the undisputed fact that she was offered the arbitration agreement on a take it or leave it basis renders it unenforceable.but it is plain that this is not sufficient under new york law to render the arbitration provision procedurally unconscionable.nayal,d at citing cases.further,ragone asserts that she did not read the arbitration agreement before signing it.but this is of no moment in light of this court holding that it can not accept a rule that would allow a party to avoid his legal obligation to read a document carefully before signing it just because the document is an arbitration agreement under which title vii claims could be arbitrated.gold,at.finally,new york law does not absolve ragone of this obligation because she does not have a college degree and has no experience or background in business or human resources.on the contrary,new york courts have repeatedly ruled that even the fact that a prospective employee possesses an imperfect grasp of the english language will not relieve the employee of making a reasonable effort to have the document explained to him.see molina,wl,at june,citing cases.the arbitration agreement is therefore not procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability.while determinations of unconscionability are ordinarily based on a conclusion that both the procedural and substantive components are present,there have been exceptional cases where a provision of the contract is so outrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability alone.gillman chase manhattan bank,internal citation omitted.as we have set forth above,ragone argued before the district court that several provisions of the arbitration agreement she signed were substantially unconscionable.the district court avoided consideration of the unconscionability of any of the disputed terms for three reasons.first,the district noted that the defendants had agreed to waive the statutes of limitations and fee shifting provisions as set out in the arbitration agreement and therefore found that these provisions do not render the arbitration a greement substantively unconscionable.ragone,wl,at.second,as to the provision of the arbitration agreement that forbids any appeal of the arbitrator decision,the district court found that the defendants representation that this would not prevent the plaintiff from moving to vacate an arbitration award in federal court,pursuant to the provisions of the faa,defeated the argument that the provision was unconscionable.id.third,the district court held that ragone objections to the provisions of the arbitration agreement limiting discovery in any court proceeding and waiving any right to a jury trial are moot in light of the grant of the defendants motion to compel arbitration.id.at.
on this appeal,ragone criticizes the district court for what she sees as an improper piecemeal approach in its consideration of the arbitration agreement.that is,ragone believes that the district court missed the forest for the trees 
in determining unconscionability,the district court should have considered the arbitration agreement in its totality as it was written and presented to ragone,and whether that overall document had the oppressive and unconscionable purpose effect of deterring an employee in the exercise of her statutory rights.the district court should have considered that the arbitration agreement as a whole,containing numerous unconscionable and oppressive terms,is irredeemably tainted by unconscionability and unlawful purpose.as such,the unconscionability can not simply be severed from the agreement,which should be held unenforceable in its entirety.
although this is not an inconsiderable argument,we are compelled to reject it.
first,ragone argues that the severability clause contained in the arbitration agreement will not serve to save the agreement because such a clause can not save an arbitration agreement that is permeated by unconscionability by the presence of multiple uneforceable provisions.the severability clause,however,has no relevance to this appeal.according to its terms,the severability clause applies i n the event that any provision of this agreement,or the application of such provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law the district court,however,did not hold any provision of the arbitration agreement to be contrary to law.rather,it resolved all questions of potentially unenforceable terms by holding that these terms were either moot,would be interpreted in a manner consistent with the faa,or had been waived.thus,the district court did not trigger any application of the severability clause and,as a result,the question of whether or not the clause can save the arbitration agreement is not properly raised on this appeal.
second,with respect to the provision of the arbitration agreement which forbids any appeal of the arbitrator eventual decision,we do not see that ragone posits any sufficient ground for reversal of the district court acceptance of the defendants representation that this provision would not prevent the plaintiff from moving to vacate an arbitration award in federal court pursuant to the provisions of the faa.ragone,wl,at.similarly,ragone does not seriously challenge the district court holding that the provisions of the arbitration agreement relating to the conduct of court proceedings are plainly moot in light of the granting of the defendants motion to compel arbitration.
that leaves the matter of the defendants election to waive enforcement of two provisions of the arbitration agreement the limitations provision which mandates that ragone must make a demand for arbitration no later than ninety calendar days after her claim arises or it will be conclusively resolved against her even if there is a statute of limitations that may have given her more time and the provision which requires that attorney fees must be awarded to the prevailing party.ragone argues that the district court erred in accepting these waivers because the arbitration agreement,when considered as a whole,is packed with oppressive and unlawful provisions meant to disadvantage the employee.acceptance of the defendants waivers,ragone declares,allows the defendants to retain the benefit of a contract whose main purpose was to unfairly prejudice her.unfortunately,ragone supports this argument by relying upon cases applying law other than the law of new york,which is controlling here.see,alexander anthony int l,cir under virgin islands law,court would not allow waiver of unconscionable provisions of arbitration agreement so as to enforce arbitration agreement afflicted by so much fundamental and pervasive unfairness ferguson countrywide credit,cir applying california law,court would refuse to enforce arbitration agreement so permeated with unconscionable clauses that waiver can not remove the unconscionable taint from the agreement.
we believe that new york law would allow for the enforcement of the arbitration agreement as modified by the defendants waivers.first,new york courts have accepted offers by parties to waive the enforcement of certain provisions of arbitration agreements,and have evaluated those agreements as modified by the parties waivers.see,brower gateway,dep t remanding for the determination of whether a substitute arbitration agreement alleviated the unconscionability problems of original provision in re currency conversion fee antitrust,d,defendants offer to pay fees and to waive rights meant plaintiff could not rely on arbitration costs as ground for finding arbitration agreement unconscionable.because unconscionability is an equitable defense to the enforcement of harsh or unreasonable contract terms,doctor,jabush,cir,a party can not complain when the defendant through its waivers declines to enforce any potentially unconscionable term.
in schreiber transportation,which we note has not been cited by any of the parties,the new york court of appeals considered a provision of an arbitration agreement which directed that the employer would advance any fees of arbitration up to.when the plaintiff submitted a dispute to arbitration,the arbitrator demanded an advance fee payment of,which the employer contended would be the employee responsibility in the amount of.the court of appeals directed that schreiber should not be compelled to bear costs which would effectively preclude him from pursuing his claim.id.at.that is,even though the arbitration agreement at issue apparently did not contain a severability clause,the court of appeals held that any order compelling arbitration should be conditioned on agreement to bear any costs subject later to reallocation of those costs by the arbitrator.accord barbieri transp,d.thus,rather than holding that a provision of an arbitration agreement which would preclude a party from vindicating its rights in arbitration rendered the entire agreement unenforceable,the court of appeals held that the offending provision should simply be disregarded.
as applied to the instant case,especially in light of the fact that we are charged with encouraging and supporting arbitration,lucent techs.tatung,cir,we hold that brower and schreiber call for affirmance of the district court.schreiber directs that the appropriate remedy when a court is faced with a plainly unconscionable provision of an arbitration which by itself would actually preclude a plaintiff from pursuing her statutory rights is to sever the improper provision of the arbitration agreement,rather than void the entire agreement.brady williams capital group,dep t.just as schreiber conditioned the order to arbitrate on the effective waiver of one provision of the arbitration agreement,and brower evaluated the unconscionability of an agreement as modified by an waiver of one provision of the arbitration agreement,we can enforce an agreement that modifies a provision that otherwise might be unconscionable.this remedy has been effected here by the defendants waiver of enforcement of the arbitration agreement statute of limitations and provisions.accordingly,we will not void the entire arbitration agreement signed by ragone.
d.a note of caution.while we affirm the district court holding that the arbitration agreement is enforceable as modified by the defendants waivers,we emphasize that we do so with something less than robust enthusiasm.although the enforceability of an arbitration agreement is decided in the first place under the applica
