nassau county and garden city 
the village of garden city is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of the state of new york and located in nassau county.as of the year,individuals of hispanic or african american ethnicity comprised of nassau county population.however,these minority groups comprised a disproportionate share of the county population.while constituting of all households in nassau county,african americans and hispanics represented of the county very low income,renter households.in addition,african americans made up of the county waiting list for section housing.under the section program,the federal government provides funds to local housing authorities,which then subsidize rental payments for qualifying tenants in buildings.see o a.
garden city african american and hispanic population in the year was.however,excluding the of the minority population representing students living in dormitories,garden city minority population was only.in addition,only of the households in garden city were headed by an african american or hispanic person.however,several of the communities surrounding garden city are,communities in which minorities make up a majority of the population.
although the lack of affordable housing has long been a problem for nassau county,garden city contains no affordable housing indeed,in the past,garden city and its residents have resisted the introduction of affordable housing into the community.according to a garden city official,in,a developer proposed constructing units of affordable housing at a site in garden city.this project was never completed,apparently due to a village building moratorium,and a luxury development was ultimately approved for the site.in addition,in may,nassau county announced that it intended to sell a parcel of county land in garden city known as the ring road site,for the development of affordable housing.but after garden city residents expressed opposition to the construction of affordable housing in the community,the project was abandoned.finally,garden city has repeatedly declined to join the nassau county urban consortium,a group of municipalities in nassau county that are eligible to receive federal funding to support development.
b.the social services site 
in,nassau county faced a budget and infrastructure crisis.under the leadership of executive thomas suozzi,the county undertook a real estate consolidation plan,which involved consolidating county operations in several facilities and selling excess government property in order to raise revenue to fund renovations of the county existing operations.
one of the properties proposed for sale under the real estate consolidation plan was a parcel of land owned by nassau county within the boundaries of garden city.this parcel of land was part of garden city public or p zone.garden city p zone encompasses numerous nassau county buildings,including the nassau county police headquarters,the county executive building,and the nassau county supreme court building.
the portion of the p zone site at issue in this case,referred to as the social services site,is an approximately acre site that housed the former nassau county social services building,the parking lots for the nassau county supreme court,a garage,an ancillary building,and additional parking facilities.the social services site consists of two segments acres located on the eastern side of county seat drive,the site of the former social services building and parking facilities and an additional acres located on the western side of county seat drive,on which a building and a parking garage are located.
nassau county planned to sell the social services site to a private developer,hoping to receive at least million for the property.in order to facilitate this sale,nassau county turned to garden city,which controlled the site zoning.
garden city rezoning 
in june,at the county request,garden city began the process of rezoning the social services site.this process was managed by the garden city board of trustees,the elected body which governs village affairs.in response to the county request,the board of trustees created a the p zone committee charged with retaining a planner and reviewing zoning options for the social services site,as well as the remainder of the p zone properties in garden city.this p zone committee consisted of village trustees peter bee,peter negri,and gerard lundquist.trustee bee was the chairman of the p zone committee.garden city also retained the planning firm of buckhurst fish and jacquemart bfj to provide a recommendation with regard to the rezoning of the social services site.garden city had previously worked with bfj over several decades.village officials trusted and respected bfj work and generally adopted its recommendations.the p zone committee was supervised by garden city village administrator robert schoelle,who served as a liaison between the committee and the board of trustees.the village also hired attorney john kiernan to advise it on the rezoning process.
in the early part of this rezoning process,bfj and garden city emphasized that any proposal should rely on existing zoning mechanisms and respect the existing character of the village.in a september,fax outlining the general planning principles for redevelopment of the p zone properties,bfj stressed that a ny rezoning associated with the proposed development should be in accordance with the goals and parameters set forth in the zoning code of garden city.app x at.this fax also emphasized that any proposed development should be consistent with the existing character and surrounding neighborhoods of garden city,not overburden roads,utilities,and schools,and not tend to depreciate the value of property in the village.app x at.similarly,in a november,memorandum entitled potential approach to p zone changes,and addressed to the p zone committee,bfj recommended that garden city borrow from its existing zoning regulations in rezoning the p zone properties,rather than adopt a new form of zoning for the property.
on april,bfj submitted its proposal to the p zone committee,recommending a co b zone for the social services site.bfj proposed applying residential group or r m zoning controls to this property.r m zoning would have allowed for the construction of up to residential apartment units on the site,or homes.bfj reiterated the proposed r m zoning in a may report to the p zone committee,stating that the rezoning would be likely to generate a net tax benefit to the village.app x at.
throughout the rezoning process,the p zone committee also kept garden city four property owners associations poas apprised of the process.the poas acted as liaisons between garden city and the citizens living within their respective neighborhoods.the social services site is located within the neighborhood of the eastern property owners association.on may,bfj gave a powerpoint presentation of its may report at a public forum.at the first forum,designed to solicit public input on the proposal,several residents expressed concern about the impact of residential units on traffic and schools.in response to these citizen concerns,bfj analyzed these issues further.
in july,bfj issued a revised version of its study,which reiterated the proposal for r m zoning.bfj emphasized again that its proposal would be careful of not overwhelming the neighborhoods with any significant adverse environmental impacts,particularly traffic,visual effects,or burdens on public facilities.app x at.responding to issues raised at the citizen forum,the july report states that t here would be a smaller number of school children generated by the new development than with the development of homes with a community aimed at young couples and empty nesters,there could be as few as to public school children per unit.app x at.upon review of the report,the p zone committee adopted bfj recommendation for r m zoning for the approval of the board of trustees.
in september,as required by state law,bfj issued a draft environmental assessment form eaf for the proposed rezoning.the eaf concluded that the proposed rezoning to r m will not have a significant impact on the environment.app x at.the eaf further stated that the proposed development at the site would not result in the generation of traffic significantly above present levels and would have a minimal impact on schools.see app x at.in addition,the eaf emphasized that i n terms of potential aesthetic impacts,the proposed zoning controls were specifically designed to accommodate existing conditions,respect existing neighborhoods particularly residential neighborhoods,maximize the use of existing zoning controls and minimize adverse visual impacts.app x at.michael filippon,the superintendent of the garden city buildings department,concurred in these conclusions.
on october,an ad was placed in the garden city news entitled,tell them what you think about the county plan for garden city.app x at.this notice stated 
where is the benefit to garden city are we being urbanized 
the county is asking the village to change our existing zoning p public use zone to allow the county to sell the building and land now occupied by the social services building,to private developers.among the proposed plans housing up to apartments 
these proposals will affect all of garden city.
the village held a subsequent public forum on october,where bfj gave another powerpoint presentation summarizing the proposed rezoning.the record indicates that at this meeting,citizens again raised questions about traffic and an increase in schoolchildren.bfj again reiterated that traffic would be reduced relative to existing use,and that housing would generate fewer schoolchildren than the development of homes.in keeping with these conclusions,in november,bfj presented an additional report to the p zone committee,again confirming its proposal for the r m zoning control that allowed for a possible apartment units on the social services site.the november report set forth a draft text for the rezoning.
in light of bfj final report,on november,the garden city village board of trustees unanimously accepted the p zone committee recommendation for the rezoning.in addition,on december,the board made a finding pursuant to new york state environmental quality review act that the zoning incorporated in what was now termed proposed local law would have no impact on the environment.app x at.the proposed rezoning would,in keeping with nassau county wishes,permit residential development on the social services site in the new co b zone.in light of the r m controls on the property,such development could include units,or less dense alternatives such as homes.having endorsed the proposed rezoning,the board of trustees moved local law to a public hearing.
starting in january,three public hearings occurred in the span of one month.at the first hearing,on january,residents voiced concerns that housing would generate traffic,parking problems,and schoolchildren.in response,filippon emphasized,y ou have to remember that the existing use on that site now generates a certain amount of traffic,a fair amount of traffic.that use is going to be vacated.the two residential uses that are being proposed as one of the alternates,each of which on their face automatically generate far less traffic than the existing use.that is something to consider also.app x at.in addition,although assured by garden city officials that the rezoning could result in homes,one resident expressed concern that nassau county would ultimately only sell the property to a developer in order to maximize revenue.
on january,the eastern property owners association held a meeting at which trustee bee discussed bfj recommendation for the social services site.a summary of the meeting reports that trustee bee addressed many questions from the floor and,in doing so,expressed the opinion that garden city demographically has a need for housing.app x at.trustee bee also reiterated that because relatively few schoolchildren resided in existing housing in garden city,bfj and the board had reasonably predicted that housing would have less of an impact on schools than housing.trustee bee indicated he would keep an open mind but he still felt the recommended zoning changes were appropriate.app x at.in addition,trustee bee addressed citizen concerns about the possibility of affordable housing on the site.in response to one question,trustee bee stated that a lthough economics would indicate that a developer would likely build housing,the zoning language would also allow affordable housing as referred to by the resident asking the question at the social services site.app x at.the meeting notes further indicate that a majority of the residents who asked questions or made comments at the meeting supported restricting the rezoning of the site to homes.app x at.according to these notes,r esidents want ed to preserve the character of the village.one resident in particular requested the eastern property owners association board take a firmer stand on the p zone issue and only support r zoning,zoning for housing.app x at.
on february,the village held a third public hearing on the proposed rezoning.the record indicates that this hearing was well attended and much more crowded than usual.app x at mindful of the number of people who are here this evening and the likelihood that this hearing will take some time.after an introduction by trustee bee,the meeting commenced with two presentations.first,tom yardley of bfj emphasized that the proposed rezoning preserved the possibility of homes,and that any housing would not result in apartments due to height and density restrictions.second,nassau county executive suozzi,the author of the county real estate consolidation plan,emphasized the county need to sell the social services site to a private developer,as well as the benefits of developing housing on the property.during this discussion,a member of the audience interrupted suozzi.
thomas suozzi instead of putting commercial there or single family there,you do something right in between the two that creates a transition from the commercial area from one to the other.i guarantee you that it will be much better than what is there now,which is a building that is falling apart with a lot of problems in the building,a lot of problems going on around the building on a regular basis and a huge sea of parking.this will make it a much more attractive area for the property.housing will be more likely to generate empty nesters and single people moving into the area as opposed to families that are going to create a burden on your school district to increase the burden on the school district 
unidentified speaker you say it supposed to be upscale.
thomas suozzi it going to be upscale.single people and senior citizen empty nesters.if you sell your million house in garden city and you do want to take care of the lawn anymore,you can go into who lives in wyndham for example it a very upscale place.there a lot of retirees that live there.
app x at.when suozzi finished his presentation,the meeting was opened to questions from the public.the first question from the audience related to trustee bee statements last time,referring to the january,meeting of the eastern property owners association.
lauren davies i just confused between what suozzi said about the social services building.you said you wanted it to be upscale,from what i understand from what peter bee said the last time is that they wanted it to be affordable housing 
trustee bee well,either i or you misheard,because i do not recollect using that phrase.if i did it was an inappropriate phrase.the idea was a place for garden city seniors to go when they did not wish to maintain the physical structure and cut the lawns and do all the various things.but not necessarily looking at a different style of life.in terms of economics.
thomas suozzi we absolutely not interested in building affordable housing there and there is a great need for affordable housing,but garden city is not the location.we need to build housing there we would generate more revenues to the county by selling it to upscale housing in that location.that is what we think is in the character of garden city and would be appropriate there.
unidentified speaker how do you have control over what the developer does 
trustee bee before the next speaker though,just to finish on that last remark,neither the county nor the village is looking to create affordable housing at that spot.
unidentified speaker can you guarantee that,that it wo be in that building 
app x at.in response to these questions,suozzi indicated that the county would be willing to put deed restrictions on any property that we sold so that it ca be anything but upscale housing.app x at in response to further questioning,suozzi stated do take my word for it,we put whatever legal codifications that people want.this will not be affordable housing projects.that number one.app x at.gerard fishberg,garden city counsel,further noted that the estimated sale prices for residential units do suggest affordable housing.app x at.
throughout the remainder of the meeting,residents indicated their opposition to housing and their preference for homes.app x at i completely opposed to any dwellings in that area.i only in support of the single family r units.one resident emphasized that the proposed development was not in the flavor and character of what garden city is now.garden city started as a neighborhood of single family homes and it should remain as such.app x at.others stated,to applause from the audience,that w e not against residential,we against residential.applause.app x at see also app x at thomas suozzi you would probably like to see single family housing i presume.unidentified speaker single family.applause.app x at i do hear a compelling argument from anyone here tonight as to why we should have homes.can we take it out of the proposal.one resident expressed concern about the possibility of four people or ten people in an apartment and nobody is going to know that.app x at.
in keeping with these statements,citizens repeatedly expressed concern about limiting the options of a developer.
gail madigan w hen you sell this property you can guarantee that it what control do you have when you sell it to a developer 
thomas suozzi guarantee what what would you like us to guarantee 
gail madigan well,i would like to know what you are going to be able to do with it.you can tell them 
thomas suozzi the zoning controls what you can do.
gail madigan yeah,but if you sell it to a developer that comes in and is going to make housing there.
thomas suozzi he would do that if it was zoned for single family housing.if it zoned for single family housing you ca put in housing.
app x at.another citizen expressed concerns about the possibility of what any housing might eventually become.
anthony agrippina we left a community in queens county that started off similar,single family homes,two family homes,town houses that became six story units.it was originally for the elderly,people who were looking to downsize.it started off that way.right now you got full families living in one bedroom townhouses,two bedroom,the school is overburdened and overcrowded.
app x at.in response,another resident emphasized that the only way to control such consequences was to restrict the zoning.app x at the only guarantee is the zoning.this board is the only set of people who are here who can guarantee or do that.suozzi is not going to be the county executive forever.we do know what the predecessors sic will do.
as at the previous meetings,residents also expressed concern about traffic and schools.county and village officials reiterated that a transition to residential use,including housing,would generate far less traffic than the existing use of the social services site.
thomas suozzi one thing that would happen is that you would have less employees that work in that building,that would no longer be working there anymore.
sheila dimasso but,we would also have more traffic because of more people owning cars and leaving there in and out.as opposed to applause 
thomas suozzi you may want to clap for that,but that irrational.applause 
app x at.in addition,suozzi and garden city officials tried to explain to citizens their view that the proposed housing would actually generate fewer schoolchildren than development of homes.
david piciulo if you have units you will have more children potentially in there than single family homes.
david piciulo if you have units you will have more children potentially in there than single family homes.
thomas suozzi that not accurate.based upon statistics,people spend their whole lives looking at this stuff.that not true.so you may feel that way,but it not accurate.
david piciulo those are statistics having to do with a national study.if you drive down into the neighborhood,the average home here has two kids.they in the system for years and you are going to have children in the system let me just make a point.
gerard fishberg not to argue with you,again,i do think anybody has prejudged this.how many apartments are there in wyndham 
michael filippon.
gerard fishberg how many school children are there in apartments 
tom yardley less than twenty.
gerard fishberg less than twenty children in apartments.
app x at.bfj fish later testified that those residents who claimed to prefer homes because of school impacts were simply wrong.app x at.
in response to these questions suozzi made clear that before any development project was approved at the site,the developer would have to satisfy state environmental guidelines,including addressing concerns regarding traffic and impact on public services,such as schools.he further emphasized that these conclusions would be subject to public comment.
in march,in the weeks after this meeting,a flyer began circulating around garden city.the flyer stated,in relevant part 
will garden city property values decrease if over apartments are built at the site of social services 
the garden city village trustees are close to voting on how to zone this property.they might choose to zone it for housing if senator balboni current bill passes in june,as many as of those apartments would be considered affordable housing.according to this bill,affordable workforce housing means housing for individuals or families at or below of the median income for the nassau suffolk primary metropolitan statistical area as defined by the federal department of housing and urban development.not just garden city incomes 
is our school district crowded enough now the trustees are saying that there will be fewer additional students to the garden city school district if there are apartments or townhouses built at the p zone as opposed to single family homes.how can they be sure of that is it true that many families move to garden city to assure their children of a quality education what will bring more students,over families or families 
app x at.the reference to senator balboni current bill in the flyer related to legislation pending at the time which would impose requirements on developers on long island.the flyer reached garden city village administrator schoelle,who faxed it to fish and at least one member of the board of trustees.the flyer also came to the attention of trustee lundquist.
at a board meeting held on march,residents again raised concerns about the possibility of affordable housing at the social services site.schoelle notes from that meeting indicate that residents expressed concern that the balboni bill might apply retroactive ly.app x at.one resident urged to play it safe with respect to the balboni bill and vote for single family homes.app x at.the following month,trustee negri told residents at a central property owners association meeting that he and other village officials met with state representatives to discuss the balboni bill.he noted that the bill called for of all new housing developments to include affordable housing,and that a family of four making would qualify.negri indicated that he did not think the bill would pass.
in response to public pressure,bfj and garden city began modifying the rezoning proposal.in materials produced in april,bfj changed the proposal,reducing the number of units potentially available at the social services site to.however,by a memorandum to the board dated may,bfj scrapped the proposed r m zoning entirely.instead,bfj proposed rezoning the vast majority of the social services site residential townhouse r t,an entirely new zoning classification.app x at.the may proposal only preserved r m zoning on the acres of the social services site west of county seat drive,and only by special permit.thus,the development of housing would be restricted to less than of the social services site,and only by permit.bfj proposed description of the r t zone defined townhouse as a dwelling unit.app x at.
whereas the previous proposed rezoning took more than a year to come before the board,the shift to r t zoning moved rapidly through the village government.bfj issued a final eaf for r t rezoning in may.even though bfj officials testified that a switch from r m zoning to r t zoning was a significant change,no draft eaf was ever issued for the r t rezoning.in addition,the shift from the p zone to r t zoning was proposed by the board as local law and moved to a public hearing on may.the trustees further stated at this meeting that they hoped to have a final vote on the rezoning as soon as june,and that the bill had already been referred to the nassau county planning commission.explaining the switch,fish offered the following rationale 
this was,this was a conscious decision,and i think those of you who might have been at the last two workshops,this was discussed in quite a bit of detail,that there was,there was a concern that if the whole acres were developed for multi family it would generate too much traffic and it did serve,it did serve as a true transition 
so,that,the proposal has been modified where previously multi family would have been allowed in all acres,as of right,the proposal been modified so that it no longer allowed at all,you have to get a special permit for it,through the trustees,and it is a condition of the permit is that it can only be to the west of county seat drive.so,in essence,what the trustees have done,is they have reduced the multi family to less than percent of the site.
app x at.at this meeting,a member of the garden city community thanked the board of trustees for responding to the concerns of residents 
m y husband works twelve hour,fourteen hour days so that we can live here.we did inherit any money from anyone.we were given anything.we did expect anything from anyone.we worked very hard to live in garden city because of what it is.and i feel like very slowly it creeping away by the building that is going on a nd i just think to all of you,just keep,be strong,like,just keep garden city what it is.that is why people want to come here.you know,it just a beautiful,beautiful town,people would like to live here,but i just think,just think of the people who live here,why you yourselves moved here.you do move here to live near apartments.you do move here so that when you turn your corner there another.
app x at.toward the close of this meeting,a member of former plaintiff acorn spoke about the need for affordable housing in nassau county and asked that garden city consider building affordable housing.
w hat we saying with respect to the people that live in garden city,you know,everybody wants to see their community,you know,keep its values 
so,we asking other communities to share and build affordable housing in their community.i mean,i do know how we going to,you know,i guess the county executive has to figure out,give respect to each community.it not just,just not good for affordable housing to be built in s o me communities because it impacts on us and our school districts.it not turning out the best education system we could if we move into the other areas.we be able to get,we all benefit from it.
acorn members subsequently attended the nassau county planning commission the following week and again expressed opposition to r t zoning.at the same time,former plaintiff mhany,then known as new york acorn housing company nyahc,sent a letter to the nassau county planning commission strongly opposing r t zoning and warning that the new zone would ensure that developers can not create affordable housing.app x at.
on june,garden city board of trustees unanimously adopted the local law and the social services site was rezoned r t.the following month,nassau county issued a request for proposals rfp concerning the social services site under the r t zoning designation.the rfp stated that the county would not consider bids of less than million.
plaintiffs were unable to submit a bid meeting the specifications of the rfp.ismene speliotis,executive director of,analyzed the r t zoning and concluded that it was not financially feasible to build affordable housing under r t zoning restrictions at any acquisition price.testifying at trial,suozzi concurred with this assessment.recognizing the futility of an bid under r t zoning,nyahc contacted the county to work on a proposal that would include affordable housing,and urge d the planning commission to delay any action on its proposal while its legal and policy implications are considered more carefully.app x at.nyahc and new york acorn met with suozzi and other county officials to discuss the possibility of including affordable housing on the social services site.but the county did not reissue the rfp.failing in these negotiations,on september,nyahc submitted a protest proposal to the county for development of the social services site.
the county ultimately awarded the contract to develop the social services site to fairhaven properties,fairhaven,a developer of homes,for million,the highest bid.fairhaven proposed the development of detached homes,and did not include any townhouses.
after the contract was awarded to fairhaven,nyahc prepared four proposals,or pro formas,for development at the social services site under the r m zoning designation,with the percentage of affordable section housing units of the total rental units ranging from to.plaintiffs expert nancy mcardle evaluated each proposal in conjunction with the distribution of the available pool of renters and determined that,had nyahc been able to build housing under any of the four proposals in accordance with the rejected r m zoning designation,the pool of renters likely to occupy all units,including,affordable,and section units,would have likely been between and minority,with minority households numbering between and.under the proposal predicting minority population,nyahc would have been able to bid million for the social services site.
mcardle further analyzed the likely racial composition of the pool of homeowners who could afford to purchase units potentially developed by fairhaven.she determined that between three and six minority households could afford such a purchase.thus,while the nyahc proposals would likely increase racial diversity in garden city,mcardle testified,the fairhaven proposal would likely leave the racial composition of garden city unchanged.
procedural history 
on may,acorn,nyahc,and several individual plaintiffs filed suit against garden city and nassau county.plaintiffs asserted claims under the fair housing act fha,et,as well as,and title vi of the civil rights act of,et.plaintiffs principally argued that garden city shift from r m to r t zoning was racially discriminatory,and that nassau county failed to prevent this discrimination.plaintiffs also argued that the abandonment of r m zoning in favor of r t zoning had a disparate impact on minority groups,and thus violated the component of the fair housing act.finally,plaintiffs argued that nassau county actions and policies in steering affordable housing to certain communities violated its obligations under title vi of the civil rights act not to discriminate in the administration of federal funding,and under section of the fair housing act to affirmatively further fair housing.
on july,the district court bianco,denied garden city and nassau county motions to dismiss in their entirety.the district court rejected defendants arguments that plaintiffs lacked standing and concluded that they had adequately alleged discrimination on the basis of race.accordingly,the district court directed the parties to discovery.
acorn disbanded in early.at the same time,nyahc changed its name to mhany.in addition,nycc,an organization with the same goals and mission,and many of the same members as acorn,moved to intervene in this litigation.on june,the district court spatt,granted nycc permission to intervene as acorn practical successor.sja.
by memorandum and order dated february,the district court spatt,granted the county motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims against the county,and denied garden city motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded nassau county was not causally responsible for the alleged discriminatory conduct of garden city.the district court also rejected plaintiffs challenge to the county policies regarding the siting of affordable housing under section of the fair housing act,concluding that plaintiffs lacked a private cause of action to enforce this provision.the district court did not address plaintiffs parallel claim under title vi of the civil rights act,assuming that this claim was premised on the alleged discrimination regarding the social services site.
in resolving the summary judgment motions,the district court rejected defendants arguments that events at the social services site had rendered this case moot.despite nassau county sale contract,the transaction with fairhaven had never closed,apparently due to the pendency of this litigation.on january,suozzi was succeeded as county executive by edward mangano.in its summary judgment filing,the county informed the district court that rather than proceed with plans for private development,mangano had decided instead to construct a new nassau county family court building at the social services site.defendants thus argued that,because the county government was no longer selling the site to a private developer,and because plaintiffs only sought injunctive relief,the case had been rendered moot.the district court rejected this argument,concluding first that it was still possible to grant relief to plaintiffs,and second that even if the site was not sold,the court could still grant other effectual relief.
on june,the district court commenced a bench trial that spanned eleven days.in a december,decision,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had established,by a preponderance of the evidence,liability on the part of the garden city defendants for the shift from r m to r t zoning under the fha,et,based on a theory of disparate treatment and disparate impact and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.the district court reiterated the conclusions of previous opinions that plaintiffs had standing,and also rejected a renewed mootness argument from garden city.
the district court subsequently issued an order concerning appropriate remedies in light of plaintiffs violations.in a final judgment issued april,the district court granted plaintiffs the following relief against garden city a prohibitory injunction,fair housing training for garden city officials,a directive to garden city to pass a fair housing resolution,appointment of a fair housing compliance officer by garden city,and expenditure of reasonable sums to fund the relief required by the judgment.the district court also ordered that if nassau county decided to sell the social services site within one year of the date of judgment,then garden city must begin the process of rezoning the social services site from r t to r m controls.if nassau county did not make such an announcement,garden city would be required to join the nassau county urban consortium,a group of nassau county municipalities eligible for hud funds and require that of newly constructed residential development of units or more be reserved for affordable housing.
garden city then filed the present appeal.plaintiffs,challenging the district court grant of summary judgment to nassau county.ja.according to defendants,nassau county recently entered into a contract with mpcc to build the courthouse.on june,mpcc commenced interior demolition and asbestos abatement.although construction has begun,the project is not scheduled to be completed until.
discussion 
section a of the fair housing act,also known as title viii of the civil rights act of,makes it unlawful t o refuse to sell or rent or otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any person because of race,color,or national origin.a.the phrase otherwise make unavailable has been interpreted to reach a wide variety of discriminatory housing practices,including discriminatory zoning restrictions,leblanc sternberg fletcher,cir,and its language counsels in favor of recognizing liability.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive communities project,d.for this reason sections a and a of the fha provide for both discriminatory intent and liability.
in analyzing plaintiffs standing here,we look to the requirements of article iii.standing under the fair housing act is as broad as article iii permits.see havens realty coleman,d fair hous.in huntington comm.town of huntington,cir standing under the fha,whether suit is brought under section or section of the act,is coextensive with article iii standing.similarly,the parties do not argue,nor do we discern,any standing concerns that would prevent plaintiffs from bringing claims under sections and.
to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.we evaluate plaintiffs standing as of the outset of the litigation.cook colgate,cir.
in challenging standing,garden city focuses on the latter two prongs of the standing analysis,arguing that plaintiffs alleged injury denial of the opportunity to build affordable housing at the social services site is not fairly traceable to garden city rejection of r m zoning,nor redressable by a favorable decision.garden city contends,in essence,that there is no guarantee plaintiffs bid would have been accepted by nassau county even under r m zoning,and no certainty that the project would be built if a court ordered a return to r m zoning.garden city notes that,of plaintiffs four pro forma bids under r m zoning,the highest was million for a project containing apartments and affordable housing.this bid was,in relative terms,slightly less than the million fairhaven bid for the development of homes which nassau county ultimately accepted under r t zoning.based primarily on this difference,garden city speculates that even if the property remained zoned as r m,plaintiffs would have nevertheless been by a developer,due to nassau county hopes of maximizing the sale value of the site.
garden city standing argument requires both improper speculation and unnecessary certainty.as an initial matter,garden city argument depends on a level of certainty that we do not typically require in housing discrimination cases.a housing plaintiff need not show with absolute certainty that a project will succeed in order to establish standing.see fair hous.in huntington comm,at a bsent defendants challenged conduct,there is a substantial probability that housing with greater minority occupancy would have been built.because of the uncertainties inherent in the housing market,we have permitted housing discrimination plaintiffs to proceed based on a realistic opportunity to proceed with construction.huntington branch,town of huntington,cir 
for example,in huntington branch,this court emphasized that i ndeterminacy of financing alone is not enough to dismiss a housing discrimination action at the motion to dismiss stage.at.indeed,the court noted that the multitude of factors affecting ultimate financing capability are too variable to permit certainty in prediction.id.of course,those who have absolutely no realistic financing capability have no standing,because,as to them,invalidation of an offending ordinance would afford only moral satisfaction rather than a realistic opportunity to proceed with construction.id.internal citation omitted.however,in the case of the plaintiffs,who had proposed a specific project,the court concluded that i nvalidation of the challenged ordinance would tangibly improve the chances of construction of the project.id.at see also scott greenville,cir noting t he uncertainty surrounding carrying any housing development to fruition.
moreover,in village of arlington heights metropolitan housing development,d,the supreme court found that the defendants challenged action s stood as an absolute barrier to the construction project proposed by the plaintiff.id.at.if plaintiff secure d the injunctive relief it sought,that barrier would be removed.id.the injunction sought by the plaintiff would not,of course,guarantee that the proposed housing development w ould be built.id.the court recognized that the plaintiff would still have to secure financing,qualify for federal subsidies,and carry through with construction.id.footnote omitted.but the court concluded that such contingencies associated with housing development did not eliminate standing,because all housing developments are subject to some extent to similar uncertainties.id.the court found that the plaintiff proposed project was sufficiently detailed and specific that no undue speculation was required to establish standing.id.
in challenging standing here,garden city essentially demands the sort of certainty rejected in arlington heights and huntington branch.pointing to the slight difference between plaintiffs bid and the fairhaven bid,the only other bid in the record,garden city contends that plaintiffs can not guarantee that they would have outbid a developer.but garden city neglects to mention that,in addressing this exact same standing argument,the district court concluded,as a factual matter,that plaintiffs bid and the fairhaven bid were directly competitive.special app x at.given the relatively small difference in bids a matter of only this finding was not clearly erroneous see rajamin deutsche bank tr,cir noting that while we review a district court legal conclusion as to standing de novo,we review the factual findings underlying this determination only for clear error.
garden city also argues this case is distinguishable from huntington branch and arlington heights because in those cases,the plaintiffs had secured conditional contracts or options on the relevant properties.but the plaintiff who challenges a zoning ordinance or zoning practice need not have a present contractual interest in a particular project to have standing.warth seldin,d.given the uncertainties associated with financing in the housing market,the fact that plaintiffs bid was directly competitive with the only bid in the record provides us reason to believe that i nvalidation of the challenged ordinance would tangibly improve the chances of construction of the project.huntington branch,at.although overturning the shift to r t zoning would not guarantee plaintiffs success,given their ability to bid with a bidder,the district court appropriately concluded that they enjoyed a realistic opportunity to proceed with construction.id.at.to demand more would be to close our eyes to the uncertainties which shroud human affairs.id.redressability is not a demand for mathematical certainty.toll,township of readington,cir 
despite the district court conclusion that plaintiffs bidding was competitive with the only bid in the record,garden city argues that other hypothetical bids under r m zoning from developers might have been higher than the fairhaven bid.yet garden city argument on this point is founded in pure speculation.garden city theorizes that because luxury apartments would provide more units than homes,this would likely increase the return to the developer,and thus raise the bid price the project could support.but no such bids for apartments exist in the record.moreover,our review of the record does not reveal a clear answer to garden city surmise.compare app x at bfj zoning study suggesting that apartments,although each lower priced than houses,would yield a greater total market value in light of the greater number of units,with app x at suggesting differing estimates for whether homes or development would yield a higher land value.moreover,the mere fact that plaintiffs bid includes an element does not necessarily mean that a hypothetical apartment developer would outbid them.as plaintiffs note,an developer,unlike a developer,need not consider profit in making its bid proposal.moreover,developers have access to sources of funds a developer does not,including tax credits and others government programs encouraging affordable housing.
ii.mootness 
next,both nassau county and garden city argue that,even if plaintiffs had standing at the outset of this litigation,this case is now moot.in light of the county plans to construct a courthouse on the social services site,they contend any injury to plaintiffs regarding inability to construct affordable housing on the site is no longer caused by purported discriminatory zoning.rather,the superseding source of this injury is the decision to build a courthouse.
defendants,and garden city in particular,rely on the principle that mootness is standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.arizonans for official english arizona,d quoting parole comm geraghty,d see also henry monaghan,constitutional adjudication the who and when,yale,providing the source of this formulation.
this principle,however,is not comprehensive,laidlaw,at,and it fails to capture exceptions to mootness,particularly voluntary cessation cases and cases capable of repetition but evading review,id.these exceptions underline the different aims of the standing and mootness doctrines.the burden of establishing standing falls on the plaintiff,as it functions to ensure,among other things,that the scarce resources of the federal courts are devoted to those disputes in which the parties have a concrete stake.id.at.by contrast,the burden of showing mootness logically falls on a defendant because,by the time mootness is an issue,the case has been brought and litigated,often as here for years.to abandon the case at an advanced stage may prove more wasteful than frugal.id.at.
in our view,this case is appropriately analyzed under the voluntary cessation doctrine.under this principle,a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.city of mesquite aladdin castle,d see also laidlaw,at stating the voluntary cessation doctrine applies in cases mooted by the defendant voluntary conduct.the voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal activities will usually render a case moot if the defendant can demonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.granite state outdoor,town of orange,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
at bottom,the rule traces to the principle that a party should not be able to evade judicial review,or to defeat a judgment,by temporarily altering questionable behavior.city news novelty,city of waukesha,d.a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden.of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.laidlaw,at emphasis added.this is both a stringent,city of mesquite,at,and a formidable burden,laidlaw,at.
in this case,we are deeply skeptical that defendants have met their formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear that the social services site will never be used for housing.we are unpersuaded that the county has committed to this course permanently.although we recognize that when the defendant is a government entity,some deference must be accorded to a legislative body representations that certain conduct has been discontinued,lamar advert.of penn,llc town of orchard park,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted,some deference does not equal unquestioned acceptance.indeed,in city of mesquite,the supreme court reached the merits despite the fact that the offending language in the challenged ordinance had been removed during the pendency of the appeal.at.in finding the case not moot,the court noted that the city repeal of the objectionable language would not preclude it from reenacting precisely the same provision if the district court judgment were vacated.id.
here,suspicious timing and circumstances pervade the county decision to build a courthouse.although the county has authorized funding for the courthouse and has contracted with a construction management corporation,plaintiffs argue compellingly that various actions with respect to the courthouse project appear to track the development of this litigation.for example,the county announced its decision to build a courthouse on the social services site only on the eve of summary judgment motions.the county claims that plans for the courthouse were in place as early as.app x at noting that schematic designs for the building were issued in.despite counsel continuing duty to inform the court of any development which may conceivably affect the outcome of litigation,fusari steinberg,d burger,concurring,the county failed to notify the district court of the proposal until,when it moved for summary judgment,app x at affidavit submitted february.
the supreme court has viewed mootness claims skeptically when they are not timely raised.see city of erie pap,d o ur appraisal of pap affidavit is influenced by pap failure,despite its obligation to the court,to mention a word about the potential mootness issue in its brief in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari.bolstering our skepticism of defendants mootness claim,plaintiffs assert,and defendants do not contest,that the project was dormant for years after nassau county was dismissed at the summary judgment stage,and the threat of liability against the county diminished.although defendants note construction fences were recently put up around the site,plaintiffs observe,again without contradiction,that these fences went up approximately around the time the parties filed the respective notices of appeal in this case,and the threat of liability against nassau county again reemerged.lillbask ex rel.mauclaire.dep t of,cir finding the voluntary cessation doctrine applicable where there was no reason to doubt the sincerity of defendants representation to the court that the challenged conduct had ceased.
nor are we persuaded by defendants contentions that the injuries of two workers during construction on the site,along with asbestos abatement and interior demolition,render the county decision to build a courthouse irreversible.defendants argue that two workers have been injured during construction.asbestos abatement and interior demolition,at least on the basis of the record before us,would appear to be actions necessary before any action could be taken on the site.in fact,the article cited in garden city brief makes no mention of a courthouse,noting only that the workers were injured performing asbestos abatement on the social services site.
the county asserts that the courthouse project is in response to an emergency need for a new courthouse.but the county own filings indicate the county has been aware of the alleged urgent need for a new courthouse since at least.an emphasi s that the change had been under consideration long before the federal lawsuit of course cuts two ways.united states transit,cir.we are left wondering whether the courthouse project represents a convenient distraction,rather than a valid claim,which the county can cite when under threat of liability,only to ignore it when the threat of liability has passed.see christian legal soc y chapter of the of cal.martinez,d alito,dissenting particularly in light of hastings practice of changing its announced policies,these requests are not moot.
nor are we persuaded that a magistrate judge order stating that the county decision to build the courthouse was final,app x at,conclusively resolves this issue.the district court did not view this order as conclusively resolving the issue of mootness,construing the question de novo in both its summary judgment opinion and at trial.finally,although garden city argues that we are barred from reviewing this finding on appeal because it was not specifically challenged by plaintiffs.plaintiffs are inherently challenging the basis for this ruling,and a notice of appeal from a final judgment brings up for review all reviewable rulings which produced the judgment.songbyrd,estate of grossman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
there are simply too many questions surrounding construction of the courthouse for us to conclude that it is absolutely clear that the parties will not resume the challenged conduct.we recognize that the county may ultimately be sincere in its efforts to build a courthouse.however,given its actions up to this point,we conclude that on the present record the county has not met its formidable burden of showing that it will not permit the challenged conduct to resume.
though we conclude it is not absolutely clear that nassau county will not return to the challenged conduct,we need not decide at this time the parties other arguments concerning mootness.
iii.disparate treatment 
the district court concluded that garden city decision to abandon r m zoning in favor of r t zoning was made with discriminatory intent.the supreme court has long held,in a variety of circumstances,that a governmental body may not escape liability under the equal protection clause merely because its discriminatory action was undertaken in response to the desires of a majority of its citizens.united states yonkers bd.of educ.yonkers i,cir see also palmore sidoti,d private biases may be outside the reach of the law,but the law can not,directly or indirectly,give them effect.we find no clear error in the district court determination that garden city decision to abandon r m zoning was a knowing response to the vocal and racially influenced opposition among garden city citizenry.
plaintiffs prima facie case 
a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the municipal themselves or by those to whom the were knowingly responsive.leblanc sternberg,at internal quotation marks omitted.this court is required to give substantial deference to the trial court findings,and may not set them aside unless they are clearly erroneous.see diesel props,at after a bench trial,the court f indings of fact,whether based on oral or other evidence,must not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.quoting.a.we review a district court finding of discrimination after a bench trial for clear error.see tsombanidis haven fire dep t,cir the district court finding of intentional discrimination was not clearly erroneous.
in finding intentional racial discrimination here,the district court applied the familiar arlington heights factors.see arlington heights,at.because discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof,a district court facing a question of discriminatory intent must make a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.the impact of the official action whether it bears more heavily on one race than another may provide an important starting point.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but unless a clear pattern,unexplainable on grounds other than race,emerges,impact alone is not determinative,and the court must look to other evidence,id.footnote omitted.other relevant considerations for discerning a racially discriminatory intent include t he historical background of the decision particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes,id.at,d epartures from the normal procedural sequence,s ubstantive departures,and t he legislative or administrative history especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body,minutes of its meetings,or reports,id.at.
here,the district court premised its finding of racial discrimination primarily on two of these factors impact,the considerable impact that the village zoning decision had on minorities in that community and sequence of events,the sequence of events involved in the board decision to adopt r t zoning instead of r m zoning after it received public opposition to the prospect of affordable housing in garden city.special app x at.the district court noted a history of racial discrimination in garden city,but declined to place significant weight on this factor.see special app x at although past events could tend to suggest that racial discrimination has historically been a problem in garden city,the court declines to place significant weight on them for various reasons.
the district court first noted statistical evidence that the original r m proposal would have created a pool of potential renters with a significantly larger percentage of minority households than the pool of potential renters for the zoning proposal ultimately adopted as law by garden city.however,in making its finding of discrimination,the district court relied primarily on the sequence of events leading up to the implementation of r t zoning.the court first noted that garden city officials and bfj were initially enthusiastic about r m zoning.bfj proposal permitted the development of up to units,and trustee bee expressed the opinion at a january,meeting that garden city demographically has a need for housing,and that he would keep an open mind but he still felt the recommended zoning change were appropriate.app x at.
however,the district court concluded that bfj and the board abruptly reversed course in response to vocal citizen opposition to the possibility of housing,including complaints that affordable housing with undesirable residents could be built under this zoning.at a february,meeting,trustee bee stated that neither the county nor the village is looking to create affordable housing.app x at.bfj and the board subsequently endorsed the r t proposal,which banned the development of housing on all but a small portion of the social services site and then only by special permit.
the district court focused on the suddenness of this change.although the p zone committee had consistently recommended r m zoning for eighteen months,r t zoning went from proposal to enactment in a matter of weeks.the district court noted that bfj consideration of r t zoning was not nearly as comprehensive and deliberative as that for r m zoning.in addition,the court found it strange that members of the p zone committee the village officials most familiar with the situation were excluded from the discussions regarding r t zoning.indeed,after a final public presentation on the proposed r m zoning in april,schoelle,filippon,and fishberg met with bfj to review the public comments.for some unknown reason,members of the p zone committee did not participate in this meeting,and neither did the village zoning counsel kiernan.the district court also found it peculiar that local law,adopting r t zoning,was moved to a public hearing even though no zoning text had yet been drafted and no environmental analysis of the law impact had been conducted.thus,in rejecting garden city argument below that the adoption of r t zoning was business as usual,the district court concluded that garden city was seeking to rewrite history.special app x at.
although now recognizing the oddness and abruptness of this sequence of events,garden city argues that these facts should not raise any suspicion.the village contends that because bfj,the village trustees,and village residents had discussed the zoning of the site for more than a year,there was no need to spend additional time discussing the same issues once they settled on a preferable approach.while the adoption of r t zoning may seem rushed,and appear to be an abrupt change from garden city prior consistent course of conduct,according to garden city,this was actually just efficient local government.given the amount of time already invested in studying the social services site,r t zoning could proceed more quickly through the legislative process.while this may be one reasonable interpretation of the facts,the district court was nevertheless entitled to draw the contrary inference that the abandonment of r m zoning was an abrupt change and that the not nearly as deliberative adoption of r t zoning was suspect.special app x at.indeed,it is a bedrock principle that w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson city of bessemer city,d.
in considering the sequence of events leading up to the adoption of r t zoning,the district court also focused closely on the nature of the citizen complaints regarding r m zoning.citizens expressed concerns about r m zoning changing garden city character and flavor.app x at.in addition,contrary to garden city contentions that any references to affordable housing were isolated,citizens repeatedly and forcefully expressed concern that r m zoning would be used to introduce affordable housing and associated undesirable elements into their community.residents expressed concerns about development that would lead to sanitation that is overrun,full families living in one bedroom townhouses,two bedroom and four people or ten people in an apartment.app x at.other residents requested that officials guarantee that the housing would be upscale because of concerns about a huge amount of apartments that come and depress the market for any owner in this village.app x at.
the district court also noted garden city residents concerns about the balboni bill and the possibility of creating affordable housing,specifically discussing a flyer warning that property values might decrease if apartments were built on the site and that such apartments might be required to include affordable housing under legislation pending in the state legislature.this flyer came to the attention of at least two trustees,as well as fish and schoelle.concerned about the balboni bill,garden city residents urged the village officials to play it safe and vote for single family homes.app x at.viewing this opposition in light of the racial makeup of garden city,the lack of affordable housing in garden city,and the likely number of minorities that would have lived in affordable housing at the social services site,the district court concluded that garden city officials abrupt change of course was a capitulation to citizen fears of affordable housing,which reflected animus.
we find no clear error in the district court determination.the tenor of the discussion at public hearings and in the flyer circulated throughout the community shows that citizen opposition,though not overtly,was directed at a potential influx of poor,minority residents.indeed,the description of the garden city public hearing is eerily reminiscent of a scene described by the court in yonkers i 
at the meeting the predominantly white audience overflowed the room.the discussion was emotionally charged,with frequent references to the effect that subsidized housing would have on the character of the neighborhood.the final speaker from the audience stated that the bronx had been ruined when blacks moved there and that he supported the condominium proposal because he did not want the same thing to happen in yonkers.
yonkers i,at.although no one used explicitly racial language at the garden city public hearing,the parallels are striking.like the residents in yonkers,garden city residents expressed concern that r m zoning would change the flavor and character of garden city.app x at.citizens requested restricting the site zoning to homes in order to preserve the flavor and character of what garden city is now.app x at.citizens repeatedly requested guarantee s that no affordable housing would be built at the social services site and that the development would only be upscale.app x at.expressing concerns about the sort of residents who might occupy an eventual complex,one resident feared that the proposed development could have four people or ten people in an apartment and nobody is going to know that.app x at.and,as with the emotionally charged scene in yonkers,suozzi stated that citizens at the public hearing were yelling at him.app x at.finally,recalling the yonkers resident who spoke regarding the bronx being ruined,one resident explained that he had left queens because apartment buildings originally intended for the elderly resulted in full families living in one bedroom townhouses,two bedroom,the school is overburdened and overcrowded.you ca park your car.the sanitation is overrun.app x at.another resident stated that she had left brooklyn to avoid exactly the sort of development potentially available for the social services site.
the district court concluded that,in light of the racial makeup of garden city and the likely number of members of racial minorities that residents believed would have lived in affordable housing at the social services site,these comments were code words for racial animus.see aman cort furniture rental,cir observing that it has become easier to coat various forms of discrimination with the appearance of propriety because the threat of liability takes that which was once overt and makes it subtle.laws and lawsuits have educated violators such that extreme manifestations of discrimination are thankfully rare regrettably,however,this in no way suggests that discrimination based upon an individual race,gender,or age is near an end.discrimination continues to pollute the social and economic mainstream of american life,and is often simply masked in more subtle forms.id.at.r acially charged code words may provide evidence of discriminatory intent by sending a clear message and carrying the distinct tone of racial motivations and implications.smith fairview ridges,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
empirical evidence supports the reasonableness of the district court conclusion.indeed,research suggests that people believe that the majority of public housing residents are people of color,specifically,african american.see carol motley vanessa gail perry,living on the other side of the tracks an investigation of public housing stereotypes,pub.pol y marketing,see also id.at i n the united states,public housing residents are perceived as predominantly ethnic peoples mainly african american.here,the comments of garden city residents employ recognized code words about,minority housing for example,o pponents of affordable housing provide subtle references to immigrant families when they condemn affordable housing due to the fear it will bring in families with lots of kids.mai thi nguyen,victoria basolo abhishek tiwari,opposition to affordable housing in the usa debate framing and the responses of local actors,housing,theory soc y.here,invoking this stereotype,garden city residents complained of full families living in one bedroom townhouses,app x at,and four people or ten people in an apartment,app x at,as well as the possibility of overburdened and overcrowded schools,app x at.in addition,research shows that opponents of affordable housing may mention that they do not want their city to become another watts or bayview hunters point,both places with a predominantly african american population.nguyen,at.so too here,garden city residents expressed concerns about their community becoming like communities with populations,such as brooklyn and queens.moreover,a series of studies have shown that when whites are asked why they would not want to live near african americans no income level is indicated in the question,common responses relate to the fear of property value decline,increasing crime,decreasing community quality physical decay of housing,trash in neighborhood,and unkempt lawns and increasing violence.nguyen,at.repeatedly expressing concerns that r m zoning would lead to a decline in their property values as well as reduced quality of life in their community,garden city residents urged the board of trustees to keep garden city what it is and to think of the people who live here.app x at.considering these statements in context,we find that the district court conclusion that citizen opposition to r m zoning utilized code words to communicate their animus to garden city officials was not clearly erroneous.see smith town of clarkton,cir finding camouflaged racial expressions based on concerns about an influx of undesirables,who would dilute the public schools.while another factfinder might reasonably draw the contrary inference from these facially neutral statements,the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.anderson,at 
in response,garden city notes that its officials testified that they did not understand the citizen opposition to be.but,quite obviously,discrimination is rarely admitted.see rosen thornburgh,cir a victim of discrimination is seldom able to prove his or her claim by direct evidence and is usually constrained to rely on the cumulative weight of circumstantial evidence.iadimarco runyon,cir a n employer who discriminates will almost never announce a discriminatory animus or provide employees or courts with direct evidence of discriminatory intent.the district court reached its conclusion after a lengthy trial,during which the court had the opportunity to hear and evaluate the testimony of numerous witnesses,including all of the relevant garden city officials.moreover,there is ample evidence from which to question the credibility of these officials.trustee lundquist stated during his trial testimony that he was unsure if garden city an overwhelmingly white community was majority black.similarly,building superintendent filippon stated that he did not know if garden city was majority white.trustee negri further stated that he could not recall if he had ever had a conversation about affordable housing.
in addition to these incredible statements,which the district court would have been entitled to discredit,there was abundant evidence from which the district court could find that garden city officials clearly understood residents coded objections to r m zoning.during his testimony,village administrator schoelle indicated that he knew residents of garden city were primarily african americans and latinos.catanzaro weiden,cir plaintiff also presents evidence that the mayor and city officials knew the racial makeup of the middletown community.in addition,county executive suozzi testified to his knowledge that race is generally a factor in opposition to affordable housing in nassau county,and that garden city residents opposition to affordable housing was motivated,at least in part,by discriminatory animus.app x.furthermore,employing the code words apparently employed by garden city residents,trustee negri testified that housing occupied by minorities is not consistent with the character of garden city.app x at.
garden city argument appears to boil down to the following because no one ever said anything overtly,this was all just business as usual.but the district court was entitled to conclude,based on the arlington heights factors,that something was amiss here,and that garden city abrupt shift in zoning in the face of vocal citizen opposition to changing the character of garden city represented acquiescence to animus.
failing to show clear error in the district court factual findings,garden city also argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard for claims involving official responses to discrimination.but the district court recognized the appropriate standard,stating that u nder the theory of disparate treatment,a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case by showing that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the municipal themselves or by those to whom the were knowingly responsive.special app x at quoting leblanc sternberg,at emphasis omitted.although garden city cites this same case and the same standard,it contends that the district nevertheless applied the wrong standard,because at two points in its page opinion,the court noted that the comments of garden city residents reflected animus or at least could have been construed as such by the board.special app x at.seizing on the could have been construed language,garden city argues that the district court only found that garden city officials responded to opposition and that this opposition was,but never actually concluded that garden city officials knew this citizen opposition was.
although garden city is correct that the standard is not could have been construed,and local officials must knowingly respond to citizen opposition,we do not think this stray language reflects the legal standard that the court applied.as noted,at other points in its opinion,the district court set out in detail the correct legal standard and cited the exact same cases that garden city relies on.moreover,statements during trial indicate that the district court and all of the parties understood the appropriate standard.in denying garden city rule motion at the close of plaintiffs case,the district court recognized that plaintiffs had presented evidence that garden city officials changed the zoning to limit minorities from buying in the garden city area.app x at.in addition,during trial and in their briefing,both parties made this standard clear.app x at defendants reiterating that plaintiffs must show that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the municipal decision makers themselves or by those to whom the decision makers were knowingly responsive app x at plaintiffs arguing that it is disingenuous of garden city decision makers,for example trustee bee to claim that they did not know that racial animus played a part in residents opposition to multifamily and affordable hous ing app x at garden city government officials could not have been unaware that their constituents opposition to affordable housing was grounded in opposition to the likely minority occupants of such housing.in light of these statements,we believe the district court understood the applicable standard.
in any case,as discussed at length,the district court analysis and factual findings support the conclusion that garden city officials acted with knowledge of their constituents discriminatory animus.see ftc bronson partners,llc,cir a n error in terminology can be harmless so long as the substantive legal standard applied was the correct one.as the foregoing analysis of the district court factual findings shows,even if the district court applied a somewhat looser standard,its evidentiary findings are sufficient to support a conclusion of discrimination even under the correct standard,that garden city officials knowingly acquiesced to citizen opposition.accordingly,we find no error in the district court conclusion that plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination.
discrimination vel non 
garden city argues that,even if plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case,its residents opposed and its officials understood them to oppose r m zoning based on legitimate concerns.although it expressed significant skepticism about the legitimacy of these motives,the district court concluded that these other reasons may have played some role in the rezoning decision.however,applying a analysis,the district court nevertheless concluded that discrimination against minorities played a determinative role in the shift from r m to r t zoning.we find no error in the district court analysis and affirm its conclusion.
once a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of discrimination based on the arlington heights factors,the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate,reason for its actions.see reg l econ.cmty.action program,city of middletown,cir.here,the district court found that garden city met its minimal burden of production on this issue,as garden city contended that r t zoning was adopted instead of r m zoning because of concerns regarding traffic and school crowding,and because r t zoning would facilitate the development of townhouses as a residential form.
if a defendant meets its burden of production,the sole remaining issue is discrimination vel non.the plaintiffs must prove that the defendants intentionally discriminated against them on a prohibited ground.id.internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.although noting that some of garden city alternative justifications for the rezoning were not just disputed,but unsupported by the record,special app x at,the district court expressed reluctance to citizens and legitimate concerns about traffic and the promotion of townhouses,even if those concerns may have been,special app x at.deeming these additional concerns legitimate,the district court followed our decision in cabrera jakabovitz,cir,and applied the analysis set out in price waterhouse hopkins,d to plaintiffs claims.
while this standard has been modified by statute in the context of title vii,there is no indication it remains inapplicable to claims under the fair housing act,and therefore a plaintiff bears the burden of proof in showing that the adverse action was motivated,at least in part,by an impermissible reason.cabrera,at.if the plaintiff has sustained this burden,then the defendant can prevail if it sustains its burden of proving its affirmative defense that it would have taken the adverse action on the basis of permissible reason s alone.id.
here,relying on its analysis of plaintiffs prima facie case,the district court concluded that the shift in zoning had been motivated,at least in part,by discriminatory animus.it then proceeded to the second half of the price waterhouse analysis the same decision defense assessing whether garden city would have taken the same action solely on the basis of its purported legitimate reasons for rezoning.reviewing these alternative rationales,the district court concluded that even accepting these legitimate reasons,garden city would not have adopted r t zoning in the absence of discriminatory animus.
garden city challenges the district court analysis.yet because garden city is challenging the district court finding of discrimination,and because these issues are ultimately factual findings,see cabrera,at noting that the issue can be decided by a jury,our review is again for clear error.see thomas football league players ass n,this constituted an acceptable finding of mixed motives,and was not clearly erroneous,vacated in part on reh g wl.and again,we find no clear error in the district court factual analysis.
garden city argues that although citizens expressed concern about the possibility of affordable housing and the residents who might occupy it,public comment focused more broadly on mundane problems such as traffic and school overcrowding.yet the district court did not err in concluding that these other rationales were insufficiently weighty to justify a shift from r m to r t zoning in the absence of discriminatory intent.
with respect to traffic,garden city argues that its zoning expert testified that r t zoning,as compared to r m zoning,would potentially reduce traffic concerns.while the district court recognized this evidence,it also noted that traffic concerns became important to garden city officials only after the increase in public opposition to affordable housing.indeed,when residents raised questions regarding traffic from r m zoning in and early,garden city officials repeatedly dismissed these concerns.indeed,suozzi,agreeing with garden city officials at earlier presentations,criticized concerns regarding r m zoning as irrational.app x at.although bfj april presentation stated that r t zoning would reduce traffic relative to r m zoning,this study was only prepared after the public meetings,and the district court reasonably questioned the credibility of figures potentially created to justify a particular result.in addition,the district court noted other record evidence suggesting any decrease in traffic between r m and r t zoning was de minimis.fish testified that,even using a conservative approach,the elimination of housing would only reduce peak traffic by.app x at.the district court thus did not err in questioning whether such concerns were sufficiently strong to cancel out any discriminatory animus.
in conducting its mixed motive analysis,the district court also appropriately questioned the strength of garden city interest in developing townhouses.although garden city zoning expert testified that r t zoning facilitated the development of townhouses and thus potentially expanded the available forms of housing in garden city by defining townhouses within the village zoning code for the first time,there is minimal evidence in the record that garden city had any real interest in adding townhouses as a residential form prior to the rise in public opposition to r m zoning.indeed,the only evidence cited for this point by garden city is brief testimony from filippon that garden city had previously recognized the fact that it did not have townhouses available for prospective buyers.yet r t zoning was not actually necessary to further this goal,nor did it actually accomplish it.fish and filippon both testified that townhouses would have been permissible as a residential form even under r m zoning.similarly,r t zoning did not actually promote townhouses,as fairhaven,the winning bidder for the social services site,planned to develop homes.the same logic also undermines garden city purported interest in using r t as a transition zone between homes and the commercial district abutting the social services site.housing would have provided a similar transition and the ultimate selection of fairhaven meant no transition at all.
finally,citizen concerns regarding school overcrowding do not cast doubt on the district court mixed motive analysis.the district court noted fish estimate that while homes would,on average,produce one additional schoolchild,under r m zoning w ith a community aimed at young couples and empty nesters there could be as few as to public school children per unit.special app x at citing app x at.at trial,fish reiterated these assessments.app x at agreeing that it still holds true that there would be a smaller number of children generated by multifamily housing under rm than with the development of homes.fish further agreed that those who questioned these assessments were simply wrong.app x at.in addition,at the public hearing,suozzi and others deemed citizen complaints about potential school overcrowding not accurate.app x at.although garden city argues that a change in the resident mix would have altered these numbers,the district court was entitled to rely on the figures in the record undercutting this concern 
accordingly,we find no clear error in the district court determination that,while these concerns may have motivated in part the decision to adopt r t zoning,the decision would not have been made in the absence of a discriminatory motive.
failing to show clear error in the district court analysis,garden city questions the mode of this analysis.garden city argues that the district court improperly placed the burden on the village to show that it would have made the same decision even in the absence of a discriminatory motive,and should have instead placed the burden on plaintiffs to show that discrimination was the cause of the rezoning decision.garden city critique of the district court analysis relies on the supreme court decision in gross fbl financial services,d,where the court held that because the adea prohibits adverse actions taken because of an employee age,adea plaintiffs can not rely on the price waterhouse analysis,and instead bear the burden of showing that age was the cause of the challenged employer decision.id.at.garden city contends that because the fair housing act similarly prohibits mak ing unavailable or deny ing a dwelling because of race,a,the district court should have placed the burden on plaintiffs to show that animus was the cause of the shift to r t zoning 
this argument is forfeited.garden city concedes that it failed to raise this argument before the district court,and it is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.greene united states,cir.although we can exercise our discretion to entertain new arguments where necessary to avoid a manifest injustice or where the argument presents a question of law and there is no need for additional,bogle assegai connecticut,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the circumstances normally do not militate in favor of an exercise of discretion to address new arguments on appeal where those arguments were available to the parties below and they proffer no reason for their failure to raise the arguments below,in re nortel networks.sec,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.garden city requests that we excuse the present forfeiture because the parties did not brief the issue of mixed motives below,in light of plaintiffs contention that garden city legitimate reasons for rezoning were pretextual.
a review of plaintiffs briefing undercuts this contention.although much of the discussion in the district court focused on pretext,an entire section in plaintiffs brief is devoted to the issue of under a mixed analysis.app x at garden city did not meet its burden to prove that r t zoning would have been adopted had the impermissible purpose not been considered.in this section,plaintiffs argue that e ven if r t addressed any legitimate zoning concerns,that discriminatory animus motivated the change even in part is enough to support a finding of discriminatory intent.app x at.in addition,plaintiffs noted that h ad the impermissible purpose of excluding minorities from garden city not been considered,r t zoning would not have been adopted.app x at.the issue of causation and who bore what burden in showing causation among the various motives was sufficiently raised by plaintiffs that defendants were on notice that they could have raised their gross argument.accordingly,we decline to exercise our discretion to overlook garden city failure to address this issue below.
in any event,even if we considered this argument,it runs headlong into circuit precedent.in cabrera,at,considering,inter alia,a fair housing act claim,this court adopted the price waterhouse analysis,concluding that once a plaintiff proves an adverse action was motivated,at least in part,by an impermissible reason,the defendant can prevail if it sustains its burden of proving its affirmative defense that it would have taken the adverse action on the basis of the permissible reason alone.we are bound by cabrera.in re zarnel,cir noting that a panel of this court is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.
moreover,when congress amended the fha in,the circuits were largely in agreement that if one of the motivating factors for an act was unlawful,the act violated the fha.see robinson lofts realty,cir williams matthews,cir hanson veterans,cir jordan dellway villa,cir united states pelzer realty,cir smith sol adler realty,cir.when congress amends an act without altering the text,it implicitly adopt s the court construction of the statute.inclusive communities project.at quoting forest grove sch.dist,d.although gross may cast doubt on this conclusion,by its terms,gross applies only to the adea,and we decline to address whether gross applies to the fha in the absence of clearer guidance from the supreme court.accordingly,even if we overlooked garden city present forfeiture,we would adhere to our existing precedent.
iv.disparate impact 
garden city also challenges the district court conclusion that the shift from r m to r t zoning violated the disparate impact prong of the fair housing act.the supreme court recently affirmed that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the fair housing act.see inclusive communities project.at holding that claims are cognizable under the fair housing act upon considering its language,the court interpretation of similar language in title vii and the adea,congress ratification of claims in against the backdrop of the unanimous view of nine courts of appeals,and the statutory purpose.
the second circuit has outlined a test for a disparate impact claim.under this test,a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by showing,the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices,and a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant facially neutral acts or practices.city of middletown,at see also tsombanidis,at.once a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case of disparate impact,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that its actions furthered,in theory and in practice,a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.tsombanidis,at quoting huntington branch,at emphasis added.
in,however,before the district court decision was rendered,the secretary of housing and urban development hud issued a regulation interpreting liability under the fha.see implementation of the fair housing act discriminatory effects standard,codified at part.in addition to affirming disparate impact liability as an element of the fha,it outlined the b urdens of proof in discriminatory effects cases.c.under this framework,the first two steps are substantially the same as in our case law first,a plaintiff or charging party must come forward with a prima facie case and second,the defendant or respondent may rebut the prima facie case by proving that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial,legitimate,nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or defendant.c.however,unlike huntington branch and its progeny,if the defendant meets its burden,the burden of proof shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the substantial,legitimate,nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.c.
instead of following hud framework,despite being well aware of hud regulation,see special app x at,the district court applied our traditional test.the district court concluded that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of disparate impact,finding that garden city rejection of r m zoning in favor of r t zoning had a significant disparate impact on minorities because it largely eliminated the potential for the type of housing that minorities were disproportionately likely to need namely,affordable rental units.special app x at.but the district court also found that r t zoning advanced certain legitimate,bona fide governmental interests,noting that r t zoning would have reduced traffic and would have provided for the construction of townhouses.but the district court held that garden city did not establish the absence of a less discriminatory alternative.special app x at.plaintiffs argue that,as a practical matter,the district court did place the burden on plaintiffs to show that r m zoning was a less discriminatory alternative.see,special app x at plaintiffs have established,by a preponderance of the evidence that less discriminatory alternatives to the current zoning ordinance existed.we are unpersuaded.it is clear that the district court shifted the burden to defendants to prove both a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve with less discriminatory effect.special app x at.the district court may have found defendants reasons unpersuasive,but that does not mean it placed the burden of proof on plaintiffs in accordance with c.
for this reason,garden city argues that the district court erred in requiring it to prove the absence of a less discriminatory alternative.plaintiffs argue that garden city argument to this effect is waived and,in any case,contrary to circuit precedent.but appellate courts are bound to consider any change,either in fact or in law,which has supervened since the district court judgment was entered.patterson alabama.see also kamen kemper fin,d when an issue or claim is properly before the court,the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties,but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.here,we exercise our prudential discretion to review a potentially waived argument.see bogle assegai,at.
section a of the fha gives the secretary of hud the authority and responsibility for administering the act,a,and confers upon the secretary authority to make rules including rules for the collection,maintenance,and analysis of appropriate data to carry out this subchapter.because congress afforded hud the authority to implement the fha,under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,this court must defer to the agency reasonable interpretation unless the intent of congress is clear.at.the supreme court implicitly adopted hud approach,see inclusive communities project.at stating that before rejecting a business or public interest,a court must determine that a plaintiff has shown that there is an available alternative practice that has less disparate impact and serves the entity legitimate needs alteration in original quoting ricci destefano,d,and while the approaches of our sister circuits have varied in the past,many had already placed the burden of proving a less discriminatory alternative on the plaintiff or have now since deferred to hud interpretation,see holly gardens citizens in action,twp.of mount holly,cir placing the burden on plaintiffs to demonstrate that there is a less discriminatory way to advance the defendant legitimate interest gallagher magner,cir same groach assocs,cty.metro human relations comm n,cir same see also inclusive communities project.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs,cir adopting hud interpretation,aff and remanded.at.
while the district court did not address this issue below,the question of whether one of our decisions has been abrogated by an agency regulation that reflects the agency interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision is a question of law that we can,and should,answer ourselves.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet servs.brand x,d considering de novo whether a previous ninth circuit decision was abrogated by a subsequent agency regulation.our earlier approach applied in huntington branch and tsombanidis may only survive if we previously held that our construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.brand x,at.because we did not hold that the statute was unambiguous,see tsombanidis,at huntington branch,at,we are obliged to defer to the more recent hud regulations.thus,we remand to the district court for consideration of whether plaintiffs satisfied their burden of proving an available alternative practice that has less disparate impact and serves defendants legitimate nondiscriminatory interests.
at the same time,we are mindful of the supreme court admonishment that all too often zoning laws and other housing restrictions function unfairly to exclude minorities from certain neighborhoods without any sufficient justification and that s uits targeting such practices reside at the heartland of liability.inclusive communities project.at.for this reason,we believe the district court extensive analysis of plaintiffs prima facie case merits discussion.
first,as the supreme court has made clear this year,zoning laws or ordinances prohibiting construction of dwellings have been found in violation of the fha.id.at citing huntington branch,at and united states city of black jack,cir invalidating ordinance prohibiting construction of new dwellings.second,we find no merit in defendants argument that the district court improperly allowed plaintiffs to challenge a single,isolated zoning decision,rather than a general zoning policy.garden city argues that disparate impact liability does not exist when a plaintiff challenges a defendant decision.rather than challenging the village zoning ordinances in general,the plaintiffs complain about a decision affecting one piece of property.we decline defendants invitation to draw a line defining what constitutes a zoning decision as opposed to a zoning policy.even assuming this distinction is relevant,given the many months of hearings and meetings,see special app x at,with charges that r m zoning would harm traffic conditions and increase school overcrowding,and that the change required passage of a local law,we are confident this case falls well within a classification of a general policy.
additionally,in the title vii and adea contexts,courts have permitted cases dealing with disparate impact challenges to single decisions of employers.council,am.fed of state,cty.mun,afl cio ward,cir see also nolting yellow freight,cir considering a disparate impact case under adea based on a decision to use performance ratings for single layoff decision.indeed,other circuits have described the distinction between a single isolated decision and a practice as analytically unmanageable almost any repeated course of conduct can be traced back to a single decision.council,at.
moreover,plaintiffs also note that there are two methods of proving the discriminatory effect of a zoning ordinance adverse impact on a particular minority group,and harm to the community generally by the perpetuation of segregation.huntington branch,at recognizing both forms of disparate impact under fha.here,the district court concluded that the r t zone restriction on the development of housing perpetuates segregation generally because it decreases the availability of housing to minorities in a municipality where minorities constitute approximately only of the overall population and only of the population living in households.special app x at.
for these reasons,we agree with the district court assessment that plaintiffs more than established a prima facie case.we also agree that defendants identified legitimate,bona fide governmental interests,such as increased traffic and strain on public schools.but for the reasons stated above,we remand for consideration of whether plaintiffs met their burden under c.
cross appeal 
the final issue in this case is the,in which plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of nassau county at the summary judgment stage.we review orders granting summary judgment de novo,focusing on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see dalberth xerox,cir.we resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see nationwide life ins.bankers leasing ass n,cir.summary judgment is appropriate w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
nassau county approval of garden city discrimination 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs disparate treatment claims against nassau county at the summary judgment stage,concluding that they failed to raise factual issues as to whether the county bore a sufficient causal relationship to garden city discriminatory shift in zoning.the district court concluded that the county lacked legal power over the chosen zoning designation for the social services site.it further refused to hold the county liable for failing to combat,either formally or informally,garden city discrimination.the district court dismissed the disparate impact and equal protection claims against the county based on the rezoning on similar logic.
plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in concluding that the county did not bear responsibility for the shift to r t zoning,arguing that they raised genuine disputes as to material fact issues on this point.plaintiffs argument has two prongs the county knew that opposition to r m zoning was racially animated,and the county had legal responsibility for r t zoning.
as to the first issue,we agree with the district court that,at the summary judgment stage,plaintiffs raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether county officials understood the opposition to r m zoning as.however,we also agree with the district court that plaintiffs have not raised a genuine issue of material fact on the second issue whether the county had legal responsibility for garden city adoption of r t zoning.we do not find either of plaintiffs arguments on this second point persuasive.
first,plaintiffs argue that under new york law,the nassau county planning commission was required to review garden city proposed r t zoning ordinance before it was enacted,and to recommend approval,modification,or disapproval,of the proposed action,or report that the proposed action has no significant or impact.mun.law m a.this law gives the commission an advisory veto which the town or village legislative body can override by a vote of a majority plus one of such body total membership.we assocs.bear,s ection m does not give the planning commission an absolute veto power.here,rather than objecting to r t zoning under section m,the commission issued a report approving the zoning.
plaintiffs argue that despite knowing the law to be discriminatory,the county did not exercise its advisory power to disapprove the zoning law.plaintiffs argue that the county failure to formally disapprove a shift it knew was discriminatory implicates the county in garden city discrimination.this court has previously held that,in the context of discrimination claims,l iability may be premised not only on action but on a refusal to act.united states city of yonkers yonkers ii,cir.in situations where an official ha d authority to intervene,and he knew about the discriminatory practices then he could be liable.comer cisneros,cir.however,plaintiffs argument that nassau county could have prevented garden city discriminatory zoning is premised on speculation.
plaintiffs concede that garden city could have adopted r t zoning over the county veto with a majority plus one vote.and in this case,garden city board of trustees adopted r t zoning unanimously.this unanimous vote would seem to obviate any causal role for nassau county in the adoption of r t zoning.since garden city could have overridden any county disapproval,any advisory disapproval by the county would likely have been ineffective.
generally,speculation by the party resisting the motion will not defeat summary judgment.kulak city of new york,cir.here,plaintiffs argue,without any evidence of past practice,that the nassau county planning commission could use the advisory veto contained in section m as a bully pulpit for the county to shame towns and villages in danger of acquiescing to the animus of their citizens.as an initial matter,plaintiffs provide no evidence that the county has previously exercised such authority.indeed,nassau county points to evidence that the planning commission role was to act as a harmonizer between communities and not as a tasked with keeping discriminating localities in line.app x at the purpose of the commission review is to provide input on actions that may have an impact across municipal boundaries,or that may be of significance and therefore require coordination among municipalities.yonkers ii,at finding that the applicable statute placed a responsibility on state officials to take steps to achieve desegregation.
moreover,even if disapproving potentially discriminatory actions by municipalities does fall with
