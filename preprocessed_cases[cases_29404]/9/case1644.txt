nicholas yarris claims he spent years on death row for a kidnaping,rape,and murder he did not commit because delaware county,its prosecutors,and its detectives obscured and destroyed evidence pointing to the actual killer,manufactured evidence against him,and thwarted his demands for dna testing.after yarris conviction was overturned and the charges against him were dropped,he filed this action under alleging violations of his rights under the united states constitution and pennsylvania law.the prosecutors and detectives moved to dismiss yarris claims on the basis of absolute and qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion to dismiss in part,and this appeal followed.we are asked to determine whether the district court properly concluded that the prosecutors and detectives are not entitled to immunity from any of yarris claims.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
factual background 
in,yarris was arrested and charged with attempted murder after assaulting a police officer during a traffic stop.yarris was subsequently placed in solitary confinement in a delaware county prison.yarris was addicted to methamphetamine at the time of his arrest,and he began suffering from cold turkey withdrawal.
while in prison,yarris learned from a newspaper of the unsolved kidnaping,rape,and murder of linda mae craig,which took place four days before yarris arrest.in an effort to bargain for release from prison,yarris told delaware county detectives randolph martin martin and david pfeifer pfeifer that he had information about the craig murder.he told the detectives that a fellow drug addict had admitted to raping and murdering craig,but that the addict had since died from a drug overdose.in fact,yarris was wrong and it was the addict brother who had died from an overdose.after determining that yarris information was incorrect,martin and pfeifer returned yarris to solitary confinement and told him that unless he came up with a better story they would think he had raped and murdered craig.
after a failed suicide attempt and a brief hospital stay,yarris was again returned to solitary confinement.yarris claims that he was placed in a freezing cell with broken windows,without any clothes,sheets,or blankets.seeking a transfer to a different cell,yarris offered to share more information about the craig murder with a prison guard.according to the prison guard,yarris said that he raped craig,but that another man murdered her.the day after yarris conversation with the guard,yarris was charged with kidnaping,robbing,raping,and murdering craig.
before proceeding to trial for the craig murder,yarris was tried and acquitted for the crime for which he was initially arrested and attempted murder of a police officer.after the verdict,the prosecutor assigned to the case,assistant district attorney barry gross gross,allegedly slammed his case file against the courtroom wall,screamed at yarris,motherfucker,you never leave the county alive and spat in yarris face.
yarris subsequently went to trial for the craig murder,with gross prosecuting the case.at trial,the prosecution introduced into evidence a photograph of the bloody interior of the victim car,which showed a pair of men leather gloves inside the vehicle.the prosecution had never informed yarris that the gloves existed and,according to yarris,had determined that the gloves were too small to fit yarris.nonetheless,the prosecution led the jury to infer that yarris fingerprints were not found in the vehicle because he wore the gloves.in addition to two witnesses who testified that they observed yarris stalking the victim,the prosecution presented the testimony of charles catalino,a jailhouse informant who stated that yarris confessed his guilt while the two were detained in adjacent cells at the delaware county prison.yarris claims the informant testified against him in exchange for a reduced sentence and visits with his wife.on july,the jury found yarris guilty on all counts and returned a verdict recommending imposition of the death penalty.yarris was formally sentenced to death on january.the pennsylvania supreme court eventually affirmed yarris conviction and sentence in october of.
in march of,yarris requested testing of the physical evidence recovered from the crime scene using newly developed dna testing techniques.he was initially informed by the district attorney office that all of the relevant evidence had been destroyed,except for two stained slides.the slides were tested,but in august of the laboratory rejected them as being of insufficient quantity for dna testing.
after reviewing the transcripts of his criminal trial,yarris discovered the existence of two additional slides.yarris contacted the district attorney office and assistant district attorney dennis mcandrews sent two detectives to retrieve the evidence and transport it to the coroner and then to the laboratory.according to yarris,detectives pfeifer and john davidson never delivered the slides to the coroner instead,they kept the slides in a paper bag under a detective desk where the slides eventually rotted and were rendered useless for dna testing.in,additional evidence in the form of the victim clothing was discovered.yarris successfully petitioned for dna testing of this evidence in november of,but the results were inconclusive.
beginning in,yarris began to request that evidence be tested again,this time using a newer and more accurate type of dna testing known as dna testing.the district attorney eventually agreed to additional testing of the evidence in september,but only if the testing was conducted by the alabama department of forensic science,which yarris alleges was not competent in dna testing.the test results were inconclusive.
yarris eventually sought habeas relief from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.in april of,dna testing was performed on the gloves found in the victim car,and the results indicated that yarris was not the habitual user of the gloves.dna testing was then performed on semen stains found on the victim clothing,and the results indicated that the sample did not come from yarris,but did come from two unknown males,one of whom was the habitual user of the gloves.dna testing was then done on scrapings found under the victim fingernails,which revealed that the scrapings were from the habitual user of the gloves.
in light of the new evidence,on august,the district court ordered that yarris be granted a new trial within two weeks,or that yarris be set free.on august,the district attorney office and yarris counsel filed a joint petition in the delaware county court of common pleas requesting that the conviction be vacated.the court vacated yarris conviction and sentence on september.after receiving a extension to consider whether to yarris,the district attorney dropped all charges against yarris on december.yarris was released from prison on january.
procedural background 
yarris commenced this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on august.in his complaint,yarris named as defendants the county of delaware the office of the district attorney of delaware county the criminal investigation division of the office of the district attorney of delaware county assistant district attorneys barry gross,dennis mcandrews,and william ryan,and criminal investigation division detectives randolph martin,clifton minshall,david pfeifer,and craig siti.yarris later filed an amended complaint,which contains two causes of action arising out of yarris arrest and conviction for murder in the first for federal constitutional claims,and the second for claims under pennsylvania law.
the adas and cid detectives moved,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis of,among other things,absolute and qualified immunity.the district court granted the motion as to yarris fifth amendment claim against all defendants,and yarris claims against minshall,who is no longer living.yarris delaware county,dist.lexis,at.however,the district court denied the motion as to the remainder of yarris claims against assistant district attorneys gross,mcandrews,and ryan collectively,the adas,and criminal investigation division detectives martin,pfeifer,and siti collectively,the cid detectives.id.the adas and cid detectives appealed the district court denial of absolute and qualified immunity.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and,as this case involves claims of constitutional violations brought pursuant to.the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over yarris state law claims pursuant to a.we have appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal of the district court order denying absolute and qualified immunity from yarris constitutional claims to the extent that the order turns on issues of law.see mitchell forsyth,d.
we exercise plenary review of the legal issues of absolute and qualified immunity.see kulwicki dawson,cir.we apply the same standard that district courts apply at the stage,and our review is limited to the contents of the complaint and any attached exhibits.see id.at.we are thus concerned with neither the accuracy of the facts alleged nor the merits of yarris underlying claims.we must construe the facts in the manner most favorable to yarris,in order to determine whether the state officials are entitled to absolute or qualified immunity from any claims based on their alleged conduct.
iii.discussion 
the adas and cid detectives argue that the district court should have granted their motion to dismiss because they are immune from each of yarris claims against them.specifically,the adas contend that they are entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity,and the cid detectives contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity.we address these arguments in turn.

absolute immunity from yarris constitutional claims 
although purports to subject e very person acting under color of state law to liability for depriving any other person in the united states of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,the supreme court has recognized that was not meant to abolish wholesale all immunities.pierson ray,d.to that end,the court has identified two kinds of immunities under qualified immunity and absolute immunity.most public officials are entitled only to qualified immunity harlow fitzgerald,d.however,for public officials who perform special functions,butz economou,d,the court has determined that absolute immunity is appropriate because it is better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.imbler pachtman,d quotation marks and citation omitted.t he official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question.burns reed,d.
in imbler,the supreme court held that state prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability under for actions performed in a role.see at.this immunity extends to acts that are intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,such as initiating a prosecution and presenting the state case.id.at.the supreme court has noted numerous public policy considerations underlying its extension of absolute immunity to prosecutors 
s uits against prosecutors for initiating and conducting prosecutions could be expected with some frequency,for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the state advocate lawsuits would divert prosecutors attention and energy away from their important duty of enforcing the criminal law prosecutors would have more difficulty than other officials in meeting the standards for qualified immunity and potential liability would prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.t here are other checks on prosecutorial misconduct,including the criminal law and professional discipline.
burns,at.citing imbler,at.
since extending absolute immunity to state prosecutors in imbler,the supreme court has clarified that absolute immunity does not extend to a prosecutor administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings.buckley fitzsimmons,d see also burns,at.at the same time,the court has reaffirmed that acts undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial,and which occur in the course of his role as an advocate for the state,are entitled to the protections of absolute immunity.buckley,at.
ultimately,whether a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity depends on whether she establishes that she was functioning as the state advocate while engaging in the alleged conduct that gives rise to the constitutional violation.see id.at.as the supreme court explained in kalina fletcher,in determining immunity,we examine the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it,d internal quotation marks,citation,and footnote omitted.
turning to the instant case,yarris amended complaint alleges that the adas engaged in conduct that violated yarris rights under the fourth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution in support of these claims,the amended complaint alleges that the adas deliberately destroyed exculpatory evidence,withheld exculpatory evidence,fabricated a false confession,and obtained a false statement from a jailhouse informant we analyze whether the adas are entitled to absolute immunity from claims based on this alleged conduct below.
deliberately destroying exculpatory evidence 
the amended complaint alleges that the adas violated yarris fourteenth amendment rights when they deliberately destroyed highly exculpatory information.although we have not directly addressed whether prosecutors are absolutely immune from claims based on the destruction of exculpatory evidence,we have denied absolute immunity where a plaintiff alleged that a prosecutor knowingly failed to preserve exculpatory evidence.see henderson fisher,cir per curiam.we have also observed that courts have been unwilling to extend absolute immunity to a prosecutor alleged perjury or destruction of evidence when not closely connected to an ongoing criminal prosecution.davis grusemeyer,cir but see heidelberg hammer,cir prosecutor absolutely immune from suit claiming that he destroyed and falsified evidence.
we believe that destroying exculpatory evidence is not related to a prosecutor prosecutorial function.unlike decisions on whether to withhold evidence from the defense,decisions to destroy evidence are not related to a prosecutor prosecutorial function.as our late colleague judge becker aptly observed in wilkinson ellis,
o nce the decision is made not to furnish evidence to the defense,no additional protectible prosecutorial discretion is involved in deciding to dispose of it,and,while deciding not to furnish the prosecution evidence to the defense may be an act of advocacy,throwing the evidence away is not such an act.
accordingly,the adas are not entitled to absolute immunity from suit for constitutional violations caused by their alleged deliberate destruction of exculpatory evidence.
withholding exculpatory evidence 
the amended complaint next alleges that the adas violated yarris constitutional rights when they withheld highly exculpatory information fail ed to disclose investigatory materials and exculpatory evidence fail ed to release physical evidence for dna testing in a prompt manner and failed to release exculpatory physical,investigatory,and dna evidence.
it is well settled that prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity from claims based on their failure to disclose exculpatory evidence,so long as they did so while functioning in their prosecutorial capacity.as the supreme court explained in imbler,the deliberate withholding of exculpatory information is included within the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion.at.see also smith holtz,cir.furthermore,courts have held that prosecutors are entitled to immunity even when they withhold evidence after trial while the criminal conviction is on appeal.see,parkinson cozzolino,cir explaining that absolute immunity covers prosecutors actions after the date of conviction while a direct appeal is pending.here,even accepting the allegations concerning the adas as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in yarris favor,we find that the adas are absolutely immune from claims based on allegations that they intentionally concealed exculpatory evidence prior to trial.see imbler,at.
less clear is whether the adas are absolutely immune from claims based on allegations that they withheld exculpatory evidence,in the form of dna samples,after yarris was convicted and sentenced to death.we agree with other courts that a bsolute immunity applies to the adversarial acts of prosecutors during proceedings where the prosecutor is personally involved and continues his role as an advocate,but that where the role as advocate has not yet begun or where it has concluded,absolute immunity does not apply.spurlock thompson,cir.compare houston partee,cir no absolute immunity where prosecutors were not personally prosecuting the appeal in proceedings with carter burch,cir absolute immunity where prosecutor was handling the postconviction motions and the initial direct appeal and thus still functioning as an advocate for the state.after a conviction is obtained,the challenged action must be shown by the prosecutor to be part of the prosecutor continuing personal involvement as the state advocate in adversarial proceedings to be encompassed within that prosecutor absolute immunity from suit.
based on the facts on the record as it now stands,the prosecutors have not satisfied their burden of showing that they are entitled to the immunity they seek.yarris direct appeal to the supreme court of pennsylvania was argued in april and decided in october of.see commonwealth yarris.yarris numerous requests for dna testing of physical evidence began in march in an attempt to uncover new evidence that might entitle him to extraordinary relief in case the legal avenues he was pursuing did not succeed.the prosecutors have not shown that their response to yarris dna test requests was part of their advocacy for the state in proceedings in which they were personally involved.
without such a showing,a prosecutor acting merely as a custodian of evidence after conviction serves the same function as police officers,medical examiners,and other clerical state employees as with certain police investigative work it is neither appropriate nor justifiable that,for the same act,absolute immunity should protect the one and not the other s.buckley,at.the handling of requests to conduct scientific tests on evidence made after related to grounds claimed in an ongoing adversarial be best described as part of the prosecutor administrative duties that do not relate to an advocate preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings and are not entitled to absolute immunity.id.because the adas have not yet shown how the handling of dna evidence related to ongoing adversarial proceedings in which they were personally involved,we conclude that the prosecutors may have been function ing as administrator s rather than as officer s of the court and,thus,may be entitled only to qualified immunity.id.
concocting a false and fabricated confession 
the amended complaint next alleges that the adas violated yarris constitutional rights when they concoct ed a false and fabricated confession.there is no elaboration in the amended complaint regarding the circumstances under which the adas fabricated a confession by yarris.in fact,the only reference to a confession is found in paragraph of the amended complaint,which discusses a conversation yarris had on february,with a prison guard who subsequently gave a statement and later testified that yarris said that he had raped craig,but that another man named mark had actually murdered her,a statement known to be absolutely false in light of dna evidence conclusively showing that yarris was not the rapist.
accepting yarris allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,we must conclude that absolute immunity from this claim is not appropriate at the dismiss stage.as already noted,the key question is whether the adas were functioning as the state advocates when they engaged in the conduct that gave rise to the allegations.see buckley,at.in buckley,the supreme court denied absolute immunity to prosecutors who had allegedly fabricated evidence that was used to obtain a criminal conviction after it determined that the prosecutors conduct occurred well before they could properly claim to be acting as advocates.id.at.see also kulwicki,at stating that prosecutor who fabricated confession would be absolutely immune if he did so while prosecuting the case.in contrast,the allegations here do not indicate whether the fabrication of yarris confession occurred during the preliminary investigation of an unsolved crime,as in buckley,or after the adas had decided to indict yarris and had begun working as the state advocates in the prosecution of yarris.accordingly,at this stage of the proceedings,the adas can not establish that they are entitled to absolute immunity for allegedly fabricating yarris confession.
obtaining a false statement from a jailhouse informant 
the amended complaint also alleges that the adas violated yarris constitutional rights when they obtain ed a false statement from a jailhouse informant.according to the amended complaint,after yarris was charged with murder,rape,kidnaping,and robbery,he was returned to his prison cell,which was located next to a cell occupied by charles catalino,who had been convicted of burglarizing ada ryan home and was awaiting sentencing.yarris alleges that the following ensued 
charles catalino subsequently falsely reported,and,perjuring himself,testified at trial,that yarris expressed concern that his blood would be discovered at the scene of the murder and that he had committed the rape and murder,a statement now known to be absolutely false in light of dna evidence conclusively showing that yarris was not the rapist or murderer.
yarris believes and therefore avers that catalino received a reduced sentence on the burglary charge to run concurrent with an existing sentence,was allowed conjugal visits with his spouse,and was released later in.
yarris thus claims that the adas used a stick and carrot treatment to elicit catalino false testimony.
based on these allegations,the adas are entitled to absolute immunity from yarris claim that they obtained a false statement from a jailhouse informant.as a general matter,we note that a prosecutor is absolutely immune from liability for using false testimony in connection with a prosecution.kulwicki,at see also imbler,at.with respect to the solicitation of false statements alleged here,the adas are entitled to absolute immunity to the extent that their conduct occurred while they were acting as advocates rather than investigators.as the amended complaint makes clear,yarris had already been charged with the craig crimes before catalino made any statements about what yarris told him while they were held in adjacent prison cells.thus,although the amended complaint does not describe in detail when or how the adas obtain ed a false statement from a jailhouse informant,the allegations relating to catalino false statements indicate that the adas involvement with catalino statements occurred after yarris prosecution for those crimes had begun.see rose bartle,cir granting absolute immunity where complaint alleged that prosecutors solicited perjured testimony for use in grand jury proceedings brawer horowitz,cir granting absolute immunity where complaint alleged that federal prosecutor and witness conspired to use perjured testimony to secure plaintiffs convictions.accordingly,the adas are entitled to absolute immunity from this claim.
qualified immunity from yarris con
