by opinion dated october,we vacated the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs claims under the alien tort claims act and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,domestic and foreign corporations hereinafter the corporations,have moved this court to stay issuance of the mandate in this action,pending their petition for certiorari to the supreme court by order dated november,we denied the motion by majority vote of the panel.we write to explain the basis for our decision judge korman,dissenting from the denial,writes separately.to grant a stay at this juncture would deprive the district court of the opportunity to address the principal issue upon which the corporations seek supreme court review whether various prudential doctrines,including deference to the political branches,counsel dismissal of these claims.we expressly did not decide this issue on the present record and remanded to the district court for a determination in the first instance.

the critical weakness in the corporations motion is its premise that this issue has been sufficiently developed as to be fit for review by the supreme court.contrary to the corporations suggestion,the district court explicitly refrained from addressing the defendants arguments that the atca claim presented a political question.khulumani barclay bank,cir per curiam see also in re african apartheid,d,defendants also argue that there is no case or controversy for this court to hear under article iii of the constitution because the matter is a political question given the court finding that defendants are entitled to relief on other grounds,the court need not address these remaining grounds for defendants motion.accordingly,we did not address the applicability of deference or other prudential doctrines because such questions require the type of careful analysis to which district courts are better suited in the first instance.see kadic karadzic,cir.we also note that it has been several years since this issue has been briefed,and the parties should be able to develop the record to take into account intervening developments.for these same reasons,we consider the corporations application for supreme court review to be premature.and in the absence of an adverse ruling on the issue of deference or other prudential doctrines,the corporations claim that they have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable injury without a stay is unpersuasive.
we expect that the district court on remand will rule expeditiously at that point,the parties can decide whether,and on what grounds,to pursue further appeals.should the parties pursue further appeals,we and,if necessary,the supreme court will have the benefit of a fully developed foundation upon which to proceed.for the foregoing reasons,the motion is denied.
i assume familiarity with the background of this case in which the defendants have moved to stay the mandate for ninety days so that they may file a petition for a writ of certiorari.while the plaintiffs have declined to consent to the motion,they have made no showing of prejudice that would result from staying the mandate.nevertheless,the majority has voted to deny the application.i write to explain my reasons for dissenting from that denial.
under fed.app.d a,a motion to stay the mandate pending a petition for a writ of certiorari must show that the certiorari petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.this case involves substantial issues regarding the application of the atca of the kind that arise with increasing frequency.indeed,this was the reason the supreme court gave for granting certiorari in sosa,d.more significantly,this case implicates considerations of foreign policy threatened by the panel decision that weigh in favor of a stay.see wald regan,cir breyer,indeed,in banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d,the supreme court explained that it had granted certiorari because the issues involved bear importantly on the conduct of the country foreign relations and more particularly on the proper role of the judicial branch id.at.
this accurately describes the threshold issue in this case as to which the real party in interest is the republic of south africa.specifically,invoking the doctrine of international comity,it asked the district court to dismiss the case,and it asked us to apply the same doctrine to affirm the dismissal by the district court judge.the executive branch joined in that application because of the foreign policy implications that the rejection of south africa plea would have on our relations with that country as well as those of v arious foreign governments,including the united kingdom and canada,which have also approached us via diplomatic channels to express their profound concern that their banks,corporations and other entities have been named as defendants,and their strong belief that the issues raised in the litigation are most appropriately handled through south africa domestic process.id.
under these circumstances,the defendants are acting as surrogates for the republic of south africa in petitioning for certiorari and seeking a stay of the mandate.indeed,after the majority reversed the judgment dismissing the complaint,the republic of south africa,speaking through its minister of justice,issued a statement reiterating its view that the case is directly related to the sovereignty of the south african state and should be resolved through south africa own democratic process.ministry of justice and constitutional development republic of south africa,media statement apartheid court of appeal decision.
thus,the issue that the supreme court will be asked to consider is the plea of the republic of south africa that the judicial branch of the united states not meddle in its affairs by entertaining complaints in which the united states does not have any interest a position supported by a number of scholars,including some of the most committed human rights advocates.see,beth stephens,sosa,the door is still ajar for human rights litigation in courts,brook.because the issues involved bear importantly on the conduct of the country foreign relations and more particularly on the role of the judicial branch,sabbatino,at,the certiorari petition would present a substantial federal question.fed.app.d a.
more than that,this is a case in which the supreme court has already indicated a special interest.in what can only be described as an extraordinary discussion of this case,the supreme court provided guidance with respect to how south africa plea should be considered in its sosa opinion.thus,after formulating the doctrine of deference out of concern that many attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation of new norms of international law would raise risks of adverse foreign policy consequences,sosa,at,the supreme court turned to the present case 
for example,there are now pending in federal district court several class actions seeking damages from various corporations alleged to have participated in,or abetted,the regime of apartheid that formerly controlled south africa.see in re south african apartheid litigation,d jpml granting a motion to transfer the cases to the southern district of new york.the government of south africa has said that these cases interfere with the policy embodied by its truth and reconciliation commission,which deliberately avoided a victors justice approach to the crimes of apartheid and chose instead one based on confession and absolution,informed by the principles of reconciliation,reconstruction,reparation and goodwill.declaration of penuell mpapa maduna,minister of justice and constitutional development,republic of south africa,reprinted in app.to brief for government of commonwealth of australia et as amici curiae,emphasis deleted.the united states has agreed.see letter of william taft iv,legal adviser,of state,to shannen coffin,deputy,reprinted in,at.in such cases,there is a strong argument that federal courts should give serious weight to the executive branch view of the case impact on foreign policy.
id.at.emphasis added citation omitted.the majority here brushed off this advice,saying that it views summary dismissal at the behest of a footnote premature.khulumani barclay bank,cir.nevertheless,the discussion of this case in sosa provides additional support for the argument that certiorari may be granted.moreover,the absence of any compelling reason for rejecting the plea of the republic of south africa,suggests that if certiorari is granted,the judgment may be reversed.indeed,a tally of the cases,in which the supreme court published slip opinions,per curiams,and original case decrees in the term,indicated that over,precisely,were either reversed or vacated.
this case not only presents a substantial question,but there is also good cause to stay the mandate.see fed.app.d a.the continued prosecution of this matter constitutes a continuing insult to the republic of south africa and a continuing irritant to our relationship with that government.more significantly,as previously noted,on this issue,the republic of south africa is the aggrieved party and the real party in interest.the remand will only cause it more harm by enmeshing it in the litigation.indeed,one footnote in the per curiam opinion specifically refers to the failure of the district court judge to decide the plaintiffs motion to strike the statement of judgment filed on behalf of the republic of south africa by its minister of justice,khulumani barclay bank,at.this otherwise pointless observation suggests that the republic of south africa could be forced into an evidentiary hearing to defend the validity of its objection.indeed,in its opinion denying the motion to stay the mandate,the majority observes that the district court has not 
had the opportunity to address the competing views on this issue.compare brief for the united states of america as amicus curiae,brief for south africa as amicus curiae,and media statement of minister for justice and constitutional development brigitte mabandla,with brief for south african organizations,unions and political parties and brief for the former commissioners and committee members of south africa truth and reconciliation commission as amici curiae including the views of archbishop desmond tutu.
majority op.ante at.the latter amicus brief argues that,contrary to the position of the south african government,the current litigation does not conflict in any manner with the policies of the south african government,or the goals of the south african people,as embodied in the trc.trc br.at but it is only for the south african government,through its elected representatives,to say whether this litigation conflicts with its policies,just as it earlier decided for the same reasons to reject the truth and reconciliation commission recommendation that a wealth tax be imposed on all corporations.surely this is not a dispute for a united states district judge to resolve.see bi union carbide chems.plastics,cir newman.yet,the majority contemplates a remand that would subject a foreign democratic nation to the indignity of having to defend policy judgments that have been entrusted to it by a free people against an attack by private citizens and organizations who have lost the political battle at home.this dispute is not the business of the judicial branch of the united states.a stay is warranted to allow the supreme court to determine whether to permit such a proceeding to go forward.
the majority justifies the denial of the stay of the mandate on the grounds that one of the issues the defendants identified in their issue of not been sufficiently developed to be fit for review by the supreme court.majority op.ante at.this defect is said to result from the fact that the district court explicitly refrained from addressing this issue and the majority consequent failure to address the applicability of deference id.
passing over the accuracy of the majority description of the district court opinion,the defect asserted by the majority is not an impediment sufficient to deny a stay of the mandate for a number of reasons.the traditional rule,as the supreme court has observed,precludes a grant of certiorari only when the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below.united states williams,d scalia,internal quotation marks omitted.this rule operates as it is phrased in the disjunctive id.thus it permits review where an issue was passed upon below,even though not argued,and where the issue was argued and not passed upon.indeed,the supreme court is authorized to grant certiorari before judgment by the court of appeals.see,mistretta united states,d.while such discretionary review is unusual,the supreme court has considered issues not resolved by the court of appeals that raise only an issue of law not calling for examination and appraisal of evidence joseph seagram sons.indeed,it has exercised its discretion to consider an issue that had not been raised below and that it raised sua sponte.see sibbach wilson.whether the supreme court will deny certiorari and allow this case to go forward,simply because two of the three members of the panel declined to reach the issue,will ultimately depend on its assessment of the importance of the issue and the consequences of permitting the kind of proceeding the majority envisions to go forward.see youakim miller,d.
in sum,the unjustified refusal of the majority to address the issue of deference is not a basis to deny the motion to stay the mandate.on the contrary,this case raises an additional issue,namely,whether it was proper for a majority of the panel to decline to reach the issue.in my separate opinion,i addressed the significant considerations of policy that warrant reaching the issue of jurisdiction,even if it had not been decided by the district court.more significantly,i demonstrated that the majority was compelled to reach the issue because it involved the jurisdiction of the district court.this argument turned on the language of the atca,the manner in which it had been construed in sosa,and our own precedent,beginning with filartiga,cir.see khulumani barclay bank,at.the per curiam opinion offered no response to this argument,and its refusal to reach the issue at the threshold is itself worthy of certiorari.
i have passed over the issue of whether the per curiam opinion accurately described the manner in which the district judge addressed the issue of jurisdiction.the majority repeats the assertion made in the per curiam opinion that the district court explicitly refrained from addressing the defendants arguments that the atca claim presented a question,ante at quoting khulumani barclay bank,at per curiam.this assertion,which implies that the district court judge was referring to the issue of jurisdiction,is predicated on footnote of the district court opinion.see in re south africa apartheid,d at parenthetical omitted.the footnote reads as follows 
defendants also argue that there is no case or controversy for this court to hear under article iii of the constitution because the matter is a political question.see memorandum of law in support of defendants joint motion to dismiss at.given the court finding that defendants are entitled to relief on other grounds,the court need not address these remaining grounds for defendants motion.
