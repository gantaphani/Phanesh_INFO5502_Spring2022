in january,james truesdell truesdell became a participant in the federal section rental assistance program section program or section,established under et,which is administered locally by the philadelphia housing authority,its executive director carl greene,and others in their employ,including barbara baylor and deborah featherson.the section program provides rent subsidies for low and participants so that they can afford to lease privately owned housing units.under the program,participants make rental payments,tenant rent based on their income and ability to pay.the pha then makes housing assistance payments to private landlords in an amount calculated to make up the difference between the participant contribution and a contract rent agreed upon by the landlord and the pha.if a participant income declines,the participant may request that pha and lower the tenant rent and,consequently,increase pha housing assistance payments.this will lower the participant overall rent obligation.
in november,pha set truesdell tenant rent at per month,effective february,however,on january,truesdell income decreased to zero,and,consequently,his tenant rent should have been reduced.the parties disputed exactly when truesdell notified the pha that he was receiving no income.
in august,truesdell received notice from his landlord that it was closing the single room occupancy sro building in which he lived.truesdell requested that pha lower his tenant rent retroactive to february,to reflect his loss of income on that date and that pha issue him a section voucher so that he could move to another residence with continued section assistance.
on october,pha notified truesdell that it would lower his rent to zero retroactively beginning on september,but that it would not do so for the period between february and august.pha explained that truesdell had not reported his loss of income until september.pha also notified truesdell that because he was deficient in his tenant rent for the period beginning february,he was in violation of his lease and therefore could not qualify for a section voucher.due to this deficiency in tenant rent for the same period,truesdell landlord began eviction proceedings on october.
on december,truesdell commenced this action raising two claims that pha had unlawfully failed to and lower his tenant rent and correspondingly,to increase the housing assistance payment to his landlord effective february,and that pha had refused to give him a section voucher.truesdell sought declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages.
on january,the district court held a preliminary injunction hearing,during which the parties reached a settlement.the district court january order included the terms of the settlement pha was required to provide rental assistance to truesdell for placement in a single room occupancy dwelling to recommend truesdell application for admission to another pha project with a unit that included food preparation and sanitary facilities to place truesdell on the waiting list for receipt of rental assistance,if and when the waiting list is reopened and to make appropriate retroactive adjustments in the housing assistance payment for the period from february,through september.during the hearing,truesdell expressly reserved the right to file an attorney fee petition later.
shortly thereafter,pha referred truesdell to oak lane court apartments.by,oak lane had approved truesdell application and had applied to pha for its approval of truesdell move into unit number.while waiting for approximately three months for pha to approve the oak lane unit,truesdell moved out of his previous sro and lived in his father house.
on june,truesdell moved for enforcement of the january order and for sanctions.four days after receiving truesdell motion,pha gave its final approval for his move into oak lane unit.because unit included private sanitary and kitchen facilities,this approval fulfilled pha obligations under both paragraphs and of the january order.on august,pha provided truesdell with evidence that it had july,former landlord in compliance with paragraph of the order.thereafter,the district court dismissed the motion to compel as moot.
on august,truesdell filed two motions for attorney fees under,and these motions were denied by the district court.truesdell subsequent motion under rule e to alter or amend the order denying attorney fees and costs was similarly denied.truesdell then filed this appeal.
we exercise plenary review over legal issues relating to the appropriate standard under which to evaluate an application for attorney fees,including the question whether truesdell was a prevailing party.see county of morris nationalist movement,cir.
under the american rule,parties are ordinarily responsible for their own attorney fees.see alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.thus,there is a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.key tronic united states,d.congress has,however,authorized the award of attorney fees to a prevailing party in the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,stat,b,the statute upon which truesdell relies in this case.section b states in pertinent part in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section of this title,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.as we have recently noted,a lthough b expressly refers to a district court discretion,it is well settled that a prevailing plaintiff should recover an award of attorney fees absent special circumstances.nationalist movement,at citing newman piggie park,d.
