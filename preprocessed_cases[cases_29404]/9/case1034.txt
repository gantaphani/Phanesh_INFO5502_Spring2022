plaintiff margaret sipser leibowitz appeals from so much of a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge,as dismissed her complaint against her employers,cornell university cornell or the university and the new york state school of industrial and labor relations the ilr school,as well as the defendants,asserting claims of gender and age discrimination based upon the of her employment contract,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,as amended title vii,the age discrimination in employment act,et,as amended the adea,as well as state and municipal laws,and state claims for breach of contract,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and quantum meruit.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the discrimination claims on the grounds that a plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case because she presented insufficient evidence to show that she suffered an adverse employment action when defendants refused to renew her contract,and there was insufficient evidence to give rise to an inference of discrimination,and b even if plaintiff established a prima facie case,defendants proffered a reason for refusing to renew plaintiff employment contract,and plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the articulated reason was a pretext for discrimination.the district court also dismissed plaintiff breach of contract claims on the ground that she failed to raise any issues of fact regarding whether she had an implicit guarantee of job security on par with tenured faculty members,as well as her claims of breach of contract,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment in connection with work she performed after she officially ended her employment with cornell.on appeal,leibowitz contends that summary judgment was improper because there were genuine issues of fact to be tried.
for the reasons that follow,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment on appellant title vii,adea,new york state human rights law nyshrl and new york city human rights law nychrl claims and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.the district court grant of summary judgment on appellant claims of breach of contract,breach of contract,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment is affirmed.
background 
the following facts were taken from the record before the district court,construed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,the party.see,hotel employees rest.employees union,local city of dep t of parks recreation,cir.
plaintiff employment at the ilr school 
the ilr school is a contract college at cornell,a partnership between the university and new york state,which offers a undergraduate program in industrial and labor relations and receives state funding through the state university of new york suny system.it has both a resident division,which teaches undergraduate and graduate courses at cornell ithaca campus,and an extension division,which offers courses designed for working practitioners at regional offices in buffalo,albany,new york city,rochester,and long island.in,after receiving her undergraduate degree from the ilr school and her law degree from new york university,plaintiff began her employment with the ilr school as an extension associate in the extension division.in,after successfully completing the extension division peer review process,she was promoted to the position of senior extension associate ii.plaintiff employment was a term appointment,in accordance with cornell and ilr school written policy,which stated that senior extension associates may be appointed to terms of up to five years and may be reappointed on the basis of recommendations by the department and the appropriate extension director and dean s.when plaintiff employment contract was due to expire in october,defendants assert that associate dean ronald seeber planned not to renew her appointment because of her strained relationship with the supervisor of the new york city office,esta bigler,but ultimately changed his mind because,first,plaintiff secured a project that permitted her to work away from the new york city office in the spring of and,second,the resident division needed teachers for particular courses in areas of plaintiff expertise.accordingly,plaintiff was reappointed for the term from february,to october.she then began teaching a full class schedule for the resident division,while also teaching and developing extension programs and serving as a thesis advisor for undergraduate students.between and,plaintiff won various teaching accolades.
b.the renewal process 
cornell and ilr school policy stated that senior extension associates were appointed to terms,renewable on the basis of department recommendations.moreover,each of plaintiff appointment letters in,and explicitly indicated that the appointment was for a finite term and was contingent upon funding.plaintiff acknowledges that the position of senior extension associate ii was not a tenured one.in fact,plaintiff sent an in to a friend in which she stated,i just a lowly,untenured extension person.however,plaintiff asserts that she held a position equivalent to that of a tenured professor and cites several pieces of evidence to support that assertion.
first,it is undisputed that,prior to the of plaintiff contract,defendants had never terminated,laid off,or failed to renew the contract of one holding the position of senior extension associate ii without cause.
second,plaintiff points to the ilr faculty personnel policies,which describe the process for reappointment and promotion of faculty members,and plaintiff sets forth evidence that the enumerated process was not followed with respect to senior extension associates.defendants note that the policy refers only to assistant professors,professors and does not reference senior extension associates and has no application to them.
finally,plaintiff points to the belief by two senior extension associates that they had a position that was essentially equivalent to tenure,as well as statements by three other cornell employees in which they stated they had heard or believed that senior extension associates had something similar to but not tenure,or that the review process was pro forma.
as noted above,plaintiff was reappointed as a senior extension associate for the term from february,to october.
plaintiff travel expenses 
while plaintiff was teaching at the ithaca campus,she was based in the new york city metropolitan area,and cornell reimbursed her travel costs.in,cornell tax compliance office required the ilr school to categorize plaintiff travel expenses as taxable income.accordingly,to maintain plaintiff salary at its level,the ilr school had to pay plaintiff a gross amount exceeding that of her travel expenses in order to cover the added cost of personal income taxes incurred.in march,dean edward lawler informed plaintiff that the ilr school would pay her towards her travel expenses.in december,plaintiff informed dean lawler that this amount was insufficient to cover her expenses and apologized for the delay in bringing it to his attention,noting that the events of september,had made it difficult for her to estimate her actual costs of travel for the fall semester.dean lawler initially denied her request,prompting plaintiff to write to him that she was truly sorry for the misunderstanding about the travel money but could not afford to cover her travel costs and wished to speak with him about her ability to meet her spring semester commitments.dean lawler then increased the amount of her travel allowance to.in january,plaintiff thanked him for the generous offer,but noted that the funds were still insufficient.dean lawler then increased the travel compensation to,but felt frustrated by plaintiff repeated requests,interpreting them as forceful,demanding,and pushy.
in june,plaintiff again contacted the ilr school regarding travel reimbursement.defendants submit that this overture reminded dean lawler that her contract was set to expire in october,which led him to evaluate whether it was worth retaining her.however,a june,from associate dean robert smith to dean lawler and associate dean ann martin indicates the decision not to renew her contract had already been made in detailing the june meeting he had with plaintiff to discuss her travel expenses,associate dean smith wrote other than my mention of budget problems,i did not offer any inklings of what is yet to come good luck on that one will be a tough meeting,but will be a good investment.regardless of the timing of the decision,defendants contend that dean lawler ultimately concluded that the special arrangement with plaintiff had become too expensive in light of budgetary issues.specifically,during the period,the suny system had reduced the percentage of its budget appropriated to the ilr school and,as a result,january expense projections for the extension division for the academic year exceeded the expected amount of state funds.drafted by associate dean martin and associate dean smith in late and early,respectively,indicate that the budget concerns in the extension division were pressing.
plaintiff contract is not renewed 
dean lawler met with plaintiff on june,to inform her of his decision not to renew her contract and memorialized that meeting in a july,letter to her,stating 
i am writing to affirm what i discussed with you on june,letting you know in advance that we are not in a position to renew your current employment contract,which expires on october.as you know,your job responsibilities have shifted from new york city to ithaca.for the last several years,we have used your talents on a basis to teach courses in our resident program in ithaca,and there have been no duties for you to perform in the position in new york city for which you were hired.we appreciate your teaching skills,but with budgetary exigencies this with the expectations of more budgetary pressures in the can not afford to continue your current terms of employment with the school.
the letter further stated that plaintiff would be formally assigned to ithaca for the academic year and her employment would extend to may,after which time the school was not making any representation about future employment,nor encouraging plaintiff to move from new york to ithaca with the expectation of future employment.
on november,associate dean martin sent an to the entire extension division,stating that peggy leibowitz was laid off.martin later testified that terminated would be a better term to describe the of plaintiff contract.on december,plaintiff submitted a letter stating her intention to retire,effective december,to preserve her benefits.plaintiff was years old at the time that her employment with the ilr school came to an end.
positions in the long island and new york city offices 
dean lawler testified that,prior to his decision not to renew plaintiff contract,he did not investigate whether a position was available within the extension division that plaintiff could assume,nor did he ask anyone else to do so.however,following the decision regarding the of plaintiff contract in june,the long island office expressed interest in having plaintiff work as a senior extension associate.in particular,in july,thomas germano,the director of the long island office,told associate dean martin that he was eager to hire plaintiff to work as a senior extension associate in his office because she had good client contacts and could generate revenue for the ilr school.germano interest was communicated to dean lawler,but,according to dean martin,allowing plaintiff to work out of the long island office was certainly not considered.
in october,the ilr school informed employees in its long island district office that,effective june,that office would be closed and its employees reassigned to the new york city district office.when arthur matthews,a younger male senior extension associate in the long island office,learned of the planned reassignment,he informed defendants that he would resign as of january.on december,plaintiff wrote to dean lawler,requesting that he permit her to rescind her retirement and that she be assigned to a position in the extension office in long island.dean lawler denied her request,citing fiscal circumstances.
on december,germano,the director of the long island office,wrote to plaintiff,purporting to confirm his offer to her of the position vacated by matthews effective january.upon learning of the offer,dean lawler informed plaintiff that the offer was not valid,and he terminated germano for making it.plaintiff was not considered for any position at the long island office.
nor was plaintiff considered for any vacancies in the new york city office.defendants claim that they did not consider plaintiff for these vacancies because plaintiff had burned some bridges in the new york city office,which included bad blood with supervisor esta bigler from an incident in.plaintiff,however,introduced evidence including from and that suggests that plaintiff and bigler had no lasting conflicts.plaintiff also introduced evidence that defendants in planned to assign arthur matthews to the new york city office,despite his having had past conflicts with bigler.
f.other employment decisions 
in the midst of the budgetary concerns that arose in late,the extension division laid off six employees all of whom were females over the age of fifty between december and january,and hired twelve employees whose average age was.other than plaintiff,the five females who were fired were administrative assistants.plaintiff base salary not including her travel expenses exceeded that of the highest paid new hire.two of the new employees,hired for the respective positions of extension support specialist and senior extension associate,were females.by the conclusion of the academic year,the ilr school was in solid financial shape with both resident and extension budgets in the black,which was due in part to cuts made in that academic year and those planned for the academic year.
plaintiff continued work as an academic advisor 
after plaintiff employment ended on december,the ilr school instructed the two students she had been advising to locate an alternate academic advisor.after the students protested,associate dean martin determined,after consulting with dean lawler,that plaintiff could continue to chair the students honor theses if all the parties consented to that arrangement.plaintiff thus continued to serve as an academic advisor to the two students.in may,she submitted an invoice to dean lawler for services performed,totaling,at a rate of approximately per day.by letter dated may,dean lawler denied plaintiff request for payment,stating that the ilr school did not offer financial compensation to an instructor for the activities that plaintiff had performed and that he would have informed her of the same before she undertook those activities had she asked at the time.specifically,dean lawler explained o ur policy in ilr is to permit teachers who leave the university to continue their services on theses,if they wish and the student agrees.we do not offer any financial compensation to an instructor for time spent on such activity,although we have generally paid travel expenses for an instructor to attend a student defense.the ilr school did reimburse plaintiff travel expenses pursuant to dean lawler representation.
reassignment of plaintiff duties 
after plaintiff employment concluded,plaintiff was not specifically replaced by any one individual at the ilr school.the ilr school tasked lee adler,a male senior extension associate,with teaching some of the resident classes that plaintiff had formerly taught.however,unlike plaintiff,adler was paid for each resident class taught in addition to his extension salary.ronald applegate,another male faculty member,began a appointment in august and was offered the option of performing work in the extension division that plaintiff had been performing prior to the conclusion of her employment.finally,defendants used another male,lance compa,to perform some of the duties plaintiff had previously performed.
i.the present action 
on december,plaintiff filed a complaint in the southern district of new york seeking damages and remedies under,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,title vii,the adea,the nyshrl,the nychrl,and new york state common law.on march,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the entirety of plaintiff complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.by order dated february,the district court granted defendants motion.first,the district court found that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under mcdonnell douglas green,d,as she had not demonstrated an adverse employment action or causation.specifically,because cornell official policy did not provide job security on par with tenured professors to contracted associates,the district court concluded that the of plaintiff contract could not constitute an adverse act for purposes of the relevant statutes.the district court also held that her breach of contract claim failed for the same reason.finally,the district court held that plaintiff contract and quantum meruit claims were insufficient as a matter of law,as she failed to plead essential elements of both causes of action.see leibowitz cornell,wl,leibowitz i.
plaintiff appealed to this court,which reversed in part the decision of the district court,reinstating plaintiff discrimination and breach of contract claims and ordering that she be granted leave to replead her contract and quantum meruit claims.see leibowitz cornell,cir leibowitz ii.with respect to plaintiff discrimination claims,this court determined that the district court erred by applying the prima facie case requirement at the pleading stage,as t he prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.id.at quoting swierkiewicz sorema,d omission in original.thus,this court concluded that plaintiff claim that the of her contract breached an unofficial promise of job security on par with tenure was a sufficient allegation of an adverse employment action to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,and that this allegation was also sufficient to plead a cause of action for breach of contract.finally,the district court was instructed to grant plaintiff leave to amend her claims of contract and quantum meruit.
this matter returned to the district court and discovery was conducted,after which defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted the motion in its entirety.see leibowitz cornell,wl,leibowitz iii.the district court determined that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she was unable to produce any evidence that she had or held any right to a tenured position,that any senior extension associate ii had tenure,or that senior extension associates who were male or younger than plaintiff were unofficially given tenure,id.at,and,therefore,plaintiff could not prove the existence of an adverse employment action in the defendants decision not to renew her contract,nor could plaintiff show circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.see id.at.the district court also concluded that plaintiff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that defendants purported reasons for failing to renew her contract were pretextual.see id.at.the district court further concluded that,because plaintiff could not establish an unofficial policy granting her tenure,her breach of contract claim failed.id.at.finally,the district court found that plaintiff contractual claim,related to services she rendered after her employment ended,failed because she could not demonstrate that defendants consented to pay her for those services,and that her claim of quantum meruit also failed because she could not establish a reasonable expectation of compensation.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue of fact exists for summary judgment purposes where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide that fact in the favor.see guilbert gardner,cir.in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,a court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.dallas aerospace,cis air,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
plaintiff now asserts four arguments on appeal.first,she argues that the district court erred in concluding that she had not established a prima facie case of gender and age discrimination.second,she contends that she raised genuine issues of disputed fact as to whether defendants proffered reason for opting not to renew her contract was pretextual.third,she asserts that the district court overlooked triable issues of fact regarding whether defendants guaranteed her job security on par with tenured faculty members as related to both her discrimination and contractual claims.finally,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment.we consider each argument in turn.
plaintiff discrimination claims 
the same evidentiary framework is used to evaluate claims of discrimination based upon gender or age see byrnie town of cromwell,bd.of,cir.to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the adea or gender discrimination under title vii,a plaintiff must demonstrate the following she was within the protected class she was qualified for the position she was subject to an adverse employment action and the adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination see terry ashcroft,cir citing roge nyp holdings,cir adea,and collins city transit,cir title vii.
once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of age or gender discrimination,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse act.patterson county of oneida,cir quoting consol.coin caterers,d title vii see,cir adea.if the defendant carries that burden,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate by competent evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.patterson,at quoting texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.however,t he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.id.quoting burdine,at.
adverse employment action 
plaintiff first challenges the district court determination that the of her contract did not constitute an adverse employment action as a matter of law.an adverse employment action,for purposes of both the adea and title vii,is more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities and can include termination of employment,a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices unique to a particular situation.galabya city bd.of,cir quoting crady liberty bank trust of,cir omission in original.
the district court,in its rule b dismissal of plaintiff discrimination claims,determined that despite plaintiff allegation that pursuant to the policies of cornell university and the ilr school,a senior extension associate ii,such as herself,is a tenure faculty member,the official policies actually stated that the position she held was a term appointment,and d efendants did not terminate plaintiff employment,but r ather,they chose not to renew her appointment for another term and,thus,there was no adverse action as a matter of law.leibowitz i,wl,at.we reversed that determination and held that plaintiff allegations were sufficient to withstand a rule b motion to dismiss in that she alleged an unofficial policy of lifetime employment that was denied her based upon her gender and age.leibowitz ii,at.
after discovery was conducted,the district court reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no adverse employment action as a matter of law because plaintiff is unable to make the requisite showing that cornell had an unofficial policy of granting tenure to its contract senior extension associate ii employees or did so for any male or younger senior associate ii employees.leibowitz iii,wl,at.thus,the district court held that p laintiff did not have a guarantee of lifetime employment,and therefore suffered no material adverse change in the terms of her employment when she was advised that she would not be rehired in the future when her contract expired.id.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that in the circumstances here a of an employment contract itself is an adverse employment action and the district court erred in requiring plaintiff to show the existence of an unofficial tenured position to satisfy the adverse action requirement.
defendants argue that,pursuant to our earlier decision in this matter,plaintiff could only sustain her burden of demonstrating adverse action by offering documentation supporting her allegation that she held a tenured position,because of her contract alone would not suffice.such is not the case.as a threshold matter,although our earlier opinion suggested that plaintiff was alleging more than and that the denial of a position equivalent to tenure would constitute an adverse action,we did not foreclose the possibility that the of an employment contract alone could constitute an adverse action.indeed,we are persuaded that,where renewal is sought,it does.
it is beyond cavil that employers subject to the strictures of the adea and title vii may not discriminate on the basis of age or gender in deciding whether or not to hire prospective employees.see a it is unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual because of such individual age passenger morgan,d refusal to hire constitutes an adverse act under title vii kern city of rochester,cir title vii is an employment law,available only to employees or prospective employees seeking redress for the unlawful employment practices of their employers.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.were we to accept defendants argument here,we would effectively rule that current employees seeking a renewal of an employment contract are not entitled to the same statutory protections under the discrimination laws as prospective employees.in other words,under defendants reasoning,an employee could bring a discrimination lawsuit if an employer refused to hire her based on her age gender,but not if the same employer failed to renew an employment contract for the same discriminatory reasons.we decline to adopt that flawed legal analysis,which is inconsistent with prior decisions of the supreme court and this court.for example,in tarshis riese organization,cir,abrogated on other grounds by swierkiewicz,d,we held that t he discharge of an employee,followed by her rehiring in a lower position,is an adverse employment action.we further explained that w e see no reason why an employer should be allowed to accomplish an adverse reassignment or demotion with invidious intent through layoff and rehiring when that same action would be impermissible if done in the course of employment.id.similarly,in the landmark case of mcdonnell douglas green,although not specifically addressed by the supreme court,the adverse action at issue under title vii,which the court allowed to proceed,involved a refusal to rehire the plaintiff,who had been laid off several months earlier in the course of the employer general reduction in workforce at.there is simply no reason that the discrimination laws should not apply with equal force to an employer decision regarding a current employee who is denied a renewal of an employment contract.an employee seeking a renewal of an employment contract,just like a new applicant or a rehire after a layoff,suffers an adverse employment action when an employment opportunity is denied and is protected from discrimination in connection with such decisions under title vii and the adea.the mere fact that the employer decision not to renew is completely discretionary does not mean that it is not an adverse employment decision.
accordingly,we hold that where an employee seeks renewal of an employment contract,of an employment contract constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of title vii and the adea.although the parties focus on the terminology used with respect to the plaintiff,whether plaintiff was laid off or terminated,or her employment was not renewed is not critical to the legal analysis rather,she suffered an adverse employment action because she was denied the requested continued employment,regardless of the label.
we note that,in reaching this decision,we join other circuit courts that have,either implicitly or explicitly,held that of a contract may constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of the discrimination laws.see,wilkerson new media tech.charter sch,cir the failure to renew an employment arrangement,whether or for a limited period of time,is an employment action,and an employer violates title vii if it takes an adverse employment action for a reason prohibited by title vii carter of toledo,cir reversing district court grant of summary judgment in employer favor on plaintiff race discrimination claim under title vii in connection with employer failure to renew her contract as a visiting professor minshall mcgraw hill broad,cir sufficient evidence existed for jury to reasonably conclude that employer unlawfully discriminated against employee based on age under the adea in deciding not to renew his contract sch.dist.of whitefish bay,cir noting,where teacher claimed of contract was discriminatory under title vii,that i t is undisputed that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action kassaye bryant,cir noting that act of refusing to renew appellant employment at bryant college may provide grounds for discrimination claim 
in sum,the district court erred in concluding that the of plaintiff employment contract was not an adverse employment action.
inference of discrimination 
plaintiff next argues that the district court erred in its determination that the circumstances surrounding the of her contract did not give rise to an inference of age or gender discrimination.viewing the facts presented in the light most favorable to plaintiff and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom,we agree.
it is that an inference of discriminatory intent may be derived from a variety of circumstances,including,but not limited to the employer continuing,after discharging the plaintiff,to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiff qualifications to fill that position or the employer criticism of the plaintiff performance in ethnically degrading terms or its invidious comments about others in the employee protected group or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group or the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff discharge.chambers trm copy ctrs,cir internal citations omitted see also carlton mystic,cir partial transfer of plaintiff duties to younger employee on termination and transfer of remaining duties to younger employee hired after termination would permit inference of discrimination cronin aetna life ins,cir inference of discrimination would be permissible where employer,during company reorganization,found new positions for younger,but not older,employees maresco evans chemetics,div.of grace,cir decision to terminate two of three older employees and none of the twenty younger employees would permit inference of discrimination.
here,plaintiff has presented evidence of the following during the relevant time period,in addition to plaintiff,defendants laid off five other employees,all of whom were females over the age of fifty defendants reassigned teaching duties once performed by plaintiff to at least three male instructors and defendants did not consider plaintiff for vacant positions that arose in,prior to plaintiff departure,in the long island and new york city offices,and attempted to fill one such position in the new york city office with a younger,male employee.
the district court determined that no inference of discrimination could be drawn from these actions because none of the male employees cited specifically replaced her,and because none were granted unofficial tenure.however,plaintiff is not required to establish that she was replaced by a single male younger employee in order to carry her burden.see montana first fed.sav.loan ass of rochester,cir i n a case or a structural reorganization case,a discharged employee who seeks under mcdonnell douglas to establish a prima facie case,need not show that he was replaced by a younger,newly hired employee it is sufficient that the discharge occur in circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination.instead,our prior cases have made clear that a variety of circumstances can give rise to an inference of discrimination,including those outlined above.where,as here,the six layoffs,including plaintiff,were women at least years of age,plaintiff duties were primarily to male instructors,and plaintiff was not considered for any vacant positions,plaintiff satisfies the minimal prima facie requirement of demonstrating that the occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.see,carlton,at finding sufficient evidence of age discrimination for prima facie case where old plaintiff was terminated and his duties to substantially younger employees montana,at evidence of age discrimination sufficient for purposes of prima facie case where old plaintiff was terminated and majority of responsibilities were transferred to old employees viola philips med.of,cir inference of age discrimination permissible for purposes of prima facie case where plaintiff was replaced by a new,younger employee within one year of his termination.
accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that plaintiff did not meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case of age and gender discrimination.
the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion on the alternative ground that defendants had proffered a legitimate,reason for the,and plaintiff had failed to provide evidence sufficient for a rational jury to find that the reason was pretextual.however,we conclude that,based upon the evidence discussed above in connection with the prima facie case,combined with the additional evidence of pretext summarized below,plaintiff has created material issues of disputed fact on this issue sufficient to survive summary judgment.
once the plaintiff properly establishes a prima facie case of age and gender discrimination,the court must evaluate whether defendants sufficiently met their burden under mcdonnell douglas of articulat ing some legitimate,non discriminatory reason for their actions.at.defendants have argued that they opted not to renew plaintiff contract because of budgetary concerns they submit that anticipated budget cuts and the expense of maintaining her travel allowance motivated them to terminate plaintiff position at the ilr school in support of this argument,defendants presented evidence of the following budget projections for the ilr school anticipated a decrease in state funding for the academic year during which plaintiff contract expired ilr school officials were aware of these potential financial difficulties and duly concerned about them and the uniquely expensive arrangement plaintiff had with the ilr school regarding payment of her travel expenses influenced the ilr school decision not to renew her contract.defendants proffered justification for ending plaintiff employment is a legitimate one and,therefore,the burden shifts back to plaintiff to demonstrate that this reason is mere pretext for unlawful discriminatory intent.see,at.in such situations,plaintiff carries the ultimate burden of persuasion and must produce evidence such that a rational finder of fact could conclude that the adverse action taken against her was more likely than not a product of discriminatory animus.see schnabel abramson,cir where the defendants have articulated legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for having fired plaintiff,the burden shifts back to plaintiff to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendants discriminated against him internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see also gross.at claimant bringing suit under adea must demonstrate that age was cause of adverse action norton sam club,cir the thick accretion of cases interpreting this framework should not obscure the simple principle that lies at the core of cases.in these,as in most other cases,the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion.to carry this burden,the plaintiff may rely on the evidence presented to establish her prima facie case,without more.see holtz rockefeller,cir cronin,at.
it is axiomatic that even during a legitimate reorganization or workforce reduction,an employer may not dismiss employees for unlawful discriminatory reasons.maresco,at internal quotations omitted.plaintiff presented evidence before the district court from which it could be inferred that the budgetary concerns cited by defendants were a pretext for discrimination.first,plaintiff presented evidence that the budgetary concerns in early diminished over the school year and by july the ilr school extension division was in solid financial shape with a budget in the black.further,the ilr school extension division had the funding necessary to hire twelve new employees during the relevant time period.although the extension division also laid off six employees during that time,plaintiff notes that all six were females over the age of fifty.second,plaintiff submitted evidence that,although her requests for additional travel funds were cited as a factor in the decision not to renew her contract,it was a common practice amongst male extension division faculty members to negotiate for compensation as she did,and that none of these employees contracts were terminated or not renewed.plaintiff submits that,if her requests were so onerous that granting them made her continued employment unsustainable,defendants were free to simply deny them.third,plaintiff pointed to evidence that she was not considered for any vacant positions before or after her,despite the availability of such positions.in particular,there is undisputed evidence that the director of the long island office wanted to hire plaintiff to work as a senior extension associate,offered her the position,and was fired for doing so.although dean lawler stated that he withdrew the offer on the basis that it was unauthorized and the fiscal circumstances did not permit it,there are disputed issues of fact as to the actual employment needs of the long island office at that time.similarly,a year old male was hired to fill a vacant senior extension associate position in the new york city office in july.in addition,matthews was going to be transferred to the new york city office in june,but chose to resign,and plaintiff was not considered for that new york city office position.although defendants cite to evidence that plaintiff had conflicts with personnel in the new york city office,there are material issues of disputed fact regarding whether such conflict continued to exist in and,if it did,whether that conflict was a genuine reason given that similar past conflicts did not deter defendants from planning to place a male employee in that office.
based on this evidence,we find that plaintiff has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding discriminatory pretext adequate to defeat summary judgment.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,a rational finder of fact could conclude that the budgetary exigencies cited by defendants were not so dire as to warrant her,since the extension department both balanced its budget and had the funds necessary to bring in twelve new hires around the time that plaintiff contract was not renewed.the fact that the six individuals laid off were females over the age of fifty could lend support to plaintiff argument that her age and gender were the real reasons behind the of her contract,especially in light of the evidence that she was not considered for other vacancies that arose in.see,demoret zegarelli,cir reasonable jury could conclude that cited reason for adverse action taken against female administrative assistant budget concerns was pretextual in light of evidence that male department heads received raises during the relevant time period stratton dep t for the aging for city of,cir reasonable jury could find pretext for age discrimination where,despite stated budgetary crisis,employer recalled and rehired certain employees,refused to consider claimant for new positions for which she was qualified and increased the number of employees who earned as much as claimant by twelve,all of whom were younger than claimant gallo prudential residential,cir reasonable jury could find was a pretext for age discrimination where,among other things,there was evidence that employer failed to consider plaintiff for other vacant positions prior to discharge,in violation of company policy montana,at question of fact regarding pretext for age discrimination existed in case where plaintiff was discharged while the number of employees actually increased,she was not offered opportunity to transfer to new position,her duties were reassigned to a younger employee,and her employer failed to consider her for new position.
on the basis of this record,we therefore decline to uphold the district court ruling that no rational finder of fact could decide that defendants proffered reasons for opting not to renew plaintiff contract were pretextual ones intended to mask unlawful discriminatory intent.see back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir u nless the defendants proffered nondiscriminatory reason is dispositive and forecloses any issue of material fact,summary judgment is inappropriate.quoting carlton,at.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment in defendants favor as to all of plaintiff discrimination claims under title vii,the adea and state law,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

plaintiff next argues that the district court erred by dismissing her breach of contract and breach of implied contract claims,premised on the allegation that the ilr school had an unofficial policy granting senior extension associates job security on par with that of tenured faculty that it violated by failing to renew her contract.she also contends that the district court improperly dismissed her claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment arising from work she performed as an academic advisor after her term of employment ended.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing all contractual and claims,as plaintiff failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact on critical elements of those aforementioned causes of action.
claims regarding alleged unofficial tenured position 
in reversing the district court initial dismissal of plaintiff breach of contract claims,we determined that plaintiff properly pled a breach of contract claim by alleging that an unofficial cornell policy granting lifetime employment to senior extension associates created a contractual relationship between the parties that cornell breached in failing to renew her contract.as a threshold matter,it is unclear whether plaintiff appeals the district court dismissal of both her breach of contract claim and her contract claim arising from this alleged unofficial policy,or simply the latter cause of action however,as plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence substantiating the existence of an express contract,be it oral or written,guaranteeing her lifetime job security,the court affirms the dismissal of her breach of contract claim.thus,we turn to plaintiff contract claim.
under new york law,a contract implied in fact may result as an inference from the facts and circumstances of the case,although not formally stated in words,and is derived from the presumed intention of the parties as indicated by their conduct.jemzura jemzura,internal citations omitted see,parsa state,an contract rests upon the conduct of the parties and not their verbal or written words.a contract implied in fact is as binding as one that is express,and similarly requires such elements as consideration,mutual assent,legal capacity and legal subject matter.maas cornell.however,i t is an elementary principle of contract law that,where there exists an express contract for compensation,an action outside that contract will not lie.stissi interstate ocean transp.of,cir see,long island,a quasi contract only applies in the absence of an express agreement.as defendants have correctly noted,plaintiff employment was governed by a series of appointment letters stating the definite term of her appointment.although plaintiff argues that the letters do not constitute express contracts because they do not bear her signature and are contingent upon funding,we disagree.to form a valid contract under new york law,there must be an offer,acceptance,consideration,mutual assent and intent to be bound,verio,cir internal quotations omitted.plaintiff seems to suggest that the absence of her signature on the letter indicates that she did not assent to be bound by the terms contained therein.however,t he manifestation or expression of assent necessary to form a contract may be by word,act,or conduct which evinces the intention of the parties to contract.maffea ippolito,emphasis added citing jur d,contracts.a party conduct indicates assent when he intends to engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents.restatement second of contracts.it is undisputed that plaintiff performed teaching services pursuant to the terms of the letter appointments,indicating her assent to be bound by them.her signature is not required to demonstrate assent.likewise,the budgetary contingency provision does not render the agreement invalid.therefore,plaintiff action for related to allegations of unofficial tenure must fail,in the face of valid agreements governing the same subject matter.
although we noted in our prior decision that this claim survived a motion to dismiss because plaintiff had alleged that documentation supported the existence of this unofficial lifetime appointment,or the equivalent of being a tenured professor,plaintiff has found no such documentation after full discovery to support such an allegation and contradict the express terms of the appointment letters and cornell policy.it is undisputed that plaintiff has not put forth any written policy that conferred tenure or the equivalent of tenure for senior extension associates in fact,the policy states precisely the contrary.
instead,plaintiff attempts to create an issue of material fact by pointing to the defendants purported failure to follow the process in the ilr faculty personnel policies for reappointment and promotion of faculty members.however,we find this evidence and argument unavailing.as an initial matter,the policy refers only to assistant professors,professors and does not reference senior extension associates and,thus,does not explicitly apply to them.in any event,the mere fact that reappointment procedures were not always followed or that reappointments were often pro forma does not support a reasonable inference that cornell was abandoning its policy and agreements that explicitly referenced a term and,instead,bestowing lifetime guarantees of employment on its,term employees.moreover,the hearsay statements or rumors on this issue recounted in discovery by certain cornell employees are insufficient to undermine the explicit terms of plaintiff appointment letters and cornell policy.the lack of sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact on this point is perhaps best illustrated by plaintiff own statements and conduct.specifically,in an to a friend in,plaintiff referred to herself as just a lowly,untenured extension person.moreover,she asked unsuccessfully to be placed on the tenure track in and again in.
in sum,we find that the district court correctly determined that the terms of her reappointment letter and cornell policy both exp
