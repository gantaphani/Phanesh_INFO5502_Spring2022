this appeal addresses whether plaintiff suit can survive defendants motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds with respect to his claims for false arrest,malicious prosecution and abuse of process,and with respect to his claim based on these causes of action.we hold that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions to the district court to enter judgment in favor of defendants.
background 
joseph savino,a former investigator in the new york city office of the chief medical examiner,filed this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on december,against the city of new york city and several members of the new york department of investigation doi and the new york police department the relevant background is set forth in the district court october,opinion and order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion for summary judgment.savino city of new york,d.we assume familiarity with that opinion and restate here only such information as is necessary to resolve this appeal.
in late and throughout,savino had been widely described in the new york news media as the highest paid city employee based on his overtime earnings,and was dubbed by some in the media as the king of overtime.on february,savino left the scene of a crime with a gold ring belonging to the dead victim savino claimed that the removal of the ring was accidental,but on june,following an investigation by the doi,he was arrested and charged with various crimes relating to the alleged theft in september,a new york state grand jury indicted savino on these charges.a petit jury acquitted savino on all counts on january.
in his complaint,savino alleges that he was prosecuted for the theft of the ring as retaliation for the embarrassing media attention stemming from his allegedly exorbitant overtime pay.he asserts claims against defendants for various torts,including false arrest,malicious prosecution,and abuse of process,violations of based on these causes of action,and violations of article i,sections and of the new york state constitution.
on february,defendants moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds,and on october,the district court miriam goldman cedarbaum,judge granted in part and denied in part defendants motion for summary judgment.savino,d at.
specifically,the district court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants on savino claims of defamation,negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violation of the new york constitution.id.at.it also granted summary judgment to the defendants gargan,dowd,brooks,bartholomew and baner with respect to the false arrest claims because the defendants did not affirmatively instigate or procure savino arrest,id.at quoting king crossland savings bank,cir.
the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to savino claims for malicious prosecution,false arrest against the doi defendants and the city,and abuse of process,as well as his claims based on these torts.
with respect to the malicious prosecution and false arrest claims,the district court concluded that the existence of probable cause constitutes a complete defense to both of these claims,as well as to savino claims based upon them.id.at.it also determined that i ndictment before a grand jury creates a presumption of probable cause that is applicable to each of these claims.id.citing weyant okst,cir,and colon city of new york.
although savino was indicted by a grand jury,the district court concluded that there remained an issue of fact as to whether savino could rebut the presumption of probable cause arising from his indictment.the district court noted that this presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the indictment was procured by fraud,perjury,the suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith.id.quoting colon,at,at.the court concluded that,based on the current record,defendants might have acted in bad faith.first,the court noted that 
d efendant brooks testified at plaintiff criminal trial that she could see both plaintiff and the decedent pocketbook while plaintiff was allegedly alone in the hotel room,and that plaintiff did not remove the ring from the pocketbook at that time.this exculpatory evidence,however,was not presented to the grand jury.in the absence of that evidence,the testimony of gargan and dowd that plaintiff was alone in the room,and had the opportunity to steal the ring at that time,was misleading.
with respect to the defendants,the court then reasoned it is unclear from the record whether the police defendants disclosed brooks information to the prosecuting attorney or the doi.if they did not,the failure to do so would be sufficient evidence of bad faith to rebut the presumption created by the indictment with respect to them.id.it concluded that,i n the absence of the presumption,there are genuine issues of fact with respect to both probable cause and qualified immunity of the defendants.id.accordingly,the court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on savino malicious prosecution claim 
the district court relied on this same line of reasoning to deny summary judgment to the doi defendants and the city on both the malicious prosecution and false arrest claims.the court concluded that t he record is unclear as to whether doi investigators sturcken,perez and wilson knew about brooks evidence.id.at.nevertheless,it reasoned 
sturcken and perez were actively involved in the investigation,and where law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation the knowledge of one is presumed shared by all.illinois andreas,d.they,in turn,informed wilson of their findings.since on a motion for summary judgment all inferences must be drawn in favor of the party,i must assume that wilson was also aware of what brooks witnessed.since all three allowed her testimony to be excluded from the grand jury,they are not entitled to a presumption of probable cause created by the indictment.as discussed above,without the presumption,there are genuine issues of fact with respect to probable cause and qualified immunity that the jury must resolve at trial.
id.at internal citation omitted.
the district court also denied defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the claim.the court noted that i n new york,a malicious claim lies against a defendant who employs regularly issued legal process to compel performance or forbearance of some act,with intent to do harm without excuse o r justification,and in order to obtain a collateral objective that is outside the legitimate ends of the process.id.at quoting cook sheldon,cir.it concluded that a reasonable jury could infer from the timing of defendants actions that the overtime issue was the motivating factor in the prosecution.id.it also noted that although abuse of process does not require that probable cause be lacking a lack of probable cause creates an inference of malice,supporting the collateral objective element of this claim.id.citing mcmullen michigan home furnishing,misc.for this reason,the district court denied summary judgment to all of the defendants with respect to the claim.
finally,the court reserved decision with respect to the issue of municipal liability until such time as it had a basis for determining whether defendant wilson,the commissioner of the doi at that time,had final authority such that his actions could subject the city to liability under.id.at see pembaur city of cincinnati,d municipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.
following the district court october,ruling,defendants filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to rule of the local rules of the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of new york.on january,the district court granted the motion for reconsideration with respect to the issue of whether sergeant brooks testimony at trial had the significance attributed to it by the district court in its october,opinion.see savino city of new york,wl,at january.the court stated 
on,brooks testified that in the five minute period that savino was alone in the room with the body,she could see the area where the handbag,purse and wallet were,and that she did see him go in the bag.def.ex.gg at.on redirect examination,brooks testified that she was not watching savino for every second of those five minutes.id.at.the redirect examination did not elicit testimony on whether brooks took her eyes off the handbag,purse and wallet during that five minute period.
id.at.on this basis,the court held that brooks testimony does not,therefore,alter its previous conclusion that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to probable cause.id.
the court then summarily denied the remainder of the arguments raised by defendants in their motion for reconsideration.finally,it determined that s ince neither party has argued that wilson does not have authority with respect to investigations of wrongdoing by city employees such that his actions may subject the city to liability under,a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether the city of new york can be held liable for his actions.id.at.
the defendants timely filed this appeal of both the october,and the january,district court orders in the absence of a final judgment,plaintiffs have not those parts of the district court order ruling in favor of defendants.see,davidson chestnut,cir holding that,in the course of reviewing an interlocutory ruling on qualified immunity,we may not review unrelated rulings that are not themselves subject to interlocutory review.
ii.discussion 
it is well established that w e review de novo a district court denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.kinzer jackson,cir.
federal rule of civil procedure c requires a court to grant a motion for summary judgment whenever it determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.see celotex catrett,d.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.at.we have had many occasions to recite the basic rule enumerated by the supreme court that,in order to avoid summary judgment,the nonmoving party must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.summary judgment is appropriate,therefore,if the evidence presented by the nonmoving party is merely colorable,or is not significantly probative,anderson,at.citation omitted,or if it is based purely on conjecture or surmise,bryant maffucci,cir.
as with the standard for summary judgment,the standard governing the qualified immunity defense is.we have only recently recalled that,u nder the doctrine of qualified immunity,a government official performing discretionary functions is shielded from liability for civil damages if his conduct did not violate plaintiff clearly established rights or if it would have been objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his conduct did not violate plaintiff rights.mandell county of suffolk,cir.accordingly,defendants are entitled to summary judgment unless,in response to defendants motion for summary judgment,savino has submitted evidence sufficient to establish that objectively reasonable persons in the defendants position would have known that their conduct violated savino rights.
because qualified immunity is an immunity from merely an immunity from of qualified immunity should be addressed as early as possible in the judicial process.see,hunter bryant,d mitchell forsyth,d.accordingly,under the collateral order doctrine,a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell,at.in considering such appeals,we may exercise pendent jurisdiction over issues that are not ordinarily subject to interlocutory review whenever they are inextricably intertwined with the determination of qualified immunity or their resolution is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court ruling on qualified immunity.see swint chambers county comm n,d.
although we lack jurisdiction to resolve material issues of fact on an interlocutory appeal,johnson jones,d,we have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of a district court denial of qualified immunity whenever the defendant is willing to accept plaintiff version of the facts for purposes of the appeal,see behrens pelletier,d salim proulx,cir.even where the lower court rules that material disputes of fact preclude summary judgment on qualified immunity,we may still exercise interlocutory jurisdiction if the defendant contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity even under plaintiff version of the facts.tierney davidson,cir 
accordingly,for purposes of this appeal,we will analyze the facts in the light most favorable to savino,reviewing de novo the legal question of whether the disputed facts identified by the district court are,in fact,material.see,cartier lussier,cir.
malicious prosecution claim 
under new york law,t he elements of an action for malicious prosecution are the initiation of a proceeding,its termination favorably to plaintiff,lack of probable cause,and malice.colon city of new york.liability for the tort of malicious prosecution also gives rise to liability under.see,cook sheldon.
as the district court properly noted,the existence of probable cause is a complete defense to a claim of malicious prosecution in new york.see colon,at,at discussing malicious prosecution claims.the district court also correctly recognized that,under new york law,indictment by a grand jury creates a presumption of probable cause that may only be rebutted by evidence that the indictment was procured by fraud,perjury,the suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith.colon,at,at.
the district court held that,even though savino was indicted for stealing the ring,he adequately rebutted the presumption of probable cause arising from his indictment because a reasonable jury could find that defendants had acted in bad faith by withholding exculpatory evidence from the prosecuting attorney,assistant district attorney joseph sullivan ada sullivan,and if this evidence had been presented to the grand jury,savino would not have been indicted.savino,d at.in particular,the court concluded,based upon sergeant brooks testimony at savino criminal trial,that sergeant brooks had observed savino the entire time savino was alone in the room,and that she did not see him take the ring.id.at.the court then apparently assumed that all of the defendants knew that sergeant brooks had been observing savino throughout this period and that they had intentionally misled the grand jury by shielding this information from ada sullivan.id.at.in its january,opinion and order on reconsideration,however,the district court conceded that brooks testified that she was not watching savino for every second of those five minutes,but it upheld its earlier decision on the ground that sergeant brooks did not expressly deny watching the handbag,purse,and wallet throughout that time period.savino,wl,at.
we believe the district court analysis is flawed because it apparently ignored the rule that it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of proof in rebutting the presumption of probable cause that arises from the indictment.see,bernard united states,cir holding that,under new york law,the plaintiff must establish that the indictment was produced by fraud,perjury,the suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.in order to survive a motion for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claim,savino must have submitted evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that his indictment was procured as a result of police conduct undertaken in bad faith.the district court erroneously shifted this burden to defendants by permitting savino to rebut the presumption of probable cause with mere conjecture and surmise that his indictment was procured as a result of conduct undertaken by the defendants in bad faith.bryant maffucci,cir.
even if sergeant brooks had been watching the crime scene the entire time that savino was alone in the room,which is highly doubtful savino has adduced no evidence,circumstantial or otherwise,that prior to sergeant brooks testimony at trial,any other officers knew what she had or had not observed.the district court glossed over this problem with respect to the defendants,simply presuming that they knew sergeant brooks had been watching the handbag,purse,and wallet and then finding that i t is unclear from the record whether the police defendants disclosed brooks information to ada sullivan or the doi.savino,d at.with respect to the doi defendants,the district court determined that,although t he record is unclear as to whether sturcken,perez and wilson knew about brooks observations before they presented the results of their investigation to ada sullivan,such knowledge could be presumed based upon the collective knowledge doctrine.id.at.
the collective knowledge doctrine provides that,for the purpose of determining whether an arresting officer had probable cause to arrest,where law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation,the knowledge of one is presumed shared by all.illinois andreas,d.we have observed that this rule exists because,in light of the complexity of modern police work,the arresting officer can not always be aware of every aspect of an investigation sometimes his authority to arrest a suspect is based on facts known only to his superiors or associates.united states valez,cir.accordingly,the doctrine has traditionally been applied to assist officers in establishing probable to impute bad faith to one member of an enforcement team on the basis of another member knowledge.in fact,in valez,we clearly stated that this doctrine can not be used to impute to an officer facts known to some other members of the police force which exonerate an arrestee.id.in addition to our holding in valez,common sense dictates that the collective knowledge doctrine can not be applied in the circumstances presented here certainly,one can not establish that an officer engaged in conduct undertaken in bad faith,colon,at,at,simply by presenting evidence of another officer knowledge or state of mind.accordingly,the district court erred by invoking the collective knowledge doctrine in the circumstances presented here.
in any event,even if other officers were aware that sergeant brooks had observed savino continuously while he was alone in the room and that she did not see him take the ring,savino has presented no evidence that this information was intentionally withheld from ada sullivan.as an initial matter,ada sullivan personally interviewed sergeant brooks before savino indictment.aff.of joseph sullivan,at.if sergeant brooks actually had been looking into the hotel room the entire time savino was alone in that room,and if she had indeed revealed this information to the other officers,they logically could have assumed that sergeant brooks herself would reveal this information during her interview with ada sullivan.accordingly,their failure to take it upon themselves to present to ada sullivan the observations of another officer sergeant brooks would have been entirely reasonable,and certainly not evidence of bad faith 
finally,ada had the discretion and authority to decide what evidence to present to the grand under no duty to present every item of arguably exculpatory evidence in seeking an indictment.see,people mitchell,t he people maintain broad discretion in presenting their case to the grand jury and need not seek evidence favorable to the defendant or present all of their evidence tending to exculpate the accused.citation omitted.accordingly,even if we assume for the sake of argument that sergeant brooks was watching the bag the entire time savino was alone in the room and that ada sullivan was made aware of her observations,his decision not to present this information to the grand jury would not amount to conduct undertaken in bad faith.
in the absence of sufficient evidence that any other in bad faith,no reasonable juror could find that savino has overcome the presumption of probable cause that arises from his indictment.because the existence of probable cause to arrest is a complete defense to a claim of malicious prosecution,defendants were entitled to summary judgment on this claim and the related claim.defendants are also entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds with respect to these claims.see,mandell county of suffolk,cir stating that an officer is entitled to immunity from suit if his conduct did not violate plaintiff clearly established rights.
false arrest claim 
to state a claim for false arrest under new york law,a plaintiff must show that the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff,the plaintiff was conscious of the confinement,the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement,and the confinement was not otherwise privileged.bernard,at.as with malicious prosecution,liability for false arrest also gives rise to liability under.see cook sheldon.
the district court analyzed savino malicious prosecution and false arrest claims together because it believed that the presumption of probable cause arising from savino indictment was applicable to both claims.see savino,d at.but the new york court of appeals has expressly held that the presumption of probable cause arising from an indictment applies only in causes of action for malicious prosecution and is totally misplaced when applied in false arrest actions.broughton state.
nevertheless,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on savino false arrest claim and the related claim.as noted above,the district court has already granted summary judgment to the defendants gargan,dowd,brooks,bartholomew and baner with respect to the false arrest claims because they did not affirmatively instigate or procure savino arrest,id.at quoting king crossland savings bank,cir.we conclude that the doi defendants and the city are also entitled to summary judgment on the claim of false arrest because,even accepting savino version of the facts,the doi defendants did not act unreasonably in securing his arrest.see,mandell,at under the doctrine of qualified immunity,a government official performing discretionary functions is shielded from liability for civil damages if it would have been objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his conduct did not violate plaintiff rights.
the defendants do not dispute that savino was,in fact,arrested.accordingly,the only question for us to consider is whether savino arrest was privileged,or justified.see,bernard,at broughton,at.the new york court of appeals has made clear that j ustification may be established by showing that the arrest was based on probable cause,broughton,at,but that the defendants bear the burden of proving that probable cause existed for the plaintiff arrest,id.probable cause exists when an officer has knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been committed by the person to be arrested.martinez simonetti,cir.
at the time that savino was arrested,the doi defendants knew that the ring had disappeared from the hotel room and that it had turned up in savino home.although savino claimed that he found the ring in a bottle of pills that he took with him from the crime scene for analysis,the victim suicide note indicated that the ring was in her wallet,and officers gargan and dowd confirmed that they had observed the ring in the wallet when they arrived at the scene.furthermore,while savino denied that he was ever alone in the room with the victim and her property,five separate police officers had informed the doi defendants that savino had asked them to leave him alone in the room and that he was in fact left alone in the room for approximately five minutes.
savino argues that the doi defendants lacked probable cause for his arrest because they already had been informed of sergeant brooks observations and,therefore,they knew that he could not have taken the ring intentionally.but even if,as savino alleges,the doi officers were told that sergeant brooks had been observing the handbag and wallet while savino was alone in the room and that she did not see him take the ring,this knowledge would not have been sufficient to negate probable cause.at most,sergeant brooks alleged observations indicate that savino did not take the ring from the wallet while he was alone in the room they do not negate the possibility that savino removed the ring from the wallet while the other officers were in the room but were not watching him.at the time of savino arrest,the doi officers had evidence that a ring that had been in the victim wallet inexplicably ended up in savino home.this evidence alone created a sufficient basis for a reasonable officer to believe that savino had stolen the ring and,therefore,that probable cause existed for his arrest.see martinez,at.accordingly,the doi defendants and the city are entitled to qualified immunity on savino false arrest claim.
in new york,a malicious claim lies against a defendant who employs regularly issued legal process to compel performance or forbearance of some act with intent to do harm without excuse of justification,and in order to obtain a collateral objective that is outside the legitimate ends of the process.cook sheldon,cir.malicious abuse of criminal process also supports liability under.id.
savino claim rests on his allegation that,in instigating the criminal investigation that led to his indictment,defendants were retaliating against him for the embarrassment caused by the media reports of his allegedly exorbitant overtime pay.the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could infer from the timing of defendants actions that the overtime issue was the motivating factor in the prosecution.savino,d at.it then determined that although abuse of process does not require that probable cause be lacking a lack of probable cause creates an inference of malice,supporting the collateral objective element of this claim.id.citation omitted.because it believed that savino ha d raised genuine issues of fact with respect to probable cause,the district court denied summary judgment to all of the defendants with respect to the claim.id.
but,as we concluded above,the district court erred in holding that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to probable cause.accordingly,it also erred in relying on a lack of probable cause to infer that,in securing savino arrest,defendants acted with malice or with a collateral objective that was outside the legitimate ends of the legal process.
with respect to the defendants,savino has submitted no evidence whatsoever to indicate that they abused the legal process as the district court itself noted,these defendants were merely witnesses to savino alleged crime and did not affirmatively instigate or procure savino arrest.savino,d internal quotation marks omitted.because there is no evidence that any of the defendants engaged in conduct for the purpose of promoting or facilitating savino arrest and prosecution,the district court erred in denying the motion for summary judgment on the claim with respect to these defendants.
savino has also failed to state a claim for abuse of process against the doi defendants.the district court determined that a reasonable jury could infer from the timing of the doi defendants actions that the overtime issue was the motivating factor in the prosecution.id.emphasis added.but the new york court of appeals has made clear that a malicious motive alone does not give rise to a cause of action for abuse of process.curiano suozzi,see also hauser bartow,finding no abuse of process because whatever may have been respondent motives,she used the process of the court for the purpose for which the law created it.in order to state a claim for abuse of process,a plaintiff must establish that the defendants had an improper purpose in instigating the action.see dean kochendorfer,distinguishing between improper motive and improper purpose and concluding that improper purpose is necessary to make out an motive is not enough.accordingly,to state a claim for abuse of criminal process,it is not sufficient for a plaintiff to allege that the defendants were seeking to retaliate against him by pursuing his arrest and prosecution.instead,he must claim that they aimed to achieve a collateral purpose beyond or in addition to his criminal prosecution.
in his complaint,savino alleges that his investigation and arrest by the doi defendants was solely motivated to seek vindication for the city great political embarrassment and humiliation for allowing plaintiff to be the highest paid city employee through his overtime earning which was widely reported in the news media for several years and to punish plaintiff for his lawfully and properly earned overtime compensation.compl.at.although this passage does allege that the doi defendants acted with an improper motive,savino has not presented any evidence that they had an ulterior purpose or objective in facilitating his prosecution.accordingly,savino has failed to state a claim for abuse of process against the doi defendants and the city,and they are entitled to summary judgment on the abuse of process claim.and because defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the merits of the abuse of process claim,they are also entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds with respect to this claim.see,mandell,at.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we hold that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds with respect to savino claims for malicious prosecution,false arrest and abuse of process,as well as his claim based on these causes of action.accordingly,the district court erred by denying defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to these claims 
the order of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of defendants.
ernestine savino,joseph savino wife,was also a named plaintiff in this action,asserting claims for loss of services and society as a result of the harm defendants caused her husband.because savino claims are entirely derivative of her husband claims,however,we need not address them separately.
according to the district court,the events taking place on february,were as follows at approximately pm on february,police officers raymond dowd and michael gargan arrived at room of the marriott marquis hotel in manhattan,which was the scene of an apparent suicide.defendant sergeant sharon brooks arrived a short time later.according to gargan and dowd,they searched the decedent pocketbook and wallet and discovered some cash and a gold ring inset with five clear stones in a zippered pocket of the wallet.dowd testified that he returned the ring to the pocket of the wallet.gargan testified before the grand jury that he observed dowd return the ring to the wallet.however,gargan wrote in his contemporaneous notes that dowd had informed him that he returned the ring.no other officer observed the ring in the john baner and david bartholomew arrived at the scene at approximately pm.the officers had noticed three prescription pill bottles in room.the pill bottles were ordinary prescription bottles made of orange plastic with prescription labels covering most of the outside surface.bartholomew says that he looked at the pill bottles and did not recall seeing a ring inside.he did not,however,pick up the bottles or open them to examine their contents.the detectives also read a suicide note left by the decedent,in which she stated that she had placed a gold ring in her wallet that she wanted her sister to arrived at the death scene at approximately pm.sturcken and defendant josé perez,a doi investigator,say that savino told them that he had searched the decedent wallet for identification,but savino denies it.according to the police,the officers left savino alone in the room w
