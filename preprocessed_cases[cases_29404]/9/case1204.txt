this litigation was brought as a class action by inmates in new york city jails challenging the defendants asserted failure to provide them with educational services to which they are entitled under new york state and federal law.after several years of litigation,the district court constance baker motley,judge granted a declaratory judgment to the plaintiffs,concluding that the defendants had failed to provide such services,and ordered the defendants to create a plan for doing so.the court later adopted the defendants proposed plan and appointed a third party to monitor the plan execution for one year.
upon receiving the monitor final report,the district court entered an injunction ordering the defendants to comply with the terms of their educational plan and to provide additional required services to eligible inmates.the defendants appealed and we vacated the injunction,remanding for the district court to consider whether porter nussle,d,required the plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies.see handberry thompson,cir,order.the district court concluded that porter did not require exhaustion in this case,and reinstated the injunction.the new york city defendants the city defendants now appeal,arguing that the district court erred in its application of federal and state law.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
the district court thoroughly set forth the facts underlying this dispute.see handberry thompson,d handberry i,and handberry thompson,d handberry ii.we recite them here only insofar as we think it necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.
the instant lawsuit arises out of a complex of allegations that the new york city department of education doe and department of corrections doc have failed to provide inmates incarcerated at new york city vast rikers island prison facility with sufficient educational services and facilities to meet standards imposed by federal and state law.on august,the plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,in order to receive the educational services guaranteed them by law.compl.they assert that the doe and doc provided less than half of persons incarcerated by doc with state and federally mandated educational services,and that they did not provide general education services to all eligible inmates or special education services to inmates with disabilities.the plaintiffs further contend that the defendants thereby violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment the individuals with disabilities education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act of,the rehabilitation act the americans with disabilities act,the ada and new york state law and regulations.the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide all mandated educational services to all persons.compl.
on october,defendant richard mills,the commissioner of the new york state education department,moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground,inter alia,that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies.as discussed below,both the idea and the prison litigation reform act,a the plra,establish exhaustion prerequisites for bringing suits such as this one.the city defendants opposed the motion to dismiss.they asserted that,as of that time,there were no applicable administrative remedies for the plaintiffs to exhaust,although the city defendants purported to reserve the exhaustion argument pending discovery.on may,the district court denied defendant mills motion to dismiss.
on november,the district court directed the plaintiffs to file a motion for a declaratory judgment establishing that their rights to receive education services had been violated and for an order directing the defendants to file an educational plan for meeting their obligations to provide such services.the plaintiffs filed the motion in december.the city defendants for summary judgment,asserting that the plaintiffs claims should be dismissed for failure to exhaust all available administrative remedies.
on january,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for declaratory judgment and denied the defendants.in addition to entering a declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,the district court ordered the defendants to file an education plan to provide rikers island inmates with the educational services to which they were entitled by state and federal law.see handberry i,d at.as the court later made clear,it entered the declaratory judgment to remedy both plaintiffs claims of procedural due process violations and their claims under the idea,rehabilitation act,ada,and state law.see handberry ii,d at.
on may,the city defendants submitted their remedial education plan to the court.see educ.plan for the rikers island academies,handberry thompson,civ.may,education plan or plan.the plan stated that,in accordance with the district court order,it provided full and complete educational services and facilities to all eligible rikers island inmates,including both general and special educational services.id.at.in an order dated june,the court adopted the plan.handberry thompson,civ.june,order adopting plan.the court did so only reluctantly,noting that the plan would not meet all the needs of incarcerated youth inmates and that it was deficient in many respects.handberry ii,d at quoting order of june.the court also appointed sheri meisel to monitor the defendants efforts to implement the plan and directed meisel to submit a report containing her findings after one year.
in her final report submitted december,meisel concluded that the plan had not been a sufficient framework to guide and sustain compliance with general and special education requirements.final report of the court monitor in handberry thompson regarding the implementation of the education plan for the rikers island academies,at,handberry thompson,civ,the final report or report.the report continued a substantial number of individuals confined at rikers island consistently received no educational services or substandard services.id.meisel identif ied specific deficiencies concerning access to educational services including ineffective notification and recruitment procedures,conflicting school and jail schedules,and lack of correctional officers for escort and security.id.meisel also noted that s pecial education and related services are not provided to all eligible students,and the delivery of special education is compromised by inadequate systems for screening and for individualized education programs.id.
after receiving the plaintiffs and the defendants responses to the final report and conducting a hearing,the district court issued an order adopting amendments to the education plan based on the report.handberry thompson,d,order amending the city defendants education plan august,order.the court ordered,inter alia,that the defendants implement procedures to notify inmates of the education services available,take steps to provide general education services to all entitled inmates,provide escorts to enable inmates to attend class,comply with the terms of the idea in providing special education services,and provide cell study to students in segregated housing.in an opinion issued the same day,the court set forth the reasons for the order.it observed that in ordering the injunctive relief,it relied solely on those factual findings that were uncontested.handberry ii,d at.
the city defendants appealed.on november,we vacated the district court order and directed it to consider whether exhaustion of administrative remedies was required under porter nussle,supra,which the supreme court had decided subsequent to the district court decision.see handberry thompson,cir,order.the district court,after receiving submissions from the parties and conducting a hearing,concluded that no further exhaustion of administrative remedies was required.the court thereupon reinstated in full the injunction it had ordered on august,amending the city education plan.the city defendants now appeal 
discussion 
exhaustion requirements 
on appeal,the city defendants again argue that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies,and contend that the district court should therefore have dismissed the action instead of granting the declaratory judgment to the plaintiffs and ordering prospective relief.
exhaustion under the plra 
the plra provides in pertinent part that 
no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
a.in porter nussle,d,the supreme court held that the plra exhaustion requirement applies to all prisoners seeking redress for prison circumstances or occurrences,id.at,irrespective of whether those conditions are general to all prisoners or affect only one prisoner in particular,see id.at.previously,in booth churner,d,the supreme court noted that the plra required exhaustion if available administrative process had the ability to provide some relief for the action complained of emphasis added,even if grievance procedures could not provide the relief sought,id.at.if no administrative remedies are available,however,then the plra does not require exhaustion.id.at.without the possibility of some relief,the administrative officers would presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint,leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust.see also mojias johnson,cir the plra clearly does not require a prisoner to exhaust administrative remedies that do not address the subject matter of his complaint.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
although the plra establishes a mandatory exhaustion requirement,it does not create a jurisdictional predicate to our ability to hear the appeal.richardson goord,cir.therefore,t he failure to exhaust available administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that is waiveable.johnson testman,cir accord hemphill new york,cir.
in rejecting the defendants argument that exhaustion was required,the district court relied on two alternative grounds that administrative remedies were not available and that,in any event,the defendants had waived the affirmative defense of.with respect to the plra exhaustion requirements,we agree with the district court as to the second ground,and therefore need not and do not address the first.
as noted,in the city defendants opposed state defendant mills motion to dismiss the complaint based on the plaintiffs alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the city defendants argued that although the plra exhaustion requirement may,ultimately,be decisive,plaintiffs raise issues that,at this time,appear to be outside the jurisdiction of the department of correction.city defs.mem.of law in opp.to state def.mot.to dismiss at,handberry thompson,civ.the city defendants argued to the district court that it should dismiss the motion without prejudice pending discovery which,they contended,would reveal whether any alleged problems with the delivery of educational services to incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of correction are solely attributable to the department of correction,in which case the matter would be grievable.id.on may,the district court denied mills motion to dismiss.
some two years later,in november,the city defendants for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.in their arguments to the district court,they asserted that prison grievance procedures were available based on a department of corrections directive that was issued in.see city defs.summary judgment br.at,handberry thompson,cv.this document,written and issued by the doc,was available to the city defendants before any discovery took place.and the district court noted that the director of doc inmate grievance program concluded that the inmates could have filed an inmate grievance concerning access to school based upon his review of paragraphs of the complaint.handberry thompson,cv,wl,at dist.lexis,at.
by opposing mills motion on the grounds that there were no relevant available administrative proceedings,the city defendants waived or conceded the inapplicability of the defense with respect to prison grievance procedures that were apparent without discovery.the grounds upon which the city defendants asserted a defense in were based on information that was available to them prior to any discovery taking place.by asserting in that there were no available prison grievance procedures based on the same information,the city defendants either waived any such claim or conceded that it was not available to the plaintiffs.
this is not a purely technical matter.had the city defendants asserted in that administrative proceedings were available,the plaintiffs might have sought to exhaust any such proceedings before timely returning to federal court.the plaintiffs were entitled to rely,instead,on the city defendants assertion that,barring the emergence of new information during discovery,the plaintiffs had no administrative process available to exhaust.the city defendants were not entitled to concede at the beginning of the litigation that prison grievance procedures were not available only to assert the contrary three years later based on information available to them from the outset.
we therefore conclude that the city defendants waived or conceded on the exhaustion arguments that they make to us now 
exhaustion under the idea 
the city defendants also assert that the plaintiffs should have exhausted administrative remedies with respect to their federal claims pursuant to the idea,the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act.it is well settled that the idea requires an aggrieved party to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a civil action in federal or state court attica cent,cir,cert.denied,d.the idea administrative review process includes review by an impartial due process hearing officer and an appeal from that hearing.id.the idea exhaustion requirement also applies where plaintiffs seek relief under other federal statutes when relief is also available under the idea.see also.
we have not yet ruled on whether the idea exhaustion requirements are subject to waiver.in polera board of education,cir,the appellant admitted that she had failed to exhaust available idea administrative remedies.id.at.we noted our recogni tion that the idea exhaustion requirement does not apply in situations in which exhaustion would be futile because administrative procedures do not provide adequate remedies.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,we concluded that absent an applicable exception,a plaintiff failure to exhaust idea administrative remedies deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction,id.at.
we need not decide today whether the defendants waiver of the defense would constitute such an exception.idea exhaustion in the instant case is excused under the futility exception for challenges addressing systemic issues.see,at.
in,the plaintiffs brought a claim in which they alleged that they had been denied a free appropriate public education under the idea,the rehabilitation act,and new york law.id.at.we noted that t he complaint was styled as a class action,and the district court described it as containing complain ts of wrongdoing that are inherent in the program itself and not directed at any individual child.id.at second alteration added.t he plaintiffs problems could not have been remedied by administrative bodies because the framework and procedures for assessing and placing students in appropriate educational programs were at issue,or because the nature and volume of complaints were incapable of correction by the administrative hearing process.id.at.we therefore concluded that idea exhaustion was not required.id.unlike challenges with respect to the content of a particular student individualized education plan iep,addressed a total failure to prepare and implement ieps.id.at.
similarly here,the plaintiffs challenge the doe and doc actions with respect to providing educational services to all entitled inmates at rikers island.as we concluded in,individual administrative remedies would be insufficient to address the defendants failure to provide the service required by the idea to all relevant inmates.see id.at.the purposes of allow for the exercise of discretion and educational expertise by state and local agencies,id.quoting polera,at are unavailing where the alleged issue is the absence of any services whatsoever.id.at.as to the plaintiffs claim,then,exhaustion is futile,and administrative remedies are effectively unavailable we therefore conclude that the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by section f g,i for idea claims and ada and rehabilitation act claims for overlapping relief that would also be available under the idea as per section does not bar our subject matter jurisdiction over this suit.
ii.prospective relief 
prospective relief for claims 
section of the plra,a a,provides that p rospective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.the city defendants argue that the plra thus limits the district court power to order prospective relief for violations solely of state law.appellants br.at.we agree.
congress defined the term civil action with respect to prison conditions as any civil proceeding arising under federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison except for habeas corpus proceedings.g.the instant civil proceeding,having been brought in part and relief having been granted in part under the idea,the rehabilitation act,and the ada,arises under federal law,even if some of the claims prosecuted in the course of the proceedings are claims.this action also addresses the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison,g,because it challenges the adequacy of the defendants provision of educational services and related ancillary services to inmates.thus,under the language of section a,any prospective relief ordered in this case must extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right of these particular plaintiffs.emphasis added.
in a,congress provided federal district courts with supplemental jurisdiction to decide certain claims.it reads 
except as provided in other subsections of section or as expressly provided by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.
id.the plaintiffs argue that under these provisions,the district court had jurisdiction over any claims related to the federal claims being adjudicated and,therefore,that the court had the power to vindicate fully those rights.for us to read a a to prohibit prospective relief on such claims,they contend,would be for us to read it to impliedly repeal a in part.such implied repeals,they point out,are not favored by courts,which assume that congress generally does not intend to enact laws in conflict with its own earlier statutes without saying so.a bsent a clearly established congressional intention,repeals by implication are not favored.an implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict,or where the latter act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.lockhart united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,though,congress explicitly contemplated that other statutes would limit the supplemental jurisdiction granted in section,which provides that such jurisdiction may be limited as expressly provided by federal statute.by its terms,a a appears to be such a federal statute.
true,on occasion,when congress has limited section,it has referred explicitly to jurisdiction.see,e providing that section shall not be construed,by reason of a claim arising under such subsection,to confer on the courts of the united states jurisdiction over any state law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce,alimony,equitable distribution of marital property or child custody decree.it hardly follows,however,that congress must make specific reference to section in order to limit its reach.indeed,congress likely did not do so here because section a limits not jurisdiction,but rather the types of remedies available once jurisdiction has been properly invoked.
the only provisions of section that refer explicitly to state law claims further support this reading of the statute.section d reads,state law limitations on remedies in this section shall not apply to relief entered by a state court based solely upon claims arising under state law.this provision appears to clarify the scope of section a remedial limitations.since section a states that in any civil action emphasis added related to prison conditions prospective relief shall be narrowly drawn,section a would appear to operate to limit the remedial powers of both federal and state courts in such cases.this limitation includes two elements first,it limits the extent of such relief to that which is no further than necessary to correct the violation second,it narrows the permissible grounds for prospective relief by requiring that it be issued only to remedy violations of the federal right in the case.therefore,if a state court were hearing a civil action involving both state and federal claims,section a would not only require that any prospective relief for a federal claim extend no further than necessary to correct its violation,but would also seem to prevent that court from ordering any prospective relief at all for violations of the state law claims.but such a result would clearly infringe upon a state traditional power to grant its courts a full range of remedial powers.thus,subsection d was included to foreclose this result.
subsection d explicitly carves out an exception for state courts from the requirement that prospective relief go no further than necessary to correct the violation and remedy only the federal right in the case,so the blanket restriction on prospective relief must apply to all civil actions related to prison conditions in federal courts.but since,under this view,the restriction both limits the extent of the relief and requires that it remedy a federal right,we think section clearly prohibits a federal court from issuing preventive relief based entirely upon claims 
it follows from the foregoing analysis that the district court was not permitted to order prospective relief to remedy an asserted violation of state law only.we thus agree with the city defendants that the district court erred in ordering such relief,and we vacate those portions of the three through five,seven,nine through eighteen,through,and appear to be based solely on asserted violations of state law.
prospective relief for federal law claims 
with respect to remedies of federal law violations,the plra provides that t he court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.a see also benjamin fraser,cir t he plra requires the court to make particular findings when it identifies federal violations.
although the plra requirement that relief be narrowly drawn and necessary to correct the violation might at first glance seem to equate permissible remedies with legal minimums,a remedy may require more than the bare minimum federal law would permit and yet still be necessary and narrowly drawn to correct the violation.benjamin,at.a remedy may be deemed to be properly drawn if it provides a practicable means of effectuati on even if such relief is.id.concluding that comprehensive window repair program at prison was necessary to remedy due process violation and narrowly drawn g iven the impracticability of the court examining each window.
the district court acknowledged that it was required to make findings under the plra.see handberry ii,d at.it noted that m uch of the relief requested by plaintiffs falls beyond the scope of least intrusive and narrowly drawn.id.the court decided,however,that the city defendants,by their own admission or by failing to dispute the findings of the monitor,remain with applicable state and federal law after years of litigation and that the court was therefore compelled to order compliance.id.the court concluded that t he order filed herewith is crafted in a way that is narrowly drawn and extends no further than necessary to achieve compliance while keeping in mind public safety and the operation of the criminal justice system.id.the court further made specific findings regarding the defendants provision of educational services.the city defendants argue that the court nonetheless did not satisfy the plra requirements.
applicability of injunction to all doc inmates.the city defendants contend that paragraph six of the injunction,which purports to apply its terms to all doc facilities is overbroad because t he plaintiff class consists only of inmates who,inter alia,are incarcerated at doc facilities on rikers island.appellants br.at internal quotation marks omitted citing handberry ii,d at.
while the district court did describe the plaintiff class as consisting of inmates housed on rikers island,see handberry ii,d at,the plaintiff class is defined as all inmates under the age of in the custody of the new york city department of correction who have not yet received their high school diploma or its equivalent.handberry thompson,civ,stipulation and order for provisional class certification and notice to the class.we are aware that the defendants education plan and the special monitor final report address solely the provision of services at rikers island jails.we think it is clear that this is because,as evidence submitted by the city defendants seems to establish,doe only provides educational services at rikers island jails inmates at doc remaining four jails,the borough houses must transfer to a rikers island jail to receive such services.am.decl.of esteban colon,handberry,civ.thus,the district court did not err in ordering relief on the basis of the facts before it for the entire class.we therefore reject the city defendants contention that paragraph six is impermissibly broad.
idea screening provisions.the child find provisions of the idea establish that the state must have policies and procedures to ensure that a ll children with disabilities in need of special education and related services are identified,located,and evaluated and that a practical method must be developed and implemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services.a a.in its opinion,the district court declared that although the education plan listed five different mechanisms for identifying inmates eligible to receive special education related services,the city defendants have failed to consistently rely on these mechanisms.handberry ii,d at.paragraph nineteen of the injunction thus requires the defendants to comply with the requirements of a a,and a,and to implement screening procedures to locate,identify,and evaluate all eligible inmates with disabilities.august,order.
we do not see how this prospective relief,which tracks the statutory language of the idea child find requirement precisely,can be viewed as unnecessary,overbroad or.the city defendants nonetheless argue that the district court order was improper because the court found no inmates with a disability who should have been referred for evaluation,but were not.appellants br.at.but we fail to see how this contention relates to the question of whether the city defendants have failed to meet their affirmative obligation to screen eligible inmates for disabilities.indeed,the idea apparent purpose in requiring screening is to find eligible inmates who might otherwise not be an effective screening mechanism in place,it is impossible for the city defendants,or anyone else,to identify inmates who should be referred for evaluation.we therefore reject their argument with respect to paragraph nineteen of the injunction.
initial meeting with special education team.in paragraphs and of the injunction,the district court ordered that inmates identified as in need of special education services meet with a school based support team or pupil personnel team within five days.august,order.the court further ordered that t he purpose of this meeting shall be to determine if identification and assessment of that inmate as in need of special educational services is appropriate.if so,then an initial evaluation for special education shall be performed pursuant to the procedures set forth in and their implementing regulations.id.
the idea requires that the state ensure that c hildren with disabilities are evaluated in accordance with subsections a through c of section of this title.a.thus,the educational agency must conduct a full and individual initial evaluation before the initial provision of special education and related services and such initial evaluation shall consist of procedures to determine the educational needs of such child.a.the evaluation thus mandated by the idea constitutes a significant step toward developing the idea primary device for delivering special education services the iep.see a lillbask ex rel.mauclaire.dep t of,cir.the iep,developed by educators in conjunction with the child parents,sets forth a specific and particularized plan for each child development.it must contain,inter alia,a statement of the child goals and steps to be taken to transition the child to the least restrictive environment.see id.a,d.because of the timing constraints associated with the transient nature of the rikers island population,the defendants use a temporary education plan tep for students with disabilities that serve s as the student iep until release from rikers island and entrance into a school program where a new,more permanent iep is required.rikers island standard operating procedures july rikers island sop manual a tep appears to be similar in most respects to an iep,although it is developed based on a single diagnostic academic placement test rather than,as with the iep,using multiple assessment tools.see august,order b.
the city defendants challenge the terms of injunction paragraphs and,contending that federal law does not require that a team of education professionals meet with every inmate who needs or may need special education,within five days of the inmate special education identification or referral.appellants br.at.
we disagree.coming as it does after a finding that the city defendants had failed to fulfill their screening and evaluation requirements and had not lived up to the terms of the education plan,see handberry ii,d at,the injunction requirement that the city defendants comply with the terms of the idea meets the requirements of the plra it is not unnecessary,overbroad,or for the district court to require the city defendants to comply with the terms of the act based upon a finding that the city defendants are not presently doing so.and the district court requirement that students meet with a student based support team sbst or a pupil personnel team is based on the rikers island sop manual,which sets forth that the sbst major role is to develop educational plans for students with disabilities.that statement does not appear to us to be merely hortatory,aspirational or rhetorical.we therefore do not see how the court order that the defendants comply with the requirements of the idea by using procedures based on requirements of their own sop manual is,at least under the circumstances presented,either overbroad or.benjamin,at finding prospective relief to satisfy plra requirements appropriate where it was based on doc own policy directive.
the city defendants also contend that the deadline within which the city defendants are to provide students who have been identified as having disabilities with an initial meeting in order to assess whether a tep is necessary is overly burdensome.appellants br.at.the rikers island sop manual states that teps must be developed for all students with disabilities attending a rikers island school,rikers island sop manual at,and that every effort will be made to provide students with teps prior to their release,id.at.in their brief to us,the city defendants point out that the rikers island population is primarily transient and suggest that most students leave rikers island within ten to thirteen business days of their incarceration.appellants br.at.we do not think that,under these circumstances,the district court requirement is in this regard unnecessary,overbroad,or.
provision of teps.in paragraph of the injunction,the district court ordered the doe to develop teps for students who do not have current ieps within thirty school days of enrollment.in deciding to order this relief,the court concluded that the city defendants had failed to develop and implement teps and had thereby deprived students of the special education services to which they are legally entitled.handberry,d at.the city defendants do not contest this conclusion.they argue instead that the deadline for tep implementation is excessively burdensome,appellants br.at,because existing rikers island procedures establish a waiting period before the sbst team must meet with the student to begin developing a tep.as we have noted,however,those procedures also state that every effort will be made to ensure that students have a tep prior to their release from rikers island.rikers island sop manual at.and the city defendants report that most entitled inmates are incarcerated for less than calendar days,appellants br.at,and that the majority are released after ten business days,id.at.these facts suggest that,by the city defendants own procedures,students should be provided with a tep within less than thirty days.in light of the fact that the deadline for tep development is more generous than that which would logically follow from the city defendants own procedures,we do not think that the deadline for tep implementation fails the plra test.see benjamin,at.
the defendants also assert that the last two sentences of paragraph of the august,order contravene the idea by eviscer ating the parental informed consent requirements.appellants br.at.those sentences provide the tep shall be created by an team in accordance with d b and.if for any reason a required member of the team fails to participate either in person or telephonically,the reason s for his or her nonparticipation shall be documented in the tep itself.august,order.under d b,the iep team is defined to include a disabled child parents,and under,the doe shall ensure that the iep team includes the child parents.however,a meeting may be conducted without a parent in attendance if the public agency is unable to convince the parents that they should attend.in this case the public agency must have a record of its attempts to arrange a mutually agreed on time and place d.the august,order,in requiring that the city defendants comply with applicable law,and in mandating that the reasons for absence of a required member be noted in the tep itself,august,order,reinforces rather than eviscerate s the requirements of the idea.
the city defendants further contend that paragraph of the injunction,which requires that a tep shall,inter alia,include measurable annual and short term academic and objectives as determined to be necessary for each student to improve performance,august,order,is overbroad because all items,except annual goals and dates for initiation and duration of services,are already listed on a tep and annual goals are meaningless in a jail setting.appellants br.at.on this issue,we agree with the defendants.although the idea requires that the iep includes a statement of measurable annual goals,including academic and functional goals,d a i ii aa bb,it would be absurd to apply annual goals to students who only reside in the jail for a matter of weeks.yerdon henry,cir where an examination of the statute as a whole demonstrates that a party interpretation would lead to absurd or futile results plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole,that interpretation should be rejected.internal citation and quotation omitted king vincent,d t he cardinal rule is that a statute is to be read as a whole since the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.internal citation omitted.thus,this provision of the plra does not apply to the plaintiffs in this case,and the section of paragraph requiring adherence to annual goals is hereby vacated.
continuum of services.in their reply brief,the city defendants assert for the first time that paragraphs and of the district court injunction are overbroad.the city defendants contend that these provisions are not based on any violation of an inmate federal rights.appellants reply br.at.paragraph requires that a range of special educations services shall be available to meet the needs of disabled students,including but not limited to,general classroom instruction,with supplementary aids and services,skills support classes,resource rooms and classes for students with intensive needs.august,order.the district court concluded that the city defendants amorphous skills class either taught by a special education teacher or by a subject area teacher in consultation with a special education teacher is less than what the city defendants are required to provide under the terms of the original education plan and falls far short of the sort of individualized services required by the idea.handberry,d at.
under the idea,the city defendants must provide a free appropriate public education.a a see also id.d a stating that such free appropriate public education must emphasize special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs.in so doing,the city defendants must ensure that a continuum of alternative placements is available to meet the needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services,including instruction in regular classes and special classes,and the provision for supplementary services such as resource room.see also id.the city defendants do not dispute that they did not provide the required continuum of services to students with disabilities.we are unpersuaded by their argument that the district court erred in ordering them to do so.
similarly,paragraph requires that the doc furnish space to enable the doe to provide counseling services.the idea requires that the doe provide related services,including counseling.a.the district court found that the space provided for such counseling was inadequate.the city defendants responded that they would make space in the george vierno center available for counseling.the court incorporated this response into the order.we do not see how this portion of the order can be deemed unnecessary,overbroad,or.
responsibility for costs of special monitor.the city defendants argue that paragraph should be vacated to the extent that it requires city defendants and the state to pay for the special monitor on the ground that these expenses should be borne by the judiciary under.appellants br.at.section f establishes that,if the court appoints a special master,his or her compensation must be paid with funds appropriated to the judiciary.id.f.
this argument is foreclosed by our decision in benjamin fraser,supra.there we concluded that the office of compliance consultants occ,which had been appointed to monitor compliance with consent decrees concerning prison conditions,was not a special master within the meaning of the plra.benjamin,at.we reasoned that the occ did not have the ability to convene and to regulate hearings,to rule on the admissibility of evidence,to subpoena and swear witnesses,and to hold witnesses in contempt.id.at.we noted that t he master responsibilities typically culminate in a report.if the report includes findings of fact,they are binding in actions unless clearly erroneous.id.we decided that while the occ reports a
