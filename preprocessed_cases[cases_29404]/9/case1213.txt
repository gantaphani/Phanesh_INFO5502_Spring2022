hardy brownell,an inmate at shawangunk correctional facility shawangunk in wallkill,new york,filed suit under in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that defendant corrections officers denied his right of access to the courts by intentionally losing his legal documents and other personal items while transferring him between correctional facilities.brownell contends that the defendants failure to account properly for his lost legal documents has precluded him from filing a timely habeas corpus petition.consequently,brownell claims that he has been denied access to the courts in violation of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.in an order entered november,the district court mckenna,granted defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that brownell had not exhausted his claims as required by the prison litigation reform act plra,a.
because we find that special circumstances justified brownell failure to exhaust and that administrative remedies are no longer available to him,we reverse the order granting summary judgment and remand this case to the district court for proceedings on the merits of the complaint.
background 
brownell prison transfers and the loss of his property 
in june,brownell was incarcerated at woodbourne correctional facility woodbourne.on june,woodbourne corrections officers confronted brownell for unauthorized possession of a corrections officer photograph and social security number.prison officials then moved brownell and certain personal and legal items to the special housing unit shu while his cell was searched for additional contraband.on sergeant krom order,corrections officers mentnech and loucks searched brownell cell,uncovering three additional corrections officers identification cards with brownell picture on each of them.that same day,brownell was transferred to eastern correctional facility eastern.
in anticipation of transferring brownell to eastern,mentnech and loucks packed the contents of brownell cell excluding the personal effects brownell took with him to the shu in thirteen bags.with the assistance of another officer not a party to this lawsuit,corrections officer bivins searched and brownell thirteen bags.bivins also filled one more bag with brownell remaining personal effects from the shu.bivins completed a personal property transferred inventory form indicating that brownell was leaving woodbourne with fourteen property bags.officers bivins and specht transported brownell from woodbourne to eastern,and officer bivens certified the arrival of fourteen property bags at eastern.corrections officer ferrafolo received brownell at eastern and confirmed by written receipt that brownell had arrived with fourteen bags of property.brownell is himself unsure whether all his bags arrived there,claiming that he did not have access to or see his property while at eastern.
brownell claims that five weeks later,on july,he was transferred to southport correctional facility southport with only three bags.on september,brownell was transferred with three property bags from southport to shawangunk,where he remains incarcerated.
ii.the administrative process 
lost property reimbursement claim 
upon learning on july,that eleven of his bags were missing,brownell claims that he contacted the inmate records clerks at both southport and shawangunk and was informed that the only documentation on record indicated that three bags were shipped from eastern.on september,brownell filed an inmate claim form at shawangunk for recovery of his lost property.he listed,as missing,items of clothing and footwear,as well as pages of trial transcripts from his trial pages of hearing transcripts and motion papers and pages of research material for a federal habeas corpus that was to be filed by september of.
the inmate claim form that brownell used appears to be intended to reimburse inmates for the value of their lost property.for example,part of the form asks the inmate to provide the original cost and depreciation of the missing item as well as the reimbursement requested.in addition,in the portion of the claim form used for an administrative response,the grounds for rejecting a claim relate to unrealistic claim value,unsubstantiated claim value,or failure to indicate age and condition of the property at the time of loss.although the inmate claim form is designed for inmate reimbursement,brownell appears to have used the form to locate his property.for example,while he indicated on the form that he did not know the value of his clothing,footwear,or legal papers information indicative of an intent to be reimbursed,he did specify the time frame during which he thought the loss occurred.brownell form was assigned a claim number and an inmate claims investigation was undertaken.
on november,the investigator,sergeant bertone,recommended denial of brownell claim.during his investigation,sergeant bertone contacted shawangunk corrections officer howe,as well as a records clerk,and brownell himself.sergeant bertone referenced officer howe written statement that no legal papers were inventoried during the processing of brownell property when he arrived at shawangunk.sergeant bertone concluded ultimately that a ll property received at shawangunk was inventoried and that p roperty missing prior to shawangunk would not fall into the responsibility of the facility.inmate has no documented proof of purchase or prices.on november,deputy superintendent of administration dsa leo bisceglia considered sergeant bertone recommendation and denied the claim for lack of documentation.
the new york department of correctional services docs affords prisoners the opportunity to appeal denial of their lost property claims to either the facility superintendent or the central office,depending on the amount of the claim,and then to the new york court of claims.regs.tit,b.instead of appealing the administrative denial of the reimbursement claim,brownell filed an inmate grievance complaint at shawangunk challenging said denial on december.brownell has testified that he abandoned his lost property claim,and filed a grievance instead,at the direction of the shawangunk inmate grievance program supervisor.the grievance requested an investigation into the lost property but did not allege that corrections personnel had intentionally interfered with the transfer of that property

as to the requested action,brownell wrote that he wanted the facility t o find his lost property via a thorough investigation.

brownell pursued his grievance through each of these stages.after reviewing the grievance,the igrc recommended that brownell should file a property claim with woodbourne.second,brownell appealed that decision to leonard portuondo,the superintendent of shawangunk.at this stage of the grievance procedure,superintendent portuondo advised brownell to appeal his claim disapproval to the superintendent,presumably referring to the lost property claim that brownell had originally filed.in the third stage,brownell appealed portuondo decision to the corc,claiming,i do not feel a thorough investigation was done on my lost property claim.three bags of property made it to eastern corr.facility,what happened to the other eleven bags the corc upheld the denial of the grievance on february,with the following explanation
