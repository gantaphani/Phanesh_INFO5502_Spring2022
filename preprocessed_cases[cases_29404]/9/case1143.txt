the plaintiff,donald lusk,is a resident of the architectural and historic district the historic district of the village of cold spring,new york the village.in,he posted various signs on his residential property protesting a real estate development on cold spring hudson river waterfront.the village served lusk with a violation notice charging him with six counts of violating various provisions of the cold spring village code the code.lusk then filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york under in which he alleged that the code provisions violated the first amendment to the united states constitution made applicable to the village through the fourteenth amendment.he sought declaratory and injunctive relief,nominal damages,and attorney fees.
the district court colleen mcmahon,judge,in a thoughtful and thorough opinion,granted lusk motion to enjoin the village from enforcing some of the code challenged provisions,concluding that they were unconstitutional.see lusk vill.of cold spring,d.the court decided,however,that chapter of the code,which requires that the village architectural and historic district review board the review board or board give prior approval to any physical alterations to residential or commercial buildings within the historic district,was constitutional both on its face and as applied to lusk signs.id.at.the court reasoned that chapter was a regulation of speech that furthered the substantial government interest in preserving the aesthetic integrity of the historic district while leaving open to the plaintiff ample alternative channels of communication.it further determined that chapter did not confer unfettered discretion on the review board with respect to whether or not to grant approval,concluding that chapter therefore was not facially unconstitutional.id.at.it denied lusk motion to enjoin the village enforcement of that portion of the code.
the village does not to contest the district court judgment insofar as it struck down as unconstitutional several portions of the code.the sole issue before us,therefore,is whether the district court erred in concluding that chapter was constitutional.we conclude that although the standards employed by chapter are constitutionally permissible,the procedures it employs to effect them are not.
background 
lusk violations of the code 
lusk resides on main street in the historic district.his house is flush against the front sidewalk.there is therefore no front lawn or other space between the house and the sidewalk.
in june,lusk began placing signs,which appear from pictures of them included in the record to have been made by applying spray paint to large pieces of plywood,on or leaning against his front porch.the signs conveyed lusk protest against a real estate development on the cold spring waterfront,with messages such as,go to public hearing to see plans for our waterfront think that building is big why does local government change zoning laws and help save the waterfront from foot high monster condos.on july,the building inspector for the village of cold spring served lusk with a violation notice for having displayed two of the signs without requisite prior approval.it charged lusk with several violations of the code 
two counts of violating code a,which provides that i t shall be unlawful for any owner or person occupying property located within the historic district to m ake,permit or maintain any alteration to any improvement located within the district unless the historic district review board has previously issued a certificate of economic hardship or a certificate of appropriateness.
two counts of violating code b,which prohibits the posting of signs without a review by the village planning board.
two counts of violating code g,which provides that signs are a permitted accessory to an establishment on the same lot.the notice alleged that lusk was in violation of section g b because the signs did not qualify as an accessory and because the aggregate size of his signs exceeded square feet.
on august,the building inspector issued a ticket to lusk requiring him to appear at the village of cold spring justice court on august,in order to respond to the alleged violations of the code on november,prior to a disposition in the criminal proceedings against him,lusk filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to and,in which he sought various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief,nominal damages and attorney fees.he alleged that the provisions of the code he was charged with violating infringed his rights under the first amendment to the united states constitution,which are applicable to the village through the fourteenth amendment.he also asserted that chapter of the code,which regulates the posting of signs in such public places as utility poles,public streets,and public sidewalks,as applied to his signs,violated the first amendment 
the district court,abstaining from interference with lusk ongoing criminal proceedings,see lusk,d at,set a briefing schedule.on january,lusk pled guilty in village justice court to one count of posting signs without a permit,a violation of chapter.
the district court opinion 
the district court first consolidated lusk request for a preliminary injunction with his request for a permanent injunction.lusk,d at.the village conceded that chapter was unconstitutional.the court therefore granted lusk motion to enjoin its enforcement.id.at.
the court also granted lusk motion to enjoin the enforcement of chapter.id.at.that provision defines sign as a ny device for visual communication that is used for the purpose of bringing the subject thereof to the attention of the public,but not including any flag,badge or insignia of any governmental agency or any civic,charitable,religious,patriotic,fraternal or similar organization.id.at.because this definition of sign explicitly excludes from its scope some communications based on their content,and because all of chapter regulations of signs incorporated that definition,the court concluded that the ordinance was not content neutral,and for that very reason can not possibly have been the narrowest means to effect the compelling governmental interest in promoting aesthetics and traffic safety.id.at.employing a strict scrutiny analysis,the court held the entire chapter to be unconstitutional.id.at.
the district court concluded,however,that chapter,which purports to regulate the appearance of residential and commercial properties within the historic district,is constitutional.the court first asked whether chapter is content neutral,noting that its stated purpose is the enhancement,perpetuation,preservation and use of improvements of historic,aesthetic,and architectural value in order to foster the health,prosperity,safety and welfare of the people of the village of cold spring.id.to this end,the code requires residents seeking to make or maintain an alteration to any improvement in the historic district first to apply for a certificate of economic hardship or a certificate of appropriateness coa from the review board.code a.the review board is required to act on applications within days of the first formal review by the review board.the district court decided that this requirement applies to all types of alterations and hence,to all types of signs.id.at.the court thus concluded that the regulation was content neutral,triggering only an intermediate level of scrutiny.id.
under intermediate scrutiny,a regulation must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.applying intermediate scrutiny,the district court concluded that the ordinance serves a substantial government interest.lusk,d at citing members of city council of taxpayers for vincent,d it is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance esthetic values.the court further concluded that the review board approval process for alterations to physical improvements established by the code is not more burdensome than necessary since i t is possible to imagine that,without these regulations,the historic character of the district would be entirely wiped away.id.at footnote omitted.
finally,the court concluded that the regulation leaves open ample alternative channels of communication i f i am reading the literal text of chapter correctly,plaintiff and other residents of the historic district may even be free to post signs on their property as long as they did not affix the signs to their improvements.id.the court concluded that even if it is not the most efficient and effective form of regulation,chapter is nevertheless constitutionally valid.id.
the district court also addressed lusk argument that chapter gives the review board excessive discretion in determining which applications to approve.chapter provides 
alteration of designated property shall be compatible with its historic character,and with exterior features of neighboring properties.in applying the principle of compatibility,the review board shall consider the following factors 
a the general design,character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration or new construction 
b the scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to the property itself,surrounding properties,and the neighborhood 
c texture and materials,and their relation to similar features of the properties in the neighborhood 
d visual compatibility with surrounding properties,including proportion of the property front facade,proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade and roof shape and 
e the importance of architectural or other features to the historic significance of the property.
code a.chapter also provides that the review board will be guided by the united states secretary of the interior standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic properties.code c.
while acknowledging that the required evaluation is an inherently subjective enterprise,the district court nevertheless concluded,
these codified constraints on board conduct require the board to make and justify its decisions in conformity with a variety of factors,none of which touches on the content of any message to be imparted by the alteration or improvement.since consideration of content would be constitutionally impermissible,the fact that the ordinance does not contain a specific prohibition against content consideration does not militate against a finding of constitutionality.i conclude that chapter does not confer unfettered discretion on the review from that plaintiff challenge to the chapter on this ground fails as well.
on appeal,lusk challenges the district court ruling with respect to the constitutionality of chapter.as noted,the village does not appeal the district court conclusion that chapters or of the code are unconstitutional.

standard of review 
lusk sought both a preliminary and a permanent injunction.we review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction by a district court for abuse of discretion.mony group,highfields capital,cir.questions of law decided in connection with requests for preliminary injunctions receive the same de novo review that is appropriate for issues of law generally.am.express fin.advisors thorley,cir.

ii.application of the first amendment 
the first amendment provides congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech const.amend.although the language speaks in terms of what is forbidden to congress,it has,of course,long been established that the conception of liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment embraces the right of free speech,stromberg california,and that its provisions therefore apply to state governments.because i t is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment,lovell city of griffin,the first amendment protection of free speech applies to the municipal ordinance at issue on this appeal.title,section of the united states code affords lusk a cause of action against the village if,as he alleges,it has deprived him of such a constitutional right.
iii.chapter as a prior restraint 
lusk begins his argument on appeal by contending that chapter constitutes a prior restraint on his expression.appellant br.at.the supreme court has referred to p rior restraints on speech and publication as the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights.press ass stuart,d.they are subjected to judicial scrutiny with a heavy presumption against their constitutional validity.org.for a better austin keefe,d quoting carroll princess anne,d,and bantam books,sullivan,d.
a law requiring prior administrative approval of speech falls within the prior restraint rubric in freedman maryland,d,for example,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of a state law establishing a board of censors to which all films had to be submitted before being shown with in the state.in striking down the law,the court acknowledged the heavy presumption against the constitutional validity of such a system of prior restraints of expression.id.at.quoting bantam books,at.see also shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d a law subjecting the exercise of first amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license,without narrow,objective,and definite standards to guide the licensing authority,is unconstitutional.cox louisiana,d it is clearly unconstitutional to enable a public official to determine which expressions of view will be permitted and which will not or to engage in invidious discrimination among persons or groups by use of a statute providing a system of broad discretionary licensing power staub city of baxley,d a n ordinance which,like this one,makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms which the constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion of such an unconstitutional censorship or prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms.kunz new york.we have here,then,an ordinance which gives an administrative official discretionary power to control in advance the right of citizens to speak on religious matters on the streets of new york.as such,the ordinance is clearly invalid as a prior restraint on the exercise of first amendment rights.beal stern,cir because the new york city rules at issue condition the exercise of expressive activity on official parks department do constitute a prior restraint on speech.the essence of prior restraints are that they give public officials the power to deny use of a forum in advance of actual expression.quoting se.promotions,conrad,d.
this aversion to what is in effect the licensing of expression has an ancient pedigree.m uch of the special hostility to traditional prior restraints has concerned the context in which they historically operated one was prohibited from publishing without the approval of a professional censor who usually operated in secret and with great discretion.marc franklin et,cases and materials on mass media law ed.franklin et.the supreme court seminal decision giving rise to the presumptive invalidity of prior restraints,near min.ex.rel.olson,noted that it was t he struggle in england,directed against the legislative power of the licenser sic that resulted in renunciation of the censorship of the press.id.at.and in thomas chicago park district,d,the court observed that the first amendment prohibits a wide assortment of government restraints upon expression,but the core abuse against which it was directed was the scheme of licensing laws implemented by the monarch and parliament to contain the evils of the printing press in th century england.
insofar as chapter is a system of prior restraints,then,it may be said to be presumptively unconstitutional.but,even so,the question remains whether the ordinance is an invalid prior restraint.thomas,at.emphasis added concluding that and specific licensing regulations with respect to large scale events in municipal parks including those involving the exercise of the right to speak did not constitute an invalid prior restraint see also beal,at the conclusion that a regulation constitutes a prior restraint,however,is not dispositive of its constitutional validity.
we conclude,however,contrary to the ruling of the district court,that chapter is constitutionally invalid.it is one of the typical attributes of prior chapter acts to freeze the speech of the plaintiff and others like him who reside in the historic district and who wish to use signs to convey message,at least for the time it takes them to obtain a coa,see.press ass n,at.we find to be at the heart of the ordinance invalidity.
iv.the necessity for a license 
city of ladue and watchtower bible 
in city of ladue gilleo,d,the supreme court addressed circumstances markedly similar to those presented by this appeal.the plaintiff,a resident of suburb of louis,posted on her property in front of her house a sign protesting the first gulf war.she thereby disobeyed a local ordinance prohibiting signs on residential front lawns,with certain exceptions for,among other things,residential identification signs no larger than one square foot,signs advertising that the property is for sale,lease or exchange and identifying the owner or agent and signs for churches,religious institutions and schools.id.at.quotation marks,citations and footnote omitted alterations incorporated.
the eighth circuit struck down the ordinance on first amendment grounds,concluding that its listed exceptions rendered it a regulation of speech that could not pass muster under strict scrutiny.gilleo city of ladue,cir.to survive strict scrutiny,restrictions must be necessary to serve a compelling interest and must be narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.at citing simon schuster,members of the state crime victims,d.
a unanimous supreme court affirmed,but using a different approach.it began by differentiating between two analytically distinct grounds for challenging ordinances regulating signs city of ladue,at.one ground justifies striking down a regulation when it prohibits too little speech.id.at.the court noted that,for instance,by carving out exceptions to an otherwise blanket ban on speech,the city had effectively given preference to one type of speech over another.see also metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality opinion holding unconstitutional a billboard ban in part because of the exceptions to the ban and noting that w ith respect to noncommercial speech,the city may not choose the appropriate subjects for public discourse.the court concern with such preferences is in part what justifies its application of strict scrutiny to regulations.see,first bank of boston bellotti,d applying heightened scrutiny to a massachusetts campaign financing statute that,in the court view,constituted an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people.
but the city of ladue court declined to base its decision on underinclusiveness.it explained that if it were to do so,as the eighth circuit had,the city might theoretically remove the defects in its ordinance by simply repealing all of the exemptions.city of ladue,at.see also metromedia,at.stevens,dissenting in part criticizing the plurality for having focuse d its attention on the exceptions from the total ban and having,somewhat ironically,conclude d that the ordinance is an unconstitutional abridgment of speech because it does not abridge enough speech.
the court examined instead whether the regulation prohibits too much speech.city of ladue,at.under this approach,removing the exceptions does not cure the constitutional defect.the court said that it would therefore first ask whether ladue may properly prohibit the plaintiff from displaying her antiwar sign,and then,only if necessary,consider the separate question whether it was improper for the city simultaneously to permit certain other signs.id.emphasis in original.in so doing,the court explained,it would assume,for purposes of its analysis,that the regulation was content neutral,thereby avoiding strict scrutiny.id.but rather than apply intermediate scrutiny,as generally would be appropriate for a regulation,see,perry,at,the court considered the ordinance purpose and its impact upon what it concluded was a unique medium by which ladue residents might communicate with one another,city of ladue,at.
the purported public purpose of the city of ladue ordinance was the city interest in minimizing the visual clutter associated with signs.id.at.but the court noted that in linmark associates,willingboro,d,it had struck down a city ban on for sale signs for houses on their own property in order to stem white flight.the city of ladue interest was concededly valid but certainly no more compelling than the interest at stake in linmark.city of ladue,at.
the court concluded that the valid purpose of the city ordinance did not justify its almost complete foreclos ure of a venerable means of communication that is both unique and important.id.residential signs,the court explained,are an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication.especially for persons of modest means or limited mobility,a yard or window sign may have no practical substitute.id.at.a special respect for individual liberty in the home has long been part of our culture and our law that principle has special resonance when the government seeks to constrain a person ability to speak there.id.at.internal citations omitted emphasis in original.thus,the court concluded that even had the regulation been content neutral,in light of the unique characteristics of yard signs and their importance as means of communication,it was not persuaded that adequate substitutes exist ed for the important medium of speech that ladue ha d closed off.id.at.
the city of ladue approach was echoed in watchtower bible tract soc y of,vill.of stratton,d,in which a congregation of jehovah witnesses challenged a village ordinance under which it was a misdemeanor to engage in canvassing without first obtaining a permit from the village mayor.the district court and the sixth circuit,applying intermediate scrutiny to what it viewed as a regulation,upheld the ordinance.see watchtower bible tract soc y of,vill.of stratton,cir.the supreme court reversed.
the court surveyed the long history of jehovah witnesses challenges to speech regulations,noting that such cases provide both a historical and analytical backdrop.watchtower bible,at.it explained that they emphasize the value of the speech involved and show that there must be a balance between a town interests and the effect of the regulation on the first amendment rights.id.at.although the parties had adamantly dispute d the appropriate standard of review,the court noted that the answer could not be found in the previous jehovah witnesses cases.but it concluded that it was unnecessary to resolve that dispute because the breadth of speech affected by the ordinance and the nature of the regulation make it clear that it must be struck down.id.at.
while recognizing the village of stratton legitimate concern about the prevention of fraud and crime and its legitimate desire to protect its residents privacy,the court concluded that those interests did not justify the regulation,which appeared to apply even to residents casually soliciting the votes of neighbors,or ringing doorbells to enlist support for employing a more efficient garbage collector.id.at.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.
although the village of stratton had argued that the registration requirement was purely ministerial and that a request for a permit had never been denied,the court concluded that a law requiring a permit to engage in such speech constitutes a dramatic departure from our national heritage and constitutional tradition.id.at.the court based its conclusion on the facts that the permit process made it impossible for a person to support a cause anonymously some people,because of either their religious scruples or their firm convictions that such speech is constitutionally protected,will refrain from applying for such a license and the ordinance effectively banned spontaneous speech,such as that of the hypothetical person who made a decision on a holiday or weekend to take an active part in a political campaign or who made a spontaneous decision to go across the street and urge a neighbor to vote against the mayor.id.at.
the watchtower bible court concluded that while the breadth and unprecedented nature of this regulation did not alone render it invalid,the government purported interest in preventing fraud could not justify its application to petitioners,to political campaigns,or to enlisting support for unpopular causes.id.at.
thus,under these relatively recent decisions,because of the particular concern with laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression,city of ladue,at,even if it is content neutral,the reviewing court in such cases must balance the state interest in regulating speech against the individual and public interest in protecting it because the ordinance at issue here,similar to that considered by city of ladue,addresses the entire medium of outdoor signs in the historic district,code b,we must apply the city of ladue test.
analysis of chapter under city of ladue 
among the stated purposes of chapter is to s afeguard the village of cold spring historic,aesthetic,architectural and cultural heritage.code b.the village asserts that the supreme court considers preservation of aesthetic values to be a legitimate government interest.see members of the city council taxpayers for vincent,d it is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance esthetic values.we agree.but under city of ladue,the erection of signs on residential property,a unique and important medium of expression,nonetheless may not be so broadly burdened.
the district court found that the plaintiff and other residents of the historic district may be free to post signs on their property as long as they did not affix the signs to their improvements.lusk,d at.at oral argument,the village similarly maintained that chapter would not apply to a traditional yard sign that was not attached to,or leaning against,any structure.tr.of oral arg.although this interpretation finds little support in the text of the ordinance we assume for present purposes that the ordinance would not have applied to lusk signs if they had been rather than leaning against his house.but accepting this odd reading of chapter does not aid residents of the historic district who,like lusk,do not have space in front of their houses to erect a sign for them,the ordinance,no less than the one at issue in city of ladue,almost completely foreclose s a venerable means of communication that is both unique and important,city of ladue,at,at least pending review board approval and as in city of ladue,the government interest in the aesthetic appearance of the historic district can not justify such a broad restriction on speech.unlike the statute in city of ladue,of course,chapter of the code does not ban speech outright.it prohibits speech for as long as days while the village considers the sign owner coa the ordinance constitutionality hinges,then,on whether chapter licensing scheme is deficient because it requires residents to wait that long before being permitted to post such a sign.we conclude that it is.it remains an impermissibly broad ban on such speech,at least for the time.see.press ass n,at.if it can be said that a threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication chills speech,prior restraint freezes it at least for the time.citing alexander bickel,the morality of consent even if they are ultimately lifted they cause irremediable loss in the immediacy,the impact,of speech a criminal statute chills,prior restraints freeze.elrod burns,d the loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.where,as here,a property owner wishes to take a public position on a pressing public issue,for example,or on the qualifications of a candidate for public office in an imminent election,the time required to obtain approval may prevent the property owner from doing so until after the public issue is settled or the election is over.such belated approval is of little consolation to lusk and those like him in this regard,and of little use to their neighbors or the political process.nor,as city of ladue instructs,does the possibility that lusk may use some other more expensive or less convenient means to convey his message enable it to survive constitutional scrutiny.city of ladue,at.in the end,the approval process itself renders the regulatory scheme invalid 
the village aesthetic interests,then,do not justify the scope of the regulations because they almost completely foreclose a venerable means of communication that is both unique and important,city of ladue,at,while the review board considers an application for a coa.see also watchtower bible,at.city of dallas,at.a prior restraint that fails to place limits on the time within which the decisionmaker must issue the license is impermissible.city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d w e can not agree that newspaper publishers can wait indefinitely for a permit only because there will always be news to report a paper needs public access at a particular time eventual access would come too little and too late.quoting freedman,at.
v.the standards established by chapter 
we thus conclude that the method by which chapter standards are to be applied is constitutionally infirm.but the plaintiff would have us go further and hold that the standards themselves,when used as a basis for judging the permissibility of signage,violate the first amendment on their face lusk asks us to declare that the regulation of signs by reference to their compatib ility with the historic district historic character,and with exterior features of neighboring properties,code a,is impermissible under the first amendment.we decline to do so.
here we depart from the city of ladue analysis.we are not faced with the validity of the statute effective proscription of the entire medium of residential signage for an extended period of time.what is now at issue is a challenge to the substantive criteria used by the statute to determine whether an outdoor sign should be permitted on residential property in the historic district.there is no indication that the requirement of architectural and design compatibility,like the licensing scheme the village employs to enforce it,necessarily implies the existence of a broad limitation on a unique and important medium of expression.but lusk argues that,the city of ladue test aside,the particular standards that the village ordinance employs,when analyzed as quotidian time,place and manner restrictions under intermediate scrutiny,are nonetheless constitutionally impermissible.
generally,time,place,and manner restrictions are permitted so long as they survive intermediate scrutiny,they are content neutral,narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,leave open ample alternatives for communication,and also if they do not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to government officials.beal,at quoting forsyth county,nationalist movement,d.
a government regulation that allows arbitrary application is inherently inconsistent with a valid time,place,and manner regulation because such discretion has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.to curtail that risk,a law subjecting the exercise of first amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license must contain narrow,objective,and definite standards to guide the licensing authority.the reasoning is simple if the permit scheme involves appraisal of facts,the exercise of judgment,and the formation of an opinion by the licensing authority,the danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious first amendment freedoms is too great to be permitted.
forsyth county,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the supreme court has warned that r egulations which permit the government to discriminate on the basis of the content of the message can not be tolerated under the first amendment.id.at.emphasis added.
lusk asserts that chapter fails to meet these criteria.he argues,in effect,that chapter is invalid because it does not set objective standards governing the grant or denial of license applications,which are necessary to ensure that village officials do not have the power to discriminate based on the content or viewpoint of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or disliked speakers.charette town of oyster bay,cir quoting city of lakewood,at.t he question,therefore,is whether the provision does,as alleged,vest unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity.beal,at quoting city of lakewood,at.
as noted,chapter provides 
alteration of designated property shall be compatible with its historic character,and with exterior features of neighboring properties.in applying the principle of compatibility,the review board shall consider the following factors 
a the general design,character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration or new construction 
b the scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to the property itself,surrounding properties,and the neighborhood 
c texture and materials,and their relation to similar features of the properties in the neighborhood 
d visual compatibility with surrounding properties,including proportion of the property front facade,proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade and roof shape and 
e the importance of architectural or other features to the historic significance of the property.
while i t is common ground that governments may regulate the physical characteristics of signs,city of ladue,at,we are met at the threshold with an ambiguity in the text of chapter as to whether it is physical characteristics alone that the ordinance indeed regulates.does it apply to the form of signs erected in the historic,their architecture and the signage in its,the content of the signs proposed messages in addition to their architecture and design to choose a familiar example,a hypothetical bulletin board signage on the exterior of a house of worship does chapter authorize the review board to make a judgment as to such a bulletin board architecture and,color,style,location and or may the board also take into account the sign name of the pastor and the title of her next sermon,or a quotation from the quran or the book of revelations using a secular illustration does the ordinance permit the board to assess a proposed theater marquee on the basis of its size,shape,decorative detail,lighting and the like only,or does it allow the board to factor in a judgment as to the historical character or other characteristics of the announcement the marquee displays 
we think that if chapter authorizes the review of architecture and design of signage divorced from the signs intended content,then chapter a articulated standards are both content neutral and sufficiently narrow and definite.see forsyth,at.although the criteria are,as the district court correctly noted,subjective in nature,lusk,d at,they nevertheless are appropriate means of regulating,aesthetic endeavors such as architecture or construction.taxpayers for vincent,at.i t is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance aesthetic values.indeed,we doubt that a municipality could maintain a reasonable level of architectural homogeneity or historical of which are proper governmental the absence of judgments that are partly subjective.yet these judgments are sufficiently tied to objective aesthetic standards,we think,to provide the necessary guidance to the review board.if the review board decision turns entirely on the compatibility of the architecture and design of an improvement,including an outdoor sign,see code b,then,the ordinance is constitutional 
on the other hand,if under chapter the review board is permitted to decide whether a sign including its message meets the chapter criteria,we think the ordinance is,as lusk argues,flawed.a standard requiring or allowing the board to decide whether the content of signs such as lusk is historically appropriate is too imprecise to be a meaningful restraint on the exercise of the judgment of the board members.the code yardstick,if employed in this manner,would not act as an effective limitation on the ability of village officials to base their,improperly,on the content of the speech they are regulating.see city of lakewood,at.there is too great a danger that the official will refer to such statutory factors as t he general design,character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration and the v isual compatibility with surrounding properties,including proportion of the property front facade,both largely inapposite to political signage,in order to prohibit a proposed sign when he or she disagrees with either the message or the messenger.see id.t he mere existence of the licensor unfettered discretion,coupled with the power of prior restraint,intimidates parties into censoring their own speech,even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.while the ordinance may be content neutral on its face,signs erected or to be erected could be judged on the basis of their village officials agree or disagree with the point of view that is expressed.
happily,we need go no further in our analysis.principles of statutory construction teach that where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,we may construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of the legislature.field day,llc county of suffolk,cir citing empire healthchoice,mcveigh,cir quoting edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d internal quotation marks omitted.as we have explained,we think that the construction of chapter is constitutional when applied to general principles of architecture and design,even though its specific application to the content of any signage would not be.this reading of the ordinance is,moreover,consistent with the village intent in adopting it,judging from its choice of words such as general design,character and appropriateness to the property,scale of proposed alteration or new construction,t exture and materials,v isual compatibility with surrounding properties,and t he importance of architectural or other features to the historic significance of the property.see code a a,b,c,d,and e.and we have been presented with no evidence of a legislative intent to the contrary.we therefore read chapter to apply to architecture and design only and thus interpret it not to authorize the review board to review,approve,or disapprove of the content of any proposed or existing signage interpreted thus,we conclude that the ordinance is constitutional.
to be sure,chapter may be subject to abuse.one day,someone may complain that a particular exercise of the review board discretionary authority constitutes an assault upon or threat to his or her first amendment right to free expression.spence washington,d finding petitioner expressive conduct protected by the first amendment because a n intent to convey a particularized message was present,and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.the review board might,for example,use its approval authority to prevent speech of those whose politics or religious views diverge from those of a majority of the board,with or without reference to a particular message that has been posted or proposed.this,however,is not such a case.we there
