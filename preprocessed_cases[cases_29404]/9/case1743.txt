opinion of the court 
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits companies employing fifteen or more persons from discriminating on the basis of sex in hiring,discharge,compensation,or terms of employment.b,a.norma nesbit alleges that gears unlimited,gears terminated her employment as a machine operator because of her sex.she concedes that gears did not employ fifteen persons during the pertinent time period,but argues that we should also count the employees at a related entity,winters performance products winters.together,gears and winters had more than fifteen employees.we hold that the district court properly refused to aggregate the number of employees at these companies.because title vii does not cover gears by itself,we affirm the dismissal of nesbit complaint.but we part with the district court on the path to this result.it viewed title vii fifteen or more person requirement as jurisdictional.we affirm the dismissal of nesbit complaint on the merits rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
facts and procedural history 
in,vaughn winter,vaughn founded winters,which manufactures rear ends for automobiles.in,he acquired gears,a transmission parts manufacturer.vaughn and his wife,madeline winter madeline,also formed maverick industries,maverick,which warehouses automotive parts,including parts produced at winters.at the time of the events relating to this suit december through august vaughn had a stake in three automotive companies gears,winters,and maverick.
the winter family shares ownership and control of these three companies.vaughn owns ten percent of gears,with the remainder held in trust in equal shares for his and vaughn.vaughn is president of gears and his children are corporate officers.he and madeline own winters and maverick in equal shares.he is president of winters and maverick,and madeline is the at winters.
gears and winters occupy separate plants about one mile apart in york,pennsylvania.in almost all respects,they operate independently.their products are produces transmissions and winters produces automotive rear ends and each company has its own equipment and production lines.winters contracts to buy parts from gears at market rates.the companies maintain separate financial records and payrolls,write separate checks,and file separate tax returns.
vaughn monitors operations at both gears and winters.while he participates in management at winters,gears is managed by randy lau.vaughn testified that he visits the gears facility only about twice a month,usually because a machine has broken down.nesbit disputes this testimony,contending that vaughn spends time at gears pretty much every day.
the only area in which gears and winters cooperate considerably is in hiring.typically,if either gears or winters has an opening,a winters employee will place a help wanted sign on the street in front of the winters building.prospective employees obtain applications at the winters front office and return them there as well.if winters is hiring,either vaughn or his wife will invite qualified applicants for an interview.if gears has an opening,someone at winters will communicate with the applicant on lau behalf and then direct him or her to the gears plant to interview with lau.the hiring decision is then lau prerogative.however,vaughn who,as noted above,normally does not participate in gears management can request that gears hire a particular applicant and gears will generally do so.either lau or the winter children normally decide whether to terminate an employee,but vaughn testified that he could ask gears to fire an employee who engaged in significant misconduct.
on december,nesbit submitted a standard employment application to winters for a machine operator position.that day,either vaughn or madeline interviewed her the interviewer concluded that no available positions at winters would be suitable for nesbit and instead referred her to gears,which hired her as a machine operator vaughn personally accompanied nesbit to meet lau,but the parties dispute whether vaughn or lau actually made the hiring decision.
nesbit remained at gears for two years and eight months.she perceived that lau was her boss and was more or less in charge at gears.occasionally she also worked an extra shift at winters following her regular shift at gears.she would punch out on the time clock at gears and then punch in at winters.when working a winters shift,she received a separate paycheck.her hours at the two plants were not consolidated for overtime pay.
on august,nesbit machine at gears crashed,leaving it unusable without repairs.nesbit became upset,which apparently caused her to develop a headache and neck pains.she informed the acting supervisor,greg pell,that she was leaving work to visit her chiropractor.when she returned the next day,lau was on vacation,and vaughn discharged her for insubordination.
after receiving permission from the equal employment opportunity commission,nesbit filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania alleging that gears discriminated against her because of gender.gears moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that it employed fewer than fifteen persons during the relevant time period and therefore was not an employer subject to title vii.
nesbit then filed an amended complaint alleging that gears and its associate corporation winters transmission,a company different from winters that vaughn owned from to were really a single employer with more than fifteen employees.gears moved again for a dismissal,this time observing that the entity called winters transmission,had ceased operation long before nesbit began working at gears.nesbit then filed a second amended complaint,alleging that gears and winters are associate corporations that together meet the threshold.on the basis of that allegation,the district court ordered discovery limited to the question whether gears and winters constitute a single employer under title vii.following discovery,the district court issued a memorandum and order in which it concluded that gears and winters are separate entities and,because gears unquestionably employs fewer than fifteen persons by itself,dismissed nesbit complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
is the number of employees a jurisdictional requirement 
we first address whether title vii threshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite as the district court believed it was in dismissing nesbit complaint pursuant to rule b or whether it is a substantive element of a title vii claim.whether an aspect of a claim concerns subject matter jurisdiction or the merits has at least three implications.first,because subject matter jurisdiction is,courts have an independent obligation to satisfy themselves of jurisdiction if it is in doubt.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.a necessary corollary is that the court can raise sua sponte jurisdiction concerns.second,if the requirement is not jurisdictional,a title vii claim for which the number of employees is in doubt nonetheless will support supplemental jurisdiction under over state claims.da silva kinsho int l,cir wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.third,in most contexts the question will be important to the plaintiff burden of proof.if an aspect of a claim concerns jurisdiction,and when jurisdiction turns on whether a particular fact is true as here as opposed to whether the complaint sufficiently alleges jurisdiction on its face,a court may inquire into the jurisdictional facts without viewing the evidence in a light favorable to either party.see mortensen first fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.by contrast,if an aspect of a claim concerns the merits,on a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim a court must accept the complaint allegations as true,united states express lines higgins,cir on a rule motion for summary judgment it must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and,if there are disputes over genuine issues of material fact,they are for the jury to resolve,huang bp amoco,cir.
relevant caselaw 
the question whether title vii threshold is a jurisdictional prerequisite when a plaintiff brings a colorable title vii claim has divided the courts of appeals the second and seventh circuits conclude that it is a substantive element that the plaintiff must prove unless the claim that there are fifteen employees is so obviously unfounded that it fails to raise a genuine federal controversy.da silva,at cir.johnson apna ghar,cir,petition for cert.filed,papa katy,cir sharpe jefferson distrib,cir.moreover,the circuit has held the americans with disabilities act ada threshold an element of the merits.eeoc francis xavier parochial.in this context,the ada requirement is in all relevant respects indistinguishable from title vii.
by contrast,the fifth,sixth,ninth,tenth,and eleventh circuits have said that the threshold is jurisdictional.greenlees eidenmuller,cir armbruster quinn,cir childs local,ibew,cir owens rush,cir scarfo ginsberg,cir.moreover,in thurber jack reilly,cir,the first circuit upheld a district court dismissal of a title vii case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction although the basis for the district court dismissal in of jurisdiction or the merits was uncontested at issue was the number of employees the employer had.the fourth circuit also held that the number of employees is jurisdictional in a case brought under the family and medical leave act fmla,a holding that suggests it would deem the number of employees jurisdictional in the title vii context as well.see hukill auto care,cir a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an fmla claim if the defendant is not an employer as that term is defined in the fmla which defines an employer as any person who employs or more employees.
the division is deeper than merely.even within certain circuits that have held title vii threshold jurisdictional,there is conflict.while in owens the tenth circuit assumed without analysis that the requirement is jurisdictional,in wheeler hurdman,cir,that court held that the threshold is both jurisdictional and intertwined with the merits of the case,and therefore should have been resolved as if on the merits.id.at.
the eleventh circuit is similarly conflicted.in garcia copenhaver,bell associates,cir,the court opined that the age discrimination in employment act threshold goes to the merits of an adea case.id.at.it reasoned that the section of the adea that provides the substantive relief the section forbidding an employer from discriminating is intertwined and dependent on the section of the adea that defines the scope of the act the section defining employer as one who employs more than twenty employees.id.at.however,in a later case,scarfo,the eleventh circuit dismissed a plaintiff title vii claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the defendant fell short of fifteen employees.a third case,morrison amway,cir,recognized this conflict and essentially joined both camps.it stated that,in the fmla context,a threshold implicate s both jurisdiction and the underlying merits.id.at emphasis added.however,it held that garcia correctly disposed of the issue as a matter of procedure the district court was required to find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of plaintiff case because of the degree to which the jurisdictional and merits inquiries were intertwined.id.at internal quotation marks omitted 
title vii requirement is an element of the merits 
with this conflict in mind,we begin our determination by noting that subject matter jurisdiction is the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate particular cases.steel citizens for a better env t,d emphasis in original.steel requires that courts normally should not conflate subject matter jurisdiction with elements of an action merits.the supreme court held that the elements of another federal statute the emergency planning and community act of epcra,a are not jurisdictional prerequisites.steel,at.in relevant part,epcra requires users of specified hazardous chemicals to file annual reports detailing their chemical inventories,methods,and recent releases of chemicals from their facilities into the environment,and provides that the district courts shall have jurisdiction in actions brought under subsection a of this section against an owner or operator of a facility to enforce the requirement concerned and to impose any civil penalty provided for violation of that requirement.c.the steel plaintiff,a group to protect environmental rights,sued a chicago manufacturer and asserted past violations of epcra.after being notified that it was in arrears on its filings,the manufacturer filed all the overdue reports.the plaintiff nonetheless continued its suit,seeking relief for past reporting violations.
the district court concluded that epcra does not support suits for past violations and therefore dismissed the plaintiff complaint under both rules b and b.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed,holding that epcra permits such suits.the supreme court determined that the case raised whether the plaintiff had constitutional standing and whether allegations of past violations state a cause of action under epcra,steel,at.as to the latter,the court decided that the past violations question was on the merits and not a jurisdictional requirement.id.at.in so doing,steel rejected attempts to portray the requirement to prove all elements of a cause of action as relevant to federal courts jurisdiction to hear a suit.the court reasoned that i t is firmly established in our cases that absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.on the contrary,
j urisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.rather,the district court has jurisdiction if the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another 
id.at.quoting bell hood.
the court also criticized the implications of treating the validity of a cause of action as jurisdictional.id.at.under that approach,each element of every cause of action would have a legitimate claim to being a jurisdictional requirement essentially eviscerating the distinction between the jurisdictional and merits inquiry and requiring a court to dismiss a claim for lack of jurisdiction whenever the plaintiff does not prevail.the court made plain,however,that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking if the alleged basis for jurisdiction clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous.id.at.
we presaged steel in a case decided five years earlier.in growth horizons,delaware county,cir,the district court dismissed a claim under the fair housing act for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the fair housing act makes it unlawful,inter alia,t o discriminate in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap.f.the district court concluded that the defendant did not make unavailable or deny housing to the plaintiff and that the fair housing act was therefore not implicated.we reversed,holding that a district court has federal question jurisdiction in any case where a plaintiff with standing makes a allegation that he or she is entitled to relief because the defendant conduct violated a federal statute.growth horizons,at.we further explained that d ismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not appropriate merely because the legal theory alleged is probably false,but only because the right claimed is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.id.at citing kulick pocono downs racing ass n,cir quoting oneida indian nation county of oneida,d see also moore federal practice,at ed.subject matter jurisdiction in cases is sometimes erroneously conflated with a plaintiff need and ability to prove the defendant bound by the federal law asserted as a predicate for relief a determination.
turning to title vii,we note that those courts that have held the requirement jurisdictional have provided no reasons for their holding rather,they have assumed it so or stated the conclusion without meaningful analysis.moreover,in reading b we perceive no congressional intent to make the requirement jurisdictional.indeed,title vii contains an explicit jurisdictional section,f,which provides that e ach united states district court and each united states court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.by contrast,b in which the requirement appears is a definitional section,defining employer.we doubt that congress intended this definitional section to have subject matter jurisdictional import.if congress had so intended,we believe its intention would be clearer.notably,b does not even contain the word jurisdiction.compare the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.id.explicitly making diverse citizenship and a jurisdictional prerequisites.moreover,congressional debate albeit postdating the requirement that an employer have more than fifteen employees reveals that at least some legislators regard the minimum not as jurisdictional but as an element of the cause of action.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of brooks w hen a company has less than employees,there are no damages available whatsoever because there is no cause of action under our current antidiscrimination statutes.
most plausible arguments for making requirement jurisdictional 
commerce clause argument 
perhaps the most plausible reason for finding that the requirement is jurisdictional is that it concerns a dispute as to the existence of a fact that is essential to a constitutional exercise of congress power to regulate.da silva,at suggesting this as a situation l ess clearly placed on one side of the line.as discussed,title vii applies to employers and defines an employer in relevant part as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees.b.because congress enacted title vii under its commerce clause power,eeoc ratliff,cir,the requirement that an employer be in an industry affecting commerce is the statute constitutional basis.and because the requirements that the employer be in an industry affecting commerce and that the employer have fifteen or more employees appear side by side in the statute,it is arguably reasonable to read b fifteen employee minimum as relevant to title vii commerce clause basis as well.that is,one might read the threshold as reflecting congress determination that only those companies with fifteen or more employees have the requisite substantial effect on interstate commerce to permit congress to enact the statute.see legislative history of titles vii and xi of civil rights act of,at the bill proceeds upon a theory that the quantum of employees is a rational yardstick by which the interstate commerce concept can be measured.separate minority views of poff and cramer,members,house comm.on the judiciary willis dean witter reynolds,cir noting congress determination in title vii that any employer with or more employees necessarily implicates interstate commerce ratliff,at i t is difficult to imagine any activity,business or industry employing or more employees that would not in some degree affect commerce among the states.quoting larson larson,employment discrimination,at.
this argument,while,nonetheless is unconvincing.first,the very wording of b suggests that the requirements that an employer be in an industry affecting commerce and have fifteen or more employees are separate and independent,and that it is a mistake to conflate the two.even if a putative employer has twenty employees,it is not covered by title vii if not in an industry affecting commerce.second,while the preceding commerce justification for title vii requirement makes intuitive sense,it finds little support in the legislative history.we note that the amendments to title vii lowered the minimum number of employees from to fifteen.patricia davidson,comment,the definition of employee under title vii distinguishing between employees and independent contractors,cin,noting this change.it lacks logic that,congress believed that it took employees for a substantial effect on interstate commerce but changed its mind in.furthermore,as initially proposed,the amendment to title vii contained an threshold.see armbruster,at.the threshold was ultimately raised to fifteen employees as the result of a political compromise,see,in order among other reasons to protect ethnic businesses and small businesses.davidson,supra,at.thus,the threshold appears motivated by policy to spare small companies the expense of complying with title vii rather than commerce clause considerations.
even assuming that congress lacks authority to enact a statute does not mean that a federal court lacks jurisdiction to review actions brought under that statute.when disposing of a claim brought under an unconstitutional statute,courts ordinarily deny the claim on the merits,on the ground that the statute under which relief is sought is unconstitutional,rather than for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.martin united way of erie county,cir kulick pocono downs racing ass n,cir noting the difference between congressional jurisdiction and federal courts article iii jurisdiction,and concluding that e lements of a claim that are called jurisdictional because they relate to congress jurisdiction remain questions of the merits see also plaut spendthrift farm,aff,cir,aff,d.
jurisdictional statements in other supreme court cases 
eeoc arabian american oil,d,can be read to suggest that the requirement is jurisdictional.in that case,the supreme court decided whether title vii applies extraterritorially to regulate the employment practices of united states employers who employ united states citizens abroad.id.at.the court addressed the question not as whether title vii granted plaintiffs a cause of action for extraterritorial violations,but rather whether title vii granted extraterritorial jurisdiction,see id.at,and affirmed the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.in arabian american oil,however,a policy consideration namely,the significant effect extraterritorial application of law might have on international relations favored viewing the extraterritoriality question as one of jurisdiction.that is,even if parties did not raise the question of title vii extraterritorial application,congress would likely have intended courts to raise the issue sua sponte in the interest of harmonious international relations.such concerns of international comity are not present here.
by analogy,some may find eeoc commercial office products,d,to counsel for finding jurisdictional the requirement.in that case,the supreme court stated that title vii does not give the eeoc jurisdiction to enforce the act against employers of fewer that employees.id.at.but this does not address the question before us.title vii grants the eeoc power to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful employment practice.a.thus,if an entity a person under the statute employs fewer than fifteen employees,by a terms,the eeoc lacks power jurisdiction.by contrast,title vii jurisdictional grant to the federal courts is broader.see id.f each united states district court and each united states court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this subchapter.
judicial administration reasons for requirement being an element of a title vii claim rather than a jurisdictional requirement 
as a policy matter which is ultimately the gut of our inquiry it also makes little sense to regard the threshold as jurisdictional.such a holding would require a federal court to determine whether a company had fifteen employees during the relevant period,even if the parties so stipulated.to require a federal court to engage in such a inquiry sua sponte which might in some cases require a federal appellate court to dig through an extensive record,including pay stubs and time sheets appears to be a waste of scarce judicial resources,and we doubt that congress intended such a result.see da silva,at i nstitutional requirements of a judicial system weigh in favor of narrowing the number of facts or circumstances that determine subject matter jurisdiction.sharpe,at surely the number of employees is not the sort of question a court including appellate court must raise on its own.
to hold the requirement jurisdictional also implies that a court would need to decide whether an entity employed more than fifteen individuals before reaching a title vii action merits even if the merits were more easily resolved than the jurisdictional question.steel,at.this result too is undesirable.
in this context,we hold that,while the matter is not free from doubt,the threshold is a substantive element whether an employer exists of a title vii claim and is not jurisdictional.federal jurisdiction is implicated only when the title vii claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous,steel,at,neither of which is the case here.
should we consolidate the number of employees at gears and winters 
as the district court looked beyond nesbit complaint and reviewed discovery on whether gears employs more than fifteen people,it should have resolved the issue under the summary judgment standard rather than as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.c.nonetheless,we may affirm its disposition for any reason supported by the record.grayson mayview state,cir.though the district court analyzed this case as jurisdictional rather than on the merits,nesbit fails nonetheless.gears and winters are plainly separate entities that can not be consolidated to meet the threshold.
the national labor relations board integrated enterprise test 
several courts of appeals have borrowed a test commonly called the integrated enterprise test or the single employer test from the national labor relations board nlrb to determine when two nominally distinct companies should be treated as a single entity under title vii.see anderson pacific maritime association,cir rc aluminum industries,national labor relations board,parker columbia pictures,cir artis francis howell north band booster ass n,cir frank west,cir mckenzie,at childs,at armbruster,at trevino celanese,cir.the four factors of the nlrb test are interrelation of operations,common management,centralized control of labor relations,and common ownership or financial control.artis,at citation omitted see also nlrb indus.of,cir discussing the test in the labor context.among these factors,n o single factor is dispositive rather,single employer status under this test ultimately depends on all the circumstances of the case.pearson component tech,cir describing but not adopting the test in a case applying the worker adjustment retraining notification act citation omitted.t he heart of the inquiry is whether there is an absence of an arm length relationship among the companies.knowlton teltrust phones,cir citations omitted,at.moreover,c ourts applying this standard in title vii and related cases have focused on the second factor centralized control of labor relations.trevino,at.
the seventh circuit has rejected the nlrb test as unhelpful in the context.papa katy,cir.in addition,other courts have occasionally listed,but essentially ignored,the nlrb factors in title vii cases,focusing instead on which entity actually made the allegedly discriminatory employment decision.see,lusk foxmeyer health,cir see also marc crandley,note,the failure of the integrated enterprise test why courts need to find new answers to the puzzle in federal discrimination cases,arguing against application of the nlrb test in the title vii context and presenting alternative options.
as the national labor relations act nlra and title vii address aspects of relations,there is surface appeal to applying the nlrb test in the title vii context.but given the different policies animating the two statutes,the nlrb test does not to the title vii context.that test is designed to determine whether the nlrb may decide a particular labor dispute.ua local united ass of journeymen apprentices of plumbing pipefitting indus.of canada,plumbing,cir i f the nlrb finds that two firms constitute a single unit the collective bargaining agreement with the union firm may be extended to the firm.crandley,supra,at see also murray miner,cir describing the test purpose to be to protect the collective bargaining rights of employees and to advance industrial stability.if the company at issue satisfies the nlrb test,it will in many cases be required to submit to collective bargaining.crandley,supra,at.but if a defendant in a title vii suit is deemed an employer within the meaning of the statute,it may be subject to liability.
because the nlra and title vii ask whether entities are a single enterprise for different reasons,it does not follow that the nlrb test is any more relevant to title vii cases than any of the other tests for determining whether two companies should be regarded as one.to the contrary,for purposes of determining whether two companies are a single employer,the nlra policy goals point in a different direction than title vii.as discussed,a significant purpose of the minimum in the title vii context is to spare small companies the considerable expense of complying with the statute requirements.see papa,at armbruster,at reviewing the legislative history behind the minimum.this goal suggests that the minimum should be strictly construed.by contrast,the nlrb jurisdiction was intended to be expansive,suggesting a more lenient test for labor cases.see crandley,supra,at.thus we deem there is little reason to refer to the nlrb test in deciding whether two entities should together be considered an employer for title vii purposes.we instead adopt a different framework,tailored to title vii policy goals.
our framework 
in papa,the seventh circuit developed its own test to determine whether two nominally distinct entities should be considered as one for title vii purposes.the court began with the basic principle of affiliate liability,that an affiliate forfeits its limited liability only if it acts to forfeit it.id.at emphasis in original.it proceeded to find three situations in the title vii context when a company and its affiliates forfeit limited liability and thus are deemed a single employer where a company has split itself into entities with less than fifteen employees with the intent to evade title vii reach when a parent company has directed the subsidiary discriminatory act of which the plaintiff is complaining or when a court would otherwise pierce the corporate veil,look behind the corporate form to hold a corporation shareholders personally liable.id.at.
we too will consider a company and its affiliates a single employer under title vii when a company has split itself into entities with less than fifteen employees intending to evade title vii reach or when a parent company has directed the subsidiary discriminatory act of which the plaintiff is complaining.however,on the third part of this disjunctive test,we articulate a slightly different standard from the seventh circuit.rather than applying the test for veil piercing imported from the corporation law context because individual shareholder liability is not implicated here,we will apply the factors courts use to determine when substantively to consolidate two or more entities in the bankruptcy context.when courts substantively consolidate two entities,they treat the assets and liabilities of each as belonging to a single entity.we explain in further detail each test.
splitting a single company into two or more to evade title vii 
when a plaintiff proves that a company has split itself into multiple entities to evade coverage under title vii,we consider those entities a single company for purposes
