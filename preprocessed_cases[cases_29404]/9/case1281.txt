julio giano,an inmate at wende correctional facility wende in alden,new york,filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of new york,alleging that,in violation of,the defendants,various state and wende officials,retaliated against him for filing an earlier lawsuit against prison authorities and for prevailing in a disciplinary proceeding.the district court siragusa,dismissed giano pro se complaint,on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act plra,a.following our holding in lawrence goord,cir,that the plra did not require plaintiffs to exhaust retaliation claims,we vacated the district court decision.giano goord,cir.but the supreme court subsequently held that all claims relating to prison conditions,including retaliation claims,are subject to the plra exhaustion requirement.see porter nussle,d.and so,on remand,the district court adhered to its earlier dismissal of giano claims for failure to exhaust.
giano appealed that dismissal,and his suit was argued alongside several other cases that concern the nature and scope of the plra exhaustion requirement abney new york dep t of corr,wl hemphill state of new york,wl johnson testman,wl and ortiz mcbride,wl.based on the following principles,as well as those articulated in our opinions in these cases,we vacate the district court dismissal of giano complaint,and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
for purposes of this appeal,we describe the facts as alleged by giano.on september,giano submitted to a urine test pursuant to prison authorities orders.sometime between september and october,six of the defendants tampered with and contaminated giano urine sample,causing the sample to test positive for marijuana,with the result that a misbehavior report against giano was issued on october.according to giano,the defendants took these actions in retaliation for his prior filing of a lawsuit against prison officials giano also claimed that defendant corrections officer co mcevoy,who had been assigned to assist giano in his defense,conspired with others to deprive giano of the opportunity to seek and obtain exculpatory information.
at the ensuing disciplinary hearing,several of the defendants allegedly presented false documents and testimony against giano.giano challenged this evidence,and claims that based on evidence that proved acts of impropriety on the part of staff and a series of procedural errors committed during the testing of the sample,he succeeded in getting the drug charge against him dismissed.giano further alleges that,after the hearing concluded,mcevoy threatened to get even with him for having filed complaints about the way in which mcevoy had performed his duties as giano defense assistant.mcevoy is reported by giano to have said,you better be real careful for this is not the end.i work with the officers who test urines and you not going to make fools of us.mcevoy also purportedly told giano that he had been framed for something having to do with a law suit.
according to giano,retaliation by the defendants continued in november,when giano participated in a trailer visit as part of the prison family reunion program.the program required inmates to undergo drug testing before and after each visit,and a positive drug test would result in suspension from the program for one year.following giano trailer visit,defendant gary keohane,a co,allegedly ordered giano to provide a urine sample in a plastic cup and then placed the sample into a paper bag containing another inmate sample.giano claims that keohane did not put a seal on the cup,nor did he tell giano where the sample would be stored or who would be testing it.he asserts that keohane and three others contaminated the sample and issued a misbehavior report,in retaliation for giano earlier lawsuit and for his victory in the first disciplinary proceeding.a second disciplinary hearing convened,and giano claims that the defendants again presented false evidence and false testimony against him.this time he was found guilty of the charge,and in addition to a suspension from family reunion visits,he was sentenced to days in keeplock,without privileges,as a penalty.
giano appealed the disciplinary hearing determination to glen goord,the acting department of correctional services docs commissioner.in a letter to goord,giano provided a detailed account of the asserted wrongdoing by defendants before and during the second disciplinary hearing.he stated in the letter 
the misbehavior report,dated,alleged that the urine sample i provided after a family reunion visit with my mother tested positive for use of cannibinoid.it was my defense that,and based upon a pending civil action against fourteen docs employees for inter alia retaliatory conduct and treatment as well as a previous hearing for the same charge a month earlier which was dismissed based upon the presentation of evidence that proved acts of impropriety on the part of staff,my urine sample was deliberately tampered with by an employee at wende.
at the commencement of the hearing,i made a formal objection to have the hearing officer recuse himself as hearing officer.it was my argument that,and since my defense was that correctional staff deliberately tampered with my urine sample,in the capacity of supervisor and responsibility for the conduct of staff he could not act in an impartial manner.
in the letter,giano went on to explain,in detail,the circumstances that led him to believe that the urine sample was tampered with.he also contended that defendants denied him the benefit of testimony from a material witness,that the hearing officer was demonstrably biased,and that no proper foundation had been laid for the test results.he requested that the drug use charge be reversed,dismissed,and expunged from his records.on february,the commissioner,ruling against giano,affirmed the result of the second disciplinary hearing 
giano complaint included ten claims,four of which are relevant to this appeal.in substance,he alleged that,in retaliation for his filing of an earlier lawsuit and for his having opposed the disciplinary charges against him,the defendants tampered with his urine samples and falsified some of the documentary and testimonial evidence used against giano at the disciplinary hearings.on december,prior to service of giano complaint on any of the defendants,the district court arcara,issued a sua sponte order requiring giano to detail his efforts to exhaust his administrative remedies.in response,giano submitted a statement asserting that he had pursued his retaliation claims in the disciplinary process,and that this should have been sufficient to exhaust his remedies.he argued that new york prison regulations and docs directive,which state that disciplinary decisions and dispositions are,prohibited him from filing a grievance to redress the harm defendants caused.he also claimed that any other avenue of appeal would have been futile because his earlier complaints had not been investigated.
in june,the district court siragusa,dismissed giano complaint,concluding that he had failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies as required by the plra.the court ruled that although state regulations may have barred giano from filing a grievance protesting the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding,the inmate grievance procedures nevertheless were the appropriate venue for challenging the acts of retaliation that giano alleged in his complaint.the contamination of his urine samples,breaches of security during the drug testing process,the filing of false misbehavior reports,the verbal threats by mcevoy,and the defendants alleged falsification of testimonial and documentary evidence were all grievable through docs grievance procedures,the district court held.giano failure to file a separate grievance,the court ruled,meant that his administrative remedies remained unexhausted.
we vacated the district court decision on may,based on our holding in lawrence goord,cir,that the plra did not require plaintiffs to exhaust claims of retaliation,because such claims involved individualized retaliatory actions against an inmate rather than claims brought with respect to prison conditions.giano goord,cir.the supreme court subsequently ruled that retaliation claims were subject to the plra exhaustion requirement,see porter nussle,d,and thereafter,on remand,the district court siragusa,in an order dated april,again dismissed giano complaint for failure to exhaust.giano filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
the plra,a,provides that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.the plra exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life,whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes,and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.porter nussle,d.further,as long as other forms of relief are obtainable through administrative channels,the provision is applicable even to suits seeking relief,such as money damages,that may not be available in prison administrative proceedings.booth churner,d.
we have previously held that administrative exhaustion is not a jurisdictional predicate,richardson goord,cir,and that plaintiffs are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court can dismiss their complaints for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,snider melindez,cir.moreover,failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense,see jenkins haubert,cir,and defendants actions may estop the state from asserting the exhaustion defense,ziemba wezner,cir.further,special circumstances may excuse a prisoner failure to exhaust,but dismissal with prejudice,when remedies are no longer available,is required in the absence of any justification for not pursuing such remedies.berry kerik,cir see also rodriguez westchester county jail corr.dep t,wl order denying petition for rehearing stating that the plaintiff prior understanding of the plra,even though ultimately determined to be incorrect,was a justification for not pursuing available remedies internal citation omitted.
in addition,today,in ortiz mcbride,we hold that exhausted claims filed alongside unexhausted ones may proceed even though the unexhausted claims must be dismissed.in abney new york dep t of corr,we conclude that,in some circumstances the behavior of the defendants may render administrative remedies unavailable,for purposes of the plra.and,in hemphill state of new york we read our holding in ziemba,supra,to signify that the threats prison officials allegedly made against the plaintiff may in some instances be sufficient to estop the government from asserting the affirmative defense of.as a result,in hemphill we deem dismissal of the plaintiff complaint at the summary judgment stage inappropriate,and remand for further factual consideration.finally,in johnson testman,we hold a that the government waived its defense of as to one defendant,and b that while,in some situations,the raising of a prisoner complaint in a disciplinary hearing may amount to exhaustion of administrative remedies,in others it may not.
in the instant case,we follow our recent decisions in berry and rodriguez,which make clear that there are certain special circumstances in which,though administrative remedies may have been available and though the government may not have been estopped from asserting the affirmative defense of,the prisoner failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements may nevertheless have been justified.berry,at rodriguez order at.the effect of such justification is that,though the administrative remedies are no longer available for reasons of timing or other procedural restrictions,such restrictions can not serve to keep the plaintiff suit from proceeding.
in the case before us,the plaintiff reasonably interpreted docs regulations to mean that his only administrative recourse was to appeal his disciplinary conviction.believing that docs directive precluded the filing of a grievance on matters relating to disciplinary proceedings,giano did not file a grievance.instead,he included references to the conduct of which he currently complains in his submissions appealing the adverse disciplinary ruling.as a result of his failure to file a formal grievance,there is a significant chance that the state will now seek to bar him from pursuing the grievance mechanisms that,it says,in fact were once available to him.
our sister circuits have taken a variety of approaches to the question of how inmates deviations from prison grievance procedures and rules should be treated for the purposes of plra exhaustion.the seventh and tenth circuits have adopted the most stringent stance,importing the equivalent of a procedural default rule from the habeas context.see pozo mccaughtry,cir drawing an analogy to collateral attacks on state court convictions,and holding that t o exhaust administrative remedies,a person must follow the rules governing filing and prosecution of a claim i f the state stands on its time limits and rejects the filing as too late,then state remedies have not been properly invoked.ross county of bernalillo,cir w e join the seventh circuit in holding that the plra,like,contains a procedural default concept within its exhaustion requirement.the sixth circuit,in contrast,has rejected such a strict standard.in thomas woolum,cir,the court ruled that so long as an inmate presented his grievance to prison officials and appealed through each level of the appellate hierarchy,he need not have complied with the state time limits for filing grievances or appeals 
as noted earlier,our circuit has recognized that while the plra exhaustion requirement is mandatory,porter,at,certain caveats apply.first,we have held that is an affirmative defense subject to estoppel in cases where prison officials inhibit an inmate ability to utilize administrative grievance procedures.ziemba,at.and,we today hold,in abney,that,in certain situations,administrative remedies may not be available,a,to prisoners seeking redress of their grievances.such circumstances include,but are not limited to,instances where the prisoner obtains a favorable disposition of his grievance,only to find,after the time for filing an administrative appeal has expired,that the relief he had won was not forthcoming.abney,citation.see also underwood wilson,cir holding that where plaintiff had undertaken all possible appeals but the prison authorities failed to respond within required time period,prisoner had exhausted administrative remedies foulk charrier,cir holding that remedies were not available to plaintiff where the warden did not respond to inmate grievance during the time period required by regulations.finally,berry and rodriguez confirm that the plra exhaustion requirement is not so rigid as to permit the barring of all suits brought after administrative remedies are no longer available,regardless of the circumstances,and simply because the plaintiff failed to follow prison grievance procedures to the letter.special circumstances may exist that amount to a justification for not complying with administrative procedural requirements.berry,at rodriguez order at 
while the language of the plra does not compel our conclusion we believe that prisoners may not circumvent the exhaustion requirement simply by waiting to bring a section action until their administrative complaints are.such a rule would not comport with the purposes of the plra,which sought to invigorate the exhaustion prescription,porter,at.and,allowing prisoners to bypass administrative procedural rules with impunity would subvert congress desire to afford corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case.porter,at.
this does not,however,mean that caused by a prisoner failure timely to pursue available administrative remedies is never justified.quite the contrary.nor is it appropriate to analogize the plra exhaustion requirement to the procedural default rule applicable in the habeas context.for,as we today hold in
