opinion of the court 
in lanning southeastern pennsylvania transp,cir hereafter lanning i,we held that under the civil rights act of a discriminatory cutoff score on an entry level employment examination must be shown to measure the minimum qualifications necessary for successful performance of the job in question in order to survive a disparate impact challenge.at.we found that the district court did not employ this standard,which was implicit in griggs duke power,d,and incorporated by the act,and,thus,vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the appeal for the court to determine whether the employer,the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa,had carried its burden of establishing that its mile run within twelve minutes measures the minimum aerobic capacity necessary to perform successfully the job of a septa transit police officer.id.at.we left it to the discretion of the district court to allow the parties to expand the record in keeping with our standard.
because we conclude that septa produced more than sufficient competent evidence to support the finding that a,training aerobic capacity of measures the minimum qualifications necessary for successful performance as a septa transit police officer and has,thus,justified the conceded disparate impact on female candidates by showing business necessity,we will affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of septa.we have jurisdiction pursuant to 
we clearly do not write on a clean slate.the district court conducted a bench trial in january of after which it rendered a opinion detailing findings of fact and conclusions of law.lanning southeastern transp,wl.june.on appeal,we,too,rendered a lengthy opinion with a lengthy dissent.to be sure,the majority opinion spent much time explaining how the standard announced therein came to be,but that opinion,and the dissent,discussed much more,including why septa concern over public safety caused it to modify its hiring requirements,the history of this litigation,and key pieces of evidence.on remand,the district court conducted a hearing,after which it rendered a decision detailing yet another findings of fact and conclusions of law.lanning septa,wl.
so much has been written and so little remains for determination that we do not believe it necessary to repeat what has been said before or,as does the dissent here,poke a hole here or there in one or more of the district court extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law.there is,however,one undisputed fact which bears repetition because it sets the stage for what is to follow it is undisputed that septa management wanted to improve the crime fighting ability of septa force and the fitness of its officers.as judge weis explained in lanning i 
concerned about its inability to control crime on its property,septa instituted a attack on the problem.it added a substantial number of officers,implemented a zone method of patrol,and adopted standards to improve the generally poor physical condition of its officers.unlike many metropolitan police departments,septa officers are deployed alone and on foot,engaging in physical activities more frequently than other law enforcement agencies.
the patrol zones present significant variations in conditions that affect the physical exertion of officers in the performance of their duties.zone one,for example,has a climb of to steps from street level.zone three,a mixture of above and locations,borders a large shopping mall,featuring retail theft and pursuits that lead into the septa transit system.zone five,which includes sports complexes,is characterized by long distances between stations.zone six includes the temple university area,a scene of frequent crimes against students.
septa officers must occasionally ask for assistance from their comrades in other zones.these calls are divided into two categories,officer assists and officer backups.an assist requires officers to respond immediately.often the only method available to get to the scene quickly is a run of five to eight city blocks.an officer responding to an assist must preserve enough energy to deal effectively with a situation once arriving on the scene.septa averages about running assists per year.backups are not as critical as assists,so officers generally use a paced jog.septa averages about backups annually.
at weis,dissenting.
we also reiterate what we explicitly stated in lanning i the business necessity standard takes public safety into consideration.at.we observed,in lanning i,that congress viewed the more liberal test for business necessity adopted in wards cove packing,atonio,d,as a significant departure from griggs and intended,when it enacted the civil rights act of,to endorse the business necessity standard enunciated in griggs and not the wards cove interpretation of that standard.we,thus,considered,in lanning i,only griggs and its cove progeny.nonetheless,we noted 
t o the limited extent that the supreme court cove jurisprudence instructs that the public safety is a legitimate consideration,application of the business necessity standard to septa is consistent with that jurisprudence because the standard itself takes public safety into consideration.if,for example,septa can show on remand that the inability of a septa transit officer to meet a certain aerobic level would significantly jeopardize public safety,this showing would be relevant to determine if that level is necessary for the successful performance of the job.clearly a septa officer who poses a significant risk to public safety could not be considered to be performing his job successfully.we are accordingly confident that application of the business necessity standard to septa is fully consistent with the supreme court cove jurisprudence as required by the act.
it is against this backdrop that we assess the sole issue we caused to be resolved on remand whether or not septa has proven that its aerobic capacity standard measures the minimum qualifications necessary for the successful performance of the job of septa transit police officers.the district court concluded that the answer was yes,and that any lesser standard would result in officers who were a danger to themselves,other officers,and the public at large,and unable to effectively fight and deter crime.lanning wl,at conclusion.in the course of our concluding that the court conclusion was correct,we have reviewed the relevant findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court conclusions of law under the plenary review standard.newark branch,naacp city of bayonne,cir lanning i,at.
we start by noting that when this case was last before us,we expressed concerns as to certain aspects of the statistical studies upon which the district court relied,and we encourage d the district court to take a critical look at these studies,if necessary,on remand.at.in its second memorandum opinion,the district court noted that it had indeed taken a second critical look at these studies as suggested and once again reaffirm ed their validity consistent with its prior extensive plus page memorandum opinion.lanning,wl,at.significantly,after the hearing on remand,the district court made additional findings of fact that bolster its conclusion.as the following brief discussion demonstrates,it is evident that the district court findings regarding the studies in this case were not clearly erroneous.
in lanning i,we were concerned that the absolute number of arrests or arrest rates in certain studies did not necessarily correlate with successful job performance.at.while we continue to believe that a septa officer should generally attempt to control a situation without having to make an arrest,the district court found,based upon its review of the extensive body of evidence before it,that lost arrests have a significant impact on the public safety in the septa transit system.lanning,wl,at.this finding indicates that arrests do,in fact,correlate to successful performance as a septa transit police officer.
we also questioned whether certain studies overemphasized the role of aerobic capacity in making arrests,and whether other studies placed too much emphasis on arrest rates for serious crimes given that,historically,the bulk of septa arrests has been for lesser crimes.while not all septa arrests are aerobic contests nor are they always effectuated to apprehend serious criminals the district court found that a n inability to proficiently perform any task would compromise the effectiveness of the septa transit police.wl,at emphasis added.in essence,the court concluded what,to us,is now evident a septa transit police officer must be ready and able to apprehend not just the numerous sedentary,petty criminals,but also the few who,from time to time,wreak serious harm on the people of philadelphia 
a final concern mentioned in lanning i involved the statistical methods relied upon in some of septa studies.we noted,for example,that a study on arrest rates seemed to be based on disproportionately large numbers of officers with an aerobic capacity over and stated that,if the correlation coefficient of the study was low,the study would be subject to close review.at citing b.upon further review,we are satisfied that the correlation coefficient was sufficiently high to be statistically significant.
we have also examined the other relevant studies in this case for possible deficiencies and conclude that they were sufficiently reliable and in keeping with sound principles of statistical analysis.as scientists well know,it is not uncommon for competent statisticians to interpret data in different ways,sometimes reaching different results.while we concede that there may be some room for there often is in the realm of statistical district court carefully considered the relevant studies and credited them.under the standard that governs our review,we conclude that the district court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.
and so we move more directly to the critical issue before minimum qualifications necessary in terms of aerobic capacity to successfully perform as a septa transit police officer.neither the district court nor the parties have explicitly defined the key phrase minimum qualifications necessary,but a definition is implicit in the parties respective arguments and the district court acceptance of that of septa.septa argued that the run test measures the minimum qualifications necessary because the relevant studies indicate that individuals who fail the test will be much less likely to successfully execute critical policing tasks.for example,the district court credited a study that evaluated the correlation between a successful run time and performance on job standards.the study found that individuals who passed the run test had a success rate on the job standards ranging from to.the success rate of the individuals who failed the run test ranged from to the district court found that such a low rate of success was unacceptable for employees who are regularly called upon to protect the public.in so doing,the district court implicitly defined minimum qualifications necessary as meaning likely to be able to do the job.
plaintiffs argued,however,that within the group that failed the run test,significant numbers of individuals would still be able to perform at least certain critical job tasks.they argued that as long as some of those failing the run test can do the job,the standard can not be classified as a minimum.in essence,plaintiffs proposed that the phrase minimum qualifications necessary means some chance of being able to do the job.under this logic,even if those failing the test had a chance of successfully completing critical job tasks,the test would be too stringent.
we are not saying,as our distinguished brother in dissent suggests we are saying,that more is better.while,of course,a higher aerobic capacity will translate into better field least as to many job tasks which entail physical set an unnecessarily high cutoff score would contravene griggs.it would clearly be unreasonable to require septa applicants to score so highly on the run test that their predicted rate of success be.it is perfectly reasonable,however,to demand a chance of success that is better than to in sum,septa transit police officers and the public they serve should not be required to engage in gambling when it comes to public safety and law enforcement.septa has demonstrated that the cutoff score it established measures the minimum qualifications necessary for successful performance as a septa officer.
the dissent concedes that septa has the right to improve its workforce and does not suggest that that is not being done.instead,the dissent concentrates its efforts on why,in its view,the aerobic capacity cutoff score as an application requirement is wanting,concluding that a fter all has been said and done,one unassailable fact remains.the aerobic capacity cutoff is not required of transit officers before or after they begin policing.dissent at.as for the before,we reject without more the argument that and not be tested until they have graduated from the police academy,perhaps two and years after they first applied to septa indeed,the dissent recognizes but relegates to a footnote the increase in septa costs and the uncertainty in planning and recruitment this would occasion.as for the after,all and now required to take a physical fitness test every six months,another step toward improving the workforce in this connection,it bears mention that septa is unable to discipline incumbents who do not pass the test only because of the patrol officers union challenge,sustained by an arbitrator.with the union blessing,however,septa offers financial incentives to those officers who do pass.
one final note.while it is undisputed that septa mile run test has a disparate impact on women,it is also undisputed that,in addition to those women who could pass the test without training,nearly all the women who trained were able to pass after only a moderate amount of training.it is not,we think,unreasonable to expect that wish to become septa transit officers,and are committed to dealing with issues of public safety on a basis,would take this necessary step.moreover,we do not consider it unreasonable for septa to require applicants,who wish to train to meet the job requirements,to do so before applying in order to demonstrate their commitment to physical fitness.the poor physical condition of septa officers prior to demonstrates that not every officer is willing to make that commitment once he or she is hired.in any event,the training which septa candidates receive does not provide sufficient physical fitness training to bring an unqualified candidate up to the physical standard requirements.
the judgment of the district court will be affirmed 
in lanning southeastern pennsylvania transp,cir hereafter,lanning i,we held that under the civil rights act of,a discriminatory cutoff score on an entry level employment examination must be shown to measure the minimum qualifications necessary for successful performance of the job in question in order to survive a disparate impact challenge.at.the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa requires all applicants for the position of transit police officer to be able to run miles in twelve minutes,which translates into an aerobic capacity of.despite the numerous opinions that have been written in this suit,and an involved and lengthy bench trial that was followed by additional testimony on remand,i do not believe septa is any closer than when we started to demonstrating that the standard that disqualifies of female applicants from even beginning the business necessity standard.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the opinion of my colleagues.
before i explain why septa has not met its burden and why we should therefore reverse the district court decision on remand,see lanning septa,wl,hereafter lanning ii,i think it important to dispose of one concern at the outset.
my disagreement with my colleagues is not about public safety or the importance of safeguarding septa ridership.no rational or informed person can seriously doubt the importance of qualified police officers to a large urban transit system.yet,on remand,the district court expressed the following concern after summarizing much of the evidence that had been offered in support of the aerobic capacity cutoff 
significant gains in apprehensions and deterrence such as those demonstrated here are to be encouraged and supported by the federal courts.the court simply will not condone dilution of readily obtainable physical abilities standards that serve to protect the public safety in order to allow unfit candidates,whether they are male or female,to become septa transit police officers.
lanning ii,wl at.similarly,the majority states septa transit police officers and the public they serve should not be required to engage in gambling when it comes to public safety and law enforcement.majority op.at.i can not stress too strongly that the issue is not now,and never has been,whether septa must jeopardize public safety in order to eliminate the disparate impact that septa concedes the standard visits upon female applicants.rather,the issue continues to be whether septa can justify that cutoff under the business necessity test that is incorporated into title vii by the civil rights act since the business necessity standard takes public safety into consideration,majority op.at citing lanning i,at,applying it here will not endanger the public.
it is uncontested that plaintiffs have established a prima facie case of job discrimination because the cutoff has a disparate impact on females applying to be septa police officers.dothard rawlinson,d.however,that discrimination is permissible if the aerobic capacity represented by that cutoff is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity s k.septa may therefore justify its discriminatory cutoff by demonstrating that anything less jeopardizes public safety.we explained this in lanning there,we stated 
if,for example,septa can show on remand that the inability of a septa transit officer to meet a certain aerobic level would significantly jeopardize public safety,this showing would be relevant to determine if that level is necessary for the successful performance of the job.clearly a septa officer who poses a significant risk to public safety could not be considered to be performing his job successfully.
lanning i,at.accordingly,any suggestion that federal courts are advocating that diminished public safety is the social price that we must pay to eliminate gender discrimination is as unfortunate as it is inaccurate and misleading.despite continuing protestations to the contrary,septa has simply not demonstrated the business necessity of its cutoff though it has had several opportunities to do so.the implication that changing septa cutoff would endanger the public is therefore nothing more than the proverbial red herring.as i shall discuss in greater detail below,the effect of septa aerobic capacity standard on public safety is purely conjectural.
moreover,as i shall also explain,the objective evidence on this record should weigh far more heavily in the balance than the conjecture that septa arguments rest upon.that objective evidence consists of the job performance of a female police applicant who was mistakenly hired although she did not meet the aerobic cutoff when she applied,septa failure to require officers to meet the standard when they first go on duty as police officers,and the fact that incumbent police officers have regularly failed to meet the cutoff with no demonstrable impact on public safety.given this record,septa can not shield its unnecessarily exclusionary job requirements from judicial review by relying on a threat to public safety where none has been demonstrated.
moreover,even if septa had demonstrated the necessary correlation between public safety and the cutoff,the plaintiffs may still prevail if they can show that an alternative employment practice has a less disparate impact and would also serve the employer legitimate business interest.id.at quoting albemarle paper moody,d.in lanning i,we suggested several alternatives that could address septa justifiable concern about the fitness of its police force while mitigating or eliminating the discriminatory impact of the cutoff.
septa could for example abandon the test as a hiring requirement but maintain an incentive program to encourage an increase in the officers aerobic capacities validate a cutoff score for aerobic capacity that measures the minimum capacity necessary to successfully perform the job and maintain incentive programs to achieve even higher aerobic levels or institute a test for excessive levels of aerobic capacity that would exclude of men as well as of women through separate aerobic capacity cutoffs for the different sexes.
lanning i,at.
septa currently uses the aerobic cutoff as an incentive rather than a disqualifier for incumbent transit police as is suggested by the first alternative.there is no evidence that public safety has been compromised by doing that.therefore,i fail to see why assuming that everything septa says about the necessity of the standard is true septa objectives ca be achieved by offering incentives for applicants just as septa now does for incumbent police officers.
there is an even simpler and more effective option that would also further septa objective more than the current method of using the aerobic cutoff.septa could impose the cutoff as a condition of graduating from the police academy rather than as an application qualifier.the period between application and actually becoming a transit police officer is sometimes as long as two and years.if this performance standard is as important to the work of a transit police officer as septa claims,the quality of septa police force would only be enhanced,not weakened,by requiring officers to meet it when they graduate from the academy.
that was one of our suggestions and it is one of the plaintiffs proposals.see lanning i,at.that proposal is eminently reasonable,it has several benefits over septa current application process,and it is a practice that other police forces use in fact,the more vital the cutoff is,the more logical it is to enforce it upon graduation from the police academy rather than when one applies a year or two earlier.doing so would have a less discriminatory impact because it would allow females to complete the application process if they could not run miles in the required time,but it would require them to train to the extent necessary to meet the cutoff before starting on duty.it would also be more consistent with insuring that all officers satisfy the standard that septa claims to be the minimum necessary for the public safety 
the fact that septa does not retest before a new recruit begins patrolling should cause us to be very skeptical about septa claim that the cutoff is necessary to public safety.that skepticism is reinforced by several undisputed facts on this record.
yet,on remand,the district court never even mentioned these options and it appears that septa never attempted to explain why these less discriminatory and more effective alternatives would not adequately address any legitimate concerns.
the district court analysis never focused on the fact that the cutoff is enforced when someone applies for the position of a septa police officer,not when an offer of employment is extended or when an applicant graduates from the police academy and actually goes on the job.all of the studies the district court relied upon purport to correlate success in tasks to fitness level at the time of the task,not at some time prior to hiring and training.however,an offer to hire may be extended as much as two and years after the aerobic running test is administered and the cutoff applied,and there is absolutely no retest before beginning as a septa officer.see lanning southeastern pennsylvania transp,wl.june,and findings of fact and conclusions of law therein hereafter initial fof.accordingly,there is no way for septa to know if even a male incumbent police officer has the aerobic capacity deemed so necessary to the job when he actually begins patrolling.common sense establishes that no matter how quickly and enthusiastically an applicant may be able to scamper one and miles when initially tested,ole man time may have reduced the applicant aerobic output beneath the cutoff at the very point that septa claims it is necessary for public safety.
there has been no no finding by the district fitness level at the time of application is a reliable proxy for fitness level on the job over the ensuing years.on the contrary,as the majority implicitly acknowledges,being able to run miles in minutes prior to training is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being able to run that fast and consequently,according to septa theory,being able to perform various police tasks thereafter.
on the one hand,the majority concedes that nearly all the women who trained were able to pass after only a moderate amount of training,majority at,so the ability to pass without training is not a necessary prerequisite.on the other hand,fitness does not guarantee continued fitness on the job.the failure to establish the required nexus between fitness at the time of application and fitness on the job is a major gap in septa proof.my colleagues in the majority gloss over this gap noting that it is not unreasonable to require women to train in advance,in order to demonstrate their commitment to physical fitness.majority at.however,it is undisputed that septa does not require applicants or incumbents to train in order to demonstrate their commitment to physical fitness.there are two additional problems with the majority reliance on the relevance of applicants demonstrating a commitment to fitness.
first,the district court made no finding that applicants who can run fast are more committed to physical fitness or even more likely to remain fit than someone who may exhibit greater endurance than required for the aerobic cutoff,but not have the speed necessary to satisfy it.moreover,since running is only one of the physical demands made of an applicant,focusing only on it may ignore the commitment of an applicant who can do a greater number of or,or bench press more weight than someone who can run miles in minutes 
second,since men are far more likely than women to be able to pass the running test without training,this commitment rationale imposes an additional discriminatory,that women must possess a demonstrated level of commitment not required of men.given the substantial physical advantage enjoyed by men,a woman who runs miles in just over minutes may thereby demonstrate more commitment to training and fitness than a man who runs the course in just under minutes or minutes flat.yet,septa enforces its cutoff in a manner that would exclude the female in favor of the male,despite the fact that the relative achievement level may demonstrate a greater commitment to fitness on the part of the female 
although the requirement of running miles in minutes and the corresponding cutoff may not appear that daunting a requirement for someone who exercises regularly and is in fairly good condition,it is nevertheless more than certain branches of the united states military demand of incumbents i can understand and appreciate septa argument that its zone system,and its reliance on foot patrols explains why the cutoff is more demanding than the standard set for new york city police.differences between what is required of septa police and new york city transit police perhaps rebut the testimony of former new york city transit police chief,michael,as to the need for septa aerobic standard.he led a significant reduction of crime in new york city transit system.when he testified before the district court as an expert witness in this suit he emphatically rejected the concept of comparing police officers running ability with that of fleeing felons as a job requirement.septa had argued that its officers must have an aerobic capacity at least equal to that of the perpetrator population septa officers may have to chase.chief disagreed.he testified h ow fast you run is not a measure of how good a cop you are.it takes a lot more than just running fast to be a good cop.
septa own experience confirms this.crime has been reduced on septa facilities even though septa does not require incumbent officers to achieve the cutoff.this undermines septa assertion about the relationship between the aerobic cutoff and effective policing,and it corroborates chief view of the cutoff.
although differences between new york city and philadelphia may cast doubt on the chief attempt to assess the value of applying this cutoff to the philadelphia transit system,it does not explain why septa insists upon a more demanding standard than is required of young people training for the amy,navy or marines.yet,septa argues that its standard is the minimum necessary for public safety,and that it is necessary to screen out applicants who fail to meet that standard without regard to whether the standard will be attained after they are hired and without regard to whether incumbent police officers can meet it.
septa insistence that the cutoff satisfies the business necessity test is undermined by the fact that it does not require its incumbent police officers to meet that standard.yet,there is nothing to suggest that public safety has been jeopardized.septa first administered a running test in.septa own internal memoranda document that incumbent transit officers of all ranks have failed septa physical fitness test,initial fof,since septa began testing.
one of plaintiff trial exhibits purports to show that of incumbent officers have failed the aerobic capacity test since it was first administered in.initial fof citing plaintiff exhibit.the district court discounted the probative value of that evidence however,because an individual officer would have been counted a number of times if this officer failed the test a number of times.id.the court concluded,t hus,this evidence is not entitled to much weight.id.
nevertheless,even assuming that the failure rate is somewhat inflated because it fails to adjust for multiple failures of individual incumbents,and even assuming that the failure rate has decreased with time,nothing on this record suggests the dramatic turn around one would have a right to expect if meeting that standard is so necessary to public safety,and septa has the burden of proof here,not plaintiffs.
it is uncontested that,despite septa claim that officers who can not meet the standard endanger public safety,septa has promoted officers who failed the running test,and given commendations to others who failed a component of that test.see initial fof.it is also uncontested that septa has never suspended,reassigned,disciplined or demoted any officer for failing to perform the physical requirements of the job.initial fof it has also promoted officers who could not meet the standard.septa policy of promoting candidates who fail to demonstrate a aerobic capacity is perplexing given the purported importance of that performance criteria.the district court noted 
septa has promoted incumbent officers who have failed some or all of the components of the physical fitness test at any time.since july,the chief of septa transit police department has had the authority to remove candidates from promotional lists for failing to achieve their interim fitness goals.despite the authority to remove officers from the promotional lists,no septa officer has ever been removed from a promotional list for failure to pass physical fitness testing for incumbents.
initial fof.the court attempted to rationalize this apparent contradiction and credit septa with making some effort to consider aerobic capacity when making promotions by noting nevertheless,only ten officers who have failed their physical fitness tests have ever been promoted.id.however,as i have already noted,septa has the burden of proving necessity.accordingly,the fact that a relatively small number of officers have been promoted while failing to satisfy the cutoff is not nearly as probative as the fact that officers who failed were promoted with no resulting impact on public safety.after all,septa obviously believed that those officers could do their jobs effectively,and adequately protect the public or it would not have promoted any of them.
the district court explained that septa failure to discipline transit police who could not meet the standard was due to a union challenge to management unilateral imposition of that requirement on incumbent officers.the union position was sustained by an arbitrator.see lanning ii,wl at.management responded by offering monetary rewards whenever an incumbent officer passed the running test,and by offering to pay for gym memberships to help incumbent officers train to the level necessary to meet the cutoff.id.although the union objections and the resulting arbitration explain why no incumbent was fired for not meeting that cutoff,they do explain why septa has commended and promoted officers who are purportedly so physically unfit that they are unable to perform the minimum job tasks that are now supposed to be so necessary to public safety.it also does not explain why septa could not offer female applicants who do not meet that cutoff the same support it offers male incumbent transit police officers.
the district court concluded that 
the experiences septa had with its incumbent officers serves to further illustrate the importance of requiring incoming officers to meet certain minimum fitness standards,as septa has much less ability to influence its force once they become members of the collective bargaining unit.
lanning ii,wl at.of course,this does not explain why septa does not retest applicants before offering them a position,and it does not even begin to show why the threshold is the minimum necessary for public safety.
we are reminded that septa initiated the policy of retesting incumbent police officers every six months in,but the manner in which the policy is administered undermines septa claim of public safety more than it supports it.the district court concluded that d espite this policy,there was evidence introduced at trial that incumbents are not always retested every six months.lanning ii,wl at.since one job status is not affected by the outcome of the retests,those examinations are merely an adjunct to the system of rewards and encouragement employed for incumbent officers.as i noted above,septa has not explained why it can not create a similar mechanism of reward and encouragement for applicants who are otherwise qualified to become police officers but can not initially demonstrate an aerobic capacity of.
we are told of how crime in and around septa property has been significantly reduced despite the apparent inability of many transit officers to meet the cutoff,and septa inability or unwillingness to enforce it.accordingly,i can only conclude that factors other than the cutoff are responsible for reducing the levels of crime.crediting the cutoff with reducing crime while not requiring incumbents to meet it totally ignores the other steps septa took that explain the reduction in crime.for example 
septa initiated a complete overhaul of the police department to make the subways on the septa system the safest place in the city.this overhaul included the announcement that transit police were to be primarily dedicated to the subway and were not to serve as guards to protect personal or physical property at depots.and septa increased the number of officers from to nearly and introduced a zone concept for the area they patrolled.
lanning ii,wl at 
given the tenuous relationship between aerobic capacity and public safety on this record,it is perhaps not surprising that incumbent officers with an aerobic capacity too low to apply for the job had an arrest rate that was virtually identical to another group of officers who satisfied the cutoff.in lanning i,we noted that officers at less than had average arrests of compared to officers with at least a level who had average arrests of.at.
ironically,serendipity has furnished us with a model that we should not so readily dismiss in assessing the business necessity of the cutoff.at the outset i alluded to an instance where septa mistakenly hired a female applicant who did not meet the aerobic cutoff.that officer was hired because of a clerical error.septa concedes that she did not meet the cutoff when she applied and was therefore not fit to even be considered for the position of septa police officer under septa discriminatory application requirement.that officer performance on a job that she was not qualified to even apply for under the aerobic cutoff is significant indeed.her presence patrolling septa property has apparently not endangered the citizens of philadelphia at all.on the contrary,as the district court originally found 
officer thomas was hired in despite the fact that she did not complete the mile run in minutes and failed the bench press,and components of septa physical fitness test for applicants.officer thomas has gone on to become a decorated officer who has repeatedly been nominated for awards such as officer of the year and officer of the quarter.in fact,septa has commended officer thomas for her outstanding performance as a police officer.moreover,officer thomas serves as one of septa two defensive tactics instructors 
lanning southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority,wl at,fof.june.
i realize,of course,that the job experience of a single officer is not statistically significant in evaluating the relevance of a standard that is supposed to apply to an entire applicant pool and at least in theory an entire police force.however,i do not offer this officer job performance to counter the statistical record.rather,i the officer performance is highly relevant to measuring the necessity of the aerobic cutoff in the context of this entire record.her performance is consistent with other evidence that undermines septa justification for gender discrimination.
one of septa experts,bernard siskin,admitted that correlating arrests and aerobic capacity was not a good way to predict the quality of an officer policing.in fact,a study found that individuals with an aerobic capacity of made more arrests for serious crimes than individuals with an aerobic capacity of and,vol xii at.accordingly,i question the district court conclusion that aerobic capacity is an important factor in successfully making arrests.op.at.if it is,some of the same officers that septa has promoted and awarded and given commendations to should not be patrolling philadelphia transit system.
the district court approval of the standard in large measure rests upon its acceptance of siskin expert opinion.see lanning ii,wl at to.although siskin did testify that higher aerobic capacity equated with higher arrests,he did not purport to correlate the cutoff with any satisfactory minimum level of policing.we explained this in lanning i where we stated 
siskin testified that in view of the linear relationship between aerobic capacity and the arrest parameters,any cutoff score can be justified since higher aerobic capacity levels will get you more field performance,more is better.see lanning,wl at.under the district court understanding of business necessity,which requires only that a cutoff score be readily justifiable,septa,as well as any other employer whose jobs entail any level of physical capability,could employ an unnecessarily high cutoff score on its physical abilities entrance exam in an effort to exclude virtually all women by justifying this facially neutral yet discriminatory practice on the theory that more is better.this result contravenes griggs and demonstrates why,under griggs,a discriminatory cutoff score must be shown to measure the minimum qualifications necessary to perform successfully the job in question.
at footnote omitted.yet,the inquiry has advanced no further following remand.i still can not help but conclude that all of the additional testimony that the district court heard after lanning i,did nothing more than establish that more is better.yet,the majority insists that there is adequate support for this cutoff now.my colleagues argue 
while,of course,a higher aerobic capacity will translate into better field least as to many job tasks which entail physical set an unnecessarily high cutoff score would contravene griggs.it would clearly be unreasonable to require septa applicants to score so highly on the run test that their predicted rate of success be.it is perfectly reasonable,however,to demand a chance of success that is better than to.
majority op.at.
reasonable though it may be,the question remains,what cutoff is necessary to ensure public safety and effective policing where between the purportedly reasonable level of to the majority approves of,and the unreasonable level of it disapproves of,does griggs allow septa to draw a line furthermore,why is to reasonable,and why is unreasonable the questions remain unanswered.
the inquiry would be furthered if septa could point to some objective basis for defining a cutoff or aerobic threshold.however,the threshold seems to have been plucked from the air by davis after septa contacted him and asked him to assist in improving the quality of transit police officers.davis testified that he initially sought the advice of twenty experienced septa officers designated as subject matter experts or smes to determine the level of physical exertion they thought was required of transit police officers.the smes told him that they thought a septa officer should be able to run a mile in full gear in minutes.however,davis rejected that cutoff because it was too low.he believed nearly anyone in the general public could satisfy that standard.lanning i,at he rejected a standard of because it was too high.it would have had a draconian effect on women applicants.id.he therefore apparently decided upon a cutoff of because it was not too high,it was not too low it was just right.but under griggs,it is not permissible to select a discriminatory employment test in the same manner that goldilocks chooses which bed to sleep in or which bowl of porridge to eat.
the cutoff was not selected based upon the requirements of the job.rather,it was based upon the expert apparently mistaken conclusion that that level would not exclude women.see fof.green,d at describing cutoff score chosen to have less impact than initially selected score as arbitrarily established.at the very least,he concluded that the resulting rate of exclusion was acceptable reasonable because it did not have a draconian impact.
in lanning i,we cautioned 
the danger of allowing an employer to carry its burden by relying simply upon an expert invalidated judgment as to an appropriate cutoff score in a testing device is illustrated by this case.
at.accepting the cutoff as being the minimum level consistent with business necessity on this record 
disregards the teachings of griggs,albemarle and dothard in which the supreme court made clear that judgment alone is insufficient to validate an employer discriminatory practices n owhere in its extensive opinion did the district court consider whether davis cutoff reflects the minimum aerobic capacity necessary to perform successfully the job of septa transit police officer.
at.the only explanation of the source of this standard comes from davis testimony during the first trial.it is not reassuring.there,the following exchange occurred between davis and counsel for the plaintiffs 
is it correct that you and henderson used your own intellectual creativity in coming up with your measures of success 
a.a nice way of saying it,yes.
vol.iii at emphasis added.none of the post hoc justifications for the cutoff suggest that it rests on any firmer ground than that response suggests.
septa made no effort on remand to empirically establish the minimum aerobic capacity necessary to perform as a transit officer.it merely attempted to justify the figure arbitrarily selected by davis as a compromise between a draconian standard that no woman could satisfy on the one hand,and a lilliputian one that anyone could satisfy on the other.as appellants point out,r ather than attempt to objectively determine a minimum cut score,or whether any was justified septa experts merely sought to measure the effect of the standard previously selected by davis.brief of appellants at.
the inquiry was further handicapped on remand by the district court refusal to reexamine its original findings.in lanning i,we cited numerous concerns with the various studies that were relied upon to uphold the cutoff,and expressed concern with the district court refusal to consider the undisputed evidence that a number of incumbent officers were performing satisfactorily even though they could not meet the standard.we noted 
the district court rejected as irrelevant the plaintiffs evidence that incumbent officers had failed the physical fitness test yet successfully performed the job and that other police forces function well without an aerobic capacity admission test.see lanning,wl at.under the standard implicit in griggs and incorporated into the act,this evidence tends to show that septa cutoff score for aerobic capacity does not correlate with the minimum qualifications necessary to perform successfully the job of septa transit officer.accordingly,this evidence is relevant and should be considered by the district court on remand.
at.we allowed the district court to exercise its own discretion on remand as to whether to consider additional evidence regarding the necessity of the cutoff.we also noted our concern regarding the court failure to consider evidence that undermined septa claim of business necessity.
nevertheless,on remand,the district court proclaimed f rom the outset that it would not disturb its prior factual findings in this case,although it did allow further development of the record.in other words,it was willing to accept additional testimony to support its conclusion,but was not willing to reexamine the decision that we reversed in light of any new evidence offered on remand.the district court correctly noted that the sole question to be resolved on remand is whether or not septa has proven that its aerobic capacity standard is the minimum necessary for the successful performance of the job of septa transit police officer.however,it then stated that the evidence at the first trial,both separately and in combination with the evidence adduced on remand,clearly met this test 
the district court based its conclusion that any standard less than would result in officers who were a danger to themselves,other officers,and the public at large,and who were unable to effectively fight and deter crime on the following 
davis calculations of the aerobic capacity required to perform essential tasks the siskin arrest studies,including the analysis of performance differences between those officers always at versus those never at moffatt initial study on work output decrements associated with aerobic capacities below septa cutpoint and septa most recent studies by davis and henderson,which taken together more than provides an appropriate empirical basis for demonstrating that septa cutpoint is already set at the minimum.
whether the analyses and studies provided by septa experts are sufficient to support this finding turns on whether they were reasonably calculated to measure minimum requirements,whether they fairly corresponded to actual job requirements and whether they fairly determined minimum performance standards for those requirements in assessing this,we must remember that the employer,septa,has the burden of proof as a matter of express congressional policy,and that that policy is based upon a recognition of the very real social harm resulting from the disparity that the employer must justify consequently,the federal courts have a heightened responsibility to scrutinize the employer proffered justification 
finally,the equal employment opportunity commission guidelines also call for heightened scrutiny where there is a severe disparate impact,low statistical correlation,or on limited aspects of job performance.each of these are present here.see b.the district court failure to heed those guidelines,or to require that septa studies conform to specific validation criteria,provides an independent justification for reversing the district court 
given all that i have set forth,i do not think there is any need to dwell on the specifics of the various statistical studies or methodologies that have been summoned to support the cutoff.after all has been said and done,after all the studies have been tabulated,all of the regression analyses analyzed,and all of the numbers fed into all of the software on all of the computers,on all of the experts desks one unassailable fact remains.the aerobic capacity is not required of transit officers before or after they begin policing.rather,it is used to disqualify applicants even though the application may be submitted as much as two and years before graduation from the police academy and employment as a police officer.moreover,as i have noted at length above,once officers actually begin protecting septa riders and property,they do not have to demonstrate or maintain any minimum aerobic capacity.yet,septa insists upon arguing that this aerobic cutoff has a very precise,demonstrable,correlation to public safety,and that it therefore supports the gender discrimination that septa admits results from it.
even though i do not think it necessary to attempt a statistical exegesis to illustrate why septa has not demonstrated a business necessity for using the cutoff as an application requirement,i can not conclude without commenting on one particularly fascinating and perhaps illuminating study that septa commissioned to support the cutoff.although my colleagues criticize an analysis that poke s a hole here or there in one or more of the district court extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law,majority op.at,i can not allow the sheer extent of the district court opinion to substitute for the proof required under griggs.accordingly,i must take one specific poke that i believe exposes the hole that septa business justification should have fallen through.
as noted above,septa wanted to determine the aerobic capacity of perpetrators that transit police might have to pursue in order to determine the validity of the aerobic cutoff.as part of its inquiry it attempted to measure the aerobic output necessary to apprehend the average perpetrator.of course,any good study begins with a representative sample,and the perpetrator study was no exception.accordingly,davis recruited a group of subjects in order to get an idea of the aerobic capacity necessary for transit police officers to chase and apprehend them.however,there was one little problem with the study.it seems that davis recruited his subjects at the university of maryland track while the university ncaa division i track team was there.
the resulting sample contained university of maryland track stars,high school track stars,other college athletes,and high school running backs who had been accepted to play football at major colleges after plaintiffs counsel complained about the skewed sample,the results for the members of the university of maryland track team were factored out,and the results were analyzed without including their times.this reduced the sample to subjects of whom only a mere were trained athletes,and four were nonathletes moreover,the high school runners were not your average high school track star.the group remaining after correcting for the members of the university of maryland track team included high school runners who were winners of regional,state and sometimes national races.iv at emphasis added.landy characterized their times as staggering.his reaction to suggesting that the aerobic performance of such a group represented the population that septa police might have to chase was appropriate.he stated i t just stretches anything that i could imagine,to imagine that of septa perpetrators are world class athletes.id.at.
although this is not your usual representative sample,it was representative enough to form part of the justification for the cutoff.incredibly,the only justification davis offered for basing his study on such an athletically talented group of trained athletes was that athletes are part of the general population and therefore part of the population that uses septa.see appellants br.at 
it is difficult to imagine a more graphic demonstration of what can result when studies seek to justify a standard rather than objectively define one.yet,that is what happened here of course,this,by itself,is not fatal to the cutoff.it is,however,illustrative of the concern we expressed in lanning i,and it is also illustrative of why the current cutoff,though perhaps reasonable in the eyes of some,can not be seen as necessary when viewed through the lens of title vii.
prior to today decision,it was established in this circuit,as it remains established in others,that a job requirement that has a disparate impact based upon gender could only be upheld if the relationship between the discriminatory requirement was so closely related to the essential of a given job that it could be justified as a business necessity.today,in upholding a discriminatory application process based only upon a colorable claim of business necessity,we retreat from that standard while purporting to apply it.yet,in enacting the civil rights act of,i believe congress meant exactly what it said discrimination in the name of business necessity must truly be necessary.no such necessity has been established here.
septa can not have its cake and eat it too.the aerobic cutoff is either so vital to public safety that it is a business necessity in which case,septa can not require it only of applicants without showing that the failure to require it of incumbents has had a negative impact on their performance as police officers.if,on the other hand,the relationship between public safety and the cutoff is as tenuous as suggested by septa failure to consider it when making job offers,promotions or commendations,then septa can not continue to use justifiable concerns about public safety as a boogeyman to support the admittedly discriminatory cutoff it uses to screen applicants.accordingly,i must respectfully dissent from the decision of my colleagues.
this case was consolidated before the district court with united states southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority.the united states filed a notice of appeal from the final judgment now under review,with the appeal docketed at.on october,the united states moved to dismiss its appeal pursuant to fed.b.that motion was granted on october.
although there is some dispute over the precise percentage of arrests that have required substantial aerobic exertion,the evidence shows that,at the very least,around one in ten arrests,or ten percent,have so required.
arrests for serious crimes have similarly accounted for around one in ten arrests.
the district court also credited studies which indicate that once septa officers reach suspects,they often must engage in physical struggles which require substantial aerobic capacity.the court further noted that septa officers must engage in at least one aerobic encounter during the course of his or her duties every month,either as an emergency assist or running backup.wl,at.these findings support the conclusion that aerobic capacity is an important factor in successfully making arrests.
the district court cited numerous other studies that offer similar results.in one such study,of those passing septa run test met minimum job standards,while only of those failing did.another study showed that of those passing the test could carry out an emergency assist,while only of the failing group were able to do so.the consideration that the district court gave to these studies lays to rest plaintiffs claim that the cutoff time was merely the product of the judgment of septa experts.as we noted in lanning i,a business necessity standard that wholly defers to an employer judgment as to what is desirable in an employee is completely inadequate.id.at emphasis added.the factual record here,however,clearly demonstrates that septa experts set the run time cutoff at minutes for objective reasons,with the studies showing that the projected rate of success of job applicants dropped off markedly for those who ran miles in over minutes.
even in other studies where those failing the test had higher predicted rates of success on job tasks,the rates were still only around.
of course,yet another step in improving the performance of incumbents would be to require a physical fitness test not only upon application but
