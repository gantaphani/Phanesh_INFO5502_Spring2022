plaintiff eric deravin,iii deravin,a former employee of defendant new york city department of corrections doc asserts claims of race discrimination and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et.deravin alleges that defendant bemard kerik kerik,the former commissioner of the doc,blocked his promotion to the position of deputy warden,because deravin is,and because deravin successfully defended himself against sexual harassment charges filed by jeanette pinero pinero,a doc corrections officer whom deravin contends was romantically involved with kerik.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,judge dismissed deravin claims pursuant to.c.the district court concluded that deravin race discrimination claim had not been adequately exhausted,because the claim was not reasonably related to the national origin and retaliation claims originally raised in deravin equal employment opportunity commission eeoc complaint.as for deravin retaliation claim,the district court ruled that defending oneself against charges of discrimination does not qualify as protected activity under title vii.on appeal,deravin challenges both of these rulings.because we find that deravin administratively exhausted his race discrimination claim,and,further,because we hold today that defending oneself against charges of discrimination by testifying in a title vii proceeding qualifies as protected activity under a,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
deravin has been an employee of the doc for over twenty years.in october,deravin was promoted to the position of captain and,in august,deravin was again promoted to the position of assistant deputy warden.in january,as soon as he became eligible,deravin applied for but was denied further promotion to the position of deputy warden.between january and april,deravin applied five more times for promotion to deputy warden.although he was recommended and approved each time by the chief of his department,deravin successive applications for promotion were also unsuccessful.deravin contends that kerik deliberately blocked his promotion to deputy warden,and that kerik instead promoted far less qualified applicants,including applicants with only high school diplomas or geds while deravin had a in criminal justice management as well as a master degree in public administration.
deravin alleges that kerik refused to promote him for two discriminatory reasons because there was a preferential policy within the doc to promote white employees,and kerik did not want to promote an employee to a position of authority and responsibility and because deravin had successfully defended himself against false sexual harassment charges brought by pinero,a doc officer whom kerik had purportedly dated after deravin filed a complaint with the eeoc,he was finally promoted to the position of deputy warden,on his sixth try,in june.
in his eeoc complaint,deravin checked only the boxes marked retaliation and national origin as the grounds for his discrimination claim.the written description of claim also focuses on kerik alleged retaliation as well as on the allegedly preferential treatment given to doc employees who are members of the emerald society due to their status.deravin explains if you look at those members who have been given promotions and preferential treatment,you will see the majority are members of the emerald society.both the retaliation i have experienced as well as this ongoing preferential treatment is in violation of the civil rights act of.
after receiving a notice of charge from the eeoc,the doc investigated deravin claims.in june,the doc issued a position statement denying deravin claims of discrimination.as part of its investigation,the doc reviewed a list of all applicants for promotion to the position of deputy warden from january to june,specifying the race of each applicant.the doc noted at the conclusion of its analysis,that out of the successful candidates 
three were male hispanics,seven were males,four were females,four were male italians,eight were male irish,and one was male greek.there were a total of promotions.there is no disproportion in promotions of irish descent as alleged by the complainant.therefore,the allegations made by the complainant that members of the emerald society were given preferential treatment and promotions are unsubstantiated.
the eeoc issued deravin a letter in august,and deravin filed this present action pro se in october,asserting claims of race discrimination and retaliation under title vii.defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the complaint.the matter was referred by the district court to magistrate judge kevin fox who recommended that defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings be granted.
by written order issued on may,the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge.the district court agreed that deravin had failed to administratively exhaust his race discrimination claim,because nothing in the eeoc complaint suggests that defendants discriminated against plaintiff on account of his race.the district court also rejected deravin explanation that the eeoc counselor who helped him fill out the complaint form erroneously failed to specify race as a basis for deravin discrimination claim.although deravin submitted two letters dated april,and may,in which he requested that the eeoc rectify the alleged administrative error,the district court characterized the may,letter as a disingenuous,attempt to remedy the deficiencies in the administrative complaint.the district court noted that the may,letter was sent months after deravin received his right to sue letter from the eeoc as well as after defendants filed their answer notifying deravin that they intended to argue that his claims are barred to the extent that the allegations were not contained in his eeoc charge.the district court also noted that there was no evidence that the letter had actually been sent to the eeoc nor was there any evidence confirming that deravin had worked with an eeoc counselor in filing his administrative complaint.
in analyzing deravin retaliation claim,the district court further agreed with the magistrate judge,concluding that defending oneself against charges of discrimination does not qualify as protected activity under title vii.the district court reasoned to be protected activity,plaintiff himself must have taken some action to protest or oppose illegal discrimination.because plaintiff has not alleged in the complaint that he engaged in any such activity,he can not make out a claim for retaliation,even if the court assumes all inferences in his favor.
accordingly,the district court dismissed deravin claims,and this timely appeal followed.

as a precondition to filing a title vii claim in federal court,a plaintiff must first pursue available administrative remedies and file a timely complaint with the eeoc.see fitzgerald henderson,cir,cert.denied,d legnani alitalia linee aeree italiane,cir per curiam.we have recognized,however,that claims that were not asserted before the eeoc may be pursued in a subsequent federal court action if they are reasonably related to those that were filed with the agency.legnani,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
