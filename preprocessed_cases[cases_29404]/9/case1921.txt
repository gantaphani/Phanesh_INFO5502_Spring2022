the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of section a ii of the public safety article of the maryland code,to the extent that it conditions eligibility for a permit to carry,wear,or transport a handgun in public on having good and substantial reason to do so.necessary to the entry of the court injunction was its trailblazing pronouncement that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of extends outside the home,as well as its determination that such right is impermissibly burdened by maryland requirement.see woollard sheridan,d.because we disagree with the court conclusion that the requirement can not pass constitutional muster,we reverse the judgment without needlessly demarcating the reach of the second amendment.
under its permitting scheme,maryland obliges a person to have a permit issued before the person carries,wears,or transports a handgun,pub.safety.such permits are not needed,however,by persons in numerous specified situations,including those who are wearing,carrying,and transporting handguns in their own homes and businesses or on other real estate that they own or lease.see,crim.law b.maryland statutory permit exceptions also extend to the following 
members of law enforcement and the military on active assignment 
persons moving handguns to and from places of legal purchase and sale,to and from bona fide repair shops,and between personal residences and businesses 
persons engaged in target shoots and practices,sport shooting events,hunting and trapping,firearms and hunter safety classes sponsored by the department of natural resources,and dog obedience training classes and shows 
gun collectors participating in public and private exhibitions 
supervisory employees armed with handguns in the course of their employment and within the confines of the business establishment,when so authorized by the establishment owner or manager 
boaters equipped with signal pistols and other visual distress signals approved by the united states coast guard and 
persons effecting surrenders of their handguns.
see id.b.where a permit is mandated,a permitless person risks criminal penalties by wear ing,carry ing,or transport ing a handgun,whether concealed or open,on or about the person or in a vehicle.id.a i ii.those penalties begin with imprisonment for a term of thirty days to three years,or a fine of to,or both.id.c i.
handgun permits are issued by the secretary of the maryland state police or the secretary designee.see,pub.safety d e.the secretary must issue a permit upon making enumerated findings,including that the applicant is an adult without a disqualifying criminal record,alcohol or drug addiction,or propensity for violence.id.a i.pursuant to the requirement,permit eligibility also necessitates the secretary finding,following an investigation,that the applicant 
has good and substantial reason to wear,carry,or transport a handgun,such as a finding that the permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger.
id.a ii.the secretary has assigned permitting responsibility to the handgun permit unit,which determines,inter alia,whether the applicant reasons for seeking a permit are good and substantial,whether the applicant has any alternative available to him for protection other than a handgun permit,and whether the permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution for the applicant against apprehended danger.see regs.g,l,o.
the handgun permit unit has identified four primary categories under which an applicant may demonstrate good and substantial reason to obtain a handgun permit 
for business activities,either at the business owner request or on behalf of an employee for regulated professions security guard,private detective,armored car driver,and special police officer for assumed risk professions,judge,police officer,public defender,prosecutor,or correctional officer and for personal protection.
regarding the first three of those categories,the good and substantial reason is usually apparent from the business activity or profession itself.id.at.as for the fourth category personal protection the permit unit considers whether the applicant needs a handgun permit as a safeguard against apprehended danger.id.at.
the handgun permit unit is guided by precedent of the court of special appeals of maryland,recognizing that whether there is apprehended danger to the applicant is an objective inquiry,and that apprehended danger can not be established by,inter alia,a vague threat or a general fear of liv ing in a dangerous society.scherr handgun permit review,quoting snowden handgun permit review.that same precedent,as the permit unit interprets it,caution s the unit against relying exclusively on apprehended threats.explaining that failure to meet the apprehended threat criterion is not dispositive.so,the permit unit examines such factors as 
the nearness or likelihood of a threat or presumed threat whether the threat can be verified whether the threat is particular to the applicant,as opposed to the average citizen if the threat can be presumed to exist,what is the basis for the presumption and the length of time since the initial threat occurred.
id.the permit unit treats those factors as nonexhaustive,however,and takes the applicant entire situation into account when considering whether a good and substantial reason exists.id.
an initial handgun permit expires on the last day of the holder birth month following years after the date the permit is issued,and may be renewed for successive periods of years each if,at the time of an application for renewal,the applicant possesses the qualifications for the issuance of a permit,pub.safety a b.an applicant denied a permit may request informal review by the secretary or immediately appeal to the handgun permit review board appointed by the governor.id.b,b.in the event the appeal is denied by the permit review board,an applicant may seek further review in the maryland state courts.id.e.
on july,raymond woollard and the second amendment foundation,together,the appellees,initiated this action in the district of maryland pursuant to,asserting,inter alia,that maryland requirement for obtaining a handgun permit contravenes the second amendment.the appellees complaint,as well as their subsequent amended complaint of january,named the secretary as a defendant,together with three members of the handgun permit review board collectively,the state 
adjudicating the parties for summary judgment,the district court explained that this action was prompted by the state denial in of appellee woollard request for a second renewal of a handgun permit originally granted in and renewed in.see woollard,d at.woollard,who resides on a farm in a remote part of baltimore county,had obtained the permit after a harrowing home invasion 
on christmas eve,woollard was at home with his wife,children,and grandchildren when an intruder shattered a window and broke into the house.the intruder was kris lee abbott,woollard.abbott,who was high on drugs and intent on driving into baltimore city to buy more,was looking for his wife car keys.woollard grabbed a shotgun and trained it on abbott,but abbott wrested the shotgun away.woollard son restored order by pointing a second gun at abbott.woollard wife called the police,who took hours to arrive.
id.at.abbott,the,received a sentence of probation for the christmas eve incident,but was subsequently incarcerated for probation violations.id.woollard permit renewal came shortly after abbott was released from prison.id.in,however,the secretary via the handgun permit unit and the handgun permit review board refused woollard a second renewal because he failed to satisfy the requirement.id.at.
the handgun permit review board decision of november,reflected that woollard proffered solely the christmas eve incident in support of his request for a second renewal,as evidence that such a renewal was necessary as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger though he acknowledged that he had not had any contact with his in the seven years since the incident.the decision also observed that,despite being advised that such proof was required in the circumstances of his renewal application,woollard did not submit documented threats or incidents that had occurred in the last three years,nor did he provide documentation to verify threats occurring beyond his residence,where he can already legally carry a handgun.id.accordingly,the permit review board concluded that woollard had not demonstrated a good and substantial reason to wear,carry,or transport a handgun as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger,and upheld the permit unit denial of a second permit renewal.id.at.instead of employing the state court appeal process provided by maryland law,woollard elected to join with appellee second amendment foundation in this federal action,challenging the constitutionality of the requirement and asserting jurisdiction under and 
the district court credited the appellees claim that the requirement is facially violative of the second amendment,and thus that woollard,separate and apart from any concern he may have regarding abbott,is entitled to wear and carry a handgun for general.see woollard,d at.in so ruling,the district court br oke ground that our superiors have not tread,proclaiming that the second amendment right recognized by the supreme court in district of columbia heller,d the right of individuals to possess and carry firearms in case of confrontation is a right that extends beyond the home.see united states masciandaro,cir wilkinson,writing for the court as to part recognizing that the supreme court left open the question of heller applicability outside the home environment.
notably,the district court gave considerable attention to our masciandaro decision.there,masciandaro challenged his conviction of carrying or possessing a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle within a national park area,in contravention of b,on the ground that the second amendment,as construed in heller,guaranteed to him the right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation and thus protected him from prosecution under b for exercising that right in a national park area.masciandaro,at.judge niemeyer,writing only for himself,posited that there is a plausible reading of heller that the second amendment provides a right to possess a loaded handgun for outside the home,at least in some form.id.at niemeyer,writing separately on this part.judge wilkinson wrote for the majority of the panel,however,that it was unnecessary to explore in masciandaro case the question of whether and to what extent the second amendment right recognized in heller applies outside the home rendering it the prudent and respectful course to await direction from the supreme court itself.id.at,wilkinson,writing for the court as to part.that was so because the panel members unanimously agreed,by judge niemeyer opinion for the court,that even assuming the heller right extended beyond the home,b pass ed constitutional muster under the applicable standard intermediate scrutiny.id.at.
in the present case,although the district court acknowledged judge wilkinson admonition that one should venture into the unmapped reaches of second amendment jurisprudence only upon necessity and only then by small degree,the court deemed itself obliged to determine whether maryland broad restriction on handgun possession outside the home burdens any second amendment right at all.woollard,d at quoting masciandaro,at wilkinson,writing for the court as to part.guided by judge niemeyer separate opinion in masciandaro,as well as signposts left by heller and other recent precedent,the district court concluded that the individual right to possess and carry weapons for is not limited to the home.see id.at.purporting to apply intermediate scrutiny,the court then recognized that the requirement is undergirded by a substantial governmental interest in protecting public safety and preventing crime,but determined that t he maryland statute failure lies in the overly broad means by which it seeks to advance this undoubtedly legitimate end.id.at see also id.at find ing that maryland requirement of a good and substantial reason for issuance of a handgun permit is insufficiently tailored to the state interest in public safety and crime prevention,and impermissibly infringes the right to keep and bear arms 
the district court thus awarded summary judgment to the appellees,see woollard sheridan,cv,ecf,and permanently enjoined enforcement of the requirement,see woollard brown,cv,ecf.after the state noted this appeal,the district court dissolved a preliminary stay of its judgment and denied the state request for a stay pending appeal.see woollard brown,cv.july,ecf.nevertheless,on august,we entered our own stay pending appeal and expedited the appellate proceedings,over which we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see fop lodge prince george,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the record shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
consistently with the summary judgment standard,our review of a decision granting an injunction is de novo where the contested issue is a question of law.see bacon city of richmond,cir.that is,although decisions pertaining to injunctive relief normally are reviewed solely for abuse of discretion in applying the injunction standard,we review such a decision de novo where it rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law,and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance.carolina tools,int l tool supply,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.

two years after issuing its heller decision,in mcdonald city of chicago,d,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of municipal bans in chicago and one of its suburbs on the possession of handguns in the home.on account of the similarities between those bans and the district of columbia prohibition struck down in heller,the mcdonald defendants were left to argue that their laws are constitutional because the second amendment has no application to the states.see mcdonald.at.the court recognized,however,that the second amendment right is fully applicable to the states,and reiterated heller holding that the second amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of.id.at.accordingly,a considerable degree of uncertainty remains as to the scope of the heller right beyond the home and the standards for determining whether and how the right can be burdened by governmental regulation.united states masciandaro,cir see also kachalsky county of westchester,cir what we know from heller and mcdonald is that second amendment guarantees are at their zenith within the home.what we do not know is the scope of that right beyond the home and the standards for determining when and how the right can be regulated by a government.citation omitted.

as we have recognized,however,we are not obliged to impart a definitive ruling at the first step of the chester inquiry.and indeed,we and other courts of appeals have sometimes deemed it prudent to instead resolve challenges to firearm prohibitions at the second step including where the challenge focuses on an prohibition.masciandaro is just one example of such an incidence.see also,rifle ass of,at although we are inclined to uphold the challenged federal laws banning the sale of firearms to persons under the age of at step one of our analytical framework,in an abundance of caution,we proceed to step two.we ultimately conclude that the challenged federal laws pass constitutional muster even if they implicate the second amendment guarantee.united states mahin,cir declining mahin invitation to recognize that second amendment protections apply outside the home and extend to persons subject to domestic protective orders,because we could assume mahin engaged in activity which implicates the second amendment and yet uphold his conviction.but kachalsky,at although the supreme court cases applying the second amendment have arisen only in connection with prohibitions on the possession of firearms in the home,the court analysis suggests that the amendment must have some application in the very different context of the public possession of firearms.our analysis proceeds on this assumption.footnote omitted 
we hew to a judicious course today,refraining from any assessment of whether maryland requirement for obtaining a handgun permit implicates second amendment protections.that is,we merely assume that the heller right exists outside the home and that such right of appellee woollard has been infringed.we are free to make that assumption because the requirement passes constitutional muster under what we have deemed to be the applicable standard intermediate scrutiny.
in masciandaro,we announced that intermediate scrutiny applies to laws that burden any right to keep and bear arms outside of the home.see at explaining that we assume that any law that would burden the fundamental,core right of in the home by a citizen would be subject to strict scrutiny.but,as we move outside the home,firearm rights have always been more limited,because public safety interests often outweigh individual interests in accord kachalsky,at because our tradition so clearly indicates a substantial role for state regulation of the carrying of firearms in public,we conclude that intermediate scrutiny is appropriate in this case.as explained herein,the state has satisfied the intermediate scrutiny standard,in that it has demonstrated that the requirement for obtaining a maryland handgun permit,as applied to appellee woollard,is reasonably adapted to a substantial governmental interest.see masciandaro,at.
we begin with the issue of whether the governmental interest asserted by the state constitutes a substantial one.the state explains that,by enacting the handgun permitting scheme,including the requirement,the general assembly endeavored to serve maryland concomitant interests in protecting public safety and preventing crime particularly violent crime committed with handguns.such purpose is reflected in codified legislative findings that 
the number of violent crimes committed in the state has increased alarmingly in recent years 
a high percentage of violent crimes committed in the state involves the use of handguns 
the result is a substantial increase in the number of deaths and injuries largely traceable to the carrying of handguns in public places by criminals 
current law has not been effective in curbing the more frequent use of handguns in committing crime and 
additional regulations on the wearing,carrying,and transporting of handguns are necessary to preserve the peace and tranquility of the state and to protect the rights and liberties of the public.
crim.law.the language of those findings,adopted in,was derived without substantive change from former article,section a of the maryland code,which dates back to.
the general assembly findings are buttressed by more recent evidence proffered by the state in these proceedings the state evidence reflects that,although there has been a significant improvement over past violent crime,homicide,and robbery totals,maryland had the eighth highest violent crime rate,the third highest homicide rate,and the second highest robbery rate of any state in.over the course of that year,of all homicides by firearm were committed with handguns,and handguns were the weapon of choice for robberies and carjackings.id.at see also id.at explaining that h andguns are the weapon of choice for criminal activity in baltimore because they are small,relatively lightweight,easy to carry and conceal,easy to load and fire,deadly at short range,and ideal for surprise attacks.furthermore,handguns have persisted as the largest threat to the lives of maryland law enforcement officers.id.at recounting that,of the maryland law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty from,causes,or died as the result of intentional gunfire,usually from a handgun.
in these circumstances,we can easily appreciate maryland impetus to enact measures aimed at protecting public safety and preventing crime,and we readily conclude that such objectives are substantial governmental interests.see,schenck pro choice network of,d referring to the significant governmental interest in public safety united states salerno,d characterizing the government general interest in preventing crime as compelling united states chapman,cir relying on schenck and salerno in holding that reducing domestic gun violence is a substantial governmental objective masciandaro,at same in concluding that the government has a substantial interest in providing for the safety of individuals who visit and make use of the national parks.the district court itself recognized that,b eyond peradventure,public safety and the prevention of crime are substantial,indeed compelling,government interests.woollard,d at.
for their part,the appellees concede that a compelling government interest in public safety generally exists,but they maintain that no legitimate government interest is at stake here,because the state can not have an interest in suppressing a fundamental right including what the appellees assert,and we assume,is the second amendment right of,responsible citizens to carry handguns in public for the purpose of.see br.of appellees see also mcdonald.at declaring that the framers and ratifiers of the fourteenth amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty the appellees would have us place the right to arm oneself in public on equal footing with the right to arm oneself at home,necessitating that we apply strict scrutiny in our review of the requirement.
unfortunately for the appellees,their argument is foreclosed by our precedent.first,in chester,we rejected the proposition that we must apply strict scrutiny whenever a law impinges upon a fundamental right.at employing intermediate,rather than strict,scrutiny in chester second amendment challenge to ban on firearm possession by domestic violence misdemeanants.then,ruling in masciandaro that intermediate scrutiny applies to laws burdening the assumed right to carry firearms in public,we recognized a longstanding distinction bear ing directly on the level of scrutiny applicable.at.the appellees therefore do not dissuade us from applying intermediate scrutiny,or from concluding that maryland interests in protecting public safety and preventing crime satisfy the significant governmental interest aspect of the intermediate scrutiny standard 
we thus turn to the question of whether the requirement,as applied to appellee,is reasonably adapted to maryland significant interests.that is,we must decide if the state has demonstrated that there is a reasonable fit between the requirement and the governmental objectives of protecting public safety and preventing crime.see chester,at.importantly,the state must show a fit that is reasonable,not perfect.united states carter,cir quoting marzzarella,at.that test is satisfied if maryland interests are substantially served by enforcement of the requirement.see id.there is no necessity either that the requirement be the least intrusive means of achieving the relevant government objective s,or that there be no burden whatsoever on woollard second amendment right.see masciandaro,at.
at the outset of our reasonable fit inquiry,we must consider the precise contours of maryland handgun permitting scheme.see chapman,at citing united states staten,cir.under that scheme,even without a permit,woollard may wear,carry,and transport handguns not only in his own home and on his personal and business properties,but also in many public places.see,crim.law b.for example,woollard may move handguns to and from bona fide repair shops and places of legal purchase and sale.id.b.woollard may also wear,carry,and transport handguns if he engages in target shoots and practices,sport shooting events,hunting and trapping,specified firearms and hunter safety classes,and gun exhibitions.id.b.
nevertheless,absent good and substantial reason to do so,woollard can not carry handguns in other public places where a permit is mandated.see,pub.safety a ii.woollard could satisfy the requirement by showing that he needs a permit for business activities,or because he is engaged in a regulated profession such as security guard or an profession such as correctional officer.see.otherwise,woollard could prove what he failed to substantiate in that a permit is necessary as a reasonable precaution against apprehended danger,pub.safety a ii.
the state has clearly demonstrated that the requirement advances the objectives of protecting public safety and preventing crime because it reduces the number of handguns carried in public.that is,limiting the public carrying of handguns protects citizens and inhibits crime by,inter alia 
decreasing the availability of handguns to criminals via theft,see explaining that criminals often target victims precisely because they possess handguns,and that baltimore police have frequently investigated homicides and robberies where it appears that one,if not the primary,goal of the attacker was to deprive the victim of his handgun or other weapons see also id.at c riminals in maryland are constantly looking for ways to arm themselves with handguns,including by stealing them from others.it is not uncommon for criminals to obtain these guns during street altercations.
lessening the likelihood that basic confrontations between individuals would turn deadly,id.at the presence of a handgun in an altercation,however petty,greatly increases the likelihood that it will escalate into potentially lethal violence.see also id.at incidents such as bar fights and road rage that now often end with people upset,but not lethally wounded,take on deadly implications when handguns are involved.
averting the confusion,along with the potentially tragic consequences thereof,that can result from the presence of a third person with a handgun during a confrontation between a police officer and a criminal suspect,id.at in such a confrontation,an additional person bearing a gun might cause confusion as to which side of the confrontation the person is on,which could lead to hesitation by the police officer and the potential for innocent victims,including the permit holder,innocent bystanders,and police officers.see also id.at c ivilians without sufficient training to use and maintain control of their weapons,particularly under tense circumstances,pose a danger to officers and other civilians.
curtailing the presence of handguns during routine encounters,id.at if the number of legal handguns on the streets increased significantly,police officers would have no choice but to take extra precautions before engaging citizens,effectively treating encounters between police and the community that now are routine,friendly,and trusting,as stops,which demand a much more rigid protocol and a strategic approach.
reducing the number of handgun sightings that must be investigated,id.increasing the number of people legally carrying handguns in the streets will also force police officers to spend more resources responding to reports about handgun sightings and engaging handgun carriers to ensure they are doing so lawfully.and 
facilitating the identification of those persons carrying handguns who pose a menace,id.at police officers would also have a harder time identifying potential security risks if more people without good and substantial reason to carry a handgun were able to do so,making it more difficult to respond when necessary.
at the same time that it reduces the number of handguns carried in public,however,the requirement ensures that those persons in palpable need of can arm themselves in public places where maryland various permit exceptions do not apply.consequently,according to the state,the requirement strikes a proper balance between ensuring access to handgun permits for those who need them while preventing a proliferation of handguns in public places that increases risks to public safety.j.
we are convinced by the state evidence that there is a reasonable fit between the requirement and maryland objectives of protecting public safety and preventing crime.in this regard,we find ourselves in agreement with much of the second circuit recent decision in kachalsky,rejecting the theory that new york handgun licensing scheme violates the second amendment by requiring an applicant to demonstrate proper cause,a special need for as a prerequisite for a license to carry a concealed handgun in public.see at.we specifically subscribe to the kachalsky court analysis that new york requirement is oriented to the second amendment protections,and constitutes a more moderate approach to protecting public safety and preventing crime than a wholesale ban on the public carrying of handguns.see id.at.the same must be said of maryland comparable requirement 
the requirement was inappropriately condemned by the district court for being a rationing system,that does no more to combat threats to public safety than would a law indiscriminately limiting the issuance of a permit to every tenth applicant.see woollard,d at.the court pointed out,inter alia,that the requirement will not prevent those who meet it from having their guns taken from them.id.the appellees have added that,because c rime is largely random and unpredictable,the state is plainly incapable of predicting who might be victimized and thus have more practical use for firearms.br.of appellees.additionally,the appellees have suggested that a regime,increasing the number of handgun carriers,would more effectively protect public safety and prevent crime than does maryland current permitting scheme.see id.at.but we can not substitute those views for the considered judgment of the general assembly that the requirement strikes an appropriate balance between granting handgun permits to those persons known to be in need of and precluding a dangerous proliferation of handguns on the streets of maryland.see kachalsky,at new york determined that limiting handgun possession to persons who have an articulable basis for beli
