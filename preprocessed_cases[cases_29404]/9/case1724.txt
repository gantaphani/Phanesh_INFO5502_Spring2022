the principal questions before us on this appeal are the scope of the exclusion from the federal arbitration act faa,for a class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce and the preemptive effect,if any,of the statutory exclusion.
defendant airborne express,airborne appeals from the district court order dated april,denying airborne motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff margaret palcko claims under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,and the pennsylvania human relations act.ann.airborne contends that palcko is required to arbitrate her claims pursuant to a contractual arbitration agreement based on the faa and washington state law.its appeal challenges the district court rulings that palcko,as a transportation worker engaged in interstate commerce,is excluded from the faa coverage,and that this faa exemption preempts enforcement of palcko arbitration agreement with airborne under washington state law.
airborne is a package transportation and delivery company that engages in intrastate,interstate,and international shipping.it began employing palcko as a field services supervisor in philadelphia in.palcko duties included supervising between thirty and drivers who delivered packages from airborne facility near the philadelphia international airport to their ultimate destinations in the philadelphia area,and picked up packages from customers in the philadelphia area and brought them back to airborne facility for shipment.palcko monitored and improved the performance of the drivers under her supervision to ensure timely and efficient delivery of packages.
when palcko was hired,she agreed to enter into a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims with airborne.the relevant portions of the agreement,which covers all claims,provides 
except as provided in this agreement,the federal arbitration act shall govern the interpretation,enforcement and all proceedings pursuant to this agreement.to the extent that the federal arbitration act is inapplicable,washington law pertaining to agreements to arbitrate shall apply.
according to palcko,once she began performing her duties at airborne she encountered immediate resistance and hostility from the drivers under her supervision.she alleges that other airborne employees falsely accused her of sexual misconduct,verbally and physically intimidated her during work,created a hostile work environment through sexist remarks,spread offensive rumors about her sex life and moral character through airborne internal communications system,and generally discriminated against her because of her gender.pl.compl.at.palcko contends that airborne did not meaningfully investigate and address these incidents,which she reported to the company management.according to palcko,when her immediate supervisor,michael matey,told her in the presence of others during a march,meeting that m aybe you do belong in this industry and m aybe you should just leave,she left the meeting and never returned to her position at airborne.pl.compl.at.airborne denies all palcko factual allegations of company wrongdoing.def.answer at.
palcko filed a charge against airborne with the equal employment opportunity commission on may,seeking administrative remedies for her allegations under title vii.after days elapsed without a finding by the commission on palcko charge against airborne,she requested a dismissal and notice of rights from the commission.f.the commission issued the dismissal and notice,thereby exhausting palcko administrative remedies and allowing her to seek judicial recourse.
palcko filed a complaint against airborne in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on may,under title vii and the pennsylvania human relations act.after the parties resolved issues unrelated to this appeal pertaining to the service of process,airborne filed a motion to compel arbitration of palcko claims under the parties arbitration agreement.the district court denied airborne motion on april,holding that palcko employment contract is excluded from the coverage of the faa because of the nature of her work.app.at.the court also found that the exclusionary effect of the faa preempts alternative enforcement of the arbitration contract under washington state law,as such enforcement would directly conflict with congress express purpose of exempting a certain class of workers from a federal law otherwise favoring arbitration.app.at.airborne now appeals from the district court order.
a.the federal arbitration.jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over palcko title vii claim under.the faa,a,provides for appellate jurisdiction over airborne appeal from the district court order denying its motion to compel arbitration brayman constr.home ins,cir.palcko contends,however,that because the district court found palcko employment contract to be exempt from the faa,we have no jurisdiction to review that court denial of airborne motion to compel arbitration under a,which is a section of the faa.appellee br.at.
palcko contention is without merit.we have held in sandvik ab advent international corporation,cir,that the faa provision for interlocutory appeals of orders denying motions to compel arbitration clearly endows us with appellate jurisdiction even in instances when the validity of the underlying contract to arbitrate is in doubt,as in palcko case with respect to the arbitration agreement reference to the faa.see id.at stating that the faa plain language contemplates interlocutory appeals from orders denying arbitration because of questions related to the validity of the underlying contract,and that other parts of the statute evince clear congressional intent that challenges to refusals to compel arbitration be promptly reviewed by appellate courts.
acceptance of palcko argument would create the curious situation in which either all district courts orders denying arbitration based on section exemption clause would be beyond appellate review,which contradicts section a plain language,or the determination of our appellate jurisdiction would be contingent on the outcome of our review of the merits of the district court finding on the exemption question,which is precisely what we are barred from doing in the absence of appellate jurisdiction.as we stated in sandvik,the more natural reading of section a is to treat all orders declining to compel arbitration as reviewable.id.at.no appellate court has held to the contrary.
our jurisdiction over the district court order here,therefore,is clear.
exemption under section of the faa 
section of the faa provides 
n othing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.
in circuit city stores,adams,d,the supreme court considered the scope of this exemption from the faa.the employer in that case,circuit city,sought to compel arbitration as provided for in its employment contracts.the ninth circuit held that arbitration was not appropriate because section of the faa exempts from its coverage all employment contracts.the supreme court reversed,rejecting the ninth circuit expansive reading of section.the court noted that m ost courts of appeals conclude the exclusion provision is limited to transportation workers,defined,for instance,as those workers actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.id.at.citing cole burns int l security.looking to the statutory language,the court applied the interpretation maxim of ejusdem generis and read the words any other class of workers engaged in commerce,as giving effect to the terms seamen and railroad employees.circuit city,at.the court held that the residual phrase any other class of workers engaged in interstate commerce should be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it id.at.reading section in this narrow manner,the court noted,also concurs with congress intent in enacting the faa to compel enforcement of arbitration agreements in response to judicial hostility toward such agreements,especially given the fact that more specific and comprehensive federal arbitration procedures for seamen and railroad employees were already in existence or on the verge of passage.see id.at.it would be rational for congress to ensure that workers in general would be covered by the provisions of the faa,while reserving for itself more specific legislation for those engaged in transportation.citation omitted.
to determine whether palcko employment contract,including the arbitration agreement,is exempt from the faa coverage,we must therefore determine whether palcko can be considered to be a transportation worker in a class of workers engaged in commerce within the meaning of the faa,as interpreted by circuit city.the district court,citing our decision in tenney engineering,united electrical radio machine workers of america,cir,reasoned that palcko qualifies as a transportation worker because her job was so closely related to the transport of the goods as to be in practical effect part of the shipping of the goods.app.at internal quotations omitted.airborne challenges the court finding,arguing that palcko,as a management employee with no close contact with channels of interstate commerce and not subject to other existing statutory employment dispute resolution schemes,can not qualify as an exempt worker under section of the faa.appellant br.at.
fifty years ago,this court in tenney was required to construe the meaning of the exception clause in the context of a labor dispute.the union sought a stay pending arbitration which was provided in the collective bargaining agreement.the parties stipulated that the employer was engaged in the manufacture of goods for sale in interstate commerce and that the employees were engaged in that manufacture and incidental plant maintenance.presaging the supreme court holding in circuit city,we held that the exception was inapplicable.we stated that as the language any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce followed seamen and railroad workers,the rule of ejusdem generis demands that the phrase includes only those other classes of workers who are likewise engaged directly in commerce,that is,only those other classes of workers who are actually engaged in the movement of interstate or foreign commerce or in work so closely related thereto as to be in practical effect part of it.tenney,at.the supreme court later decision in circuit city essentially affirmed the tenney analysis.at.
adopting the narrow interpretation of section stated in tenney and circuit city,airborne argues that palcko work,as a supervisor,was not only dissimilar to that of seamen or railroad workers,but also did not directly involve the interstate delivery of packages.she therefore can not be a transportation worker in the sense envisioned by the court in circuit city.we do not agree.according to palcko affidavit,she was responsible for monitoring and improving the performance of drivers under her supervision to insure sic timely and efficient delivery of packages.app.at.such direct supervision of package shipments makes palcko work so closely related to interstate and foreign commerce as to be in practical effect part of it.tenney,at see generally great mortgage peacock,cir declaring that tenney is still good law.
airborne suggests that the exemption clause should be limited to those truck drivers who physically move the packages.if we were to accept that limitation,we would unnecessarily narrow the section exemption in a way never intended by the faa had congress intended the residual clause of the exemption to cover only those workers who physically transported goods across state lines,it would have phrased the faa language accordingly we therefore concur with the district court finding that palcko employment contract with airborne is exempt from the faa coverage because she is a transportation worker engaged in interstate and foreign commerce under section of that statute.
b.the faa preemptive effect over washington state law governing arbitration 
jurisdiction 
airborne also argues that even if its arbitration agreement with palcko is exempt from the faa coverage,the agreement is nonetheless enforceable under the alternative ground that the arbitration agreement is valid under washington state law.before we examine the merit of airborne argument,however,we must first ascertain whether there is a basis for our jurisdiction to inquire into this claim.
the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over palcko pennsylvania state law cause of action under,and issued an order denying airborne motion to compel arbitration on both faa and washington state law grounds.while we may review airborne appeal with respect to the faa under a,that section does not cover our review of a,arbitration claim in an otherwise nonappealable interlocutory order.our ability to review the washington state law issue before us,if any,must therefore rest on the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction,which is discretionary and narrow in nature.
in dupont de nemours and rhone poulenc fiber and resin intermediates,cir,we explained that t he doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction,in its broadest formulation,allows an appellate court in its discretion to exercise jurisdiction over issues that are not independently appealable but that are intertwined with issues over which the appellate court properly and independently exercises its jurisdiction.id.at.recognizing that the supreme court has endorsed,but also limited,the use of pendent appellate jurisdiction by courts of appeals,we concluded that the doctrine should be used sparingly,and only where there is sufficient overlap in the facts relevant to both the appealable and nonappealable issues to warrant plenary review.id.at emphasis in original.
here,both the faa exemption and washington state law issues arise from a single arbitration agreement that provides alternative grounds for the arbitration of all claims arising from palcko employment with airborne.moreover,both palcko title vii and pennsylvania human relations act claims arise from the same set of facts related to her conditions as an airborne employee.thus,not only does sufficient overlap of facts exist to warrant plenary review,but the washington state law arbitration issue is so closely intertwined with the faa claim that our taking of pendent appellate jurisdiction over the former is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court order in its entirety.we therefore conclude we may exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the portion of the district court order.
discussion 
the district court ruled that the exemption of palcko employment contract from the faa coverage also precludes enforcement of the arbitration agreement under washington state law.the court found that a lthough the faa contains no express preemptive provision and its preemptive effect is limited,its preemptive effect does encompass questions of arbitrability.app.at.it reasoned that enforcement of the arbitration agreement between palcko and airborne in accordance with state laws favoring arbitration would directly conflict with congress express purpose,in drafting the exemption clause in section of the faa,of exempting workers engaged in interstate commerce from arbitration.app.at.
in considering whether the inclusion of the exemption clause was intended to preempt state law regarding enforcement of arbitration agreements,we must keep in mind that congress enacted the faa to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate,rather than restrict the force of arbitration agreements.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d.the supreme court has stated that passage of the act was motivated,first and foremost,by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered,and courts must not overlook this principal objective when construing the statute,or allow the fortuitous impact of the act on efficient dispute resolution to overshadow the underlying motivation.id.at.footnote omitted.in seeking to fulfill the faa purpose,the court has enforced an agreement to arbitrate claims under the securities act of,even though prior case law stated that the securities act language pro
