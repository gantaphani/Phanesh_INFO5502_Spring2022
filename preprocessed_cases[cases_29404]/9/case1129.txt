the district court judgment was entered before we decided a series of cases examining the plra exhaustion requirement.we vacate that judgment in part and remand to the district court to consider whether the threats macias alleges he received rendered the united states bureau of prisons bop administrative grievance procedures unavailable to him,or whether those threats estop defendants from raising macias failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.we affirm the district court judgment in all other respects.
background 
for the purposes of this appeal,we discuss the facts as alleged by macias.macias entered the mdc on february,as a detainee.mdc medical personnel examined him on march,march,april,and july.at these appointments macias informed mdc personnel that in he had undergone arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.on october,while picking up his food tray in his housing unit,macias slipped and fell on a wet floor resulting in injuries to his right knee,back and head.that same day defendant annessa examined macias and prescribed medication and bed rest and ordered an of his back,hip and right knee.in early december macias approached annessa to request additional pain medication.annessa refused him and told him that there was nothing further he could do to help him.macias filed an administrative tort claim shortly thereafter,numbered and received by the bop on december,alleging that his injuries were caused by defendants negligence,and that days had passed since his injury and he still had not received proper medical care.
on january,an mdc physician diagnosed macias with a right medial collateral ligament tear and ordered an mri.the results of the mri indicated that macias knee had a lateral and medial meniscal tear,an anterior collateral ligament tear and degenerative arthritis.after his mri,macias was seen several more times by mdc medical personnel.macias pain medication was intermittently discontinued and he had difficulty obtaining additional treatment.
on january,defendant parker denied macias access to his medication during a cell search causing him to collapse.parker also denied macias food by ordering him not to ask other inmates to help him with his lunch tray and by telling him that if he could go to the law library on crutches,he could carry his food tray on crutches.macias filed an administrative tort claim against parker on march,numbered,alleging emotional damages as a result of parker mistreatment.
macias then filed this pro se action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs and negligent in causing his injuries and emotional distress.on may,macias lawsuit was transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.while his case was pending macias filed a motion for a temporary restraining order claiming that the mdc had again discontinued his pain medication,that he reinjured his right knee when his wheelchair collapsed,and that he had not been provided with prescribed rehabilitative physical therapy.macias asked the district court to order the mdc to reissue his medication and to enjoin the defendants from retaliating against him.
the district court construed macias lawsuit liberally,see mceachin mcguinnis,cir when a plaintiff proceeds pro se a court is obliged to construe his pleadings liberally,particularly when they allege civil rights violations,and found that macias had stated eighth amendment claims under bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d,and tort claims under the ftca.defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit pursuant to.b because,inter alia,macias had failed to comply with the plra exhaustion requirement before filing both his bivens claims and his motion for a temporary restraining order,and because he had failed to comply with the ftca exhaustion requirement before filing his tort claims.
in a decision entered on july,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the lawsuit in full.judge trager dismissed macias state law tort claims without prejudice because macias filed his complaint while his two administrative tort claims were pending.the court dismissed macias eighth amendment bivens claims and his motion for a temporary restraining order because macias had never availed himself of the bop administrative remedy system.
on appeal,macias contends that his bivens claims should not have been dismissed for failing to comply with the plra exhaustion requirement because he did not need to use the bop administrative remedy system because the bop is not authorized to provide some of the relief he seeks,his administrative tort claims and other informal complaints put the prison officials on notice of the nature of his grievance,and defendant parker alleged threats rendered the bop administrative remedy system unavailable to him,or in the alternative,those threats estop defendants from raising his failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.macias does not challenge either the dismissal of his tort claims pursuant to the ftca or the dismissal of his motion for a temporary restraining order.therefore,our review is limited to the district court decision to dismiss macias bivens claims.for the following reasons,we affirm in part,and vacate and remand in part.
discussion 
federal jurisdiction is based on this bivens action arising under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
we review the district court dismissal of macias complaint for failure to state a claim de novo accepting as true all facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff.faulkner beer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the plra provides that a prisoner may not bring an action under federal law with respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.the supreme court has held that the plra exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life,whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes,and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.porter nussle,d.
we recently decided a series of cases examining the scope of the plra exhaustion requirement.see giano goord,cir abney mcginnis,cir johnson testman,cir ortiz mcbride,cir ziemba wezner,cir hemphill new york,cir.in hemphill we read together giano,abney,johnson,ortiz and ziemba and formulated a test 
depending on the inmate explanation for the alleged failure to exhaust,the court must ask whether administrative remedies were in fact available to the prisoner.the court should also inquire as to whether the defendants may have forfeited the affirmative defense of by failing to raise or preserve it,or whether the defendants own actions inhibiting the inmate exhaustion of remedies may estop one or more of the defendants from raising the plaintiff failure to exhaust as a defense.i
