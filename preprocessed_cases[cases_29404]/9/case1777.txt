opinion of the court 
jeffery montgomery appeals from the entry of summary judgment against him in this civil rights action initially brought pro se under.montgomery,an inmate in the new jersey state correctional system,claims that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.montgomery also contests the district court denial of his motion to appoint counsel.we find that,under the standards established by this court in tabron grace,cir,the district court abused its discretion in denying montgomery counsel.because we believe that montgomery ability to meet the evidentiary requirements of the summary judgment motion was prejudiced by his lack of counsel,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
factual background 
plaintiff jeffery montgomery is currently an inmate at riverfront state prison in camden,new jersey.the events that gave rise to this lawsuit occurred from to,while montgomery was incarcerated at east jersey state prison east jersey in rahway,new jersey.defendants steven pinchak,terry moore,and al ortiz were administrative officials at east jersey during the period of montgomery incarceration these three defendants will be collectively referred to as administrators.defendant correctional medical services cms is a private corporate entity that has provided medical care to prisoners at east jersey since april.defendant naficy is a physician employed by cms as an independent contractor at east jersey who rendered medical care to montgomery during his incarceration.
montgomery has a heart condition and has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus hiv,which can cause aids.in march,in response to montgomery complaints of chest pains,ghazanfar jafferi,a cardiologist at francis hospital,examined montgomery and determined that he needed a cardiac catheterization.at that time,all medical care at east jersey was provided by medical personnel employed by the new jersey state department of corrections doc and all of montgomery medical records were within the custody and control of doc.east jersey was notified of jafferi recommendation,and montgomery catheterization was scheduled to be performed that may.
in april,about a month after jafferi examination,the state of new jersey entered into a contract with cms,under which cms assumed responsibility for providing medical care for the prisoners at east jersey and all other new jersey state correctional institutions.cms was subsequently unable to locate any of montgomery previously generated medical records.these records included not only jafferi recommendation for montgomery catheterization,but also all records of any antibiotic medicines prescribed dispensed to treat montgomery hiv as well as several medications prescribed for his heart condition.
montgomery scheduled catheterization was not performed that may.he claims that he never underwent the procedure,nor the subsequently prescribed treatment,because the defendants lost his medical records,which documented the necessity of the procedure.montgomery raised this issue with defendant pinchak through a letter dated august,stating 
i wish to bring to your attention about medical staff claiming to have lost my medical records.this has denied me to medical treatment follow up that was schedule for the month of may with a cardiologist specialist at francis hospital.
on january,while in solitary confinement,montgomery was awakened in the middle of the night by severe chest pains.a nurse came to his cell,accompanied by four east jersey guards.montgomery related to the nurse his cardiac history and condition,but,as montgomery explained in his original complaint,the nurse refuse d to have the officers open my cell door to examine me n or did the nurse take my vital signs which is standard procedure with an individual suffering from chest pains.app.at.the guards permitted montgomery to attempt to pass his arm through the food portal so as to enable the nurse to take his vital signs.finding,however,that montgomery arm would not fit,the nurse and guards made no further effort to treat montgomery.in her report of the incident,the nurse explained simply that montgomery was denied care that night because he seemed agitated.
montgomery also claims that,after losing his records,the defendants deprived him of necessary hiv antiviral medications over a ten month period,from may to february a physical examination of montgomery revealed that,by february,his white blood cell count had dropped to a dangerously low level.
after cms lost his medical records,montgomery filed various requests,in accordance with east jersey procedures,for both his records and for his prescribed treatment.although a significant part of montgomery records were recreated,many remain missing by cms own admission.additionally,montgomery asserts that the defendants refused to recreate his file until after he brought this suit and that significant portions of the recreated records are either inaccurate or have been falsified.he also claims that the recreated records fail to reflect the actual treatment that he had received.
procedural history 
in february,montgomery filed the initial complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.montgomery claimed that the defendants had violated his civil rights under by depriving him of prescribed treatment for his various medical conditions,thereby denying him his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.specifically,montgomery alleged that,because of the lost medical records,the defendants denied him a cardiac catheterization scheduled for may,and that from may to february they refused to administer his prescribed antiviral and cardiac medications,or to provide necessary and laboratory blood work.this is the only complaint that montgomery has brought since being incarcerated.
in may,the district court approved montgomery application to proceed in forma pauperis and allowed him to submit an amended complaint.in june,montgomery submitted a motion for the appointment of counsel,asserting that the complexity and difficulty of this case itself warrants counsel.app.at.montgomery noted that the case will require expert witnesses in the medical field,that he is unable to afford counsel and that he has a limited knowledge of the law.id.
the district court referred the motion for appointment of counsel to the magistrate judge,who,on october,denied the motion.in explaining his decision,the magistrate judge remarked that p laintiff case does not seem to have merit as a civil rights suit.app.at.the magistrate judge added that,even if montgomery had stated a proper civil rights claim,p laintiff is well able to present his case.although plaintiff is incarcerated,he is adept at following the court procedures.app.at.finding that the case is fairly straightforward and presents no excessively complex issues of fact or law,the judge concluded that montgomery can adequately represent himself and that the appointment of counsel was therefore not merited.app.at.
on october,the same day he denied montgomery motion for appointment of counsel,the magistrate judge also denied montgomery rule motion to compel production of his medical documents from cms contrary to his finding that montgomery was adept at following the court procedures,the magistrate judge determined that montgomery had failed to request the specified documents as provided for in,and that montgomery further violated local civil rule b by not submitting affidavits certifying the parties good faith efforts to resolve the discovery dispute without the aid of the court app.at.the judge therefore concluded that montgomery motion to compel production of documents was technically a request to defendants to provide said documents and should be denied.app.at.
thereafter,montgomery continued to pursue discovery without the aid of counsel,with varying degrees of success for instance,on november,montgomery sent a series of interrogatories to defendants.cms objected to six of montgomery first nine interrogatories.montgomery then brought a motion to compel answers to those first six questions,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a b on january,the magistrate judge denied montgomery motion because cms had in fact filed responses,even though they were in the form of objections.
in january,montgomery mailed an additional set of interrogatories to the defendants.a month later,montgomery again filed a motion to compel answers pursuant to rule a b.on april,the magistrate judge denied the motion,finding that plaintiff failed to abide by the federal rules of civil procedure in that he failed to obtain leave of court before serving his additional interrogatories.app.at.the judge additionally found that plaintiff failed to abide by b in that no copies of the additional interrogatories,which are the subject matter of this motion,were annexed or included with the moving papers.id.
on march,the magistrate judge ordered,in response to montgomery request pursuant to d,that several subpoenas compelling production of montgomery medical records be served upon medical service providers and prison authorities who had treated montgomery additionally,since cms still claimed to be unable to find montgomery original records,on june,the court ordered cms to file,within twenty days,a certification describing the efforts it had undertaken to find those records.
in june,montgomery attempted once again to serve interrogatories upon defendants.this time,montgomery filed a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories,which the court granted on june.
on july,as cms had failed either to answer montgomery interrogatories or to file a certification of its search efforts,montgomery filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in opposition,cms submitted a response to the interrogatories and an affidavit regarding the results of the search,and informed the court that some documents had been found.based on cms submissions,the court denied montgomery motion for sanctions as moot.
during this period,montgomery wrote a letter to the magistrate judge asserting that cms was now,in response to his lawsuit,retaliating mainly by denying the plaintiff prescribed medication.app.at.montgomery stated that the defendants correctional medical services,have intentionally refused to follow up needed prescribed medication that is clearly documented before them and which was prescribed by a cardiologist specialist.id.montgomery indicated that his prescription had expired on june,and that since then cms had refused to reorder the medication.the record in this case does not reveal at what point cms reinstated montgomery cardiac medication regimen.
following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment and montgomery filed a.on january,the district court granted summary judgment as to all of the defendants.the court reasoned that montgomery had failed to demonstrate that either naficy or the prison administrators had acted with deliberate indifference to montgomery serious medical needs.the district court further found that no cause of action could lie against defendant cms,since respondeat superior is not a valid basis for a cause of action under,and since cms is not alleged to have had anything to do with plaintiff medical care.app.at.based on these findings,the district court denied montgomery for summary judgment.montgomery then filed a timely appeal with this court.
montgomery raises two issues on appeal.first,he claims that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to appoint counsel,and in not appointing counsel sua sponte later in the proceedings,when montgomery difficulties with the rules of discovery became apparent.montgomery also claims that the district court erred in finding that montgomery case presented no genuine issues of material fact,and,therefore,in granting the defendants summary judgment motion.because we agree with montgomery that the district court abused its discretion in failing to appoint counsel,we will vacate the district court judgment and remand the case with instructions to appoint counsel to assist montgomery in the preparation and presentation of his case.
we review a district court decision to deny counsel to an indigent civil litigant for abuse of discretion.hamilton leavy,cir.we have determined that a district court abuses its discretion if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.newton merrill lynch,quoting in re motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir.we have jurisdiction over the district court final order under.
indigent civil litigants possess neither a constitutional nor a statutory right to appointed counsel.see parham johnson,cir.nevertheless,congress has granted district courts statutory authority to request appointed counsel for indigent civil litigants.see e providing that t he court may request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.this court has interpreted as affording district courts broad discretion to determine whether appointment of counsel in a civil case would be appropriate.see tabron grace,cir.the tabron court found that the decision to appoint counsel may be made at any point in the litigation,and may be made by a district court sua sponte.id.at.
in tabron,we developed a list of criteria to aid the district courts in weighing the appointment of counsel for indigent civil litigants as a threshold matter,a district court must assess whether the claimant case has some arguable merit in fact and law.tabron,at see also parham,at.if a claimant overcomes this threshold hurdle,we identified a number of factors that a court should consider when assessing a claimant request for counsel.these include 
the plaintiff ability to present his or her own case 
the difficulty of the particular legal issues 
the degree to which factual investigation will be necessary and the ability of the plaintiff to pursue investigation 
the plaintiff capacity to retain counsel on his or her own behalf 
the extent to which a case is likely to turn on credibility determinations,and 
whether the case will require testimony from expert witnesses.
we have noted that this list of factors is not exhaustive,but should serve as a guidepost for the district courts.parham,at citing tabron,at.in addition,we have cautioned that courts should exercise care in appointing counsel because volunteer lawyer time is a precious commodity and should not be wasted on frivolous cases.id.at.
as a threshold matter,we must assess whether montgomery case,in which he claims that the defendants violated his civil rights under by depriving him of prescribed medical treatment,has some arguable merit in fact and law.parham,at citing tabron,at see also hodge police officers,cir explaining that i f mere bald assertions by an indigent required appointment of an attorney under the statute,the demand for such representation could be overwhelming.montgomery asserts that this denial of adequate medical treatment has forced him to endure pain and suffering,thereby violating his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.
to demonstrate a prima facie case of cruel and unusual punishment based on the denial of medical care,a plaintiff must establish that defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his or her serious medical needs.see estelle gamble,d durmer,cir.this standard has two elements first,plaintiff must make an objective showing that the deprivation was sufficiently serious,or that the result of defendant denial was sufficiently serious.additionally,the plaintiff must make a subjective showing that defendant acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.see wilson seiter,d.
in assessing whether montgomery claim had some merit in fact and law,the magistrate judge made just one finding.he found that montgomery did not allege the requisite deliberate indifference in claiming that his federal civil rights were violated.see montgomery pinchak,civ.at.the magistrate judge held that plaintiff complaint and other papers filed in this action fail ed to allege the necessary intentional indifference on behalf of the defendants needed to successfully prosecute a civil rights claim.therefore,plaintiff case,as it pertains to the eight amendment,does not appear to have some potential merit in fact and law.id.the magistrate judge clearly erred in this determination.
it is plain from the record that montgomery did,in fact,allege the necessary intentional indifference on behalf of the defendants.montgomery amended complaint,filed well before the magistrate judge ruling on montgomery motion for appointment of counsel,conformed to the language of the caselaw by claiming that defendants have violated plaintiff rights with deliberate indifference and contempt of the district court and the district of new jersey.app.at.while montgomery pleading may be inartful,it satisfies the more lenient standard that district courts are required to apply to pro se submissions.see,estelle,at.a pro se complaint,however inartfully pleaded must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.quoting conley gibson,d.in light of this evidence,the magistrate judge determination misstates the record and is plainly in error.
neither party disputes that montgomery has been diagnosed with,and prescribed medicine for,his heart and hiv conditions.at oral argument,montgomery attorney asserted that,because both conditions can be life threatening if not properly treated,montgomery has demonstrated the objective component of the estelle standard.we agree and find that montgomery has satisfied the first prong of estelle by demonstrating a serious medical need.see monmouth county correctional institutional inmates lanzaro,cir instructing that the seriousness of a medical need may be determined by reference to the effect of denying the particular treatment.
in analyzing montgomery chances for success on the merits,we agree with the district court determination on summary judgment that the mere loss by the defendants of montgomery medical records does not rise to the requisite level of deliberate indifference.see lanzaro,at instructing that mere allegations of medical malpractice do not raise issues of constitutional import.moreover,if montgomery claim had merely concerned the prison negligent misplacement of his medical records,we might also agree with the magistrate judge earlier determination that montgomery case lacked merit in fact and law,and does not therefore require the appointment of counsel.see,hodge,at finding that,as a threshold matter,counsel is unwarranted where the indigent chances of success on the merits are extremely slim.
however,montgomery claims more than the mere loss of his records.for instance,montgomery asserts that,over a period from may to february,the defendants refused to provide him with the antiviral medications,laboratory blood work,and prescription medication refills that their own medical staff,prior to the disappearance of montgomery records,had determined were necessary for treating his heart and hiv conditions.according to montgomery,this occurred despite his numerous documented requests for treatment and medical care.additionally,he claims that the defendants refused to recreate his file until after he brought this suit,and that significant portions of the recreated records are either inaccurate or have been falsified.finally,montgomery has alleged that the prison staff,in retaliation for his having filed this suit,once again refused to refill montgomery prescription for his prescribed cardiac medication,beginning in july of.in addition,defendants own records indicate that they were aware that a cardiac catheterization had been scheduled for montgomery,but ten months after the date set had still not been performed.see app.at memo of march,from cms quality assurance specialist to the registered nurse in charge of the prison ward.montgomery assertions and the defendants admission are considerable factors in establishing a prima facie case of the defendants deliberate indifference,and,consequently,we find that montgomery has adequately demonstrated the subjective component of the estelle standard.see durmer,cir noting that deliberate indifference may exist in a variety of different circumstances,including where prison authorities prevent an inmate from receiving recommended treatment,or where knowledge of the need for medical care is accompanied by the intentional refusal to provide that care.
we therefore conclude that montgomery allegations clearly state a,prima facie case of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need and that the already established evidence indicates more than an extremely slim chance of success on the merits.therefore,we find that montgomery case demonstrates potential merit in fact and law,and that he has met his threshold burden for appointment of counsel.of course,our inquiry does not end here.we must now analyze montgomery claim under each of the tabron factors.
plaintiff ability to present his or her own case 
perhaps the most significant of tabron factors is the plaintiff ability to present his or her case.see tabron,at describing this component of the analysis as a significant factor.we have identified a number of factors that courts should consider in determining a plaintiff ability to present her own case.these include the plaintiff education,literacy,prior work experience,and prior litigation experience,along with a plaintiff ability to understand english and the restraints placed upon a prisoner plaintiff by confinement.see also parham,at instructing that while these factors are not always determinative,they should be considered in each meritorious case.
in arguing that the appointment of counsel was not appropriate because montgomery was fully capable of presenting his own case,defendants accurately point out that montgomery was able to respond to all pending motions and sought the court relief on his own behalf by filing his own motions.furthermore,the magistrate judge similarly found that although incarcerated,montgomery is adept at following the court procedures,and that all of his submissions had been both coherent and comprehensive.see montgomery,civ,at.
under similar circumstances,this court has determined that the ability to file and respond to motions does indicate that a plaintiff has some legal knowledge and is literate.but this fact alone does not conclusively establish that a plaintiff was able to present his own case.see parham,at.in parham,we found that a prisoner lack of legal experience and the complex discovery rules clearly put him at a disadvantage in countering the defendant discovery tactics and that these discovery rules prevented the plaintiff from presenting an effective case below.id.
as previously noted,montgomery was not a sophisticated jailhouse lawyer.this was the first and only claim that he had brought since being incarcerated.we also know that,because of his confinement,he was unable to depose any defendants.montgomery nonetheless attempted to proceed with an investigation through interrogatories,document requests,and requests for admissions.as did the plaintiff in parham,he encountered multiple obstacles,both in the resistance of the defendants and in the intricacies of the discovery rules.
montgomery unfamiliarity with complex discovery rules forced numerous technical rulings that hindered his attempts to investigate the facts underlying his case.it is difficult for this court to reconcile those rulings with the district court concurrent finding that montgomery was adept at following the court procedures,and could therefore litigate his own claim.see montgomery,civ,at.furthermore,while we are obligated to afford the district court findings considerable discretion,we simply can not agree that,as demonstrated by montgomery filings in the record,he possesses the type of education,literacy,prior work experience,and prior litigation experience necessary to represent himself competently in this civil suit.since we have determined that his case has some potential merit,and since this case involves complex discovery rules with which montgomery was seemingly unable to comply,we find that montgomery ability to present his own case is doubtful,and that this factor weighs in favor
