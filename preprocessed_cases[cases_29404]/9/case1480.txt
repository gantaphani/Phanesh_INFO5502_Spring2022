background 
who is african american,began attending penn valley elementary school in the lower merion school district in kindergarten.beginning in first grade the school year,was placed in title i classes durrell received a brochure and letters explaining title i services and consented to enrollment in the program.received title i services from first grade through fifth grade.
on october,when was in second grade,durrell met with santa cucinotta,the school psychologist,the school counselor,and the principal.at this conference,they discussed that was having difficulty with confidence,as well as reading,writing,and getting her thoughts on paper.the team collectively agreed that should continue to receive title i reading services.after this meeting,cucinotta began to monitor progress in her classes.the school district also created a child study team to monitor progress.durrell participated in many of the child study team meetings.
when was in third grade the school year,cucinotta and durrell again discussed difficulties in school.during the spring of that year,scored below the on the reading portion of the pennsylvania system of school assessment pssa on may,durrell met with the school counselor and the principal.they agreed that,while was enthusiastic and had a nice grade experience,the team needed to develop strategies directed toward improving attention and focus.app.
at the beginning of year the school year,scored below the benchmark score on the degrees of readings powers drp test on february,the child study team,consisting of durrell,cucinotta,the school counselor,and teacher,met to discuss progress.they talked about enthusiasm for certain activities,but noted her unwillingness to continue participating in title i reading classes,and her difficulties with place value in math,and decoding and understanding the main idea in reading.app.the team decided to send a referral packet to pupil services for and issued a permission to evaluate pte,which is a request to the parent that the student be evaluated in order to determine eligibility and need for special education services.durrell consented to the evaluation.that year,teacher also explained to durrell that was struggling in her studies.on june,the school district issued another pte for,and on june,durrell again consented.
cucinotta began the evaluation in june,using the predicted achievement model to assess the results revealed a point discrepancy between expected score of and her reading comprehension score of as part of the evaluation,cucinotta considered whether any mitigating factors would have affected achievements,such as personal or familial circumstances cucinotta also spoke with durrell,reviewed a literacy specialist evaluations of from the end of third grade and the beginning of fourth grade,and considered pssa and drp scores.cucinotta considered the testing scores,as well as her own clinical observations of language processing,the difficulty had with directions,and the vocabulary that did understand.app.
cucinotta concluded her evaluation at the beginning of year the school year,and published the results in two evaluation reports,dated september and.as a result of the evaluation,cucinotta determined that had a learning disability in reading and math and recommended that she receive specially designed instruction in these areas.the reports also noted that was unhappy that she was designated as disabled and had told cucinotta that she did not think she belonged in special education.durrell reviewed and signed the evaluation reports,indicating that she agreed with the recommendations.
following her designation as disabled,a team was assembled to develop an individualized education program iep for.the record indicates that the iep team considered personal sentiment that she did not want to be in special education,and that cucinotta and a guidance counselor subsequently discussed feelings with her.on october,durrell attended an iep meeting for,during which durrell received and approved the notice of recommended placement norep.the norep indicated that would receive special education services during her year specifically,learning support in the resource room as well as itinerant speech and language therapy.
on november,the iep team met again to create a revised iep for,which durrell approved.a revised norep was subsequently issued,indicating that would continue to receive speech and language therapy,and would also be placed in a learning support class called instructional support lab isl.
on january,when was in fifth grade and less than three months after she was placed in special education,scored level on the woodcock reading mastery test.she scored at a grade level in word identification,grade level in word attack,and grade level in word comprehension.
from sixth to eighth grade,attended welsh valley middle school in the school district.iep team selected her classes,with her mother approval.when was in sixth grade,the iep team developed a new iep providing with accommodations for standardized testing.durrell agreed to these accommodations.
on october,durrell emailed isl teacher and stated,i am really concerned about pssa score.she is below proficiency.could we consider having her work with the reading specialist she needs some instruction to bring her up to proficiency.this is a real concern for me now it is obvious that more needs to be done.app.in response to this email,the school district provided with instruction with a reading specialist.again confided in her teacher that she was unhappy with isl and did feel like she needed the extra help.
on may,when was in seventh grade,the school district issued an evaluation report analyzing academic progress.the report indicated that was receiving good grades in her classes and had made positive progress toward her iep goals.the report recommended be removed from special education services for language arts due to her progress in that area,but that she continue to receive specialized instruction in reading and writing.following the evaluation,these recommendations were implemented.because continued to receive special education,there was not time in her schedule for her to take science and spanish.
began attending lower merion high school when she was in ninth grade the school year.the school district created a suggested schedule of classes for year,which included isl,and sent the schedule home to durrell.all parents of rising had the option of requesting a change in their child suggested course schedule.durrell had this option of picking different courses for,but elected not to do so.that fall,scored just below the benchmark on the advanced degrees of reading power test 
on april,the school district issued a second pte for to determine if she still needed special education durrell consented to the evaluation.craig cosden,a school district psychologist,performed the evaluation.as part of the evaluation,cosden spoke with both and durrell,obtained reports from teachers,discussed progress with both the literacy specialist and the math specialist,and reviewed grades and scores on standardized tests.cosden determined that had average intelligence,but consistently demonstrated achievement levels below her intelligence level in the areas of reading and math.the evaluation report also indicated that had a specific learning disability,although the disability was not identified.cosden thus concluded that was still in need of special education in reading and math 
continued to have isl classes in tenth grade.on november,durrell requested that the school district remove from isl and place her in study hall.the school district changed s.schedule in accordance with this request within two days.
the school district complied with durrell other requests as well.for example,on november,durrell emailed kimberly fedchak,a school employee,to ask if fedchak could meet with for additional instruction.durrell wrote,i would like to know if can come in to work with you,during academic recovery to go over her test corrections.she said she did have a clear understanding of the material.she does have math goals in her iep.i feel the more individual instruction she has,the better she do.app.fedchak agreed.
also in november of,cosden met with durrell and durrell legal counsel,as part of an iep meeting.during this meeting,durrell counsel requested a copy of the testing protocols relating to cosden evaluation of cosden lied to durrell and told her that the testing protocols had been destroyed.cosden later admitted that he had intentionally misled the family because he did not think it was ethical for him to disclose the protocols to persons who have no ability to be able to process and understand the information.app.
on november,durrell filed a due process complaint notice,requesting a special education hearing and seeking an independent education evaluation iee.the school district consented to the iee,and durrell selected umar abdullah johnson johnson,a nationally certified school psychologist,to perform the evaluation.the iee was performed in january,and abdullah johnson published his report on february.his intelligence tests revealed iq to be,which is in the middle of the average range.the achievement test placed in the average range in four out of six composite score areas,in the below average range for reading comprehension fluency,and in the superior range for basic reading.
abdullah johnson also determined that any discrepancy between iq and her achievement scores was too small to constitute a severe discrepancy,and that the data used in the report prepared by cucinotta did not support the school district conclusion that had a learning disability.he concluded that s.designation as learning disabled was,and always had been,erroneous 
following abdullah johnson evaluation,durrell requested that be removed from special education.cosden also prepared a reevaluation report.the report discussed academic history and included observations from teachers.cosden report also discussed the test results from abdullah johnson evaluation of,although it did not specifically reference abdullah johnson determination that was not,and never had been,disabled.the report did,however,state that did not have a disability and therefore was no longer eligible to receive special education.on april,the school district issued a norep indicating that did not have a specific learning disability and removing her from special education.received no special education in her junior and senior years of high school.
as of february,had been accepted to west virginia university,kutztown university,cabrini college,and neumann university.
procedural history 
following removal from special education,the school district moved to dismiss durrell complaint before the hearing officer as moot,because was not a child with a disability and therefore was no longer entitled to the idea protection the hearing officer agreed and determined that he did not have jurisdiction over claim because she admitted that she is not disabled and never has been disabled.
on november,appellants filed suit in federal district court,alleging three claims.claim one asserted that,under the idea,the school district violated its duty to accurately identify children with disabilities and to ensure that was properly evaluated and assessed as not disabled.claim two alleged a violation of of the ra,and claim three alleged a violation of of the ada.claims two and three alleged that the school district discriminated against by erroneously identifying her as a child with a disability.
appellants sought compensatory education and monetary damages.according to appellants,receipt of special education services damaged her and academic progress.it also prevented her from participating in certain classes,including science and one year of foreign language during middle school,and courses in high school.appellants expert calculated damages as,which includes two additional years of college tuition,hours of psychotherapy,and hours of tutoring.
on june,the district court granted the school district motion to dismiss claim one the district court concluded that,because asserts that she is not disabled,she can not be,for pleading purposes,a child with a disability and thus can not seek relief under the idea.durrell ex rel.lower merion sch,wl,at.june,
on july,the district court granted summary judgment in the school district favor as to the remaining ra and ada claims.the district court first ruled that,in order to sustain a claim seeking compensatory damages under the ra and ada,a plaintiff must be able to show evidence of intentional discrimination on the part of the defendant.durrell ex rel.lower merion sch,wl,at.july.the district court then concluded that appellants had produced no evidence creating a genuine dispute of fact as to intentional discrimination and granted summary judgment.id.at while we find any misidentification of unfortunate,plaintiffs have not come forward with any evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to find that the school district intentionally discriminated against when it regarded her as disabled.
appellants filed a timely appeal.

iii.analysis 
idea claim 
appellants argue that the district court erred when it dismissed their idea claim.appellants contend that the idea jurisdictional umbrella encompasses not merely children with disabilities,but also children who have been misidentified as disabled.this question is a matter of first impression for this court,as it requires us to determine whether the protections and remedies of the idea extend beyond children with disabilities.while appellants arguments are emotionally compelling,they are ultimately to no avail.
plain language of the statute 
this question presents an issue of statutory interpretation.our goal when interpreting a statute is to effectuate congress intent.because we presume that congress intent is most clearly expressed in the text of the statute,we begin our analysis with an examination of the plain language of the relevant provision.hagans comm r of soc,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also jimenez quarterman,d as with any question of statutory interpretation,our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then this first canon of statutory interpretation is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.bank germain,d.moreover,where the statutory language is unambiguous,the court should not consider statutory purpose or legislative history,in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir,because we operate under the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose,park n fly,dollar park fly,d.
with this framework in mind,we turn to the language of the idea.the idea guarantees procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities and their parents.a emphasis added.children with disabilities and their parents who claim violations of the idea can file a complaint with a due process hearing officer.id.b.the complaint may pertain to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.id.b a emphasis added.following the due process hearing,the idea permits an aggrieved party to bring a civil action in any court.id.i a.thus,a child may file a civil suit only if he or she would have been entitled to file a complaint before a hearing officer it is clear from the plain language that only children with disabilities and their parents may do so.
the idea defines child with a disability to mean 
a child with intellectual disabilities,hearing impairments including deafness,speech or language impairments,visual impairments including blindness,serious emotional disturbance or referred to in this chapter as emotional disturbance,orthopedic impairments,autism,traumatic brain injury,other health impairments,or specific learning disabilities and who by reason thereof needs special education and related services.
id.a.there is no indication that the term child with a disability includes children who are mistakenly identified as disabled,but who are,in fact,not disabled therefore,under the act plain language,it is clear that the idea creates a cause of action only for individuals with disabilities.because appellants assert that is not,and never was,a child with a disability,is excluded from the idea provisions and may not bring a claim under that act.see appellants reply br.the school district can not avoid reality that is not a child with a disability and never was.we can not,sua sponte,create a cause of action where the plain language of a statute does not provide for one 
legislative history 
appellants argue that the plain language is not dispositive.they claim that they can maintain a cause of action under the idea because,even though is not disabled,she is african american and the idea should be construed to protect minority children who are misidentified as disabled.in making this argument,appellants ask us simply to acknowledge the flip side of the identification coin that after a school district has,through the idea procedures,misidentified an african american child as having a disability,the child enjoys the same protections of the idea hearing process.appellants br.in support of this proposition,appellants point to language in the findings section of the idea and to a house committee report prepared in anticipation of the idea introduction,both of which acknowledge the problem of minority students being misidentified as disabled appellants contend that congress would have not expressed such concern about the misidentification of african american children as disabled and then left those same children without any recourse under the idea.appellants br.
appellants reliance on the statutory findings and house committee report is unavailing.legislative history has never been permitted to override the plain meaning of a statute.as the supreme court has made clear,congress authoritative statement is the statutory text,not the legislative history.chamber of commerce whiting,d quoting exxon mobil allapattah,d.legislative history may not be used to alter the plain meaning of a statute.the law is what congress enacts,not what its members say on the floor.szehinskyj att y,cir.
moreover,legislative history may be referenced only if the statutory language is written without a plain meaning,if the statutory language is ambiguous.byrd shannon,cir.legislative history is meant to clear up ambiguity,not create it.milner dep t of navy,d see also velis kardanis,cir there is no need to resort to legislative history unless the statutory language is ambiguous.we must not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.milner.at see also coal.for students with disabilities educ.legal def.fund allen,cir this plain meaning can not be circumvented unless we have the rare instance when there is a clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary or when a literal application of the plain language would frustrate the statute purpose or lead to an absurd result.because there is no ambiguity in the idea creation of a cause of action,we need not even look to legislative history 
child find provision 
appellants also argue that idea child find requirement permits this lawsuit.idea child find provision states 
all children with disabilities residing in the state,including children with disabilities who are homeless children or are wards of the state and children with disabilities attending private schools,regardless of the severity of their disabilities,and who are in need of special education and related services,are identified,located,and evaluated and a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services.
a a.appellants argue that,because the duty to identify children with disabilities falls squarely on schools,any parent should be able to bring a complaint to enforce this provision as this is clearly a matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.b a.
once again,appellants argument has no foothold in the plain language of the statute.the child find provision,by its own language,imposes a duty on the school to create procedures by which to identify children with disabilities.however,the obligation of this duty is still only to children with disabilities.appellants can not escape the plain language of the idea.moreover,under the evidence presented,it is clear that the school district satisfied its duty under the child find provision the school district evaluated on numerous occasions in accordance with its internal policies,and was found to be eligible for special education.
because the plain language of the statute only permits a child with a disability to bring a claim under the idea,who by her own admission is not disabled,can not sustain her action.
intentional discrimination under the ra and ada 
appellants also brought claims under of the ra and of the ada.section of the ra provides 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states,as defined in section of this title,shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 
a.section of the ada similarly states 
n o qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
both the ra and ada extend their protections not only to individuals who actually are disabled,but also to individuals who are regarded as having a
