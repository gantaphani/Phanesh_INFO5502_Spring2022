appellant lydia gonzalez challenges various summary judgment rulings which prompted the district court to dismiss the claims she filed against her employer,el dia,alleging that it violated the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and various puerto rico statutes.the record facts are related in the light most favorable to gonzalez.see conto concord,cir.
background 
in,at age,gonzalez was hired as a reporter by el nuevo dia,a puerto rico newspaper owned by el dia.during the ensuing years,her supervisor,maria luisa ferre,frequently stated,inter alia,that i gonzalez demeanor and couture were o ut of style and colorless,and her coiffure like phyllis diller was,manias de vieja,or old person ways ii she should have retired and gone to live with her grandchildren in florida long ago and iii due to her age she would not live long enough to see her grandson play major league baseball.
on another occasion,after ferre balked at gonzalez expression of interest in covering fashion shows,gonzalez stated you want me to look like a vogue model rather than responding,ferre simply stared at gonzalez.moreover,ferre routinely assigned younger reporters to cover the fashion shows and often told gonzalez dona lydia,i do know what i going to do with you.
similar remarks were made to gonzalez by jorge mercado,the director of the human resources department,who frequently stated that gonzalez had manias de vieja.moreover,often as gonzalez arrived at work in the morning,mercado would accost her in the lobby and inquire mom,can i help you or what did you come here for,to visit or to request a job in addition,when mercado visited the department in which gonzalez worked,he would make such comments as are you still here or i thought you had been discharged or terminated a long time ago.
following a serious injury in april,gonzalez applied to the state insurance fund sif for workers compensation benefits.the sif determined that gonzalez should take medical leave while receiving treatment and rehabilitative therapy.apparently concerned about gonzalez extended absence from work,ferre contacted the el dia human resources department regarding retirement packages which might be offered gonzalez.
on june,gonzalez discussed her health problems and her job with ferre.at one point,ferre asked gonzalez whether she would like to retire,adding look,you are already years old and your health is not good.when gonzalez responded that she did not wish to retire and instead offered to return to work immediately,ferre rejected her offer and advised gonzalez to take a vacation and return to work on july.as gonzalez had no remaining time,however,and ferre was well aware that gonzalez was in difficult financial straits,ferre offered to make an advance on gonzalez salary.gonzalez promptly related the conversation to her former supervisor,iris landron.on the following day,el dia issued a check to gonzalez.although gonzalez was surprised by the large amount and concerned about her ability to repay it,she nevertheless applied the entire advance toward her delinquent real estate mortgage.
on june,mercado asked gonzalez to come to his office,where she was presented with a resignation,release,and compensation agreement.mercado asserted that during her june meeting with ferre,gonzalez had agreed to execute these documents.gonzalez denied any such agreement,refused to sign,and informed mercado that she planned to return to work on june,rather than july.upon returning to work on june,gonzalez asked mercado to draft an agreement,which she then signed,promising to repay the advance by june.
on june,gonzalez and her union representatives met with mercado to explain that gonzalez had been unable to obtain a bank loan with which to repay her debt to el dia.mercado rejected gonzalez alternative offer either to tender certain valuable artwork in lieu of cash or repay the loan through payroll deductions.after asserting that gonzalez had breached the repayment agreement in bad faith,mercado suspended her without pay,albeit with benefits,health and life insurance,until such time as she repaid the advance.
as gonzalez was left without a source of income,yet required to mitigate damages,she accepted a position as a staff reporter with the san juan star,an el nuevo dia competitor,then submitted a grievance against el dia pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement cba.during the grievance proceeding,gonzalez admitted to having worked for the san juan star.thereafter,on july,mercado terminated gonzalez,citing the provision in the cba,r eporters working for the newspaper shall work exclusively on reporting news for the newspaper,and thus shall not write articles columns for any newspaper other than el nuevo dia.emphasis added.
in august,gonzalez initiated the present action against el dia,ferre,and mercado in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,alleging inter alia that her employment had been terminated in violation of the adea,the ada,and various commonwealth of puerto rico statutes.el dia counterclaimed for its advance to gonzalez.
ultimately,the district court entered summary judgment for el dia,dismissed all claims in the gonzalez complaint,and awarded el dia summary judgment on its counterclaim on appeal,gonzalez challenges the district court rulings which presaged the dismissal of her complaint.
discussion 
summary judgment rulings are reviewed de novo,after all the competent evidence and attendant reasonable inferences have been assessed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see conto,at moreover,rather than weigh the credibility of the testimony,we presume that a rational factfinder would accept it as stated by the witness.see centennial wireless,cir.
a.the adea claim 
under the adea,an employer may not discharge or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of her age.a gonzalez was required to comply with the familiar paradigm established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.thus,at the outset she needed to tender enough evidence to establish a prima facie claim.see suttle caribe,cir for present purposes,el dia acknowledges that gonzalez established a prima facie case under the adea.see id.
the required showing generates a rebuttable presumption that the violated the adea.whereupon,the burden of distinguished from the burden of to the to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.once this limited burden has been met by the,the presumption which attended the prima facie case vanishes and the claimant must adduce sufficient creditable evidence that age was a motivating factor in the challenged employment action.see id.the may meet her burden of proof by showing that the employer proffered reason for the challenged employment action was pretextual,see id.at,from which the factfinder in turn may,but need not,infer the alleged discriminatory animus.see fite digital equip,cir citing reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
el dia plainly met its circumscribed burden of production by identifying a nondiscriminatory basis for the gonzalez discharge,her acceptance of employment as a reporter for a competing newspaper,in direct violation of the provision in the cba,king preferred tech.group,cir family and medical leave act noting that violation of cba provision by employee was legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for adverse employment action taken by employer burmistrz city of chicago,d,same,under ada.accordingly,the burden then shifted back to gonzalez to prove that the nondiscriminatory basis assertedly relied upon by el dia was merely a pretext,and that age animus was the real reason for her termination.
at this stage in the proceedings,gonzalez can not dispute that she knowingly failed to comply with the pertinent cba provision,thereby entitling el dia to discharge her.see mechnig sears,roebuck,cir federal courts do not sit as a department that reexamines an entity business decisions.no matter how medieval a firm practices,no matter how its decisional process,no matter how mistaken the firm managers,the adea does not interfere.citations omitted accordingly,in order to establish that an animus nonetheless constituted a motivating factor in the decision to terminate her employment,gonzalez relies principally upon six varieties of evidence.
the ageist remarks 
gonzalez asserts that,prior to june,mercado and ferre engaged in a pattern of workplace remarks which demonstrate an animus.see supra section upon closer examination,however,the stray remarks she identified afforded an inadequate foundation for the requisite discriminatory intent.
in the first place,stray workplace remarks,as well as statements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process,normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.see straughn delta air lines,cir laurin providence,cir.the gonzalez deposition identified neither the time nor the context of the remarks made by mercado and ferre,nor could gonzalez state whether any particular remark had been made at a time proximate either to june or to her july termination.see,at noting circumscribed evidentiary weight of temporally remote statements.
secondly,it is far from clear that the alleged remarks bespeak any animus at all.see fernandes costa.masonry,cir noting that a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different discriminatory and the other not directly reflect illegal animus emphasis added speen crown clothing,cir a mbiguous remarks,tending to suggest animus based on age,are insufficient,standing alone,to prove an employer discriminatory intent.citations omitted emphasis added lehman prudential ins.of,cir same.
some statements,such as those made by mercado,merely displayed a measure of surprise that gonzalez was still employed at el dia,without either asserting or implying that she was too old to be working.moreover,mercado alleged use of the salutation mom though no doubt insensitive,perhaps even constituted a foundation for an adea claim,especially since these particular and advanced are not synonymous.
similarly,the remarks ferre allegedly directed at gonzalez are reasonably susceptible to interpretation simply as descriptions of the somewhat dowdy appearance and demeanor which gonzalez herself acknowledges.moreover,the spanish phrase manias de vieja old ways did not unambiguously connote that gonzalez was old,let alone too old,but rather that she acted in ways which did not appear in keeping with a person her age.see,pearson city of manhattan,d,holding that phrase old ways not evidence of adea animus,as such terms apply more to a person state of mind than to a person age martin ryder distribution,observing that simple references to the good old boys and are insufficient evidence of animus under adea,aff,cir.nor did any other statement,attributed either to mercado or ferre,unambiguously communicate an animus.rather,their remarks are readily susceptible to interpretations which are in no sense discriminatory.
the fashion show coverage 
similarly unavailing is the contention that the unexplained refusal to allow gonzalez to cover fashion shows demonstrated an animus.given her acknowledged penchant for clothing and hairstyles,it seems much more plausible to attribute el dia decision to the fact that gonzalez was insufficiently attuned to current fashions and,therefore,that her representation of el dia at fashion shows could very well reflect adversely upon its business image in such circles,rogosin mayor and city council of baltimore,d,noting that employer has right under adea to consider projection of negative public image.
the conspiracy 
further,gonzalez contends that since ferre acknowledges that she contacted mercado prior to june in regard to the retirement plan,both should be considered el dia decisionmakers,and that ferre remark on june,you are already years old and your health is not good accordingly constituted a discriminatory statement by a decisionmaker in the context of the adverse employment action taken against her by el dia.the record on appeal does not square with her contention,however.
instead,ferre simply stated that she contacted the human resources department prior to june regarding the retirement options available to gonzalez.there is no record support whatever for the notion that ferre stated that she had spoken with mercado about the matter.accordingly,no rational factfinder could construe ferre routine investigation into the retirement options available to gonzalez as either i somehow sinister or ii a rational basis for surmising that ferre played a meaningful role in mercado subsequent decisions to suspend and terminate gonzalez.
the remarks made by ferre on june 
on june,ferre adverted to gonzalez age while the two were discussing gonzalez vacation plans and the retirement offer which had been made to her.of course the mere tender of a retirement proposal does not evince the requisite discriminatory animus.see baralt nationwide mut.ins,cir,cert.denied,d pepsi cola of bottling,cir.moreover,even viewed in the light most favorable to gonzalez,ferre statement plainly conveyed the rational concern that retirement might prove the more prudent course,especially since gonzalez had been experiencing serious health problems,as well as financial difficulties.see hoffman mca,cir finding no animus in supervisor mere observation that employee was getting old.nor does gonzalez contend that she felt pressured to retire by ferre reference to age.sempier johnson higgins,cir a n early retirement program designed to force employees who reach a senior age to leave or face significant pressure to resign or retire might itself create an inference of age discrimination.
yet more importantly,of course,the june offer tendered by ferre is not the adverse employment action at issue.rather,the two pertinent employment decisions,the suspension without pay and the ensuing termination were made later,precipitated not by gonzalez age but by her acknowledged i delinquency in repaying the advance when due,and ii violation of the provision in the cba.
the allegedly false communication by ferre to mercado 
additionally,gonzalez stresses that,after june,ferre falsely informed mercado that gonzalez had accepted the retirement offer,thereby presumably causing the check to issue and corroborating gonzalez acceptance,all in an elaborate effort to force gonzalez to leave her employment.even viewed in the light most favorable to gonzalez,see conto,at,any such inference would be highly speculative at the very least.we explain.
first,although at summary judgment we must credit the assertion attributed to gonzalez on june she never agreed to retire,see,at does not follow that ferre spoke untruthfully.rather,ferre simply may have misinterpreted gonzalez stated intentions.but more importantly,we are unable to conceive a plausible motive for ferre to misrepresent gonzalez intentions.had gonzalez not desired or june retire,surely her mere acceptance of the loan itself would not have pressured her into executing the retirement agreement,particularly in light of i mercado ready acceptance of gonzalez own characterization of the june transaction as a loan transaction,and ii mercado willingness to accommodate her suggestion that a repayment agreement immediately be reduced to writing.finally,gonzalez characterization of the loan,as a mere salary advance,severely strains credulity,especially since she attested that she had been surprised by the large amount of the check and wondered how she would repay it.accordingly,the record is devoid of creditable evidence that ferre,in issuing the check to gonzalez,harbored any illicit motive whatever,let alone an animus.
the suspension without pay 
finally,gonzalez points to mercado rejection of her alternative proposals for repaying the loan,through payroll deductions or by tendering valuable artwork in lieu of cash.mercado suspended gonzalez for acting in bad faith,presumably because she had insisted,a mere seven days earlier,that mercado draw up a repayment agreement.inasmuch as gonzalez was well aware on june that she was in serious financial straits,her contention that she reasonably expecte
