plaintiff appellant hernán acevedo parrilla acevedo appeals the district court award of summary judgment to his former employer,novartis ex lax ex lax or the company,on his claims of age discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.upon careful review of the record,we find that it holds sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the company reason for terminating acevedo was pretextual,and that the true reason for his termination was discriminatory based on his age.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand.
background 
because our review is from a grant of summary judgment,we set forth the background facts,as supported by the record,in the light most favorable to the party,in this case,acevedo.vélez thermo king de,cir.
acevedo history at ex lax 
acevedo was born in and is a trained mechanical engineer.for twenty years,from to,acevedo worked in various posts as an engineer in the manufacturing,government,and pharmaceutical sectors,a trajectory that included the assumption of supervisory roles and exemplary performance evaluations.in,the general manager of ex lax a pharmaceutical company that manufactures products,including laxatives approached acevedo and offered him the position of maintenance and engineering manager at the company site located in humacao,puerto rico.acevedo accepted the position and held it for the next eleven years,until he was terminated in.at the time of his termination,acevedo was years old.
acevedo main responsibility as the maintenance and engineering manager at ex lax consisted of keeping the plant facilities in optimum condition,including facilities associated with the company production machinery,treatment plant,landscaping,and building services.acevedo department also provided engineering support to other departments in the company,supervised major contract works,and oversaw the provision of services such as pest control,cleaning,and sanitation by outside contractors.in all,the job required that acevedo supervise approximately twelve employees,including a maintenance technician,several mechanics,a stock room clerk,a groundskeeper,a packaging engineer,and a facilities project engineer.
for most of his career at ex lax,acevedo received positive performance reviews that fluctuated between overall ratings of fully met expectations and exceeding expectations.from to,acevedo was awarded bonuses of over in each of those years,except for,when his bonus totaled only.in,the year of his termination,both acevedo immediate supervisor at the time,carlos ceinos ceinos,and ceinos supervisor,iván martí martí,approved a bonus of for acevedo performance in.
ceinos superintendence as site leader 
in,ex lax hired ceinos for the position of site leader,which made him responsible for overall operations at the company puerto rico site.as part of his duties,ceinos evaluated the performance of all of ex lax department managers,including acevedo.ceinos was also charged with reviewing unplanned deviation reports generated by investigation teams at the site.these reports contained analyses of deviations from ex lax standard operating procedures sops,and were prepared in order to determine the root cause of particular deviations,establish appropriate corrective and preventive actions,and gauge the impact of the deviation on ex lax products.
according to elizabeth rodríguez rodríguez,ex lax human resources hr manager from march to may,upon assuming the role of site leader,ceinos asked rodríguez to investigate the inclinations of employees who had reached retirement age to determine what their wishes were regarding leaving the company.rodríguez testified that this request was part of ceinos new recruitment plan,instituted for the purpose of proceed ing to substitute the persons who were of retirement age.in order to qualify for retirement,employees had to have accumulated at least five years of service with the company and be years of age or older.although rodríguez stated that t here was no pressure as such exerted upon employees to retire as part of ceinos plan,she gave at least one example of an employee at retirement age who chose not to retire after being asked and was subsequently moved to another department,resulting in what rodríguez characterized as a demotion.
information provided by ex lax in answers to interrogatories reveals that,after the year in which ceinos became site leader the company hired approximately employees,of whom were less than forty years of age.in the same period,ex lax fired only employees,of whom were older than forty.
c.the and incidents 
not long after ceinos became site leader,acevedo began to experience performance problems at the company.ceinos became aware of a number of incidents involving acevedo department that occurred from to and factored these into acevedo performance reviews.in,such events included the recorded presence of rodents in the chocolate manufacturing and packaging areas,the recorded presence of bacteria in two lots of ex lax gas x super extra strength soft gel,and a packaging process deviation.
the first of these incidents transpired in january of,when a rodent was found in the packaging area near the chocolate line,causing production to be put on hold.a subsequent investigation conducted by ex lax personnel,and in which acevedo participated,determined that the rodent had likely entered the packaging area during a building renovation that began on december,during which contractors accessed the plant through the cafeteria emergency exit door and the employees entrance door.the investigation team found that these doors had remained open for longer than necessary,but the resulting report did not specifically mention a mistake or error on the part of acevedo or his department.
later,in june of,an employee from one source,ex lax building services contractor,found traces of ceiling tile on the floor of the chocolate manufacturing area.it was later confirmed that this was the result of rodent activity in the ceiling above the chocolate room.after the setting of traps and the capture of one small rodent,a maintenance technician found a hole in an unused exhaust fan in the ceiling of the quality assurance laboratory.the exhaust fan was immediately removed and the hole sealed.a subsequent investigation concluded it was highly probable that the rodent gained access through the previously uncovered hole.the discovery of this latter rodent activity caused the company to reject,or decommission,a batch of chocolate laxative.
the second event took place in september and involved the detection through laboratory tests of a bacteria in two lots of ex lax gas x super extra strength soft gel.this triggered the quality assurance department rejection and disposal of the lots.an investigation team comprised of ex lax personnel,including acevedo,later concluded that the bacteria could have originated either from mold contamination in closed and unused bathrooms located near the production area,or from the fact that one of the operators who participated in the inspection of the lots was confirmed to be sick at the time of the inspection.acevedo indicated through testimony that contamination in the bathrooms could have been prevented had there been an sop in place regarding their daily cleaning.
the third and final event also occurred in september,when the personnel from acevedo department were installing and setting up a new brush box for the packaging of a lot of gas x maximum strength soft gels.during the,they became aware that the positioning of the brushes inside the brush box was not correct,so they changed it.they then installed a new acrylic box in the brush box and evaluated the effect of the acrylic box on the packaging operation.although these actions did not have a negative impact on the quality of ex lax product,both actions were taken without the appropriate deviation approval from the production and quality assurance departments and,therefore,violated ex lax change control procedure.the record reveals that some of the personnel involved in this event may not have received adequate training in the change control procedures.after the brush box incident,all personnel,supervisors,and managers in acevedo department were so trained.
ceinos testified that he became aware of each of the incidents through their corresponding investigative unplanned deviation reports.he also indicated that he attributed responsibility for each of the incidents to acevedo based on his general job description and responsibilities.accordingly,ceinos recorded them in acevedo annual performance review,in which he gave acevedo a low overall rating of,or partially met expectations.as a result,ex lax required that acevedo complete a performance improvement plan pip,lasting from march to june.the pip identified acevedo specific performance problems and outlined the personalized improvement plan that he was expected to complete.according to the terms of the pip,ex lax gave acevedo ninety days to successfully complete the plan and achieve a status of fully meeting expectations in order to retain his current position at the company,with the caveat that ex lax always reserved the right to take appropriate action,including termination,if acevedo improvement did not continue.acevedo complied with the requirements of his pip,and ceinos subsequently rated him as fully met expectations in both the and annual performance reviews.
in ceinos again held acevedo responsible for a number of incidents which he deemed to have affected acevedo performance.the first of these incidents involved a change in equipment that resulted in total organic carbon toc levels above the acceptable limit in the purified water used for production.as a result,ex lax had to discard almost forty thousand dollars worth of manufactured products.the record reflects that acevedo was on vacation at the time this occurred and that another employee,angel alsina alsina,was assigned supervisory duties during his absence.
the second incident involved the potential contamination of a chocolate batch after a fumigation or fogging procedure was performed in the chocolate manufacturing area by ecolab,ex lax pest control services contractor.the company quality assurance and compliance departments had to decommission the batch of chocolate prepared on the day of the fogging.ex lax stated that this represented a loss of just over ninety thousand dollars to the company.the unplanned deviation report indicated that the ecolab employee who applied the insecticide may not have been given clear instructions due to an inadequate written procedure addressing what to do before,during,and after a pest control activity takes place.
third,and finally,based on two routine walks he took to evaluate the plant facilities,ceinos found that there was a general lack of cleanliness and organization in the spare parts room,the machine shop,and the purified water room.ultimately,acevedo received a mixed evaluation in his annual performance review ceinos overall rating in the objectives portion amounted to fully met expectations,while his overall rating in the values and objectives section reached only partially met expectations.
ageist remarks and acevedo termination 
acevedo alleges that on two occasions,in august and december of,ceinos commented to him that the main problem at the ex lax plant were the persons who had been in the company for a long time,because those persons were not performing.acevedo testified that ceinos said this in the context of their conversation about the problems that had existed during the year and ceinos evaluation of his performance.
on february,acevedo was terminated from his employment at ex lax,without prior notice and effective immediately acevedo testified that,at the time of his discharge,the reasons ceinos gave for his termination were the fogging incident,the purified water or toc incident,and the disorganization of the rooms in other words,the incidents.ceinos testified that,although he never explicitly warned acevedo that these incidents could lead to his termination,he had related to acevedo that too many incidents had occurred with his department,that they were still having problems because the department would not comply with the procedures,and that the maintenance and engineering personnel apparently were not well trained.
acevedo replacement 
in february,year old mariely rivera rivera was hired to replace acevedo as maintenance and engineering manager.just as acevedo had before her,rivera reported directly to ceinos.ceinos testified that rivera interview took place before december of,prior to acevedo dismissal.
in october of,an internal audit of rivera department was conducted,which revealed persistent violations of ex lax sops.these violations included the department failure to follow proper documentation practices,conduct certain procedures relating to the purified water system,complete cleaning and sanitation in certain areas with the required frequency,and complete certain pest control procedures on the required monthly basis.many of the same deficiencies would also be recorded in a subsequent internal audit report dated may.in addition,ex lax records reveal a july unplanned deviation report indicating that an increase in mold and yeast counts had been detected in the packaging area.one of the root causes identified for this deviation was improper area cleaning and sanitation.notwithstanding these incidents,rivera received an appraisal of fully met expectations in her annual performance evaluation,signed by ceinos.the evaluation did not reference any of the aforementioned infractions relating to facilities management.
in,a string of incidents occurred in which animals,including numerous insects,a lizard,and rats,entered the plant.these were documented by investigation teams in at least four separate unplanned deviation reports.the reports concluded that the entrance of the animals was caused by a major construction project that was being conducted in the manufacturing area.ceinos admitted that he had knowledge of these incidents at the time.nonetheless,rivera testimony reflects that ceinos did not comment on the incidents in her performance evaluations that year,and that no employee was held responsible for the same.ceinos awarded rivera an overall manager appraisal equivalent to fully met expectations in her annual performance review.
procedural history 
on february,acevedo brought this suit against ex lax,asserting that his former employer terminated him due to his age,in violation of the adea and various puerto rico statutes.on march,ex lax moved for summary judgment,arguing that acevedo failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because he could not show that he was fired despite having met the company legitimate work expectations.ex lax also contended that,even if acevedo could make such a showing,he could not put forth sufficient proof to establish that the company proffered reason for his termination failure to meet his employer legitimate work expectations was pretextual.acevedo opposed ex lax motion by reaffirming the pretextual nature of the company reasons for his dismissal and pointing to what he deemed sufficient direct proof of discrimination.on september,the district court granted ex lax summary judgment motion,dismissing both the federal and supplemental claims.see acevedo padilla novartis ex lax,d.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.sánchez rodríguez v.at t mobility of,cir quoting kuperman wrenn,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we independently weigh the merits of the motion without deference to the reasoning of the district court.hughes boston mut.life ins,cir.
summary judgment is properly granted only where the movant in this case,ex lax shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.thus,to survive summary judgment,acevedo must establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his dismissal was motivated by discrimination.see carroll xerox,cir once the moving party has pointed to the absence of adequate evidence supporting the nonmoving party case,the nonmoving party must come forward with facts that show a genuine issue for trial.a genuine issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party,and a material fact is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.calero cerezo dep t of justice,cir.
compliance with local rule 
as a preliminary matter,we note that in considering the parties filings in support of and opposition to ex lax motion for summary judgment,the district court determined that both acevedo and ex lax ran afoul of the district of puerto rico rule,local rule c.see civ.c requiring party opposing summary judgment to submit a separate,short,and concise statement of material facts admitting,denying or qualifying the corresponding facts that support the motion,with record citations in support.acevedo submitted an opposing statement of material facts,but included additional information as to each opposed fact that did not specifically correlate to ex lax proposed facts.see id.indicating that opposing statement may contain in a separate section additional facts emphasis added see also carreras sajo,garcía partners,cir.ex lax,in turn,acted in violation of the local rule because it cit ed numerous pages of its reply when opposing acevedo facts,instead of providing concise and specific responses.acevedo padilla,d at.
as a result,the district court,in an appropriate exercise of its discretion,ruled that it would disregard any additional facts provided by acevedo when denying or qualifying ex lax statement of uncontested facts.id.at.however,to this determination it tacked on a ruling that the supplemental facts properly included in acevedo separate section of additional facts would nonetheless be deemed admitted when supported by the record.id.the district court did not explain what effect,if any,ex lax own transgression to the local rule had on the court analysis of the facts.
our review of the district court application of local rule is for abuse of discretion.carreras,at.ex lax generally points to this ruling by the district court to support its position on appeal,but it does not appear to us that the district court ruling had any practical effect on its summary judgment determination.indeed,the district court ultimately relied on acevedo separate section of additional facts,as references to that document can be found throughout the opinion but it did so only when supported by the record,and not properly controverted by ex lax.acevedo padilla,d at.we can discern no error by the district court and,for purposes of this appeal,we have likewise only considered those facts additional or otherwise properly presented and supported,per local rule.
acevedo age discrimination claim 
the adea and mcdonnell douglas 
the adea provides that it is unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against him with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a.a plaintiff asserting a claim under the adea has the burden of establishing that age was the cause of the employer adverse action.gross fbl fin,d.such a plaintiff is not required to proffer direct evidence of discrimination,and may meet his burden through circumstantial evidence.to be sure,we have acknowledged that adea plaintiffs rarely possess smoking gun evidence to prove their employers discriminatory motivations.vélez,at quoting arroyo audifred verizon wireless,cir.in the absence of direct evidence of age discrimination,we evaluate adea claims under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d cameron idearc media,cir.
in the first of the three mcdonnell douglas stages,the plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.in an adea action this requires a showing that he or she was at least years old at the time of discharge that he or she was qualified for the position but was nevertheless fired and the employer subsequently filled the position.id.citing vélez,at.doing so gives rise to an inference that the employer discriminated due to the plaintiff advanced years.mesnick,cir.if the plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case,the burden shifts in the second stage to the employer,who must then produce a legitimate,reason for termination.cameron,at.if the employer is able to do this,the ball returns to the plaintiff court,in which he must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant alleged nondiscriminatory reason was in fact a pretext for discrimination.goncalves plymouth cnty.sheriff dep t,cir.
the prima facie case 
as the district court noted,acevedo is a person over forty years of age,who was fired by his employer and subsequently replaced by someone younger.he therefore neatly satisfies three of the four prongs in the prima facie case.the only contentious question on appeal is whether acevedo meets the second prong that he was qualified for the position that he held.we linger briefly here to clarify some points that might have been obfuscated by the district court analysis.
ex lax theory of the case is that acevedo termination was a lawful business decision,unrelated to his age,that was based on acevedo failure to comply with the company established quality control standards and,hence,with its legitimate job expectations.in particular,ex lax points to the and incidents that occurred in the maintenance and engineering department,memorialized in unplanned deviation reports,and on which ceinos allegedly based his termination decision.this constitutes ex lax alleged nondiscriminatory reason for dismissing acevedo,which comes into play at the second stage of our mcdonnell douglas analysis,discussed infra.however,ex lax argued before the district court that these facts,if believed,meant acevedo also failed the second prong of the prima facie case.
although the district court ultimately determined that acevedo had established a prima facie case under the adea,it did so only after considering ex lax alleged reason for dismissal,assessing acevedo proffered counterpoints,and concluding that it was unclear whether acevedo had been responsible for several of the incidents.acevedo padilla,d at.this constituted error on the district court part.see vélez,at finding as error that the district court accepted for the purpose of the prima facie analysis the employer stated reason for firing the plaintiff as proof that he was not qualified for the job meléndez autogermana,cir holding that we can not consider the employer alleged nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment action when analyzing the prima facie case quoting wexler white fine furniture,cir en banc.a plaintiff is not required,at the prima facie stage,to disprove the defendant proffered nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment action.we have explained that doing so bypass es the analysis and deprive s the plaintiff of the opportunity to show such reason was in actuality a pretext designed to mask discrimination.vélez,at quoting wexler,at see also meléndez,at same.
a plaintiff prima facie burden under the qualified prong of the prima facie case,see cameron,at,is met if he presents evidence which,if believed,prove s that he was doing his chores proficiently.freeman package mach,cir finding the second prong met despite defendant adamantine insistence that plaintiff job performance was not up to snuff see also hebert mohawk rubber,cir finding plaintiff prima facie burden met where,despite employer challenge of his account regarding the adequacy of his job performance,plaintiff adduced a quantum and quantity of evidence of his competence sufficient to prevail if a jury believed his version of the facts and disbelieved defendant.in this case,the record reflects that acevedo is a trained mechanical engineer with prior,experience in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors,including experience as a supervisor.moreover,before his termination from ex lax,acevedo had a long history of employment at the company,spanning an period,with overall positive reviews.we find that these facts are enough to meet what we have regularly described as a low standard for the prima facie showing in a discrimination case.vélez,at quoting zapata matos reckitt colman,cir see also rathbun autozone,cir describing standard as modest.
ex lax explanation and acevedo showing of discrimination 
acevedo having triggered the rebuttable presumption that ex lax violated the adea,ex lax now has the burden of production as distinguished from the burden of proof to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment action.gonzález,at.we have already discussed ex lax contention that acevedo termination was a business decision unrelated to his age.ex lax argues that the decision was based on acevedo supervisor understanding reflected in ceinos deposition testimony that acevedo consistently failed to comply with the duties and objectives of his position,particularly with regard to the observance of quality control standards in connection with the plant equipment and facilities.ex lax briefing points to all of the previously referenced and incidents,which were recorded in investigative and unplanned deviation reports,and which it contends were within the scope of acevedo responsibilities and had a negative impact on the plant operations.we have no trouble finding on this basis that ex lax has articulated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for firing acevedo.see,dávila de para la difusión pública,cir finding that sworn statement by director of employer legal division that appellant was terminated due to poor work performance by itself,provide d sufficient basis for the district court conclusion that the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory motive for the appellant discharge.
thus,we reach the third and final phase of,at which point the mcdonnell douglas framework falls by the wayside.mesnick,at.the court focus now turns to the ultimate issue,which is whether after assessing all of the evidence on the record in the light most favorable to acevedo he has raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether the termination of his employment was motivated by age discrimination.domínguez cruz,at.in order to meet this burden,acevedo must offer some minimally sufficient evidence,direct or indirect,both of pretext and of ex lax discriminatory animus.mesnick,at emphasis added.
we first consider acevedo attestation of pretext,having in mind that courts should exercise particular caution before granting summary judgment for employers on such issues as pretext,motive,and intent.santiago ramos centennial wireless,cir citing hodgens dynamics,cir.
acevedo evidence of pretext 
acevedo argues that ex lax stated reasons for his dismissal betray the element of pretext because they are both internally inconsistent and incompatible with acevedo performance record.on this point acevedo has met the minimally sufficient standard to proceed with his case.we have consistently stated that mere questions regarding the employer business judgment are insufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext.see webber int l paper,cir a n employee opinion of the efficacy of an employment decision,standing alone,can not supplant the employer business judgment.however,acevedo has presented here more than a simple disagreement with the correctness of ceinos decisions he has proffered evidence sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether ceinos himself truly believed acevedo performance was unsatisfactory.see,gray new england,cir explaining that in assessing pretext the court focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker,whether the decisionmaker perceived the plaintiff as violating company policies and whether this perception was credible and reasonable.
to begin,while it is undisputed that acevedo job description encompassed a duty to oversee the general upkeep of the plant facilities,there are material issues of fact as to whether acevedo was to blame for four of the incidents involving plant facilities that the company has cited as triggers for his termination.the district court noted as much in its opinion and order,which pinpointed as problematic for ex lax position the record surrounding the microbial incident,for which more than one possible cause was identified in the unplanned deviation report the packaging process deviation,which had no negative effect on the quality of ex lax products the toc incident,during which acevedo was not on duty and the fogging incident,which the investigation report concluded was due to inadequate written procedures for pest control operations see acevedo padilla,d at.we must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of acevedo at this stage.see sánchez rodríguez,at.the fact that there is uncertainty regarding whether acevedo was responsible for the incidents indicates that there is a question for a jury to resolve as to whether the employer did in fact rely on these incidents in making its termination decision.see domínguez cruz,at inconsistencies in employer performance explanation,including doubts whether plaintiff was directly responsible for two of the alleged violations,deemed relevant to finding of pretext.
furthermore,p roof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination.williams raytheon,cir quoting reeves sanderson plumbing,d internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,acevedo has sufficiently demonstrated potential inconsistencies in ceinos testimony as to both the microbial and toc incidents.a reasonable factfinder could conclude that these inconsistencies call into question ceinos reasons for terminating acevedo,namely,that acevedo was not complying with the duties and responsibilities of his position.for instance,regarding the microbial incident,ceinos stated that it was acevedo responsibility to have an sop in place to ensure that the bathrooms remained adequately cleaned.however,ceinos also stated that he could not recall whether there was in fact an sop in place at the time the incident occurred.in addition,with regard to the toc incident,ceinos testified that he held acevedo accountable despite the fact that he was off duty on that day,because acevedo was ultimately responsible for mak ing sure that the person he put in charge was qualified to exercise th at function.ceinos nonetheless later acknowledged that alsina the person who was put in charge and actually authorized the change in equipment is a very qualified person who still works for ex lax.the employer contemporaneous beliefs are a vital consideration because i n assessing pretext,a court focus must be on the perception of the decisionmaker,that is,whether the employer believed its stated reason to be credible.mesnick,at quoting gray,at see feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir t he question is not whether the plaintiff was actually performing below expectations,but whether the employer believed that he was.
acevedo also argues that pretext may be inferred from ceinos reliance on the microbial incident and the packaging process deviation of because both incidents had been previously addressed through acevedo pip.according to rodríguez deposition testimony,under ex lax hr policy,if an employee succeeded at a pip,the factors that led to the pip could not be used in support of a termination decision.see kouvchinov parametric tech,cir noting that pretext can be demonstrated through a showing that an employer has deviated inexplicably from one of its standard business practices,yet finding the principle inapplicable in the specific case,where plaintiff did not show existence of a standard policy or practice.on the other hand,the pip itself indicated the possibility of adverse action,including dismissal,against acevedo if his improvement did not continue.this evidence presents a contested issue of material fact as to ex lax disciplinary procedures,and it should be for a jury to decide whether rodríguez testimony about the pip procedure is credible.
it is undisputed,however,that acevedo successfully complied with the pip,was rated as having fully met expectations in both the and annual performance reviews,and despite the incidents that ceinos points to received a bonus of for his performance in that was approved by ceinos himself these seemingly incongruous facts might lead a reasonable juror to disbelieve ceinos contention that his decision to terminate acevedo was based purely on a poor performance record.see santiago ramos,at a plaintiff can establish pretext by showing weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons such that a factfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.quoting hodgens,at.
acevedo raises an additional,correlative argument that his dismissal deviated from ex lax policy requiring adherence to a progressive disciplinary program.both rodríguez and pabellón testified that ex lax disciplinary actions normally followed successive steps,beginning with an orientation to the employee,followed by a series of verbal and written warnings,a potential suspension,and ultimately ending with dismissal.pursuant to this policy,all disciplinary actions including termination had to be approved by the hr department,and supervisors had to prepare informative memorandums indicating the reasons for termination prior to an employee dismissal.none of these steps were taken in acevedo case.e vidence that standard procedure was not followed is directly relevant to acevedo burden of demonstrating pretext.brennan gte gov t,cir.we acknowledge,as the district court did,see acevedo padilla,d at,that other testimony by pabellón suggested that ex lax progressive disciplinary policy did not apply to exempt or management employees,who were allegedly routinely chastised through memorandums performance reviews.this was arguably the method employed in acevedo case,but it does not answer the question why the decision to dismiss acevedo did not require submission of the reasons for termination to the hr department,a step that,in pabellón estimation,did apply to all employees.see lattimore polaroid,cir holding,in a case involving allegations that had deviated from its established policies and practices,that evidence of pretext,although thin,disputed and susceptible to varying interpretations,is sufficient to create a jury question.
without much question,acevedo has offered at least minimally sufficient evidence that the reasons given by ex lax for his discharge were pretextual.mesnick,at.
acevedo evidence of discriminatory intent 
while the above evidence could support the conclusion that ex lax explanations for acevedo discharge were pretextual,this is not enough for acevedo to defeat summary judgment he must also show that the pretextual reasons were intended to cover up the employer real motive age discrimination.id.at.we find that acevedo proof,taken in the aggregate,is sufficient to raise a question of material fact regarding whether the true reason behind his termination was age discrimination.
first,we consider acevedo argument that certain comments made to him by ceinos in august and december of constituted ageist remarks.acevedo contends,and ex lax concedes,that ceinos told him that the problem at ex lax lay in the fact that employees who had been in the company for a long time were not performing.acevedo testimony reflects that the context of these remarks concerned the problems that existed at the company during the year and an evaluation that ceinos would be conducting of acevedo work.acevedo maintains that ceinos was specifically referring to the older employees who worked in the maintenance group,and that these comments,combined with their proximity to his dismissal,connote a discriminatory intent.ex lax,in turn,argues that ceinos remarks were unrelated to the decisional process itself,were not reasonably proximate to the date of acevedo discharge,and do not necessarily imply an illegal animus.
it is settled that statements made by decisionmakers can evidence age discrimination,kelley airborne freight,cir,and ceinos was certainly the decisionmaker in acevedo case.see id.at,remark that it would be a good time to get rid of some of the older mediocre managers had a direct bearing on age discrimination because the speaker made the decision to terminate.while the remarks in this case were arguably,ceinos did not allude to acevedo or any employee actual age when he made the comment to the extent that the comments were made in reference to acevedo performance and focused on his department,they could also be interpreted by a reasonable factfinder as referring to the older employees who had remained longer on the job see hodgens,at,statements by supervisors carrying the inference of animus against protected classes of people or conduct are clearly probative of pretext,even if that inference is not the only one that could be drawn from the comment.emphasis added citations omitted.
moreover,in evaluating such remarks made by a decisionmaker,this court has considered their temporal proximity and causal connection to the decision to discharge.meléndez,at affirming plaintiff inability to establish that employer remarks exhibited discriminatory animus because of failure to prove that comments were temporally and causally connected to his termination.drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to acevedo,the remarks were made,at most,six months prior to his termination and expressed ceinos displeasure at older employees long tenure at the company.a jury could therefore infer that ceinos statements were temporally and causally related to acevedo discharge.see,walton nalco chem,cir finding that decisionmaker remark made some time in was directly related and temporally proximate to termination occurring in february 
second,acevedo contends that the company treated him differently from his younger replacement,rivera,which constitutes evidence of age discrimination.indeed,a n employer disparate treatment of employees in response to behavior that legitimately offends the employer can provide evidence of discriminatory animus.vélez,at.however,t o successfully allege disparate treatment,a plaintiff must show that others similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.kosereis rhode island,cir quoting conward cambridge sch,cir.
because rivera replaced acevedo as maintenance and engineering manager,it is clear that the two were similarly situated at the company.that is,it is undisputed that rivera came into the same responsibilities that acevedo had prior to his termination.despite this,rivera was not reprimanded or disciplined for incidents that acevedo contends were similar to the problems that arose during his tenure.for instance,in,after rivera took charge of the maintenance and engineering department,an internal audit of the department revealed persistent violations of the company sops and good manufacturing practices.these included departmental failures to follow procedures involving the purified water system,complete cleaning and sanitation adequately,and execute pest control procedures with the required frequency.a july unplanned deviation report also indicated that an increase in mold and yeast counts had been detected in the packaging area due to improper area cleaning and sanitation,and unplanned deviation reports from reflected various instances in which pests,such as insects,a lizard,and rats,entered the plant.despite admitting his knowledge of these events at the time they occurred,ceinos did not hold rivera accountable for them in her performance evaluations,nor were any other employees reprimanded for the same.we find that,based on this evidence,a jury could infer that the disparate treatment alleged by acevedo existed,exposing the pretextual nature of ex lax proffered explanation for firing acevedo and revealing that ex lax true motivation was age discrimination.vélez,at.
the district court rejected acevedo disparate treatment argument because it found rivera infractions regarding the pest incidents were not comparable to acevedo.see acevedo padilla,d at along the same lines,ex lax argues that rivera was not similarly situated to acevedo because the problems under rivera governance that were reflected in the internal audit and unplanned deviation reports of and were distinguishable from the kinds of deficiencies ceinos had previously held acevedo accountable for.however,these are issues of fact and credibility,and acevedo has presented sufficient evidence to allow a jury to decide whether the incidents were similar enough to support his allegation of disparate treatment.a reasonable factfinder could infer that the difference in ceinos treatment of acevedo and rivera,who was a much younger replacement,tends to prove the employer discriminatory animus toward acevedo.see,id.at where four employees,including the plaintiff,admitted to stealing property from the employer,but only the plaintiff was fired,a jury could reasonably distrust the employer given reason for the firing and conclude that it was a pretext for age discrimination see mesnick,at deployment of younger replacements may be considered as probative,circumstantial evidence of age discrimination citing hebert,at.
finally,we examine acevedo contention that a series of employment decisions made by ex lax beginning in constitute an invidious pattern of discharges or forced early retirements that hints at discriminatory animus on the part of ex lax.medina munoz reynolds tobacco,cir.acevedo first points to the following statistics,gathered from ex lax employment records after ceinos became site leader in,the company hired approximately employees,of whom were younger than years of age in the same period,employees were fired,of whom were over years old.we have clarified that statistics,when considered in isolation and outside of context,are not probative of age discrimination.see,cruz ramos sun oil,cir noting that appellant burden to show employer discriminatory animus can not be carried simply by a comparison of ages within a sample that lacks statistical significance.in this vein,ex lax argues that acevedo reliance on the company hiring data is unsound because,as the district court found,acevedo failed to provide information regarding the pool of applicants or the composition of the relevant labor market.acevedo padilla,d at see leblanc great am.ins,cir t he fact that recently hired employees are younger than the plaintiff is not necessarily evidence of discriminatory intent,but may simply reflect a younger available work force.we can not argue with this reasoning because our case law makes clear that acevedo should have introduced evidence regarding the relevant labor market in order to put ex lax hiring data into context.id.failure to indicate whether qualified older employees were available or applied for those jobs noted as flaw in the statistical evidence that recent hires were younger than the plaintiff for discriminatory reasons quoting simpson midland ross,cir.notwithstanding,it is relatively straightforward for one to draw statistical significance from the separately adduced fact that,after ceinos arrival in,almost all of the fired employees out of a total of people were over forty years of age.a reasonable inference may be drawn from this evidence for the existence of the kind of pattern suggested by acevedo.
in any event,this is not the only proof relied upon by acevedo to substantiate his theory that his termination was part of a greater pattern of discharges or forced retirements.medina munoz,at.in addition to the reasonable inference that may be drawn from the documented firings that occurred at the plant soon after ceinos arrival,acevedo offers the testimony of rodríguez,who indicated that,upon beginning work as site leader in,ceinos instituted a new recruitment plan with the purpose of substitut ing the persons who were of retirement age.as part of the recruitment plan,rodríguez stated that ceinos asked her to investigate how long employees at or nearing retirement age planned to stay at the company.she explained that although in effectuating this plan,hr did not pressure employees to retire,at least one employee at retirement age who was asked to retire early,and chose not to,was subsequently moved to another department and effectively demoted.
ceinos,in contrast,averred that it was rodríguez who brought to his attention a concern that there were a substantial number of employees in key positions that were near retirement age,and that this situation could result in a number of key positions being vacant simultaneously.as a result,ceinos contends that he asked rodríguez to prepare a plan to prevent this potential situation from coming to fruition.see wallace tanner recognition,cir noting that company officials are permitted to gather information relevant to personnel planning without raising the specter of age discrimination.
we acknowledge that an offer of early retirement is not,by itself,evidence of discriminatory animus and that s omething more must be shown that would tie the decision to offer early retirement to discrimination.alvarez fonseca pepsi cola of bottling,cir.notwithstanding,on a motion for summary judgment,we must draw all inferences in favor of the.see hodgens,at.a jury could find that the statistics,considered in conjunction with the recruitment plan about which rodríguez testified and the rest of the plaintiff circumstantial proof discredit ceinos stated reason for the discharge.see hebert,at finding that plaintiff defeated summary judgment,after considering admittedly weak data proffered by plaintiff that beginning of supervisor tenure coincided with dismissals of workers in protected class,where plaintiff case for pretext did not rest on general pattern data alone,and relied on other suggestive scraps of circumstantial evidence.
iii.conclusion 
in sum,based on the totality of the record,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented on summary judgment from which a jury could draw the permissible inference that ex lax claimed reasons for terminating acevedo were pretextual and that the decision was the result of discriminatory animus.we are particularly moved to this conclusion by inconsistencies between ex lax stated reasons for dismissal and acevedo performance record at the company,the lack of credibility that may be ascribed by a jury to certain of ceinos justifications for dismissal,and,most importantly,the fact that in response to arguably similar conduct by acevedo younger replacement,ex lax took no disciplinary action.
because acevedo proffer on summary judgment is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether discrimination motivated the adverse employment action a question that a jury,and not this court,should solve we must reverse the district court determination in ex lax favor and remand.
reversed and remanded.
ex lax performance reviews contained both objective and subjective evaluations,respectively titled the objectives and values and behaviors sections.for each performance review,the employee execution in various areas would be rated under both sections.this entailed rating the accomplishment of specific objectives,compliance with protocols and the fulfillment of particular qualities or values,competence and leadership.ratings were given on a scale of through partially met expectations,fully met expectations,and exceeded expectations,and were adjudicated for distinct areas as well as tallied for an overall rating.
as we will explain infra,ex lax maintains that its bonuses are not tied to the individual performance per se,but rather respond to a myriad of considerations,including the performance of the company as a whole.
although he was hr manager at the time,josé pabellón pabellón could not explain why acevedo did not receive prior notice of his termination through a letter of dismissal.he also did not remember whether acevedo was placed on a progressive discipline program prior to his termination.pabellón testified that he and ceinos did not discuss acevedo dismissal,nor did pabellón recommend it.
although acevedo claims that certain statements made by ceinos in august and december of constituted ageist remarks,on appeal he does not characterize his testimony about those remarks as direct evidence of age discrimination sufficient to carry his burden that
