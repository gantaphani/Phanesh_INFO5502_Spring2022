plaintiff is a state prisoner who challenges the constitutionality of d,a part of the prison litigation reform act of plra,as violating his right to equal protection of the laws under the fifth amendment due process clause.the challenged provision caps the attorneys fee award that a successful prisoner litigant may recover from the government in a civil rights action at percent of the value of the prisoner monetary judgment.the district court upheld the constitutionality of this provision,and we now affirm.
jamey wilkins,the plaintiff,was a prisoner in the custody of the north carolina department of correction now the north carolina department of public safety.on june,he was incarcerated at the lanesboro correctional institute in polkton,north carolina,when officer alexander gaddy,the defendant,escorted another inmate past his cell.wilkins and officer gaddy became embroiled in an argument that resulted in officer gaddy opening wilkins cell and physically subduing him.according to wilkins,officer gaddy lifted and then slammed him to the concrete floor where,once pinned,officer gaddy punched,kicked,kneed,and choked wilkins until the officer was removed by another member of the corrections staff.wilkins alleged that the altercation caused him a bruised heel,back and neck pains,headaches,and other health complications.
following the incident,wilkins filed a pro se civil rights suit under claiming that officer gaddy maliciously and sadistically assaulted him with excessive force in violation of the eighth amendment.the district court dismissed the suit when it concluded that wilkins had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he had not alleged more than a de minimis injury.we affirmed.wilkins gaddy,app x cir.
the supreme court granted wilkins petition for certiorari and reversed,holding that the core judicial inquiry in eighth amendment claims is not focused on the extent of the injury sustained by the plaintiff but rather the nature of the force used in the purported assault.wilkins gaddy,d.although it remanded for further proceedings,the supreme court express ed no view on the underlying merits of wilkins claim and noted that the relatively modest nature of his alleged injuries will no doubt limit the damages he may recover.id.at.
wilkins obtained representation upon remand from north carolina prisoner legal services and proceeded to trial.the jury returned a verdict holding officer gaddy responsible for using excessive force against wilkins,but declined to award compensatory or punitive damages.instead,it awarded only nominal damages of.the district court entered judgment for wilkins in the amount of.wilkins,as the prevailing party,filed a motion under the provision of for in attorneys fees.while acknowledging that fee awards in prisoner lawsuits are capped by d,wilkins argued that this section of the plra violated the fifth amendment equal protection component by irrationally treating prisoner and litigants differently.
the magistrate judge to whom the matter had been referred calculated the award pursuant to d and recommended that wilkins lawyers be awarded.wilkins reiterated his equal protection challenge before the district court,but the court found d to be a constitutional exercise of legislative authority.specifically,the district court held that the classification between prisoners and in d was rationally related to legitimate government interests,including reducing marginal prisoner lawsuits and protecting the public fisc.it further noted that the rational basis standard of review commands judicial deference to legislative acts unless the relationship of the chosen means to the desired ends is bereft of logical support.consequently,the district court declined to strike down d,adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,and awarded wilkins counsel in attorneys fees.wilkins now appeals.
wilkins seeks the full award of in attorneys fees for his counsel.to that end,he contends that the fee cap in d creates a distinction between prisoner and litigants that can not stand under the fifth amendment.first,wilkins does admit that courts do not review classifications involving prisoners with strict scrutiny.he asserts,however,that statutes governing inmates still require a heightened standard of review because of prisoners unique characteristics.second,he argues that d fails even ordinary rational basis review because it arbitrarily and irrationally discriminates against prisoner civil rights litigants in that the fee cap bears no rational relationship to the admittedly legitimate governmental objectives at which it is aimed.appellant br.we are not persuaded by either contention.
government may not constitutionally deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.but this principle is not and can not be absolute because it is a practical necessity that most legislation classif y for one purpose or another,with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons.romer evans,d.indeed,unless a statute affects a fundamental right or some protected class,courts generally accord the legislation a strong presumption of validity by applying a rational basis standard of review.heller doe,d.
this standard is quite deferential.it simply requires courts to determine whether the classification in question is,at a minimum,rationally related to legitimate governmental goals.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.in other words,the fit between the enactment and the public purposes behind it need not be mathematically precise.as long as congress has a reasonable basis for adopting the classification,which can include rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data,the statute will pass constitutional muster.fcc beach commc,d.the rational basis standard thus embodies an idea critical to the continuing vitality of our democracy that courts are not empowered to sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations.city of new orleans dukes,d.
wilkins accepts the fact that we should apply rational basis review to analyze the fee cap in d.however,he would have us apply a more searching form of rational basis review,appellant br.quoting lawrence texas,d,concurring,because he contends that the rational basis standard is in reality a spectrum and that prisoners possess certain characteristics which warrant the court to apply the rational basis review in a less rigid manner,appellant br.these include prisoners relative inability to protect themselves in the political process and the historical discrimination against prisoners in employment,housing,and welfare programs.in effect,wilkins asks us to give less deference to legislative classifications involving prison litigants.
we do not think that rational basis is a permissible approach here.our precedent clearly holds that prisoners are not a suspect class.giarratano johnson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has only applied heightened scrutiny when it finds that a particular class is in that it possesses immutable characteristics,faces historic or ongoing discrimination,or is subject to arbitrary burdens on some basis beyond its ability to control.city of cleburne,at.because breaking the law is a voluntary act and many prisoners will eventually be released,the status of incarceration is neither an immutable characteristic,nor an invidious basis of classification.moss clark,cir.moreover,it would be ironic for the law to confer special solicitude upon a class whose members had violated it.id.nor is any fundamental right of access to the courts involved,for no party possesses an entitlement to a congressional declaration that its attorneys fees in a federal lawsuit shall be borne by the party.see johnson daley,cir en banc finding that there is no fundamental right to have one adversary,or the public treasury,defray all or part of the cost of litigation.
these considerations militate in favor of ordinary rational basis review.several of our sister circuits have concluded that classifications involving prisoners should not receive strict scrutiny,and their reasoning also supports the parallel conclusion that heighte
