plaintiff sharon shaffer shaffer,a special education teacher who worked for the schenectady city school district district from,brought this action pursuant to claiming that the district has revoked her tenure in violation of,inter alia,the due process,takings,and obligation of contracts clauses of the united states constitution.shaffer claimed that she had acquired tenure when the schenectady city school district board of education the school board voted to grant tenure to a list of public school teachers,which list included her name.the district,the school board,individual members of the school board,and the district superintendent,raymond colucciello collectively schenectady moved to dismiss,contending that the apparent grant of tenure resulted from a clerical error and that in any event the board had promptly rescinded it.the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn,denied the defendants motion.the court granted the plaintiff cross motion for partial summary judgment,ordering plaintiff reinstated with back pay.schenectady appealed.
the dispositive questions in this case are whether shaffer acquired tenure,and,if so,whether the revocation of that tenure was lawful.because the case involves important questions governed by new york law,because the relevant statutory provisions do not resolve the issues on their face,and because there is no governing new york caselaw on point,rangolan county of nassau,cir,we believe that these questions would be best determined by the new york court of appeals upon a certificate from this court.see cir.regs.tit,judith kaye kenneth weissman,interactive judicial federalism certified questions in new york,fordham,certification has had its greatest value where a policy choice among reasonable province of the state high implicated,whether in the reading of a statute or the evolution of a common law principle.we therefore respectfully request the new york court of appeals to accept certification.
background 
shaffer began working as a special education teacher for the district in november,and was appointed the following year to a probationary,position for the term from september,through september.sometime in early,shaffer was recommended for tenure by her principal and immediate faculty supervisor.however,on march,the district superintendent,raymond colucciello,wrote to shaffer,advising her that he would be recommending to the school board that shaffer services be discontinued as of june.according to schenectady,the superintendent decision was based on shaffer record of excessive absenteeism.shaffer absences did not exceed those permitted in the collective bargaining agreement,and she maintains that she was never warned that such contractually permissible absences could jeopardize her tenure eligibility.
after receiving the superintendent letter,shaffer began a campaign intended to convince the board and superintendent to grant her tenure.the teachers union,various colleagues,shaffer supervisor,and a former board member contacted schenectady officials on shaffer behalf.
on may,the superintendent submitted to the school board a document,entitled superintendent report to the board of education,which contained an agenda for the board next meeting.the fourth agenda item,labeled appointments on tenure,read it is recommended that the board of education approve the appointments on tenure listed on the proposed,attached resolution for june.the resolution itself stated in accordance with the recommendation of the superintendent of schools in his written report to the board of education dated may,the person whose name is set forth below is hereby appointed on tenure effective on the date set forth below.directly beneath this sentence,there was a heading,recommendation for tenure,followed by a list of names,along with the addresses,tenure areas,and effective tenure dates of the persons listed.shaffer name was on the list,with an effective tenure date of september.schenectady contends that shaffer name was included as the result of a clerical error in the superintendent office 
on june,the school board passed the resolution,which was then publicly posted and disseminated.upon learning that her name had been included on the tenure list,shaffer initially assumed that her lobbying efforts had succeeded.however,after shaffer supervisor contacted the superintendent to confirm the tenure award,the superintendent communicated to shaffer that the school board would rescind the june resolution unless shaffer agreed to resign.on june,shaffer attorney informed the district that shaffer would not resign.five days later,on june,the school board held a special meeting.shaffer and her attorney were invited to this meeting.shaffer contends they were prevented from attending by being given incorrect information about the location of the meeting.at the meeting,the board passed a resolution rescinding tenure which stated that,whereas the prior resolution contained a clerical error,that resolution was hereby rescinded.the board then passed a new resolution granting tenure to teachers on a revised list,which did not include shaffer name.the action of recission occurred prior to the date on which,according to the resolution granting tenure,shaffer tenure became effective.
shaffer then filed this suit.the district court ordered shaffer reinstated with back pay,and the defendants appealed.although the district court ordered the action continued for the purpose of determining damages,we have jurisdiction,pursuant to a,to review the district court grant of injunctive relief.
discussion 
the disposition of shaffer federal claims depends on questions of state law as to whether shaffer was granted tenure and,if so,whether the board subsequent revocation of that tenure was lawful.under new york law a tenured teacher has a protected property interest in her position and a right to retain it subject to being discharged for cause in accordance with the provisions of the education law.gould board of,accord strong board of,cir position as tenured teacher is a property interest protected by fourteenth amendment see also educ.law,mckinney tenured employees are not removable except for cause after a hearing.as outlined in educ.law,the causes for which a tenured teacher may be dismissed do not appear to encompass contractually permissible reason given in this case however,the services of a probationary teacher may be discontinued at any time during the probationary period,on the recommendation of the superintendent of schools,by a majority vote of the board of education.educ.law a.at least one new york court has held that contractually permissible absences may be considered in decisions whether to grant tenure.see mugavin nyquist,dep t.thus,the grounds for shaffer dismissal may well have been an improper basis for the removal of a tenured teacher,but a proper basis for the denial of tenure to a probationary teacher.in addition,tenured teachers,unlike probationary teachers,may be dismissed only pursuant to procedures outlined in the education law,which include,inter alia,formal filing of charges and a hearing before an impartial labor arbitrator procedures that were not followed in shaffer case.
the first question we confront is whether a teacher who is granted tenure by a board resolution that states it is to be effective on a future date is nevertheless immediately entitled to the protections accorded under the education law to tenured teachers.the board grant of tenure to shaffer by resolution of june,expressly provided that her tenure was to become effective september.the board rescinded that action on june,months before the effective date.according to the literal terms of the resolution granting tenure,shaffer would not have become a tenured teacher until september.this would suggest that when the resolution was rescinded on june,she was not yet a tenured teacher,but one with merely an expectation of becoming tenured on september.
we find that the law with respect to the question is unclear.section of new york education law admits of multiple readings 
at the expiration of the probationary term of any persons appointed for su
