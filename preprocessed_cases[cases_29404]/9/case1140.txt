years ago,judge learned hand observed that o ur procedure has been always haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted,but posited,optimistically,that i t is an unreal dream.united states garsson.today,with the advance of forensic dna technology our desire to join learned hand optimism has given way to the reality of wrongful convictions a reality which challenges us to reaffirm our commitment to the principle that the innocent should be freed 
the case sub judice arises at this intersection of scientific advance and enduring constitutional values.in it,we are asked to determine whether there exists a right,grounded in the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution,to dna testing.and,in addition to implicating fundamental questions of constitutional principle,the matter has extraordinary practical significance not only to those who claim they were falsely accused and wrongfully convicted,but also to state and local governments on whom the burdens of any such right to be tested would principally fall.
not surprisingly,the issue of dna testing has in recent years captured the attention of the congress and the legislatures of nearly every state in the nation see,innocence protection act of,a providing,in certain defined circumstances,for dna testing of prisoners convicted under federal and some state laws national conference of state legislatures,dna motions,at collecting state legislation providing for dna testing.as a result,our court must approach the question with utmost care and discreetness,not only because of the constitutional and practical significance of the issue,but also because of t he imperative of according respect to the congress,ashcroft american civil liberties union,d,as well as state legislatures,in their treatment of this multifaceted question.yet at the same time,i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law of the constitution is.tinelli redl,cir per curiam quoting marbury madison,cranch.internal quotation marks omitted and first alteration in original.
richard brown brown contends that we should not,in this case,address the question at all.first,brown argues that the district court below,pursuant to the doctrine,properly dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d examining the scope of the doctrine citing rooker fidelity trust,and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.second,and alternatively,brown asserts that,even if the district court erred in applying the doctrine,frank mckithen mckithen failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because he could only seek access to,or testing of,evidence by way of a habeas corpus proceeding.see heck humphrey,d holding that a prisoner claim is not cognizable under thus can only be brought as a habeas establishing the basis for the claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the prisoner conviction emphasis added.and third,brown argues that,even if the first two arguments are that,therefore,mckithen did state a claim over which the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,and upon the merits of which relief could be nevertheless was not entitled to relitigate the question of dna testing,because the district court was bound to recognize the issue and effects of an earlier judgment rendered against mckithen.
brown first and second arguments are unconvincing.and this leads us to remand the case to the district court for its consideration,in the first instance,of the merits of mckithen claim.in particular,the district court on remand should address in the first instance whether there exists a constitutional right of access to evidence for purposes of potentially exonerative dna testing,and whether that right was infringed in mckithen case.
with respect to brown third argument,we hold that brown waived his claim preclusion defense,and that,on the facts of this case,it would be inappropriate for us to raise the defense nostra sponte,and that,on remand,the district court should it concludes that a constitutional right the contours of that right are sufficiently similar to the state standards previously adjudicated so that issue preclusion would apply.
background 
mckithen was convicted in of attempted murder and related charges,in new york supreme court,queens county queens county court.at trial,the prosecution argued that,on the night of august,mckithen unexpectedly appeared at the apartment he had once shared with his estranged wife dashed to the kitchen and grabbed a knife stabbed his wife in the lower back as she was escaping out of a bedroom window and then immediately fled the apartment.a distinctive knife,which mckithen wife positively identified as the weapon used against her,was admitted into evidence at trial but was never subjected to dna or fingerprint testing.
the jury found mckithen guilty of attempted murder in the second degree and related charges.on appeal,the appellate division affirmed his conviction.the court modified mckithen sentence so that the terms imposed on the various charges would run concurrently.people mckithen.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.people mckithen.
in,seven years after he had been convicted,mckithen moved in queens county court,pursuant to.proc.law a,to compel,inter alia,dna testing of the knife admitted into evidence at trial.subsection a of provides 
where the defendant motion requests the performance of a forensic dna test on specified evidence,and upon the court determination that any evidence containing dna was secured in connection with the trial resulting in the judgment,the court shall grant the application for forensic dna testing of such evidence upon its determination that if a dna test had been conducted on such evidence,and if the results had been admitted in the trial resulting in the judgment,there exists a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendant.
see.proc.law a emphases added.in his motion,mckithen asserted that dna testing might have exonerated him of the crime for which he was convicted.the queens county court concluded that there is no reasonable probability that the results of such testing would have resulted in a verdict more favorable to mckithen,and denied mckithen motion.decision and order of the honorable john latella,new york state supreme court,dated.
in march,mckithen,incarcerated and proceeding pro se,brought this suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson.he claimed that brown,queens county district attorney,violated his constitutional right of access to evidence for dna testing,and sought injunctive relief d irecting dna testing of the knife.mckithen asserted that dna testing would conclusively determine whether he is guilty of a ttempted m urder,and related charges for which he was convicted in state court 
brown moved,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,to dismiss mckithen claim on four grounds the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine mckithen failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because a claim seeking access to evidence for dna testing is not cognizable under the claim was barred by issue preclusion and mckithen failed to state a claim under brady maryland,d,and otherwise failed to make out a constitutional claim for a deprivation of due process.neither in that motion nor in any other submission to the district court did brown raise additional arguments for dismissal of mckithen claim nor otherwise indicate a defense based on claim preclusion.
the district court referred the motion to united states magistrate judge lois bloom.in her report and recommendation,dated march,the magistrate judge observed that the circuits have split over whether actions seeking access to dna evidence are barred by heck humphrey,so that they may be brought only in a habeas corpus proceeding.the magistrate judge also noted that courts have disagreed as to whether there exists any substantive or procedural right to dna testing.although our circuit had not taken a position on either issue,the magistrate judge concluded that the district court need not weigh in on this debate,because mckithen suit could be dismissed,pursuant to the doctrine,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the magistrate judge acknowledged that mckithen claim to dna testing wa s being raised as a constitutional claim for the first time in the instant action,and that his motion involved a statutory right to testing under state law.nevertheless,the magistrate judge concluded that mckithen suit was barred by the doctrine because the claim is identical to the underlying issues raised by the motion,and therefore succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.
the magistrate judge emphasized the limited nature of the report and recommendation 
there has been no attempt to define the parameters of any constitutional right to dna testing as on these facts,the court need not decide whether such a right exists.the court finds only that the purported constitutional right as claimed by plaintiff would require this court to revisit the same issues previously decided by the state court and therefore,this court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to the doctrine.
by order dated april,the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge in its entirety and dismissed mckithen suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,mckithen argues that his suit is not prohibited by the doctrine that his claim is cognizable under that litigation of his claim is not precluded by res judicata or collateral estoppel and that,on the merits,he has a constitutional right of access to evidence in order to conduct potentially exonerative dna testing.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
relying on our court decision in moccio new york state office of court administration,cir,in a which a panel of our court suggested that the doctrine applies broadly and is effectively with the ordinary application of preclusion law,the district court held that mckithen suit should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we review this ruling de novo.see hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir.and,i n resolving a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b,we may refer to evidence outside the pleadings.makarova united states,cir.moreover,given that mckithen was proceeding pro se in the district court,his submissions to that court must be construed liberally.triestman fed.bureau of prisons,cir per curiam.we conclude that in view of the supreme court recent decision in exxon mobil,at.rejecting moccio approach,and our interpretation of that decision in hoblock,at,the district court rule b dismissal can not be sustained.
the doctrine merely recognizes that,which provides that federal district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,is a grant of original jurisdiction,and does not authorize district courts to exercise appellate jurisdiction over judgments,which congress has reserved to the supreme court,see a.verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d holding that the doctrine does not apply to a suit seeking review of state agency action.that the doctrine is meant to occupy narrow ground,see exxon mobil,at,is evidenced by the fact that the supreme court has only applied the doctrine the two cases after which the doctrine was named.see rooker.dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction a suit brought by plaintiffs in federal district court which sought to have a prior state court judgment,adverse to the plaintiffs,declared null and void feldman,d dismissing in part,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,a law suit brought against a district of columbia court that had denied plaintiffs petition to sit for the bar examination.
nevertheless,the doctrine has sometimes been construed by lower courts to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases,overriding congress conferral of jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts,and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to.exxon mobil,at.as an example of such an incorrect expansive reading,the high court cited our decision in moccio,at.id.and in rejecting moccio approach,the court declared that t he doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.id.at.
in hoblock,our court observed that t he supreme court has now told us that moccio was incorrect exxon mobil teaches that and preclusion are entirely separate doctrines.at.the hoblock panel then undertook the task of clarifying the limited scope of the doctrine after exxon mobil 
from the opinion in exxon mobil,we can see that there are four requirements for the application of.first,the plaintiff must have lost in state court.second,the plaintiff must complain of injuries caused by a judgment.third,the plaintiff must invit e district court review and rejection of that judgment.fourth,the judgment must have been rendered before the district court proceedings commenced,has no application to suits proceeding in parallel with ongoing litigation.the first and fourth of these requirements may be loosely termed procedural the second and third may be termed substantive.
hoblock,at internal citation omitted and alteration in original.
when the procedural requirements are they are in mckithen case because he lost in state court the first requirement and the state court judgment was rendered before he brought his suit the fourth requirement the application of the doctrine turns on whether the second and third substantive requirements are met.and those substantive requirements,the hoblock panel explained,can be reduced to the following statement federal plaintiffs are not subject to the bar unless they complain of an injury caused by a state judgment.id.at emphasis in original 
this,however,raises a further question what constitutes an injury caused by a state judgment to clarify this full meaning of which is far from hoblock panel stated that t he following formula guides our inquiry a federal suit complains of injury from a judgment,even if it appears to complain only of a third party actions,when the third party actions are produced by a judgment and not simply ratified,acquiesced in,or left unpunished by it.id.at.yet the meaning and scope of the phrase produced by a judgment is least in all its either.
we need not fully disentangle these complexities to decide the case before us.what exxon mobil and hoblock do make clear is that the applicability of the doctrine turns not on the similarity between a party and claims which is,generally speaking,the focus of ordinary preclusion law,but rather on the causal relationship between the judgment and the injury of which the party complains in federal court.see hoblock,at a plaintiff who seeks in federal court a result opposed to the one he achieved in state court does not,for that reason alone,run afoul of.exxon mobil,at.the doctrine does not stop a district court from exercising jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court,because i f a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,a claim based on an injury that was not caused by the judgment,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.thus,whatever the full import of the caused by and produced by language,at least the following is evident a party is not complaining of an injury caused by a judgment when the exact injury of which the party complains in federal court existed prior in time to the proceedings,and so could not have been caused by those proceedings.
that is precisely the case here.in seeking access to,and dna testing of,evidence,mckithen could have chosen to bring either his state motion or his federal suit first.as he chose to litigate in state court first,principles of preclusion might apply.but,given that mckithen in federal court seeks redress for an injury that existed in its exact form prior to the judgment,he can not be complaining of an injury caused by the state court rather,the preexisting injury in this case is properly understood to have been simply ratified,acquiesced in,or left unpunished by the state court.hoblock,at 
we therefore hold that,under current supreme court and circuit law,the district court erred when it followed the then governing moccio case and applied the doctrine to bar mckithen suit.
mckithen brings his suit under the civil rights act of,stat,as amended,which gives a cause of action for anyone subjected to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws by a person acting under color of state law.while his claim undoubtedly comes within the literal terms of,heck,at,the supreme court has recognized an implicit exception from otherwise broad scope for actions that lie within the core of habeas corpus,wilkinson dotson,d quoting preiser rodriguez,d.accordingly,we must now determine whether a claim asserting a federal constitutional right of access to,and dna testing of,evidence is cognizable under,or whether,instead,it lies so well within the core of habeas corpus that it may only be brought in a habeas petition.
the question has been an open one in this circuit.we today join the seventh,ninth,and eleventh circuits,and district courts in the first and third circuits,agreeing with them that a claim seeking access to evidence for dna testing may properly be brought as a suit.see savory lyons,cir osborne dist.attorney office for the third judicial,cir bradley pryor,cir see also wade brady,d,section is an entirely appropriate medium for plaintiff to raise his claim for access to dna testing.derrickson.county dist.attorney office,wl,at.july,same.in doing so we reject the position taken by three other circuits.see harvey horan,cir harvey i holding that such a claim can not be brought in a action when a plaintiff seek s access to dna evidence for one reason and one reason the first step in undermining his conviction kutzner montgomery county,cir per curiam adopting the reasoning of harvey i see also boyle mayer,cir unpublished holding that a suit seeking dna testing of biological evidence is,in light of heck,not cognizable under.
while both and the federal habeas statute,provide access to a federal forum for claims of unconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials,the provisions differ in their scope and operation.heck,at.thus,while exhaustion of state remedies generally is not a prerequisite to an action under,id.quoting patsy bd.of regents,d,even in an action brought by a state prisoner,the federal habeas statute normally requires a state prisoner to exhaust state remedies before filing a habeas petition in federal court.see b,c see also woodford ngo,d explaining that a state prisoner is generally barred from obtaining federal habeas relief unless the prisoner has properly presented his or her claims through one complete round of the state established appellate review process citation and internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the aedpa time limitations and rules concerning successive petitions applicable to habeas are much more stringent than the normal limitations statutes that control see muhammad close,d per curiam explaining that prisoners suing under generally face a substantially lower gate than those prisoners petitioning for habeas.and,of course,given these differences,if were always available,the procedural and the other like requirements of the federal habeas statute would be rendered nugatory.
consequently,in preiser rodriguez,d,the supreme court began its efforts to harmoniz e t he broad language of,a general statute,with the specific federal habeas corpus statute.heck,at.thomas,concurring internal quotation marks omitted and second alteration in original.in preiser,state prisoners had brought civil rights actions attacking the constitutionality of prison disciplinary proceedings that had led to the deprivation of their credits,and sought solely equitable relief.in light of the potential overlap between and the habeas provision,the court crafted an implicit exception to the textual terms of and held that habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release.id.at.citing preiser,at.
over time,this implicit exception has been carefully circumscribed.see dotson,at.noting that the implicit exception from otherwise broad scope recognized in preiser covers only those actions that lie within the core of habeas corpus quoting preiser,at.preiser itself had exception has been applied by the supreme court,in its case law,only when success for a prisoner in a suit would necessarily result in the nullification of his conviction or the shortening of his confinement.thus,in wolff mcdonnell,d,the court held that inmates were permitted to bring a suit,pursuant to,to obtain a declaration as a predicate to their requested damages the disciplinary procedures by which their credits were deprived were invalid,as well as to seek an injunction enjoining prospective enforcement of invalid prison regulations.id.at.in reaching these conclusions,the court reasoned that,much as either form of relief might be the first step in invalidity of prisoners sentences,i n neither case would victory for the prisoners in the suit necessarily have meant immediate release or a shorter period of incarceration.dotson,at.discussing wolff emphases added see wolff,at.i t was proper for the federal courts to determine the validity of the procedures for revoking credits and to fashion appropriate remedies for any constitutional violations ascertained,short of ordering the actual restoration of good time already cancelled.
twenty years later,in heck humphrey,the court reaffirmed that the exception recognized in preiser applies only when establishing the basis for a prisoner claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the conviction.heck,at.emphasis added.the plaintiff in heck was an inmate who alleged that state officials unconstitutionally caused his conviction by improperly investigating his crime and destroying evidence.id.at.in holding that the plaintiff claim was not cognizable under though the plaintiff only requested damages as court explained that,in order for plaintiff to succeed on his damages claim,he would necessarily have to show,as a predicate to the award,that his conviction was invalid.hence,success for the plaintiff would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction,and,since civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments,id.at,no cause of action under was available until the conviction or sentence was reversed,expunged,invalidated,or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus,id.at.
in an important footnote,the court in heck reaffirmed the narrowness of preiser exception,by providing an instructive example of a lawsuit which,under the standard articulated in heck,would not be barred 
for example,a suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence that was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the plaintiff conviction.because of doctrines like independent source and inevitable discovery,and especially harmless error,such a action,even if successful,would not necessarily imply that the plaintiff conviction was unlawful.
id.at.emphasis in original internal citations omitted.heck footnote underscored that the preiser exception does not bar a action that,at most,increases the likelihood that a plaintiff will eventually be able to overturn a conviction,but which does not go so far as to necessarily demonstrate the conviction invalidity.see nelson campbell,d w e were careful in heck to stress the importance of the term necessarily.savory,at the exception to is a narrow one,designed to preserve the specific role of habeas corpus relief.anyanwutaku moore,holding that an inmate constitutional challenge alleging miscalculation of a parole eligibility date was cognizable under,because such parole decisions were discretionary and hence,there was no guarantee the inmate would ultimately be released any earlier.
the high court recently reiterated this point in dotson,d.in affirming,yet again,that the proper inquiry is whether victory for the prisoners would necessarily have meant immediate release or a shorter period of incarceration,id.at,the high court deemed it irrelevant that a prisoner might,following success in a suit,find himself in a better position to raise subsequent challenges to his conviction or sentence.specifically,the dotson court allowed plaintiff inmates to proceed with their suits when success for one prisoner plaintiff would have meant,at most,speedier consideration of a new parole application,and success for the other prisoner would potentially have led to a new parole hearing at which state authorities may,in their discretion,decline to shorten his prison term.id.at.emphasis in original anyanwutaku.
we conclude that the governing standard for application of the exception,then,is whether a prisoner victory in a suit would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction or sentence that a prisoner success might be merely helpful or potentially demonstrative of illegal confinement is,under this standard,irrelevant.
moreover,given that the test is whether success in the suit sub judice will necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of a conviction or not whether a plaintiff intends to bring subsequent prisoner motives for bringing a suit are,as dotson observes,also plainly beside the point.dotson,at.the problem with ohio argument lies in its jump from a true premise that in all likelihood the prisoners hope these actions will help bring about earlier release to a faulty conclusion that habeas is their sole avenue for relief.
were mckithen to prevail on the merits,he would obtain only an injunction requiring that the knife be made available for dna testing.such testing,of course,necessarily implies nothing at all about the plaintiff conviction.harvey ii,at luttig,respecting the denial of rehearing en banc emphasis in original.that is because t he results of any dna tests that are eventually performed may be inconclusive,they may be insufficiently exculpatory,or they may even be inculpatory.id.moreover,even if the results of dna testing prove exculpatory,mckithen would then have to initiate an entirely separate as a habeas petition,subject to all the procedural and other aedpa which he would have to argue that the state has violated his constitutional rights by continuing to imprison him in light of the exculpatory evidence see id.
it follows if success for the plaintiff might well make it more likely that the plaintiff,in a subsequent proceeding,may eventually be able to make a showing that his conviction was unlawful,see dotson,at.heck,at.wolff,at.preiser,at,and even if a plaintiff ultimate motive is to challenge his claim for access to evidence is cognizable under.see savory,at osborne,at bradley,at wade,d at derrickson,wl,at 
as the supreme court made clear in exxon mobil,a federal court may be bound to recognize the claim and effects of a judgment even if there is jurisdiction to hear the merits of the claim,and the claim is otherwise properly presented.exxon mobil,at.see hoblock,at citing exxon mobil.in determining whether claim or issue preclusion applies,our inquiry is governed by new york state law.see such judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.see also hoblock,at parsons steel,first.bank,d.we therefore consider,in turn,brown arguments that we are barred from considering mckithen claim by claim preclusion,and by issue preclusion.
the doctrine of claim preclusion,also referred to as res judicata,prevents a plaintiff from raising a claim that was or could have been raised in a prior suit.new york law has adopted a transactional approach to claim preclusion.see,gargiul tompkins,cir citing reilly reid.o nce a claim is brought to a final conclusion,all other claims arising out of the same transaction or series of transaction are barred city of syracuse.
under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which governs general pleading rules in federal court,p reclusion is not a jurisdictional matter.exxon mobil,at.citing.c,which lists claim preclusion as an affirmative defense.as such,the defense of claim and issue preclusion may be waived by the parties,see mkt.share,sterling bank,cir generally a failure to plead an affirmative defense results in a waiver.internal citations and quotation marks omitted scherer equitable life assurance soc y,cir the preclusion doctrines are waiveable affirmative defenses.curry city of syracuse,cir c ollateral estoppel,like res judicata,is an affirmative defense i t normally must be pled in a timely manner or it may be waived,and we are under no obligation to raise the issue nostra sponte,scherer,at noting that although a court is free to raise that defense sua sponte,even if the parties have seemingly waived it,there is no obligation on the part of a court to act sua sponte and interpose the defense if it has not been raised.indeed,our court has recognized that sua sponte application of claim preclusion is not always desirable.id.
on appeal,brown concedes that claim preclusion was not specifically raised below,but insists that we should apply the defense nostra sponte for the sake of judicial economy.as support,brown asserts that appellant due process claim in this action is precisely the same claim he raised in his state claim,now couched in due process terminology,and could have been raised in the state action.he remarks that has remained incarcerated throughout,and proceeded pro se in the state and district court proceedings should not now be rewarded for his failure to raise the same claim in this action.
brown arguments are without merit.as mckithen rightly rejoins,brown has offered us no support for the naked assertion that mckithen could have brought a federal constitutional claim as part of his motion.indeed this may be an open question of state law even if it were not,however,and assuming further that its answer would cut in brown favor,we conclude that it would still be inappropriate,in this case,to invoke claim preclusion nostra sponte given,as mckithen notes,the seriousness of the crime of which he was convicted,the length of the sentence,the fact that the claim goes to innocence,and that mckithen proceeded pro se in state court.
brown has waived the defense of claim preclusion,and,given the circumstances of this case,we decline to invoke the defense nostra sponte.
brown did raise the defense of issue preclusion,collateral estoppel,in the district court,and we therefore must decide whether the defense applies.our inquiry is governed by new york state law.see hoblock,at.
under new york law,collateral estoppel will preclude a federal court from deciding an issue if the issue in question was actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding,and the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding.vargas city of new york,cir quoting colon coughlin,cir.we have said that,dispositive to a finding of preclusive effect,is whether an independent judgment in a separate proceeding would impair or destroy rights or interests established by the judgment entered in the first action.state bank trust,cir internal quotation marks omitted.importantly,we have also cautioned that i ssue preclusion will apply only if it is quite clear that these requirements have been satisfied,lest a party be precluded from obtaining at least one full hearing on his or her claim.colon,at quoting gramatan home investors lopez,emphasis added.
brown argues that o nly by overturning the ruling of the state court could the federal court grant appellant relief.the state court,in denying mckithen motion to have the knife tested,reached the conclusion that mckithen did not meet the standards for dna testing.and brown insists that mckithen could prevail on his federal claim only if the federal district court were to disregard the state court holding on this point.but that is only so if the federal constitutional right to dna testing is the same as or lesser than and included in the state statutory right.in other words,it ai necessarily so.
under.proc.law a,the state court was required to decide whether mckithen met the reasonable probability and more favorable standards.see supra.at this stage of the proceedings,we are unable to rule on whether,assuming that a federal constitutional right to dna testing exists,the standards for proving a violation of that right are more,or less,stringent than those of the state statute.
it is not at all inevitable that the federal constitutional right,if it exists,will look precisely like the state statutory right.even apart from the possibility that the federal constitutional right might be,in some applications,more readily available than the state statutory right,mckithen rightly notes that dna may have a variety of uses that are not captured in the state statute standard.for example,it might aid in clemency proceedings evidence might be probative enough to warrant executive intervention even if it did not meet the state law reasonable probability threshold.alternatively,the dna evidence might be useful to a prisoner with an indeterminate sentence,such as mckithen,in obtaining if the evidence is insufficient to create a reasonable probability of a different verdict.
for these reasons,we can not find,at this juncture,that issue preclusion applies.instead,we leave the defense for the district court to consider on remand when the stage is properly set for it.if the district court concludes that there exists a constitutional right on the basis of which mckithen might obtain his requested relief a question which,as we explain below,is best left for the district court to consider in the first instance,it should then consider whether the contours of that right are sufficiently similar narrower than and incorporated previously adjudicated state statutory standard as to collaterally estopp mckithen claim.
the district court,viewing itself bound to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the doctrine,did not address the merits of mckithen action.because we vacate the district court judgment on that instead hold that the district court did have jurisdiction,that mckithen suit is cognizable under,that the defense of claim preclusion was waived,and that we can not determine whether issue preclusion applies before determining whether the federal constitutional right exists and what its contours extraordinarily important,and delicate,constitutional issue which mckithen has sought to litigate is squarely before us.
but we decline to rule on it now.instead,because of the nature of the,as noted earlier,in light of the need to approach the issue remand the question to the district court for its examination in the first instance.the same considerations that lead us to remand,however,counsel in favor of our providing the district court some guidance as to how its inquiry might proceed.
the supreme court has made clear that prisoners lawfully deprived of their freedom retain substantive liberty interests under the fourteenth amendment.see,youngberg romeo,d the mere fact that plaintiff has been committed under proper procedures does not deprive him of all substantive liberty interests under the fourteenth amendment.see also vitek jones,d holding that convicted felon retains a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to a mental institution without due process morrissey brewer,d holding that parolee has a liberty interest which includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty.the district court,on remand,must,therefore,first consider whether this residual liberty interest encompasses an interest in accessing or possessing potentially exonerative biological evidence.compare harvey ii,at,luttig,respecting the denial of rehearing en banc i believe,and would hold,that there does exist such a right of access to evidence.with harvey i,at king,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment concluding that the defendant had no legal right to access or discover the biological evidence relating to his conviction.see also grayson king,cir declining to weigh in on the thorny threshold issue.
if the district court concludes that this liberty interest exists,then procedural due process applies to its deprivation.on this point,the district court inquiry should begin with the framework established in mathews eldridge,d,for analyzing procedural due process claims mathews applies,rather than the more demanding medina california,d,because mckithen is not bringing a challenge to his underlying conviction or to the process afforded during criminal proceedings themselves,krimstock kelly,cir,but instead is seeking access to evidence.see harvey ii,at luttig,respecting the denial of rehearing en banc concluding that mathews,rather than medina,provides the proper analytical framework for determining whether there exists a procedural due process right to such access because t he asserted right of access does not entail a challenge to the underlying conviction,and neither at least comfortably is the state denial of access equivalent to a state rule of criminal procedure governing the process by which one is tried and found guilty or innocent of criminal offense krimstock,at holding that mathews applies to a case involving an alleged deprivation of property pending a criminal proceeding.
under the mathews framework,
identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
mathews,at.see also united states ruiz,d same.
under mathews the cases inevitably turn on their particular in the instant case include the availability of statutory avenues of relief,such as state or federal legislation providing for dna testing and the seriousness of the crime and sentence involved see greenholtz inmates of.penal corr.complex,d it is axiomatic that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.quoting morrissey,at.mathews,at.d ue process,unlike some legal rules,is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstance.internal quotation marks omitted.
it is also worth noting that the right asserted by mckithen in this case,while implicating questions of tremendous importance,is narrow in its reach.mckithen does not,for example,at all challenge the state procedures for the collection and storage of biological for which cost is clearly a significant concern.rather,mckithen seeks only access to,and perhaps testing of,biological evidence already in the state possession.moreover,at oral argument,mckithen indicated that he would be able to cover the costs of dna testing himself,and,therefore,would not need to argue that the defendant should be compelled to conduct the testing for him.
we deem it appropriate to leave factual questions,such as the cost to the the interaction between such facts and the constitutional right the district court to consider in the first instance.
conclusion
