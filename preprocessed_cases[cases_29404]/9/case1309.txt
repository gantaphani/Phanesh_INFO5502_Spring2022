the original complaint in this action was filed on october,and an amended complaint was filed on january,before the defendants had responded to the original complaint.the district court dismissed the amended complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,but granted the plaintiffs an opportunity to replead their allegations.webb goord.the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on october,but the district court again ruled that dismissal was warranted pursuant to rule b.webb goord,d.the plaintiffs appeal from this second dismissal.
the plaintiffs,with the exception of one who has been released,are inmates incarcerated in various correctional facilities administered by the new york state department of correctional services docs.the second amended complaint names an array of defendants the commissioner of docs the health commissioner of docs the inspector general of docs the superintendents of fourteen separate correctional facilities administered by docs approximately fifty other docs employees,most of whom are corrections officers,and many of whom are identified only by their last name and one hundred john doe defendants alleged to be docs corrections officers.
the second amended complaint alleges that each of the plaintiffs suffered a violation of his civil rights as a result of actions,or failures to act,on the part of docs officials and employees.specifically,the second amended complaint alleges the occurrence of more than forty incidents that resulted in serious physical injury to the plaintiffs,including attacks by corrections officers,improper physical punishments,attacks by other inmates for which the defendants are responsible because of their failure to provide a safe prison environment,and denials of medical care to plaintiffs suffering from injury and illness.
some features of these allegations stand out.first,the second amended complaint only sets forth the most basic facts of the incidents alleged to have resulted in injury.for the most part,each plaintiff is allotted one paragraph of the complaint,which provides the place and approximate time of the incident involving him,along with a sentence or two concerning the injury alleged to have arisen from the incident.
further,the incidents are dispersed across time and space.that is,the events complained of are alleged to have taken place at fourteen separate docs facilities and,while most of the incidents are alleged to have taken place between and,incidents occurring as long ago as are included in the second amended complaint.the plaintiffs allegations therefore share a common nucleus of operative fact only in a very broad sense.
the second amended complaint asserts federal causes of action under the eighth amendment to the united states constitution and under section.it also asserts common law claims of assault,intentional infliction of emotional distress,respondeat superior liability,negligence,and denial of medical treatment.
in spite of the brevity with which the plaintiffs factual allegations are set forth,the second amended complaint constitutes a catalog of violence and ill treatment toward the plaintiffs.numerous incidents resulting in,among other things,lacerations,serious bruises and fractures are alleged.for example,plaintiff edward walsh alleges that,after docs officials denied his request to be placed in protective custody,he was attacked so brutally by other inmates that he received facial wounds requiring stitches.plaintiff rodney wright alleges that he required stitches to close a wound received as a result of an attack by other inmates.plaintiff michael mckenzie alleges that an attack by corrections officers left him with seventeen broken bones in his face.it is neither trite nor patronizing for the court to recognize the seriousness of such allegations.
after the first amended complaint was filed,the plaintiffs sought discovery as to matters going far beyond the specific events alleged therein.for example,the plaintiffs requested that the defendants produce a list of the number of incidents in the past year where prisoners received or more stitches and a list of the number and nature of complaints by prisoners against docs personnel for brutality use of excessive force.
the second amended complaint specifically seeks relief only in the form of compensatory damages for each plaintiff.in correspondence with the district court,however,both before and after the dismissal of the second amended complaint,the plaintiffs counsel asserted that much broader relief was appropriate.in a letter to the district court,dated april,the plaintiffs counsel asserted that an extraordinary event had occurred in that the new yorker magazine,in its issue of april,had published an article entitled guarding sing sing.the article,written by ted conover,a journalist who had taken a job as a corrections officer at a docs facility,describes several instances of brutality toward inmates none of these instances of brutality,however,involved any of the plaintiffs.nevertheless,the plaintiffs counsel asserted that the article constitutes substantial admissions that tend to prove all of the allegations in this case and cry out for the appointment of a special master to govern the state prison system pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra,section.
further,after the second amended complaint was dismissed,the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in hope pelzer,d,which was issued on june.according to the plaintiffs counsel,hope not only established that summary judgment should be granted in favor of the plaintiffs,but also that a special master should be appointed to run docs pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra,section.the district court subsequently denied the motion for reconsideration.

we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see scutti,llc park place entertainment,cir.employing this standard,we affirm the district court.
i.the general inadequacy of the second amended complaint.
in its opinion dismissing the first amended complaint,the district court expressed puzzlement that the instant action although not so labeled,is akin to a class action challenging state prison conditions and operational practices.webb goord.in none of the three complaints that have been filed in this action do the plaintiffs actually assert class action claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.this seems to us to be the most striking thing about this case.if anything,we have even more reason to be puzzled than was the district court because the bulk of the law upon which the plaintiffs rely on this appeal is class action law,and a good part of oral argument was devoted to the question of why this case was not brought as a class action.in sum,this case looks,walks,and sounds like a class action,but yet is not one.
we hasten to add that,because this case has not been brought as a class action,class action law is not dispositive as to our decision to affirm the district court.but we feel that some discussion of the class action law of this circuit is highly useful to the explanation of our decision.for herein lies an explanation of the fundamental infirmity of the second amended complaint.amalgamating more than forty discrete incidents of misconduct by docs officials does not make for a sustainable lawsuit.as the district court recognized,the claim of each individual plaintiff,standing alone,may or may not have merit.but,taken together,the claims do not establish the existence of a policy or practice existing throughout the docs system,or within a single docs facility,such that manageable discovery or a reasonable trial could be held in this action.
our circuit has expressed some trepidation regarding the efficacy of class action litigation in providing relief to individual inmate plaintiffs who claim that prison conditions,or the actions of prison officials,have violated their civil rights.in blyden mancusi,cir,we considered the results of a district court treatment of class action litigation arising from injuries allegedly suffered by inmates during the infamo
