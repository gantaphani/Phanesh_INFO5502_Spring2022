these appeals present constitutional challenges to section of the defense of marriage act doma,which denies federal economic and other benefits to couples lawfully married in massachusetts and to surviving spouses from couples thus married.rather than challenging the right of states to define marriage as they see fit,the appeals contest the right of congress to undercut the choices made by couples and by individual states in deciding who can be married to whom.
in,the hawaii supreme court held that it might violate the hawaii constitution to deny marriage licenses to couples.baehr lewin,haw.although hawaii then empowered its legislature to block such a ruling,haw.const.art.i,which it did,act of june,haw.sess.laws codified at.the hawaii decision was followed by legalization of marriage in a small minority of states,some by statute and a few by judicial decision many more states responded by banning marriage by statute or constitutional amendment 
congress reacted with the same alarm as many state legislatures.within three years after the hawaii decision,doma was enacted with strong majorities in both houses and signed into law by president clinton.the entire statute,reprinted in an addendum to this decision,must having only two operative paragraphs be one of the shortest major enactments in recent history.section of doma,defines marriage for purposes of federal law 
in determining the meaning of any act of congress,or of any ruling,regulation,or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the united states,the word marriage means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife,and the word spouse refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.
section,which is not at issue here,absolves states from recognizing marriages solemnized in other states.doma does not formally invalidate marriages in states that permit them,but its adverse consequences for such a choice are considerable.notably,it prevents married couples from filing joint federal tax returns,which can lessen tax burdens,see a c,and prevents the surviving spouse of a marriage from collecting social security survivor benefits,f,i.doma also leaves federal employees unable to share their health insurance and certain other medical benefits with spouses.
doma affects a thousand or more generic to marriage in myriad federal laws.in most cases,the changes operate to the disadvantage of married couples in the half dozen or so states that permit marriage.the number of couples thus affected is estimated at more than further,doma has potentially serious adverse consequences,hereafter described,for states that choose to legalize marriage.
in gill opm,seven couples married in massachusetts and three surviving spouses of such marriages brought suit in federal district court to enjoin pertinent federal agencies and officials from enforcing doma to deprive the couples of federal benefits available to married couples in massachusetts.the commonwealth brought a companion case,massachusetts dhhs,concerned that doma will revoke federal funding for programs tied to doma marriage definition such as massachusetts state medicaid program and veterans cemeteries.
by combining the income of individuals in marriages,massachusetts medicaid program is noncompliant with doma,and the department of health and human services,through its centers for medicare and medicaid services,has discretion to rescind medicaid funding to noncomplying states.burying a veteran with his or her spouse removes federal veterans cemetery status and gives the department of veterans affairs discretion to recapture all federal funding for the cemetery.
the department of justice defended doma in the district court but,on july,that court found section unconstitutional under the equal protection clause.gill office of pers,d.in the companion case,the district court accepted the commonwealth argument that section violated the spending clause and the tenth amendment.massachusetts dep t of health human,d.
the district court judgment declared section unconstitutional and enjoined the federal officials and agencies from enforcing section,but the court stayed injunctive relief pending appeals.the judgment included specific remedies ordered for the named plaintiffs in relation to tax,social security and like claims.with one qualification discussed separately below the federal defendants have throughout focused solely upon the district court premise that doma is unconstitutional.
the justice department filed a brief in this court defending doma against all constitutional claims.thereafter,altering its position,the justice department filed a revised brief arguing that the equal protection claim should be assessed under a heightened scrutiny standard and that doma failed under that standard.it opposed the separate spending clause and tenth amendment claims pressed by the commonwealth.the gill plaintiffs defend the district court judgment on all three grounds.
a delay in proceedings followed the justice department about face while defense of the statute passed to a group of republican leaders of the house of representatives the bipartisan legal advisory group the legal group who retained counsel and intervened in the appeal to support section.a large number of amicus briefs have been filed on both sides of the dispute,some on both sides proving very helpful to the court.
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,our review is de novo,kuperman wrenn,cir,and the issues presented are themselves legal in character,even though informed by background information as to legislative purpose and legislative facts bearing upon the rationality or adequacy of distinctions drawn by statutes,fcc beach commc ns.such information is normally noticed by courts with the assistance of briefs,records and common knowledge.daggett comm on governmental ethics election practices,cir.
this case is difficult because it couples issues of equal protection and federalism with the need to assess the rationale for a congressional statute passed with minimal hearings and lacking in formal findings.in addition,supreme court precedent offers some help to each side,but the rationale in several cases is open to interpretation.we have done our best to discern the direction of these precedents,but only the supreme court can finally decide this unique case.
although our decision discusses equal protection and federalism concerns separately,it concludes that governing precedents under both heads combine not to create some new category of heightened scrutiny for doma under a prescribed algorithm,but rather to require a closer than usual review based in part on discrepant impact among married couples and in part on the importance of state interests in regulating marriage.our decision then tests the rationales offered for doma,taking account of supreme court precedent limiting which rationales can be counted and of the force of certain rationales.
equal protection.the legal group says that any equal protection challenge to doma is foreclosed at the outset by baker nelson.there,a central claim made was that a state refusal to recognize marriage violated federal equal protection principles.minnesota had,like doma,defined marriage as a union of persons of the opposite sex,and the state supreme court had upheld the statute.on appeal,the supreme court dismissed summarily for want of a substantial federal question.id.
baker is precedent binding on us unless repudiated by subsequent supreme court precedent.hicks miranda.following baker,gay rights claims prevailed in several well known decisions,lawrence texas,and romer evans,but neither mandates that the constitution requires states to permit marriages.a supreme court summary dismissal prevent s lower courts from coming to opposite conclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.mandel bradley,per curiam.baker does not resolve our own case but it does limit the arguments to ones that do not presume or rest on a constitutional right to marriage.
central to this appeal is supreme court case law governing equal protection analysis.the gill plaintiffs say that doma fails under the rational basis test,traditionally used in cases not involving suspect classifications.the federal defendants said that doma would survive such rational basis scrutiny but now urge,instead,that doma fails under intermediate scrutiny.in our view,these competing formulas are inadequate fully to describe governing precedent.
certain suspect classifications race,alienage and national origin require what the court calls strict scrutiny,which entails both a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring.adarand constructors,pena.classifications invoke intermediate scrutiny and must be substantially related to achieving an important governmental objective both are far more demanding than rational basis review as conventionally applied in routine matters of commercial,tax and like regulation.
equal protection claims tested by this rational basis standard,famously called by justice holmes the last resort of constitutional argument,buck bell,rarely succeed.courts accept as adequate any plausible factual basis,williamson lee optical of oklahoma,without regard to congress actual motives.beach commc ns,at.means need not be narrowly drawn to meet or even be entirely consistent with the stated legislative ends.lee optical,at.
under such a rational basis standard,the gill plaintiffs can not prevail.consider only one of the several justifications for doma offered by congress itself,namely,that broadening the definition of marriage will reduce tax revenues and increase social security payments.this is the converse of the very advantages that the gill plaintiffs are seeking,and congress could rationally have believed that doma would reduce costs,even if newer studies of the actual economic effects of doma suggest that it may in fact raise costs for the federal government.
the federal defendants conceded that rational basis review leaves doma intact but now urge this court to employ the intermediate scrutiny test used by supreme court for gender discrimination.some similarity exists between the two situations along with some differences,compare frontiero richardson,plurality opinion describing criteria for categorization.but extending intermediate scrutiny to sexual preference classifications is not a step open to us.
first,this court in cook gates,cir,cert.denied,has already declined to create a major new category of suspect classification for statutes distinguishing based on sexual preference.cook rejected an equal protection challenge to the do ask,do tell policy adopted by congress for the military,pointing out that romer itself avoided the suspect classification label.cook,at.this binds the panel.san juan cable llc,cir.
second,to create such a new suspect classification for relationships would have implications in particular,by implying an overruling of baker,which we are neither empowered to do nor willing to predict.nothing indicates that the supreme court is about to adopt this new suspect classification when it conspicuously failed to do so in romer a case that could readily have been disposed by such a demarche.that such a classification could overturn marriage laws in a huge majority of individual states underscores the implications.
however,that is not the end of the matter.without relying on suspect classifications,supreme court equal protection decisions have both intensified scrutiny of purported justifications where minorities are subject to discrepant treatment and have limited the permissible justifications.and as we later explain,in areas where state regulation has traditionally governed,the court may require that the federal government interest in intervention be shown with special clarity.
in a set of equal protection decisions,the supreme court has now several times struck down state or local enactments without invoking any suspect classification.in each,the protesting group was historically disadvantaged or unpopular,and the statutory justification seemed thin,unsupported or impermissible.it is these decisions not classic rational basis review that the gill plaintiffs and the justice department most usefully invoke in their briefs while seeking to absorb them into different and more rigid categorical rubrics.
the oldest of the decisions,of agric.moreno,invalidated congress decision to exclude from the food stamp program households containing unrelated individuals.disregarding purported justifications that such households were more likely to under report income and to evade detection,the court closely scrutinized the legislation fit finding both that the rule disqualified many and particularly needy households,and a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group.id.at.
the second,city of cleburne cleburne living,overturned a local ordinance as applied to the denial of a special permit for operating a group home for the mentally disabled.the court found unconvincing interests like protecting the inhabitants against the risk of flooding,given that nursing or convalescent homes were allowed without a permit mental disability too had no connection to alleged concerns about population density.all that remained were mere negative attitudes,or fear,unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable in a zoning proceeding.id.at.
finally,in romer evans,the court struck down a provision in colorado constitution prohibiting regulation to protect homosexuals from discrimination.the court,calling unprecedented the disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the law,deemed the provision a enactment divorced from any factual context from which we could discern a relationship to legitimate state interests.id.at.
these three decisions did not adopt some new category of suspect classification or employ rational basis review in its minimalist form instead,the court rested on the nature of the discrepant treatment,the burden imposed,and the infirmities of the justifications offered.several justices have remarked on this both favorably,city of cleburne,at stevens,concurring,and unfavorably,united states.virginia vmi,scalia,dissenting.
circuit courts,citing these same cases,have similarly concluded that equal protection assessments are sensitive to the circumstances of the case and not dependent entirely on abstract categorizations as one distinguished judge observed 
judges and commentators have noted that the usually deferential rational basis test has been applied with greater rigor in some contexts,particularly those in which courts have had reason to be concerned about possible discrimination.
united states then,cir calabresi,concurring citing city of cleburne as an example.there is nothing remarkable about this categories are often approximations and are themselves constructed by weighing of underlying elements.
all three of the cited cases moreno,city of cleburne and romer stressed the historic patterns of disadvantage suffered by the group adversely affected by the statute.as with the women,the poor and the mentally impaired,gays and lesbians have long been the subject of discrimination.lawrence,at.the court has in these cases undertaken a more careful assessment of the justifications than the light scrutiny offered by conventional rational basis review.
as for burden,the combined effect of doma restrictions on federal benefits will not prevent marriage where permitted under state law but it will penalize those couples by limiting tax and social security benefits to couples in their own and all other states.for those married couples of which one partner is in federal service,the other can not take advantage of medical care and other benefits available to partners in massachusetts and everywhere else in the country.
these burdens are comparable to those the court found substantial in moreno,city of cleburne,and romer.moreno,like this case,involved meaningful economic benefits city of cleburne involved the opportunity to secure housing romer,the chance to secure equal protection of the laws on the same terms as other groups.loss of survivor social security,medical care and tax benefits are major detriments on any reckoning provision for retirement and medical care are,in practice,the main components of the social safety net for vast numbers of americans.
accordingly,we conclude that the extreme deference accorded to ordinary economic legislation in cases like lee optical would not be extended to doma by the supreme court and without insisting on compelling or important justifications or narrow tailoring,the court would scrutinize with care the purported bases for the legislation.before providing such scrutiny,a separate element absent in moreno,city of cleburne,and romer federalism must be considered.
federalism.in assailing doma,the plaintiffs and especially the commonwealth rely directly on limitations attributed to the spending clause of the constitution and the tenth amendment the justice department,along with the legal group,rejects those claims.in our view,neither the tenth amendment nor the spending clause invalidates doma but supreme court precedent relating to challenges to federal laws reinforce the need for closer than usual scrutiny of doma justifications and diminish somewhat the deference ordinarily accorded.
it is true that doma intrudes extensively into a realm that has from the start of the nation been primarily confided to state regulation domestic relations and the definition and incidents of lawful marriage which is a leading instance of the states exercise of their broad authority over morality and culture.as the supreme court observed long ago,
t he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife,parent and child,belongs to the laws of the states and not to the laws of the united states.

consonantly,congress has never purported to lay down a general code defining marriage or purporting to bind to the states to such a regime.rather,in individual situations such as the criteria in immigration law,b a i congress has provided its own definitions limited to the particular program or personnel involved.but no precedent exists for doma sweeping general federal definition of marriage for all federal statutes and programs.
nevertheless,congress surely has an interest in who counts as married.the statutes and programs that section governs are federal regimes such as social security,the internal revenue code and medical insurance for federal workers and their benefit structure requires deciding who is married to whom.that congress has traditionally looked to state law to determine the answer does not mean that the tenth amendment or spending clause require it to do so.
supreme court interpretations of the tenth amendment have varied over the years but those in force today have struck down statutes only where congress sought to commandeer state governments or otherwise directly dictate the internal operations of state government.printz united states,new york united states.whatever its effects,section governs only federal programs and funding,and does not share these two vices of commandeering or direct command.
neither does doma run afoul of the germaneness requirement that conditions on federal funds must be related to federal purposes.south dakota dole.the requirement is not implicated where,as here,congress merely defines the terms of the federal benefit.in dole,the supreme court upheld a condition by which federal funds for highway construction depended on a state adoption of a minimum drinking age for all driving on state roadways.at.doma merely limits the use of federal funds to prescribed purposes.
however,the denial of federal benefits to couples lawfully married does burden the choice of states like massachusetts to regulate the rules and incidents of marriage notably,the commonwealth stands both to assume new administrative burdens and to lose funding for medicaid or veterans cemeteries solely on account of its marriage laws.these consequences do not violate the tenth amendment or spending clause,but congress effort to put a thumb on the scales and influence a state decision as to how to shape its own marriage laws does bear on how the justifications are assessed.
in united states morrison,and united states lopez,the supreme court scrutinized with special care federal statutes intruding on matters customarily within state control.the lack of adequate and persuasive findings led the court in both cases to invalidate the statutes under the commerce clause even though nothing more than rational basis review is normally afforded in such cases.
the supreme court has made somewhat similar statements about the need for scrutiny when examining federal statutes intruding on regulation of state election processes.nw.austin mun.util.dist.no.one holder,city of boerne flores,calling rfra a considerable congressional intrusion into the states traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.
true,these federalism cases examined the reach of federal power under the commerce clause and other sources of constitutional authority not invoked here but a statute that violates equal protection is likewise beyond the power of congress.see moreno,at douglas,concurring.given that doma intrudes broadly into an area of traditional state regulation,a closer examination of the justifications that would prevent doma from violating equal protection and thus from exceeding federal authority is uniquely reinforced by federalism concerns.
doma rationales.despite its ramifying application throughout the,only one day of hearings was held on doma,defense of marriage act hearing on before the subcomm.on the constitution of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.hearing,and none of the testimony concerned doma effects on the numerous federal programs at issue.some of the odder consequences of doma testify to the speed with which it was adopted 
the statute,only a few paragraphs in length,is devoid of the express prefatory findings commonly made in major federal laws.e,id.accordingly,in discerning and assessing congress basis for doma our main resort is the house committee report and,in lesser measure,to variations of its themes advanced in the briefs before us.the committee report stated 
t he committee briefly discusses four of the governmental interests advanced by this legislation defending and nurturing the institution of traditional,heterosexual marriage defending traditional notions of morality protecting state sovereignty and democratic and preserving scarce government resources.
the penultimate reason listed above was not directed to section indeed,is antithetical to it but was concerned solely with section,which reserved a state power not to recognize marriages performed in other states.thus,we begin with the others,reserving for separate consideration the claim strongly pressed by the gill plaintiffs that doma should be condemned because its unacknowledged but alleged central motive was hostility to homosexuality.
first,starting with the most concrete of the cited reasons preserving scarce government resources it is said that doma will save money for the federal government by limiting tax savings and avoiding social security and other payments to spouses.this may well be true,or at least might have been thought true more detailed recent analysis indicates that doma is more likely on a net basis to cost the government money 
but,where the distinction is drawn against a historically disadvantaged group and has no other basis,supreme court precedent marks this as a reason undermining rather than bolstering the distinction.plyler doe,romer,at.the reason,derived from equal protection analysis,is that such a group has historically been less able to protect itself through the political process.plyler,at united states carolene prods.
a second rationale of a pragmatic character,advanced by the legal group brief and several others,is to support in the context of stable marriage the evidence as to child rearing by couples is the subject of controversy,but we need not enter the debate.whether or not children raised by marriages are on average better served,doma can not preclude couples in massachusetts from adopting children or prevent a woman partner from giving b
