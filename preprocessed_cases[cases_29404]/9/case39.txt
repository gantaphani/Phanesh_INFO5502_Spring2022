sims filed suit against stanton in federal district court under stat,alleging that stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the fourth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment to stanton,finding that stanton entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation,by the need to pursue patrick as he fled,and by sims lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home and even if a constitutional violation had occurred,stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.
sims appealed,and a panel of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed.the court held that stanton warrantless entry into sims yard was unconstitutional because sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself,because there was no immediate danger,and because patrick had committed only the minor offense of disobeying a police officer,at.the court also found the law to be clearly established that stanton pursuit of patrick did not justify his warrantless entry,given that patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor,at.the court accordingly held that stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity,at.we address only the latter holding here,and now reverse.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,quoting harlow fitzgerald.qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.ashcroft,slip,at quoting malley briggs.we do not require a case directly on point before concluding that the law is clearly established,but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.at slip,at.
there is no suggestion in this case that officer stanton knowingly violated the constitution the question is whether,in light of precedent existing at the time,he was plainly incompetent in entering sims yard to pursue the fleeing patrick,at slip,at.the ninth circuit concluded that he was.it did so despite the fact that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect.compare,middletown flinchum,ohio,we hold today that when officers,having identified themselves,are in hot pursuit of a suspect who flees to a house in order to avoid arrest,the police may enter without a warrant,regardless of whether the offense for which the suspect is being arrested is a misdemeanor and state ricci,the facts of this case demonstrate that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for the misdemeanor offense of disobeying a police officer where the defendant had fled into his home with police officers in hot pursuit,with mas corro billings,the warrantless entry based on hot pursuit was not justified where t he intended arrest was for a traffic misdemeanor committed by a minor,with whom the officer was well acquainted,who had fled into his family home from which there was only one exit footnote omitted,and butler state,even though officer sudduth might have been under the impression that he was in continuous pursuit of butler for what he considered to be the crime of disorderly conduct,since the crime is a minor offense,under these circumstances there is no exigent circumstance that would allow officer sudduth warrantless entry into butler home for what is concededly,at most,a petty disturbance 
other courts have concluded that police officers are at least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances because the constitutional violation is not clearly established,grenier champlin,putting firmly to one side the merits of whether the home arrests were constitutional,we can not say that only a plainly incompetent policeman could have thought them permissible at the time,where officers entered a home without a warrant in hot pursuit of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers order to remain outside internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
notwithstanding this basic disagreement,the ninth circuit below denied stanton qualified immunity.in its analysis on the hot pursuit point,the panel relied on two cases,one from this court,welsh wisconsin,and one from its own,united states johnson,en banc per curiam.neither case clearly establishes that stanton violated sims fourth amendment rights.
in welsh,police officers learned from a witness that edward welsh had driven his car off the road and then left the scene,presumably because he was drunk.acting on that tip,the officers went to welsh home without a warrant,entered without consent,and arrested him for driving while intoxicated a nonjailable traffic offense under state law,at.our opinion first noted our precedent holding that hot pursuit of a fleeing felon justifies an officer warrantless entry,at citing united states santana.but we rejected the suggestion that the hot pursuit exception applied there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of welsh from the scene of a crime.at.we went on to conclude that the officers entry violated the fourth amendment,finding it important that there was probable cause to believe that only a minor offense ha d been committed.ibid.in those circumstances,we said,application of the exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned.ibid.but we did not lay down a categorical rule for all cases involving minor offenses,saying only that a warrant is usually required,at.
in johnson,police officers broke into michael johnson fenced yard in search of another person steven smith whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor arrest warrants,at.the ninth circuit was clear that this case,like welsh,did not involve hot pursuit the facts of this case simply are not covered by the hot pursuit doctrine because smith had escaped from the police minutes prior and his whereabouts were unknown,at.the court held that the officers entry required a warrant,in part because smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses.then,in a footnote,the court said in situations where an officer is truly in hot pursuit and the underlying offense is a felony,the fourth amendment usually yields to law enforcement interest in apprehending a fleeing suspect.see santana,supra,at.however,in situations where the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor,law enforcement must yield to the fourth amendment in all but the rarest cases.welsh,supra,at.johnson,supra,at.
in concluding as it must have that stanton was plainly incompetent,at slip,at,the ninth circuit below read welsh and the footnote in johnson far too broadly.first,both of those cases cited santana with approval,a case that approved an officer warrantless entry while in hot pursuit.and though santana involved a felony suspect,we did not expressly limit our holding based on that fact.see,at the only remaining question is whether the suspect act of retreating into her house could thwart an otherwise proper arrest.we hold that it could not second,to repeat,neither welsh nor johnson involved hot pursuit.welsh,supra,at johnson,supra,at.thus,despite our emphasis in welsh on the fact that the crime at issue was minor indeed,a mere nonjailable civil offense nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important in cases of hot pursuit.third,even in the portion of welsh cited by the ninth circuit below,our opinion is equivocal we held not that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never justified,but only that such entry should be rare,at.
that is in fact how two california state courts have read welsh.in both people lloyd,cal.app,cal.rptr,and in re lavoyne,cal.app,cal.rptr,the california court of appeal refused to limit the hot pursuit exception to felony suspects.the court stated in lloyd where the pursuit into the home was based on an arrest set in motion in a public place,the fact that the offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the validity of the entry without a warrant.cal.app,at,cal,at.it is especially troubling that the ninth circuit would conclude that stanton was plainly incompetent and subject to personal liability for damages based on actions that were lawful according to courts in the jurisdiction where he acted,supra,at kennedy,concurring slip,at.
finally,our determination that welsh and johnson are insufficient to overcome stanton qualified immunity is bolstered by the fact that,even after johnson,two different district courts in the ninth circuit have granted qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established.see kolesnikov sacramento county,no,wl,ed,since welsh,it has not been clearly established that there can never be warrantless home arrests in the context of a hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing from the commission of misdemeanor offenses garcia imperial,wl,sd.in garcia,a case with facts similar to those here,the district court distinguished johnson as a case where the officers were not in hot pursuit of the suspect,had not seen the suspect enter the neighbor property,and had no real reason to think the suspect was there.wl.precisely the same facts distinguish this case from johnson stanton was in hot pursuit of patrick,he did see patrick enter sims property,and he had every reason to believe that patrick was just beyond sims gate.app.to pet.for cert.
to summarize the law at the time stanton made his decision to enter sims yard two opinions of this court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry two opinions of the state court of appeal affirmatively authorized that entry the most relevant opinion of the ninth circuit was readily distinguishable two federal district courts in the ninth circuit had granted qualified immunity in the wake of that opinion and the federal and state courts of last resort around the nation were sharply divided.
we do not express any view on whether officer stanton entry into sims yard in pursuit of patrick was constitutional.but whether or not the constitutional rule applied by the court below was correct,it was not beyond debate.supra,at slip,at.stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified,but he was not plainly incompetent.malley,at.
the petition for certiorari and respondent motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted,the judgment of the ninth circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
