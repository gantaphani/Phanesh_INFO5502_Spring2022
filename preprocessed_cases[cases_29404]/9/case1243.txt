in this case,anthony capobianco,was employed as a new york city sanitation worker.he suffers from congenital stationary night blindness,which prevents him from driving at night and makes it difficult for him to see and function in dim light.the new york city department of sanitation dos fired him,at least in part,as a jury could find,because of the limitations imposed by his medical condition.
capobianco brought this action against dos and the city of new york the city,alleging violations of the americans with disabilities act of,et the ada,and state and city law.the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion and dismissed the complaint because it concluded that no reasonable jury could find that capobianco was disabled or that defendants regarded him as being disabled within the meaning of the ada.
we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
statement of the case 
a.the facts 
capobianco is hired by dos 
capobianco was employed by dos from december,until november.he was hired only after many years of trying to obtain employment with dos,as he took the test to be a sanitation worker first in and again in.although he obtained perfect scores both times,he was not called by dos to be a sanitation worker until.
in june,as part of the evaluation process,capobianco filled out a dos medical questionnaire.he checked off yes for vision problems,and added a note explaining vision problems nearsighted.he was given an eye examination and dos advised him in august that it had determined that he was not qualified for the position of sanitation worker because of his visual deficit.by letter dated august,he appealed the decision to the new york city civil service commission.
in,capobianco underwent cataract surgery to improve his vision.his doctor reported that capobianco vision had improved to with both eyes together and in each eye separately.in july,with his appeal apparently still pending,capobianco wrote to the city,enclosing a letter from his doctor advising of the improvement.he asked dos to give him another eye examination so that he could be appointed a sanitation worker.
dos gave capobianco another vision test on january.this time,dos determined that capobianco had no visual deficit and that he was now medically qualified to perform the duties of a sanitation worker barring any other medical problems.on september,dos sent capobianco a notice advising him to report for processing.he did so in october,and was given another medical examination.he reported no medical or physical conditions that would interfere with his ability to perform the functions of the job,but did disclose that he had had cataract surgery.on october,capobianco filled out another dos medical questionnaire form.he again checked off yes for vision problems,and added the following explanation 
have been nearsighted since birth.in april of i had cataract surgery in both eyes to improve my vision.
on december,capobianco commenced employment with dos as a sanitation worker.after classroom instruction and hands on training,he was assigned to work in a queens garage.for the first month or so,he worked the day shift on a truck.this was a operation,with one person driving the truck along a predetermined route and the other picking up garbage and placing it into the back of the truck.capobianco performed both functions.
capobianco is diagnosed with night blindness 
on january,shortly after he returned from a vacation,capobianco was assigned to work an evening shift for the first time.he drove a sanitation truck that night without incident,as he was able to follow another sanitation worker in another truck performing relays,driving trucks that had been filled during the day shift and unloading them at a refuse transfer station.the next night,he was assigned to a different location in brooklyn.while driving on an unfamiliar,dark route in the rain,he had difficulty seeing signs and lines on the road.he returned to his garage in queens and informed his supervisor of the problems he had experienced.he had also developed a migraine headache,and the supervisor instructed him to go home sick.
capobianco stayed home the next day.when he returned to work,he visited the dos medical clinic.on february,he was placed on what is referred to within dos as a medical tissue he was assigned to light duty,with no driving.for about two months thereafter,he was primarily assigned to clerical duties,with some garbage collection.on march,a consulting reported that capobianco best corrected vision was and recommended further testing.on march,the medical tissue was changed to no night driving,day driving only.there were no other restrictions.
capobianco was then examined by scott brodie at mount sinai medical center,who,after performing a number of tests,diagnosed congenital stationary.in a report to dos dated april,brodie wrote 
this is an inherited condition,present throughout life.while there is no known treatment,capobianco can be expected to retain his present level of visual function indefinitely.the night blindness has been present since early childhood,and is not related to the recent cataract surgery or the size of the posterior capsulotomies.
as a consequence of capobianco visual condition,it would not be advisable for him to drive at night,particularly a vehicle.bad weather would of course further exaggerate the disability.it would be appropriate for capobianco to be placed on a duty schedule which avoids the need to drive at night.during daylight conditions,there is no significant visual disability.
this was the first time capobianco had been diagnosed with night blindness.on april,he was continued on a limited duty tissue,day driving only.
capobianco is discharged 
until july,dos continued to assign capobianco mostly to clerical work,even though he was capable of performing all duties during the day.for a period of time,from march,until the first week in may,he was detached temporarily to safety and training and performed field training.one supervisor described his work as terrific and outstanding,and he received a written commendation.
as of july,capobianco was assigned to regular duty,days only,which included driving a truck as well as working the back of the truck.he performed these duties in a satisfactory manner.one of his supervisors,however,refused to rate capobianco for two evaluation periods december,to march,and march,to june,twice writing unrateable on the form.a different supervisor rated capobianco work satisfactory,for the period june,to september,
on july,capobianco again was temporarily detached to safety and training.he assisted in the hiring of new dos employees,performed administrative and clerical functions,and also drove dos personnel to different locations,all during the day shift.he performed these duties satisfactorily,and one supervisor described him as an outstanding worker who did everything well.he was still working in safety and training when he learned,in,that he was being officially transferred to safety and training,effective october.
notwithstanding the transfer order,on november,just two weeks later,capobianco was informed by dos that he was being fired.he was not given an explanation.he subsequently received a letter dated november,that stated in its entirety 
your services as a sanitation worker are terminated under probation effective at the close of business on thursday,november.
after he was dismissed,capobianco was commended for his job performance in safety and training by the director of human resources.two weeks after his dismissal,he was given a certificate of achievement by the director and assistant director of safety and training.
capobianco medical condition is a factor 
internal dos records show that capobianco medical condition was a factor in dos decision to terminate his employment.on june,the personnel management division of dos wrote to dos human resources as follows 
the personnel management division recommends termination for probationary sanitation worker anthony copobianco sic.he is unable to perform in title duties of a sanitation worker due to myopic macular degeneration.copobianco sic was placed on a limited duty medical assignment by the medical division shortly after he was hired.
the head of the personnel management division followed up in a memorandum to human resources dated july,questioning why capobianco had not yet been fired 
on june,i sent the attached letter to you recommending termination of capobianco due to myopic macular degeneration.the eye problem he has hampers his ability to perform the duties of sanitation workers,especially during the night time hours.
if the disease is continuing to degenerate,why are we waiting to terminate him why did the clinic resume him sic to regular duties on a days only tissue 
on october,the personnel management division requested that the evaluation review board the erb of dos meet to discuss capobianco status.the erb met and recommended the termination of probationary sanitation worker capobianco due to inability to sustain regular duty resulting from a permanent medical condition.
capobianco night blindness 
during discovery in the proceedings below,capobianco designated brodie of mount sinai as an expert witness.brodie prepared a written expert report,in the form of a letter dated july,which was produced to defendants in discovery.brodie explained that capobianco night blindness 
impacts all attempts at activities performed under conditions of dim light.it is extremely difficult for him to find a seat in a dark movie theater or restaurant.it is unsafe for him to walk,run,or ride a bicycle outdoors at night,except in the most familiar and surroundings.independent excursions in the evening twilight must be planned with great care,or avoided altogether,due to the risk of his unexpectedly finding himself outdoors as night falls.nighttime outdoor recreation,such as campfires,or even a game of catch,must be severely curtailed.driving at night is impossible,a restriction which has effectively proscribed many opportunities for gainful employment which capobianco might otherwise pursue as a holder of a valid commercial driver license.
brodie also noted that a fter minutes in darkness,capobianco requires more than times as much light in order to see as does a person.brodie also explained that c ongenital stationary night blindness is quite rare,occurring in about individual in.capobianco was born with his night blindness and the condition is permanent and stationary it will not get better or worse with age.the condition can not be corrected with surgery,glasses,contact lenses,or other optical means.capobianco does not have myopic macular degeneration.
capobianco night blindness does not limit him in performing the daily activities of his life,as long as the lighting conditions are adequate.for example,he is able to care for his young daughter,including driving her to school in the morning and picking her up at.he is able to perform typical household tasks such as housecleaning and routine chores,including taking garbage to the curb at night and picking up at night toys or other items left in the front yard.he exercises regularly,including walking,jogging,and playing tennis,and walks his dog both at night and during the day.he also has an extensive work history,and has been able to work as an ambulance driver,a security guard,a toll taker,a postal worker,and an office worker.
capobianco is able to engage in these activities only during the day,except to the extent that he can take garbage to the curb or pick up toys in the front yard and the like at night because the outside of his home is and he has lived there for many years and the area is familiar to him.he can not jog,bike,or even walk at night or in the early morning when it is still dark.whenever he goes out at night,his wife or someone else must drive.although he has a commercial driver license,he is unable to take on any job that would involve driving at night or in dim light.
prior proceedings 
the administrative proceedings 
on february,capobianco filed a charge of discrimination against dos with the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc.on december,the eeoc issued a written determination finding that there was reasonable cause to believe that capobianco was discriminated against in violation of the ada.after efforts to conciliate were unsuccessful,the eeoc referred the matter to the united states department of justice doj on january.on april,capobianco received a letter from doj.
the proceedings below 
capobianco filed the action below on june,within days after receipt of the letter.the complaint asserted claims under the ada as well as the new york state human rights law,exec.law et,and the new york city human rights law,admin.code et.he asserted claims for discrimination based on disability as well as a perception of disability.
after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.by an unpublished opinion and order filed may,the district court allyne ross,district judge granted the motion in part and denied it in part.the district court dismissed the ada claims,concluding that no reasonable jury could find that capobianco was disabled or was regarded by defendants as being disabled within the meaning of the ada.the district court did not reach the merits of capobianco state and city claims,noting that the term disability is defined more broadly under state and city law than under the ada.the court nonetheless dismissed the state and city law claims as well,declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.
judgment was entered on may,dismissing the action,and capobianco filed a timely notice of appeal on june.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to exclude the two medical reports for abuse of discretion.joiner,d see also united states laflam,cir.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.woodman,at dawson bumble bumble,cir.we may affirm only if we conclude that on the record presented,considered in the light most favorable to capobianco,no reasonable jury could find in his favor on his claims under the ada.see shannon new york city transit,cir.
b.the medical reports 
in opposing defendants summary judgment motion,capobianco sought to rely on two reports from brodie.the first was brodie letter dated april,addressed to the medical division of dos.it was submitted to dos while capobianco was still an employee and was part of his employment file at dos.the second was brodie letter dated july,addressed to whom it may concern.during discovery capobianco designated brodie as his expert witness and the report was produced to defendants as part of capobianco expert disclosures,in accordance with rule a b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the district court held that brodie letters were inadmissible as unsworn statements and inadequate as a basis to oppose the defendants motion for summary judgment.as a general matter,it is correct that unsworn letters from physicians generally are inadmissible hearsay that are an insufficient basis for opposing a motion for summary judgment.see.e douglas victor capital group,d,physician letters in ada case see also united states all right,title interest in real prop.appurtenances,cir t he submission of an unsworn letter was an inappropriate response to the motion for summary judgment,and the factual assertions made in that letter were properly disregarded by the court.nonetheless,here it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to exclude the two letters.
first,the letters were submitted not by capobianco but by defendants,in support of their motion for summary judgment.they were attached as exhibits to defendants rule statement and were part of defendants moving papers.defendants cited both letters and relied on them in seeking summary judgment.hence,defendants waived any objections to the admissibility of the reports by offering them themselves.see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.u ncertified or otherwise inadmissible documents may be considered by the court if not challenged.the objection must be timely or it will be deemed to have been waived.footnote omitted see also.d b a statement is not hearsay if t he statement is offered against a party and is a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.neither side objected to the admissibility of the reports,and,indeed,both sides relied on them.
second,the district court sua sponte decision to exclude the reports prejudiced capobianco.because defendants had submitted the reports initially,capobianco reasonably believed that he could rely on them even though they were unsworn letters.with the reports apparently a part of the summary judgment record,and without notice that any issue existed as to their admissibility,capobianco understandably did not obtain a sworn affidavit from brodie,which presumably would have merely reiterated what was already in the letters.had he been given notice that this was an issue,capobianco could have obtained an affidavit easily,as brodie had already been designated an expert and his expert report had previously been produced.
third,the first report was not inadmissible hearsay in any event.it was a letter that brodie had submitted to dos while capobianco was still employed by dos.the letter was part of capobianco personnel file and apparently was considered by dos as it was making its decision to discharge him.hence,the letter was admissible as evidence of dos state of mind.see cameron cmty.aid for retarded children,cir holding in ada case that statements made to supervisor by other employees complaining about plaintiff were admissible to show supervisor state of mind and therefore were not hearsay.
accordingly,the district court abused its discretion by refusing sua sponte to consider brodie two reports.
c.the merits 
applicable law 
the ada prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability in the terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.a plaintiff asserting a violation of the ada must prove that the defendant is covered by the ada plaintiff suffers from or is regarded as suffering from a disability within the meaning of the ada plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation and plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability or perceived disability.see shannon,at giordano city of new york,cir.here,the district court addressed only the second element,and thus we only address the questions of whether capobianco was disabled or was regarded by defendants as being disabled within the meaning of the ada 
a disability is 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
the existence of a disability must be determined on a basis.toyota motor,williams,d.
not every impairment is a disability within the meaning of the ada rather,there are two requirements the impairment must limit a major life activity and the limitation must be substantial.a.
m ajor life activities are activities that are of central importance to daily life.toyota,at.the eeoc regulations define major life activities to include functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i see eeoc hunt,cir 
the regulations define the term substantially limits to mean 
i unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or 
ii significantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition,manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.
j.factors to consider in determining whether a major life activity is substantially limited include the nature and severity of the impairment its duration or expected duration and the existence of any actual or expected permanent or long term impact.id.j see toyota,at.s ubstantially in the phrase substantially limits suggests considerable or to a large degree,and thus clearly precludes impairments that interfere in only a minor way with the performance of manual tasks from qualifying as disabilities.alteration in original.moreover,the mere fact that an impairment requires an individual to perform a task differently from the average person does not mean that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada rather,there must be a significant restriction.see albertson,kirkingburg,d rejecting lower court transforming significant restriction into difference,thereby undercut ting the fundamental statutory requirement that only impairments causing substantial limitat ions in individuals ability to perform major life activities constitute disabilities second alteration in original.the inquiry is not just on the effect an impairment has on tasks associated with a specific job,but it must focus primarily on whether the claimant is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people daily lives.toyota,at.finally,we must consider the effect of the measures that the individual employs to mitigate or correct the impairment.see albertson,at.sutton united air lines,d.
a plaintiff is also disabled within the meaning of the ada if he is regarded by his employer as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.a regarded as claim turns on the employer perception of the employee and is therefore a question of intent,not whether the employee has a disability.colwell suffolk county police dep t,cir quoting francis city of meriden,cir.it is not enough that the employer perceive the employee as somehow disabled the employer must regard the employee as disabled within the meaning of the ada,having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.id.at emphasis omitted see jacques dimarzio,cir.
application 
we address first the district court ruling that capobianco was not disabled within the meaning of the ada as a matter of law and second the district court ruling that defendants did not regard capobianco as being disabled within the meaning of the ada as a matter of law.
capobianco disability 
in the district court,capobianco argued that his night blindness substantially limited two major life activities seeing and working.on appeal,he does not challenge the district court conclusion that his night blindness did not substantially limit his major life activity of working.accordingly,we address only the district court ruling with respect to the major life activity of seeing,which was characterized by the supreme court in toyota as a basic abilit y.at.
the district court held that no reasonable jury could find that capobianco night blindness substantially limited his major life activity of seeing.we disagree,for the record contains substantial evidence from which a jury could find that capobianco impairment substantially limited his ability to see,including the following 
first,as brodie explained,congenital stationary night blindness affects only in people,and after only minutes in the darkness,capobianco requires more than times as much light to see as does a person.
second,there is evidence in the record to show that capobianco night blindness prevents him from driving at night or in dim light,except in the most familiar and surroundings although capobianco has a commercial driver license,the condition also disqualifies him from jobs that would involve driving at night or in dim light.a jury could surely find that the average person in the general population can drive at night see j ii.
third,the record contains evidence to show that capobianco is unable to safely walk,run,or ride a bicycle outdoors at night,except in the most familiar and surroundings he has extreme difficulty finding a seat in a dark movie theater or restaurant he must avoid altogether or plan with great care independent excursions in the evening twilight,lest he find himself outdoors alone as night falls and he is severely restricted in terms of outdoor nighttime activities in general.although some of these activities are less important than others,a reasonable jury could surely find that at least some of these activities are of central importan
