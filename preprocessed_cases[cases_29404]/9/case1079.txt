rolon has served as a police officer in wallkill,new york,since.on april,of police james coscette signed a notice of disciplinary charges against rolon the april discipline,specifying that on february,when henneman asked rolon a series of questions concerning a harassment claim reported by police officer paul besser,rolon replied using coarse,violent,profane,insolent abusive language,and refused to respond to henneman inquiry.coscette suspended rolon without pay on april,for an indefinite period of time pending resolution of the charges.rolon subsequently served a unpaid suspension relating to this matter.
in may,henneman replaced coscette and became acting chief of the town of wallkill police department.three months later,in august,henneman served rolon with a second notice of discipline the august discipline.this notice contained nine charges of misconduct and fifteen specifications arising from events that took place between may and july.several of these alleged incidents of misconduct were not witnessed by henneman but were reported to him by moskowitz.pursuant to this second notice of discipline,henneman suspended rolon without pay pending resolution of the charges.
prior to the initiation of the august disciplinary proceedings,on may,rolon filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york conner,alleging that defendants coscette and henneman,among others,had violated his constitutional right to due process.moskowitz was not named as a defendant in this suit.
on january,the parties reached a settlement and,with respect to the named defendants,rolon agreed to a general release of claims arising from the april and august disciplinary actions.the settlement,however,did not reach the issue of rolon entitlement to back pay rather,the parties agreed to submit this issue to arbitration.the police department and rolon also agreed to submit the august disciplinary charges to arbitration,pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement cba between the town of wallkill and the town police benevolent association.
the august discipline charges were considered during arbitration hearings held on fourteen days between january and august.henneman and moskowitz both provided testimony at the arbitral hearings.during moskowitz,the arbitrator directed moskowitz to produce his personal notebooks for the period of february through august.moskowitz left the hearing with the intention to retrieve the notebooks,explaining that he had taken them home during lunch.he failed to return,and the town refused to order moskowitz to return with the notebooks.because of moskowitz actions,the arbitrator struck his testimony in its entirety.
in a decision and award dated february,the arbitrator found that neither henneman nor moskowitz provided truthful or credible testimony,and that henneman personal hostility toward rolon motivated many of his actions as acting chief of the department.the arbitrator found rolon guilty of only three charges of misconduct and ordered two days suspension without pay and oral counseling rolon was found not guilty of the remaining charges and was ordered reinstated to the police force with full back pay and restoration of his benefits.
on august,rolon filed suit under in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon.rolon alleged that by bearing false witness against him,henneman and moskowitz caused him anguish and injury,intentionally violated his right to due process of law,and abused their supervisory positions.the injury he alleged included humiliation and economic loss in the form of lost overtime pay.rolon also claimed that moskowitz lied to henneman about rolon misconduct,which led to the preferment of disciplinary charges and caused rolon emotional distress.
in response,henneman and moskowitz moved for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c,claiming that,as a result of the january settlement,rolon claims were barred by res judicata.in the alternative,henneman and moskowitz claimed either they were protected by qualified or absolute immunity,or rolon failed to state a cognizable claim for the denial of any substantive due process rights.the district court granted henneman judgment on the pleadings,ruling that absolute immunity attaches to henneman witness testimony at the arbitration proceedings at issue because testifying witnesses,including police officers,are entitled to absolute immunity from liability under based on their testimony.rolon i,d at.in a subsequent was delayed in issuing by moskowitz military district court granted moskowitz judgment on the pleadings.the district court first ruled that moskowitz was not entitled to absolute immunity as a testifying witness because his testimony was struck in its entirety by the arbitrator and,a ccordingly,there is no testimony to which immunity can attach.rolon ii,d at.second,the district court interpreted rolon claim that moskowitz lied to henneman and initiated false charges against him as comprising two separate claims,one for malicious prosecution and the other for fabrication of evidence.id.at.with respect to the malicious prosecution claim,the district court found that moskowitz was not eligible for absolute immunity because he was a complaining witness.id.although moskowitz may have been entitled to qualified immunity by virtue of this role,the district court found it unnecessary to reach the question because it found that rolon failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim.claims of malicious prosecution,the district court observed,are limited to the criminal arena,and o nly those malicious prosecution claims that implicate fourth amendment rights can be brought under.id.at citing albright oliver,d.because rolon did not face criminal charges and was not arrested or otherwise detained,the district court concluded that his fourth amendment rights were not implicated and that rolon failed to state a claim for malicious prosecution under.id.
with respect to rolon claim for fabrication of evidence,the district court explained that the second circuit has only recognized a constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigation capacity.id.quoting zahrey coffey,cir.the district court rejected rolon argument that deprivation of a property interest caused by fabrication of evidence must also give rise to a due process claim.id.at.it further noted that even were rolon claim cognizable,such a right was not clearly established in when moskowitz made the allegedly false accusations.thus,under the doctrine of qualified immunity,rolon could not prevail against moskowitz.id.at.in closing,the court noted that its dismissal does not mean that it condones moskowitz,it was truly contemptible.it simply means that plaintiff must avail himself of other means of redres
