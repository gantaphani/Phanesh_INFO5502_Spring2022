plaintiff carlos vives brought this action against defendants seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and monetary damages,based on his contention that his first and fourth amendment rights were violated when he was arrested for aggravated harassment pursuant to new york penal law section in connection with his mailing religious and political materials to jane hoffman,then a candidate for new york state lieutenant governor,and other people of the jewish faith.vives,d at.vives stated that he sent these materials with the intent to alarm the recipients about current world events that have been prophesied in the bible.id.
noting that section had never before been declared unconstitutional on its face,the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge nonetheless concluded that a declaration of the section unconstitutionality was inevitable,and that,under these circumstances,the defendants may be said to have had fair notice of section unconstitutionality prior to arresting vives.id.at.the district court consequently denied detectives li and lu motion for summary judgment and found that,if defendants wanted to avoid personal liability,they would have to prove at trial that their actions were reasonable under the circumstances.id.
because we hold that defendants did not have fair notice of the district court inevitable declaration of section unconstitutionality,we reverse the district court denial of defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the issue of defendants personal liability.
discussion 
we review a district court denial of summary judgment de novo.maxwell city of new york,cir.
we have held that 
absent contrary direction,state officials are entitled to rely on a presumptively valid state statute until and unless the statute is declared unconstitutional the enactment of a law forecloses speculation by enforcement officers concerning the law the possible exception of a law so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws.
connecticut ex rel.blumenthal crotty,cir citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.despite this directive,the district court did not apply the standard articulated in blumenthal to defendants case.instead,the district court relied on certain language from in re state police litigation,cir a case which did not involve state officials acting under the color of a decided that detectives li and lu were not entitled to rely on the presumptive constitutionality of section if,in light of law,the unlawfulness of their action s was apparent.vives,d at quoting in re state police,at.
the district court then found that law foreshadowed the unconstitutionality of section,id.at,with such obvious clarity that a reasonable officer would have known that arresting plaintiff under section for his mailings was unlawful,id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in so finding,the district court relied principally on four cases,see id.at,none of which stands for the proposition that section is facially unconstitutional.
in the first case relied on by the district court,people dupont,dep t,the appellate division held that section was unconstitutional only as applied to the facts before it people dietze,the second of the four,dealt with the constitutionality of an entirely different penal section the third case,schlagler phillips,was reversed on appeal,cir and in the fourth case,people mangano,the judgment was entered on july,more than a year after detectives li and lu arrested plaintiff on april,as such,none of these cases could possibly have served as fair notice to detectives li and lu that a declaration of section unconstitutionality was inevitable.vives,d at.
far from being so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws,blumenthal,at,several courts have specifically declined to find section unconstitutional.see,people diraimondo,misc d,dist,nassau cty finding that the defendant failed to meet the heavy burden of proving section unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt people miguez,misc d,dep t rejecting defendant contention that her conduct,which violated section,qualifie d as constitutionally protected speech people katz,misc d,dep t defendant argument that section is void for vagueness is unavailing.these cases,in conjunction with our ruling in schlagler,see note ante,lead us to conclude that the detectives reliance on the presumptive constitutionality of section was appropriate.
on the basis of the foregoing,we hold that defendants did not have fair notice of section purported unconstitutionality and that the district court erred in denying detectives li and lu qualified immunity on that ground.because we hold that the district court denial of qualified immunity to defendants was improper,we do not reach the question of whether new york penal law survives constitutional scrutiny,but save that question for another day.see ehrlich town of glastonbury,cir recognizing that,consistent with saucier katz,d,we may in certain circumstances move directly to the question of qualified immunity and refrain from determining whether a constitutional right has been violated see also ashwander tva.brandeis,concurring the court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record,if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.anobile pelligrino,cir principles of judicial restraint caution us to avoid reaching constitutional questions when they are unnecessary to the disposition of a case.
conclusion 
the portion of the district court judgment denying defendants qualified immunity is reversed,and the cause is remanded to the district court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of defendants on the issue of defendants personal liability.
i agree with the majority conclusion that the defendants did not have fair notice of unconstitutionality,and thus are entitled to qualified immunity.police officers clearly should not be subjected to liability for failing to substitute their own legal judgment for that of state trial and appellate courts.see pierson ray,d.
i respectfully depart from the majority insofar as it does not address the constitutionality of.the supreme court has instructed us as follows 
in a suit against an officer for an alleged violation of a constitutional right,the requisites of a qualified immunity defense must be considered in proper sequence.
a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right 
saucier katz,d.the majority passes over this preliminary inquiry,holding instead that the fair notice prong of the test is not met and from that concluding that there is no need to reach the constitutional question.saucier precludes this approach.finding a constitutional violation is a prerequisite to reaching the fair notice issue,and answering the constitutional question is therefore necessary to the disposition of the case.anobile pelligrino,cir.my reasons for this conclusion are detailed in the discussion that follows 
discussion 
in ehrlich town of glastonbury,cir,we reaffirmed that i n saucier,the supreme court made plain that a sequential analysis of qualified immunity claims is not simply recommended but required.id.at.ehrlich nonetheless found exceptions to this otherwise straightforward rule,based on principles set forth in our decision,horne coughlin,cir.i dissented in horne because supreme court precedent stated that the better approach to resolving cases in which the defense of qualified immunity is raised is to determine first whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.normally,it is only after making such a determination that a court should ask whether the right allegedly implicated was clearly established at the time of the events in question.county of sacramento lewis,d.from this i concluded 
a federal court faced with a suit alleging the deprivation of a constitutional right under should ordinarily decide whether the constitutional right alleged by the plaintiff actually exists,even where the defense of qualified immunity might provide an alternative ground for decision.although this principle need not govern in each and every case,it is undoubtedly the n ormal rule and the better approach to constitutional adjudication in litigation.moreover,neither the policy of avoidance of constitutional questions nor the remote possibility of clarifying the law in later suits for injunctive relief justifies a departure from this general principle.rather,courts remain free to depart from the general rule only in those situations where they can articulate a persuasive reason for doing so.
horne,at cardamone,dissenting.i did not believe that the horne majority articulated sufficient reasons for avoiding the constitutional question in that case.
of course,i was outvoted in horne,and the ehrlich panel sought to salvage what it could of horne in light of the supreme court holding in saucier that the threshold constitutional inquiry is mandatory rather than simply the better approach.whatever misgivings i may have about ehrlich treatment of saucier,ehrlich is the law in the circuit and must be met on its own terms.even working within the confines of ehrlich,however,i can not agree with the majority because ehrlich does not provide authority to allow us to decline to reach the constitutional issue in this case.
ehrlich states that in those situations in which one can conclude that the supreme court did not intend to make the saucier sequence mandatory,the horne principles are relevant to determining whether we should avoid the constitutional question.ehrlich,at.those principles indicate,for example,that this court should address particularly egregious constitutional violations before deciding the qualified immunity issue may pass over particularly difficult constitutional questions and move directly to the qualified immunity issue and when defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,may pass over the constitutional inquiry to avoid constitutional dicta.id.at.
the ehrlich panel identified two situations in which it may frequently be appropriate to conclude that the saucier sequence is inapplicable and the horne principles are relevant.id.at.first,we need not follow the saucier inquiry if there is no likelihood that the constitutional question will escape federal court review over a lengthy period because federal courts will not repeatedly rely on qualified immunity to decide cases.koch town of brattleboro,cir quoting horne,at see ehrlich,at.second,we need not follow saucier if the existence of a constitutional violation depends on the resolution of uncertain state law,meaning that a federal court would have to first interpret state law and then decide whether its interpretation presents a constitutional problem.ehrlich,at.
neither of these exceptions from saucier apply to this case.first,this is precisely the type of constitutional issue that will repeatedly escape review by federal courts.as the majority opinion demonstrates,numerous new york state courts have upheld the constitutionality of or have applied the law as if it was constitutional.thus,police the defendants in this always lack fair notice of the law unconstitutionality and will always be entitled to qualified immunity.federal courts reviewing arrests under,like the majority here,will repeatedly rely on qualified immunity and thus this issue will escape federal court review over a lengthy period.koch,at quoting horne,at.
second,this is plainly not an unsettled or ambiguous state law that we would need to interpret.when state law is unclear,adopting our own interpretation of state law would actually subvert saucier,by inducing state actors to rely on our rule when that rule might change altogether upon subsequent review by the relevant state courts.ehrlich,at.no such concern is present here.the majority concedes that is over years old and that numerous state courts have found it constitutional.the statute plain language defines the crime of aggravated harassment in the second degree as communicat ing with a person anonymously or otherwise,by telephone,or by telegraph,mail or any other form of written communication,in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm with the intent to harass,annoy,threaten or alarm the other person.state courts have applied this provision to mean exactly what it says that in order to obtain a conviction for aggravated harassment in the second degree,the state need only prove that a person,like vives,invaded substantial privacy interests by communicating in an annoying or alarming manner.see,people goldstein,misc d.term people cooper,misc d,nassau county people miguez,misc d,aff,misc d.term 
the meaning of this law is straightforward and unambiguous,and the state courts have given us no cause to think otherwise.indeed,since state courts have interpreted the meaning of this law consistently over the past years,there is no realistic possibility that state courts are suddenly going to reinterpret.there is,of course,always a chance that the new york state court of appeals will reverse several lower state courts and hold the law unconstitutional,but this does not mean that the meaning of the law is unsettled.and,in any event,such a possibility is not an adequate reason for a federal court to decline to exercise its responsibility to determine what the federal constitution requires.
the majority states no rationale for deciding that saucier is inapplicable.instead,it relies solely on the horne factors as a reason to disregard saucier,an approach that we explicitly rejected in ehrlich.see ehrlich,at these principles can not,of course,make discretionary what the supreme court has deemed mandatory.they do,however,affect the choice in those cases in which the underlying rationale in saucier does not apply.emphases omitted.
c.the horne factors 
the majority rests its decision on the avoidance of constitutional dicta.under ehrlich,this is not,in itself,a sufficient ground for disregarding saucier.even if it were,however,it provides no justification for avoiding the constitutional question in this case.
in cases in which we ultimately resolve the issue in favor of defendants on qualified immunity grounds,any finding of a constitutional violation is dicta.as we noted in ehrlich,however,the supreme court,by the very logic of saucier,makes clear that such dicta is enough to put defendant state actors on notice that,if they repeat their acts,they will not have the benefit of qualified immunity.ehrlich,at.i believe this principle carries added weight in a case where,as here,state courts have placed the imprimatur of legitimacy on an arguable violation of the federal constitution,and thus if a federal court does not step in and inform state actors that the law violates the federal constitution,state law enforcement officers will continue to be placed in the same impossible position as the defendants in this case they will have a duty to enforce a law that violates core federal constitutional rights because state courts have told them that the law is valid.
although the horne majority expressed concern about constitutional holdings in dicta,horne,at,none of those concerns should overcome the necessity of reaching the constitutional issue in this case.the horne majority fretted that judges risk being insufficiently thoughtful and cautious in uttering pronouncements in dicta,and that parties may do an inadequate job briefing and presenting an issue that predictably will have no effect on the outcome of the case.id.at.such concerns,to the extent they are relevant at all,are hardly relevant here.i doubt that any member of this panel fails to understand the importance of the issues in this case or has been insufficiently thoughtful and cautious in deciding this appeal.
further,the majority can not reasonably declare that the parties did not adequately address this issue.defendants were represented on appeal by the corporation counsel of the city of new york.that office,although it preferred to
