background 
tanner company,based in salt lake city,utah,assists companies in developing programs to recognize and reward their employees.its services include providing custom gifts or jewelry for service anniversaries.tanner hired appellant in to help develop a market in the northeast.he began as a salesperson in the boston area,advanced to regional sales manager as the supervisor of several other employees,and achieved a record of superior performance in generating new business.his region ranked in the top ten for sales for twelve of the last fifteen years of his employment,and among other recognitions,he shared the most impressive customer commitment award with another regional manager in.
in july,however,the sales director for the boston region and appellant superior,rulon horne,drafted a memo identifying eight concerns that had developed about appellant performance and other matters.according to horne,appellant personal sales numbers had been lagging and he had become less involved in the region business and activities.doug duckworth,horne predecessor,testified that he communicated a similar concern about appellant lack of involvement in the region to horne during the transition in sales directors earlier in the year.in addition to declining sales,the issues identified in horne memo included appellant intimidating management style,lack of respect for horne,resistance to signing a confidentiality agreement,and the lack of growth in repeat sales in the boston region.horne also noted two operational changes the company wished to effectuate in the boston office to end the relationship with appellant wife brochure business,and to either relocate the regional office from a building owned by appellant or obtain a lease from him.finally,the memo noted appellant minimal use of his laptop computer,which frustrated the company effort to track activity at its field offices.
a few days after writing the memo,horne met with his superiors to discuss his concerns.present at the meeting,which was held at the corporate office in salt lake city,were tanner chief executive officer,don ostler its president,kent murdock the executive vice president of sales,tim treu and the vice president of sales,dale sansom.the group agreed that appellant would be offered the opportunity to correct the problems,and horne and treu arranged to meet with wallace in boston at the end of august.
in sessions on august and,horne and treu reviewed with appellant the concerns listed in horne memo.horne testified that appellant was not given advance notice of the agenda in order to prevent him from his responses.although the parties differ on certain particulars of the meetings,they agree that appellant made a commitment to address each of the eight items.in response to questions about sales performance,appellant explained that he had credited much of his own personal business to doug mercer,the senior sales associate in the office.treu notes of the meeting on the first day report that wallace also attributed his lower performance to other factors,including concern about his daughter health.in his deposition,however,appellant testified that he may have made reference to his daughter illness,but said that her health was not a distraction that affected his work for tanner.he attributed his lower numbers entirely to the allocation of his business to mercer and agreed to meet with his staff to the credit for sales that generated he also promised quick action on other issues,stating that a lease and the signed confidentiality agreement would be submitted early the next week,and he would dial in on his laptop immediately.
treu and horne returned to utah on wednesday,august.on friday,august,the boston office administrator,patty prew,separately called two headquarters employees who worked in the sales promotion and customer service departments,apparently to express surprise that appellant had not been fired.prew told the two employees,kathie lewis and carol anderson,that appellant was not actively involved in the region business and was spending substantial time on other,personal activities.prew asked that horne call her at home the next day so that she could communicate her concerns directly to him.in a phone conversation with horne,she reported that appellant had paid little attention to tanner business for the past two years because of his preoccupation with a personal real estate investment.he had purchased a large parcel of land that he hoped to develop for commercial,residential and recreational uses.
aware that prew was unhappy with appellant because she felt underpaid company officials sought confirmation of her information from other sources.anderson,one of the headquarters employees whom prew had contacted,told horne and treu that her contacts with appellant had dropped off in the previous year or so lewis reported only two conversations with appellant during the eight months she had been working with his region.horne spoke with appellant reported that appellant was no longer heavily involved in tanner business.horne and treu also did an online search of boston area newspapers and found that they were full of articles covering meetings and battles concerning appellant real estate project treu notes describe the coverage as one of the biggest ongoing stories of the year.according to horne deposition testimony,this information filled in the unanswered question as to what had really gone on here,and it created,in our mind,the perception that appellant had not been forthright in his answers to us as to why he was distracted.
the four officers who had met previously to discuss appellant work,treu,ceo ostler and company president consulted and decided to terminate him.murdock testified that the company officials felt duped and misled by the discussions with appellant in boston the previous week,concluding that he was collecting a lot of money for not doing anything at tanner.horne and treu flew to boston and told appellant on september that he was being terminated,attributing the decision to his involvement with the real estate development.
in depositions and documents,appellant offered a competing version of his work habits.he disputed the contention that he was neglecting his tanner duties in favor of the real estate project,stating that he spent relatively little time on the development.he stated that he devoted full days to tanner business,though he worked often at home and sometimes in the middle of the night.his counsel elicited from both prew and mercer an acknowledgment that they did not know either how he spent his time away from the office or what he was doing when he was in the office.
to prove that his termination was not only unjustified,but motivated by age discrimination,appellant offered evidence of statements by three tanner officials.all but one occurred during the and involved comments by horne two predecessors as director of sales,duckworth and brent west.according to appellant,west was the first to ask about his retirement plans.appellant responded that he had no plans to retire and intended to remain with tanner until age.when west asked the same question about six months later,appellant gave the same answer,prompting west to reply well,tom,do you think that,you know,you get tired of this business,and is a long way away.
the issue of appellant retirement came up again when mercer,his associate sales representative,bypassed opportunities to apply for regional sales manager positions in other areas of the country.duckworth asked appellant why the mercer did not seek the positions and was told that he did not want to leave n
