appealing from an adverse judgment of the district court,the parents of andrew,a disabled child who is attending a catholic elementary school,assert that the individuals with disabilities education act idea,is unconstitutional as applied to their son.while he,like other disabled children who go to private schools,receives some educational services under federal and state law,he is not entitled by law to the panoply of services available to disabled public school students under the rubric of free and appropriate public education fape,nor to the due process hearing provided to public school students alone.appellants argue that the difference in treatment of their disabled son,who is attending a religious school,from other disabled students,who are attending public schools,violates the free exercise clause of the first amendment to the federal constitution,the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution,and the federal religious freedom restoration act rfra,to.
the district court considered these contentions upon cross motions for summary judgment.rejecting appellants claims,it granted the appellee manchester school district motion for summary judgment and denied summary judgment to appellants.gary manchester sch,d.
on appeal,appellants reiterate their contentions.after carefully considering them,we find ourselves in agreement with the district court.in disposing of this appeal,we are also in substantial accord with much of the reasoning contained in its published memorandum and order.id.at.we see,therefore,no need to go over yet again all of the groundwork covered there.nor need we restate the background facts already described in detail in the district court opinion.id.at.we add,however,at some length,our own analysis of several of the key issues.
appellants lead argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that the federal law did not violate andrew and his parents free exercise rights under the first amendment.they reject the district court assertion that the supreme court decision in employment div.dep t of human res.of oregon smith,d,is controlling.smith,according to the district court,exempted most neutral laws of general applicability from the compelling interest test.in the district court view,
a law ordinarily need not be justified by a compelling interest if it is neutral in that it is not targeted at religiously motivated conduct and generally applicable in that it does not selectively burden religious conduct.see church of lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.
idea and its regulations,the district court says,do not target religiously motivated conduct and is generally applicable in that it does not selectively burden religious conduct.for these reasons,and because appellants first amendment claim is not hybrid,is not linked to a separate constitutional claim,the district court found no violation of free exercise rights.id.we do not disagree.
appellants reject the district court analysis.they ask us to read smith as limited to instances of socially harmful or criminal conduct.they point out that smith did not purport to overrule the supreme court holdings in the cases of hobbie unemployment appeals comm n,d,thomas review bd.of the indiana employment sec,d,and sherbert verner,d.in hobbie and sherbert,the complainants were denied unemployment benefits following discharge because of their refusal to work on saturday,complainant religion sabbath.in thomas,the complainant was denied unemployment benefits after discharge based on his refusal to help produce armaments.holding that the denial of a public benefit in these circumstances burdened plaintiff religion,the court ruled that,in order to justify an action having such an effect under the clause,the government had to demonstrate that the withholding of the benefit served a compelling governmental interest and was the least restrictive means to that end.hobbie,at.thomas,at.sherbert,at.appellants have likened the denial of educational disability benefits here to those situations,asking us similarly to apply strict scrutiny.if we do,appellants contend,we will find that andrew attendance at a catholic school is mandated by his parents religious beliefs.no compelling governmental interest is served,they say,by withholding from him the identical benefits granted to his peers at public schools.
it is not always easy to predict what analytical framework the supreme court will apply to the various,factually dissimilar free exercise cases that arise.smith rejected a free exercise claim involving the use of peyote,an illegal substance.writing for five of the justices,justice scalia endorsed the constitutionality of neutral,generally applicable laws even when they impinged incidentally upon individual religious practices.smith,at.the smith majority expressly limited hobbie,thomas and sherbert to the unemployment compensation field.smith,at.while,as appellants point out,justice scalia in smith also distinguished hobbie,thomas and sherbert on the narrower ground that the use of peyote was illegal,at,the majority overall message is unmistakably contrary to appellants present argument that hobbie,thomas and,in particular,the compelling interest broadly applicable here.smith,insofar as can be told from reading the court more recent precedent,remains good law,albeit reflective when written of the thinking of a narrow majority of justices,some of whom no longer serve.see,watchtower bible and tract soc y of vill.of stratton,d discussing in dicta that lower court relied on smith standard city of boerne flores,d invalidating statute that sought to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in sherbert verner,and wisconsin yoder,that had been rejected in smith richard schragger,the role of the local in the doctrine and discourse of religious liberty,harv,describing the current doctrine notes,they drew a circle that shut me in the free exercise implications of zelman,harv,although the smith rule has been criticized by several at the time of the decision and court has reiterated its commitment to the rule and rebuffed a congressional attempt to change it.footnotes omitted ming hsu chen,note,two wrongs make a right hybrid claims of discrimination,notwithstanding any of its flaws,smith remains good law.
we also agree,for the reasons the district court stated,that this case is not a hybrid one.hence,we conclude that the district court analyzed the case under the correct standard.gary,d at.
while we could perhaps leave the free exercise analysis there,an even more fundamental reason causes us to reject appellants first amendment arguments.we can not accept appellants contention that providing to all disabled attendees at private schools,both sectarian and secular,fewer benefits than those granted to public school attendees is truly analogous to denying unemployment benefits to persons fired because of their insistence upon celebrating the sabbath or not producing weapons.
the state unemployment benefits denied in hobbie,thomas,sherbert were public benefits,available to all.plaintiffs would have received them had their refusal to work on a certain day or at a certain job not been erroneously viewed by local authorities as misconduct.while appellants say their son attendance at a catholic school is likewise a act,there is a basic difference.he and they are not being deprived of a generally available public benefit.rather,the benefits to which appellants lay claim under the first amendment are benefits the federal government has earmarked solely for students enrolled in the nation public still available for andrew were he sent to a public school,though not otherwise.since the early days of public education in this country,public financial aid has commonly been limited to public rather than independent schools.while the parents of private school attendees pay the same taxes as public school parents,the former tax money normally supports their own children education only if they transfer them to a public school.to be sure,parents have a protected right to send their children to private schools if they so desire.pierce soc y of sisters.state law compelling public
