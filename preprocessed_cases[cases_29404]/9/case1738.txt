opinion of the court 
at the end of gary marshall alston sentence in a new jersey prison,he was involuntarily committed to greystone park psychiatric hospital.while there,alston sued various greystone employees in a pro se complaint,raising several challenges with respect to his prison sentence and his psychiatric commitment.before the merits of alston claims could be tested,the district court granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under.b.the court concluded that alston pleading did not meet the factual specificity requirement for civil rights complaints and dismissed his complaint.because we hold that the district court subjected alston complaint to a heightened pleading standard no longer applicable in such civil rights cases,we will reverse.
challenging his transfer to greystone,alston filed two pro se complaints under on december.in those complaints,which were later consolidated,alston sought over million in damages from four greystone employees,who he contended had violated his rights.the employees included william parker,jack singer,and lynda navratil collectively,defendants the complaints,the pertinent text of which we set forth in the margin,are not models of clarity yet,their thrust is clear enough alston questioned the basis of his transfer to greystone and requested the appointment of counsel to help advance his case.
the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,who granted alston application for counsel on march.the threshold requirement for the appointment of counsel to indigent plaintiffs is the arguable legal and factual merit of a complaint.see tabron grace,cir.the magistrate judge recognized two claims in alston complaint a claim that his term in prison caused him such harm that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment and that his involuntary commitment,as alston put it without victim without evidence,violated due process.with respect to the latter claim,the magistrate judge cited vitek jones,d,in which the supreme court articulated the minimum procedural protections that must be afforded to a prisoner who is transferred to a psychiatric institution.such procedures include fair notice and a hearing at which evidence may be presented.this vitek claim is at the heart of alston complaint.the magistrate judge recognized the legal sufficiency of these claims,but noted at the same time the paucity of factual development.nevertheless,after considering other factors,including his doubt that alston could adequately present his case without assistance,he ordered counsel to be appointed.
four years later,in august of,the district court finally appointed counsel for alston by that time,alston had been released from greystone and his whereabouts were unknown.eventually,his counsel successfully located him and entered into a representation agreement on november.one month later,on december,alston counsel filed a status update with the district court.counsel informed the district court that it was attempting to locate,and serve alston pro se complaint on,the defendants.a similar status update was filed on february.notwithstanding these updates,on march,the district court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.
subsequently,alston counsel successfully served the complaint on three out of the four named defendants and petitioned the district court to reconsider its dismissal.on january,the district court reinstated the case upon alston motion and vacated its earlier dismissal order.the defendants responded by filing a b motion,invoking various defenses,such as defects in the pleading,witness immunity,qualified immunity,and sovereign immunity.
the district court determined that alston complaint was fatally defective,and on that basis,granted the motion to dismiss.citing darr wolfe,cir,the court observed that it was well settled that civil rights complaints must be pled with factual specificity.concluding that alston complaint was unsubstantiated and did not specifically set forth how each defendant infringed alston rights,the district court found that alston had not met the pleading requirements necessary to pursue a action.the district court further held that alston had sufficient notice of this pleading defect,referring to the magistrate judge admonition in that the allegations lacked factual support accordingly,the district court entered an order granting the defendants b motion and dismissing the complaint.the order did not specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice,but pursuant to.b,we treat the dismissal as an adjudication upon the merits.subsequently,the district court rejected alston motion for reargument and reconsideration.alston appeals both the orders dismissing his complaint and denying reconsideration.
alston principal contention on appeal is that he should have been permitted to have discovery so as to comply with the standard imposed by the district court.this court has long recognized the importance of discovery in the successful prosecution of civil rights complaints.see colburn upper darby township,cir i n civil rights cases much of the evidence can be developed only through discovery of materials held by defendant officials.quoting frazier southeastern.transp,cir.we acknowledge alston need for discovery to present his case,which we discuss more fully below.but,the lack of discovery was not the real barrier blocking alston path to relief.rather,it was the stringent pleading standard presupposed by the parties and the district court.our discussion therefore begins by examining the district court requirement of factual specificity,which is in conflict with.a simplified notice pleading standard.we will then consider alston contention that the district court should have presented an opportunity to amend the complaint before dismissing it with prejudice.lastly,we will comment on the right to discovery in actions such as this.
jurisdiction was proper in the trial court based on.our review is predicated on.we have plenary review of the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to.b.nami fauver,cir.in considering this appeal from a rule b dismissal,we accept all allegations as true and attribute all reasonable inferences in favor of alston.thus,we will affirm the district court dismissal only if it appears that alston could prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.id.at.we review the district court denial of reconsideration for abuse of discretion.max seafood caf√© ex rel.lou ann,quinteros,cir.
the district court tested alston complaint against a pleading requirement for civil rights cases based on our opinion in darr wolfe.the district court observed that it was well settled that third circuit law requires civil rights plaintiffs to plead with particularity we disagree.
alston complaint should have been considered not under a heightened pleading requirement,but under the more liberal standards of notice pleading.although once enforced in several circuits,including ours,a requirement for civil rights complaints has been rejected by the supreme court in no uncertain terms.leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d.in leatherman,the court instructed that rule standard for averments of fraud and mistake should not be imported to the notice pleading standard of rule,which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.id.more recently,in swierkiewicz sorema,d,the court reaffirmed its holding in leatherman and stated that rule a simplified pleading standard applies to all civil actions,with limited exceptions.our court of appeals has recognized the supreme court abrogation of a heightened pleading requirement for actions.see ray kertes,cir t he court has explained that courts should narrowly interpret statutory language to avoid heightened pleadings standards.abbott latshaw,cir observing that nothing more is required of cases than the notice pleading requirement of rule.
while our ruling in darr,at,is one of several decisions in which this court imposed a higher bar for pleadings,see,frazier,at ross meagan,cir rotolo borough of charleroi,cir,none of which have been expressly overruled,these pronouncements preceded and can not be reconciled with the supreme court holdings in leatherman and swierkiewicz.insofar as our decisions,such as darr,run counter to the principle of notice pleading in actions,they are not controlling.fundamentally,a heightened pleading requirement for civil rights complaints no longer retains vitality under the federal rules 
alston complaint should have been subject only to the short and plain statement requirement of rule a.courts are to construe complaints so as to do substantial justice.f,keeping in mind that pro se complaints in particular should be construed liberally.dluhos strasberg,cir.comprising only two paragraphs in all,alston pro se complaint was short and,despite some vagueness,sufficiently plain.both the district court and the magistrate judge found that the complaint,construed liberally,set forth cognizable legal claims.likewise,the defendants never argued that the complaint ran afoul of the short and plain statement requirement to the contrary,their b motion was replete with defenses that responded to claims they discerned in alston complaint.
although alston complaint arguably complies with rule a,we recognize that it lacks clarity and will likely require amendment.indeed,his complaint has yielded varied interpretations.the magistrate judge recognized two claims,one involving the cruel and unusual punishment clause and the other a deprivation of due process.the defendants,in their b motion,focused instead on alston allegations of slander,that he was committed to greystone as a result of false testimony.in addition to these claims,alston response to the b motion included claims concerning the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses of the constitution.given these varying interpretations of what is at issue,we concede that alston complaint may have lacked enough detail to have served its function as a guide to discovery.mchenry renne,cir stating that a complaint should set forth who is being sued,for what relief,and on what theory,with enough detail to guide discovery.thus,we have no doubt that the complaint will require amendment.we are equally certain that alston may have made some progress in that regard had he been afforded the opportunity.the denial of that opportunity to amend will be taken up next.
while the district court error in granting defendants b motion by imposing a requirement on alston complaint mandates that we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings,alston argues that irrespective of the appropriate pleading standard,he should have been given an opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissal.indeed,alston counsel stated at oral argument that alston intends to amend both the allegations and the parties named in the complaint.in particular,it appears that alston will seek to strike all but the claim that his involuntary commitment violated due process and seek to add new jersey state officials in their official capacity.we therefore discuss the issue of amendment as guidance for the district court consideration on remand.
we have held that even when a plaintiff does not seek leave to amend,if a complaint is vulnerable to b dismissal,a district court must permit a curative amendment,unless an amendment would be inequitable or futile.grayson mayview state,cir citing shane fauver,cir.in shane,we held that this aspect should be considered and noted in dismissing a claim for failure to state a claim 
w e suggest that district judges expressly state,where appropriate,that the plaintiff has leave to amend within a specified period of time,and that application for dismissal of the action may be made if a timely amendment is not forthcoming within that time.if the plaintiff does not desire to amend,he may file an appropriate notice with the district court asserting his intent to stand on the complaint,at which time an order to dismiss the action would be appropriate.
id.at quoting borelli city of reading,cir as we noted in shane,these principles apply equally to pro se plaintiffs and those represented by experienced counsel.at citing district council bradley,cir.dismissal without leave to amend is justified only on the grounds of bad faith,undue delay,prejudice,or futility.id.at citing in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.
on remand,the district court should offer alston leave to amend pursuant to the above procedures for b dismissals,unless a curative amendment would be inequitable,futile,or untimely.neither the district court nor the defendants made or advocated such a finding,or even argued that there was bad faith,undue delay,prejudice,or futility.
amendments to pleadings are governed by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.in particular,rule a provides that a party can amend the complaint to add or substitute parties,as alston is apparently intending to do.rule c,however,sets forth requirements that determine whether an amendment adding an entirely new defendant will relate back to the original date of the filing of the complaint for purposes of the governing statute of limitations.
the relation back provision of rule aims to relieve the harsh result of the strict application of the statute of limitations.garvin city of philadelphia,cir.the issue then becomes whether the proposed pleading amendment to add or substitute defendants will relate back to the date of the filing of the original complaint rule c requires that for an amendment adding a new party to relate back,the proposed new defendants must have had actual or constructive notice of the institution of the action within the period set forth by rule m,days.see garvin,at explaining that t he parties to be brought in by amendment must have received notice of the institution of the action within days following the filing of the action,the period provided for service of the complaint by rule m of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the district court should make all these determinations in the first instance 
as we indicated at the outset,alston argues that he should have been given the opportunity to engage in some discovery in order to live up to the specificity standard the district court imposed.we note,first,that,as discussed above,no such standard exists.second,to the extent that in a civil rights action the court finds that plaintiff may be disadvantaged by not having access to precisely who the relevant actors were,and their precise roles,perhaps access to some initial discovery would be advisable.we have noted the difficulty faced by plaintiffs in such situations.see colburn,at.while the federal rules do not provide for discovery in aid of pleading,as such,nonetheless it would be beneficial in difficult cases such as this.but,again,we note that it is not essential at the pleading stage in order to satisfy the standard of notice pleading,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering it 
the district court dismissed alston complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend.we conclude that the district court erred in applying a heightened pleading standard,and that,in light of the procedures for b dismissal,the district court should offer alston an opportunity to amend his complaint absent inequity,futility,or untimeliness.therefore,we will vacate the order dismissing the complaint and will remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
although alston also named carroll simmon as a defendant,the parties have been unable to identify such an individual.
with the exception of misspellings,we set out alston allegations verbatim.in one complaint,alston stated defendant s slanderous allege that i was a threat s that got me six month s more in jail without victim without evidence when than know i have no other right to petitioner the covered which i am exercising.in the other complaint,alston stated plaintiff did seventeen years in hard labor and maximum security jail after serving this cruel and unusual punishment s i am denied release as the judiciary promised at the completion of my jail term i was transfer to another jail for an year now for allege medical reason s that never h
