qin wen zheng,a chinese citizen from changle city in the fujian province of china,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying his second motion to reopen proceedings in his case as untimely and numerically barred under c.in re qin wen zheng,no.a,see also c ii allowing for one motion to reopen filed within ninety days of the final agency decision.zheng contends that the bia wrongly determined that he failed to demonstrate changed country conditions in china that might exempt the motion from those bars.as particularly relevant here,zheng argues that the bia erred in rejecting for lack of authentication a purported notice from a municipal government in china threatening him with severe punish ment if he did not abandon his application for asylum and return to china forthwith.
background 
zheng arrived in the united states in july.he applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat based on the alleged forced sterilization of his wife under the chinese policy.at a hearing before immigration judge ij adam opaciuch,zheng conceded removability.he testified and submitted documentary evidence in support of his claims.on june,the ij denied zheng requests for relief,determining that his testimony was not credible because it was inconsistent with his prior statements and other documentary evidence,and that he,therefore,failed to meet his burdens of proof.in re qin wen zheng,no.a immig.city june.zheng appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision,without opinion,on november.in re qin wen zheng,no.a.zheng did not petition this court for review of that decision.
in october,zheng filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.he again argued the merits of his asylum claim and submitted,inter alia,affidavits from,and photographs of,his wife and children in china.on april,the bia denied the motion,finding that zheng had filed the motion beyond the time limit and had failed to establish changed circumstances that would permit a late filing.in re qin wen zheng,no.a.again,zheng refrained from petitioning this court for review.
in august,zheng filed a second motion to reopen,claiming that he was newly eligible for relief based on changed country conditions in china.he submitted a variety of documents in support of his motion,including various country reports from the united states department of state,the governments of the united kingdom and canada,and amnesty international a newspaper article an internet printout of a chinese law addressing the entry and exit of citizens to and from china and a copy of a decision by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.he also submitted a notice allegedly sent to his wife from officials of his local village that,he contends,demonstrates that conditions had materially changed there.
the village notice 
the notice that zheng submitted was in chinese accompanied by an english translation.entitled notice we refer to it hereinafter as such,it is dated june,and its letterhead in the submitted english translation reads long tian villager commission,guhuai town,changle city,fujian province,china.it also appears to have a stamp on the lower right quadrant which is translated to read long tian villager commission,guhuai town,changle city.as translated,the notice reads in its entirety 
the government is currently investigating those people who had left the country illegally and applied for asylum in overseas.their behaviors has damaged our countries international image.from the report we received,we found out that your husband,zheng qin wen is among those people.he not only violated the family planning policy in china,but also illegally left china and went to the united states wherein he did something detrimental to our country dignity.it is hereby ordered that you must persuade your husband zheng qin wen immediately stopping his asylum application in overseas,coming back to china and surrendering himself to the government to obtain a lenient treatment.otherwise,he will be severely punished if he is arrested.
the notice was supported solely,and only to some extent,by an affidavit from zheng wife.also translated from chinese to english the affidavit rehearses the underlying assertions of zheng asylum application.the affidavit also attempts to provide further context to the local government crackdown against chinese citizens who apply for asylum elsewhere,and generally reiterates the message and substance of the notice.it does not include any reference to the notice.
the bia opinion 
the bia was unpersuaded by zheng submission.see in re qin wen zheng,no.a,per curiam.much of the evidence now presented,including the wife affidavit and background material,it said,was not previously unavailable or is not new the new country reports have not been highlighted id.the bia continued t he purported notice from the respondent home town has not been authenticated,a fact which is relevant in the context of this case in light of the ij adverse credibility finding.id.the agency denied zheng motion to reopen on the grounds that his evidentiary submissions failed to demonstrate changed country conditions,which could have excepted the motion from the time and numerical bars that otherwise apply.
zheng petitions for review.
discussion 
standard and scope of review 
zheng petition to this court,filed on october,is timely only as it pertains to the bia denial of his second motion to reopen on october.see b requiring a petition for review to be filed no later than thirty days after the date of the order to be challenged.we therefore may review no more than that denial.see kaur bia,cir per curiam noting that we are precluded from reviewing the underlying merits of an asylum claim on a motion to reopen.
it is undisputed that both the time and numerical bars pertaining to motions to reopen apply here.see c a,c c zheng argues,however,that he has demonstrated the existence of materially changed conditions in china affecting the possibility of his persecution there should he be forced to return,which would satisfy one of four possible exceptions to those limitations.see c ii t ime and numerical limitations shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered,if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.
a motion to reopen proceedings must state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c.such a motion may not be granted unless it appears to the bia that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.id.
we review the decision to deny a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.bhanot chertoff,cir per curiam.the bia abuses its discretion if its decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements.alrefae chertoff,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
ii.the notice 
the propriety of the bia decision to deny zheng second motion to reopen depends on its conclusion that zheng had not established a change in country conditions,which in turn was based in part on the bia refusal to credit the notice.the bia noted that the notice lacked authentication,which,in light of the ij adverse credibility finding,prompted the bia to reject the document authenticity.citing no authority,zheng argues that the board committed a legal error in giving no weight to the merit of the evidence,instead focusing on the admissibility of the evidence.pet.br.at.
we conclude that the bia,in relying on the adverse credibility determination made by the ij following zheng asylum hearing,reasonably rejected the authenticity of the notice.in siewe gonzales,cir,we found that the doctrine of falsus in uno,falsus in omnibus supported a general adverse credibility find
