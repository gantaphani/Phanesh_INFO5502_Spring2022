this is an appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut handed down by judge janet bond arterton and entered on august.the order affirmed the district court prior referral to a special master of the city of bridgeport objection to the same special master investigating a claim of racial discrimination made by an employee of the bridgeport police department.
thus,the setting for the present appeal is the city of bridgeport,connecticut,and in particular,its police department.bridgeport is connecticut largest city,with a population of almost people.its advantageous location on long island sound attracted early settlers and by the century the city had grown into a substantial manufacturing center.during the,like many cities in the northeast,bridgeport lost a portion of its manufacturing base,and that left in its wake serious problems of unemployment and crime.one of the hurdles bridgeport has faced in adapting to its changed circumstances is the fact that its police department has engaged in racial discrimination against the black and hispanic officers on its force.
since bridgeport has been bound by a series of federal court orders designed to remedy this discrimination.a remedial order was issued in by the united states district court for the district of connecticut and remains in force today.that order appointed the special master whose authority is the subject of the present appeal.in this appeal,the city challenges,first,the special master authority to investigate the new complaint of racial discrimination because it was brought by one of the police department civilian employees rather than a police officer.and,second,the city questions the special master power to decide the scope of his own authority in the first instance.we write to address the second question,and to explain why our answer to that question deprives us of jurisdiction to reach the merits of the city appeal,to which we now turn.
background 
initial actions 
the instant case had its genesis in when plaintiffs,an organization of black police officers known as the bridgeport guardians,and three individual black police officers,sued the city of bridgeport and its police commissioners in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alleging racial discrimination and free speech violations within the bridgeport police department department.see bridgeport guardians,delmonte.the department had already been the target of a number of discrimination suits resulting in federal court orders going back to.see bridgeport guardians,members of bridgeport civil serv.comm n,enjoining use of patrolman examination found to have adverse impact on black and puerto rican candidates,and imposing hiring and promotion quotas to remedy past discrimination,aff in part and rev in part,cir holding promotion quotas unwarranted but affirming in all other respects,modified order aff,cir bridgeport guardians bridgeport police dep t,rejecting challenge to department detective examination,but noting that the distressing absence of minority group members from the supervisory ranks of the department should be a cause for continuing concern by responsible officials.
while the previous suits had focused on the disparate impact of the department hiring and promotion procedures,the plaintiffs in the suit claimed the department was intentionally discriminating against black and hispanic police officers,and then retaliating against those who complained about the violation of their constitutional rights.see delmonte.at.the district court agreed,holding defendants actions violated titles vi and vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the first amendment of the constitution.delmonte.at.it specifically found a pattern of intentional discrimination in the way the department assigned police officers to its internal divisions,geographic areas,and individual partners,the way the department carried out disciplinary procedures,and the overall environment in which police officers were forced to work.id.it found black police officers were almost entirely excluded from assignments to the department more prestigious divisions,and were effectively segregated within the patrol division by being regularly paired as partners with other minority officers.id.at.black and hispanic officers in the patrol division were then disproportionately assigned to high crime areas.id.at.
in addition,the court found black officers were very likely to be disciplined or fired for conduct that was generally ignored when committed by white police officers.id.at.moreover,black officers were frequently harassed and subjected to racial slurs and disparaging remarks within the department that were not only tolerated,but also were engaged in by supervisory personnel,which included the head of the department.id.at.among many examples of shocking harassment was a displayed that the court assumed was approved by supervisory which a black man,identified by a racial epithet,was portrayed as a target to be shot at.id.at.
remedial order of the district court 
to remedy these violations,the district court issued an order in,regulating various aspects of the department procedures for appointments,assignments,and disciplinary measures,and enjoining the defendants,as well as the defendants officers,agents,and employees,from engaging in discrimination,harassment,or retaliation against department officers.see id.at.among other things,the remedial order appointed a qualified,neutral special master to 
a review any and all disciplinary actions instituted against any black officer who claims such action is racially discriminatory in purpose or effect and to recommend an appropriate adjustment in any such action found to be racially discriminatory as to initiation,severity of sanction or otherwise.
b receive,investigate,and remedy all complaints of discriminatory treatment,racial harassment or slurs within the and,in appropriate cases,to bring disciplinary charges against those responsible those supervisors who foster or permit such racial harassment to occur in violation of departmental rules.
c review any disqualification of any black officer seeking promotion which disqualification is based on grounds of any suspension,disciplinary action,or alleged misconduct upon which such sanction was premised occurring from to the date of this order.
id.at.the order provides that the special master findings and recommendations may be appealed to the district court.id.at.
special master and city 
since his appointment,the special master has issued numerous findings and recommendations in accordance with the order.the district court in turn has recognized the special master broad powers to take all actions and measures necessary or proper to implement the remedial order.bridgeport guardians delmonte.may.it has also held the department in contempt at least three times.see bridgeport guardians delmonte,d.in its april contempt ruling,the district court remarked on the department long history of and of its racial,ethnic and sexual slur and harassment policies,which it thought defied logic.id.at.
the bridgeport police department has now implemented a slur and harassment policy,which states that i n appropriate cases,police department employees may file a complaint with the special master.the policy has been approved by the district court and there are other signs that the parties may be moving closer to resolving their dispute.for now,however,the remedial order remains in effect,and the special master continues to carry out his duties under it.see bridgeport guardians delmonte,denying joint motion for modification of remedy order,reconsideration denied,wl,dist.lexis,appeal filed,cir.
instant complaint 
it is against this background that one of the department civilian female a new complaint of racial discrimination to the special master attention.her complaint triggered the series of decisions that led to the present appeal.when the special master forwarded this new complaint to the parties and requested a response,the city filed an objection with the district court.it insisted the special master mandate is limited to complaints
