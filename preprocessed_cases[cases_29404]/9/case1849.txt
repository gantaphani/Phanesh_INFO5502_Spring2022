gordon goines went to the police station to report the theft of his cable services and ended up involuntarily detained for six days for a evaluation.goines thereafter brought this action under,alleging that he was unlawfully seized without probable cause in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.goines named as defendants the police officers who initially detained him,as well as the worker who evaluated him,and the worker employer.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,see.b,and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.we conclude that the claims against the evaluator and her employer were properly dismissed.as to the two officers who initially took goines into custody,however,we find the allegations of goines complaint sufficient to survive the motion to dismiss.we therefore affirm the district court order in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.

according to the allegations of the complaint,goines suffers from cerebellar ataxia,a neurological condition that causes him difficulties with his speech,balance,and certain fine motor functions.the disorder does not affect goines cognitive functioning,and he has no mental health issues.
in may,goines began experiencing problems with his cable television service the service would intermittently disconnect and the television would freeze and produce loud line noises while it was turned on.a technician with the cable provider visited goines on may and determined that an unknown neighbor had spliced into goines cable,causing the disconnections and line noises.the technician advised goines to report the theft to the police.goines thereafter walked across the street to the police station and reported the cable theft,telling the police that he did not want to confront the neighbor because he did not know how the neighbor would react and he did not want to get into a fight.
the officer to whom goines first spoke turned him over to defendant officers david shaw and robert dean together,the officers.goines agreed to take the officers back to his apartment so he could demonstrate the problem.because the officers did not turn on the television,however,they did not hear the noises.the officers asked goines if he had any mental health issues,which goines denied,and asked whether he wanted to talk to someone.believing that he would be speaking to someone about the cable theft,goines answered in the affirmative.the officers then handcuffed goines,walked him back to the police station,and placed him in the back of a patrol car.goines told the officers he wanted to go home and asked to be let out of the car,but officer dean told goines that was an option.the officers transported goines,involuntarily,to the augusta county medical center,where he was and handcuffed to a table.while at the medical center,the officers learned that goines owned a registered handgun.goines volunteered to give the gun to the officers if there was a problem,and goines reiterated his desire to go home.
goines was evaluated at the medical center by defendant jenna rhodes,an emergency services and intake clinician employed by defendant valley community services board.goines attached as an exhibit to his complaint the preadmission screening report completed by rhodes.in the screening report,rhodes described her personal observations of goines as well as information about goines statements and behavior that the officers had provided her.based on her observations and the officers information,rhodes concluded that goines suffered from a mental illness and that he posed a threat to the safety of his neighbors,and rhodes filed a petition seeking to have goines involuntarily detained.the magistrate judge granted the petition at on may,and issued a temporary detention order.goines thereafter was transported to crossroads mental health center,where he remained until he was released on may.
the facts set out above form the core of goines constitutional claims that the defendants violated the fourth amendment because they lacked probable cause to believe goines had a mental illness and was a threat to himself or others.in addition to these facts,however,goines complaint contains several references to a report the incident report that officer shaw prepared sometime after the interaction with goines.
quoting from the incident report,the complaint states that the first police officer to whom goines spoke told officers shaw and dean that goines seemed to have some mental health issues going on over an issue with a television.the complaint also alleges that the officers ignored or did not take the time to understand the nature of goines problem that someone had spliced into his cable,which was causing line noises and other issues when the television was turned on.as an apparent indication of the officers failure to understand,the complaint then quotes shaw statement in the incident report that goines told the officers that there was a clicking noise in the wall because someone outside was controlling his.the complaint,again quoting from the incident report,states that even though goines denied having any mental health issues,the officers n evertheless concluded that goines was having irrational issues and hearing things.
although goines quoted the incident report in his complaint,he did not attach it as an exhibit or explicitly incorporate the entire report by reference.the defendants,however,attached a copy of the incident report to their motion to dismiss and referred to other parts of the incident report,parts not quoted by goines when arguing that goines failed to state a claim.
while a b motion focuses on the allegations of the complaint,it is well established that a document attached to a motion to dismiss may be considered when evaluating a motion to dismiss if the document was integral to the complaint and authentic.sec y of state for defence trimble nav,cir.the district court therefore treated the incident report as if it had been attached to the complaint and considered the contents of the incident report.recognizing the general rule that the exhibit prevails in the event of a conflict between an attached exhibit and the allegations of a complaint,see walk at broadlands homeowner ass openband at broadlands,llc,cir,the district court believed that because the incident report was prepared by the officers and reflected their version of the relevant events,an exception to the rule was required.accordingly,when considering the sufficiency of goines complaint,the district court treated the contents of the incident report as true,except where the complaint expressly conflicts with,or contradicts any factual allegations in the incident report.emphasis added.
as to the constitutional claims against the officers,the district court determined that the facts reflected in the complaint and incident report established that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.in the district court view,it was objectively reasonable for the officers to conclude that there was probable cause to believe goines was suffering from a mental illness,and it was likewise objectively reasonable to believe that there was probable cause to believe goines posed a threat to others.central to the court analysis were certain facts appearing in the incident report but not in the complaint that goines told the officers while they were in his apartment that he was then hearing noises that the officers could not hear and repeatedly said that someone outside was controlling his television,which made it objectively reasonable for the officers to conclude that goines had a mental illness and that goines,in response to a series of questions from the officers,stated that he would hurt his neighbors by punching them,which made it objectively reasonable for the officers to conclude that goines was a threat to others.the court therefore dismissed the claims against the officers.
the court likewise dismissed the constitutional claims against rhodes and her employer.as previously noted,goines attached the screening report prepared by rhodes to his complaint.the district court took the same approach with the screening report as it did with the incident report unless the complaint explicitly contradicted the screening report,the court accepted the contents of the screening report as true.the district court concluded that,in light of the information set out in the screening report,rhodes had probable cause to believe that goines had a mental illness and was a danger to others.accordingly,the court dismissed the claims against rhodes and her employer.
this appeal followed.
we begin with goines claims against the officers.goines argues that the district court erred in treating the allegations of the incident report as true and that the allegations in his complaint establish that the officers lacked probable cause to believe that he was mentally ill or that he posed a danger to himself or others.as noted above,the district court relied on the incident report to dismiss the claim against the officers.the question,then,is whether the court reliance on that document was proper.
a motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of a complaint,occupy columbia haley,cir,and our evaluation is thus generally limited to a review of the allegations of the complaint itself.however,we also consider documents that are explicitly incorporated into the complaint by reference,tellabs,makor issues rights,d,and those attached to the complaint as exhibits,see.c.and,as mentioned above,we may consider a document submitted by the movant that was not attached to or expressly incorporated in a complaint,so long as the document was integral to the complaint and there is no dispute about the document authenticity.see trimble,at am.chiropractic ass trigon healthcare,cir phillips lci int l,cir.
whether the court properly considered the incident report,which was quoted in but not attached to the complaint,is not entirely clear.although the complaint included a few quotes from and references to the incident report,goines claims do not turn on,nor are they otherwise based on,statements contained in the incident report.see sira morton,cir limited quotation from or reference to documents that may constitute relevant evidence in a case is not enough to incorporate those documents,wholesale,into the complaint.under these circumstances,the incident report arguably is not integral to the complaint and therefore should not have been considered by the district court.see chambers time warner,cir explaining that a document is integral to the complaint where the complaint relies heavily upon its terms and effect internal quotation marks omitted smith hogan,cir document with no independent legal significance to plaintiff claim was not integral to complaint.
nonetheless,because goines does not argue otherwise,we will assume without deciding that the incident report was integral to the complaint.and because there is no question about the authenticity of the incident report,we will therefore assume that the district court properly treated the incident report as if it had been attached to the complaint.the more difficult question is whether the district court properly treated the factual contents of the incident report as true.
as previously noted,the district court approach to this question began with its recognition of the rule,which provides that in the event of conflict between the bare allegations of the complaint and any exhibit attached,the exhibit prevails.fayetteville inv rs commercial builders,cir accord walk,at.under the rule,if a plaintiff attaches documents and relies upon the documents to form the basis for a claim or part of a claim,dismissal is appropriate if the document negates the claim.thompson illinois dep t of prof l regulation,cir.accordingly,if a plaintiff alleges a failure to perform an act required by the contract,the contract description of the defendant duties will prevail over the plaintiff contrary characterization.see shore markets,assocs,cir district court properly dismissed claim where terms of attached lease established that landlord had the contractual right to take action challenged by the plaintiff walk,at looking to terms of attached contract to conclude that plaintiff seeking to invalidate portions of the contract lacked standing.similarly,if a plaintiff alleges that the defendant prospectus failed to disclose a material risk,the claim will be dismissed if the prospectus shows the disclosure was in fact made.see cozzarelli inspire pharm,cir where complaint quoted from investment analysts reports to support claim that defendant intentionally misled the public,district court properly reviewed reports in their entirety when dismissing the complaint.
animating the rule is the presumption that the plaintiff,by basing his claim on the attached document,has adopted as true the contents of that document.plaintiffs attach exhibits to their complaints for all sorts of reasons,however,see eeoc concentra health,cir,and it is not always appropriate to conclude that the plaintiff has adopted the contents of an attached document,see.gun outdoor shows,city of bend,cir explaining that rule c does not require a plaintiff to adopt every word within the exhibits as true for purposes of pleading simply because the documents were attached to the complaint to support an alleged fact.indeed,if attached documents were always treated as if their contents were adopted by the plaintiff,a libel plaintiff would plead himself out of court simply by attaching the libelous writing to his complaint.see gant wallingford bd.of,cir a libel plaintiff may attach the writing alleged in the complaint to be libelous without risk that the court will deem true all libels in it.accordingly,before treating the contents of an attached or incorporated document as true,the district court should consider the nature of the document and why the plaintiff attached it.gun outdoor,at before treating contents of attached document as true,courts should consider why a plaintiff attached the document,who authored the document,and the reliability of the document.
when the plaintiff attaches or incorporates a document upon which his claim is based,or when the complaint otherwise shows that the plaintiff has adopted the contents of the document,crediting the document over conflicting allegations in the complaint is proper.see,am.chiropractic,at dismissing civil rico claim despite complaint allegation of justifiable reliance where terms of document upon which claim was based established that any reliance would not have been justified.but in cases where the plaintiff attaches or incorporates a document for purposes other than the truthfulness of the document,it is inappropriate to treat the contents of that document as true.for example,if a prisoner attaches an unfavorable decision from a prison tribunal to show that he has exhausted his administrative remedies,he does not thereby adopt the factual findings of that unfavorable decision.see carroll yates,cir rejecting as fantastic the argument that all facts contained in any attachments to a complaint are automatically deemed facts alleged as part of the complaint internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.similarly,if a plaintiff attaches or references a report prepared by a to show how he learned of certain facts alleged in his complaint,he does not automatically adopt all of the factual conclusions contained in the report.see banneker ventures,llc graham,banneker referred to some of the report recitations to show how it learned some facts in the complaint,but it did not purport to and was not required to adopt the factual contents of the report wholesale.
the purpose for which the document is offered is particularly important where the document is one prepared by or for the defendant.such unilateral documents may reflect the defendant version of contested events or contain,exculpatory statements that are unlikely to have been adopted by the plaintiff.treating the contents of such a document as true simply because it was attached to or relied upon in the complaint,even though the plaintiff relied on it for purposes other than truthfulness,would be contrary to the concept of notice pleading and would enable parties to hide behind untested,assertions.gun outdoor,at.
in this case,we think it clear that goines did not adopt the incident report as true simply by relying on the report for some of the facts alleged in his complaint.as previously noted,goines does not base his claims on the incident report that is,no portion of any of his claims is dependent upon the truth of any statements contained in the incident report.instead,goines complaint tells the story of police who assumed from goines physical difficulties that he was mentally ill and never actually listened to what goines was telling them,and goines referred to portions of the incident report to support that theory of the case.thus,goines alleged that he is not mentally ill,but then quoted from the incident report that the first police officer to whom goines spoke told the officers that goines seemed to have some mental health issues.goines alleged that the line noises and other problems with his television service occurred when the television was turned on and that the officers did not hear the line noises because they never turned on the television.see complaint.goines juxtaposed these clear allegations against the statement in the incident report that goines told the officers that there was a clicking noise in the wall because someone outside was controlling his,which goines contended showed that the officers ignored or did not take the time to understand goines complaint,id.likewise,goines alleged that he told the officers that he did not have any mental health issues,but that the officers n evertheless determined that goines was having irrational issues and hearing things.thus,when the complaint is read in the light most favorable to goines and in light of his theory of the case,it is apparent that goines purpose in quoting from the incident report was not to assert the truthfulness of the statements contained in the report,but instead to illustrate the mistakes he believed were made by the officers.
because goines did not rely on the incident report for its truthfulness,the district court erred by treating as true the factual statements contained in the incident report.the district court instead should have treated the report as what it was a document prepared by officer shaw representing the officers view of events,not a document representing the true facts.see jones city of cincinnati,cir in case where plaintiff attached to his complaint transcripts of investigatory interviews with defendant police officers,declining to assume everything the officers said in those interviews is true.the court likewise should have treated goines allegations regarding the incident report as what they were allegations that the officers made the quoted statements,not allegations that the statements themselves were true.see id.w e treat the exhibit as an allegation that the officers made the statements in the transcript and we treat that allegation as true we do not accept as true,however,that the officers statements are accurate or true.gun outdoor,at the letters that the plaintiff attached to its complaint demonstrate that the defendant stated it adopted the policy for safety reasons during a public meeting that had been publicized and during which individuals opposed to the policy had the opportunity to voice their concerns.attaching the letters to the complaint does not,however,establish the truth of these unilateral statements.emphasis added.
when the statements in the incident report are treated not as true,but as assertions made by the officers,we have little difficulty in concluding that goines claims against the officers should not have been dismissed.
to withstand a motion to dismiss,a plaintiff must allege facts that,if true,show a violation of clearly established constitutional rights.cloaninger ex rel.estate of cloaninger mcdevitt,cir.t he general right to be free from seizure unless probable cause exists is clearly established in the mental health seizure context.bailey,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.p robable cause to seize a person for a psychological evaluation exists when the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man to believe that the person poses a danger to himself or others.cloaninger,at internal quotation marks omitted.
goines alleged that he has no mental illness,and the facts he described in the complaint noises in the television line and signal disruption caused by a neighbor splicing into goines cable line and a desire not to fight with the thieving neighbor provided no basis for the officers to have reasonably concluded otherwise.while the incident report indicates that goines told the officers that he was hearing noises in the apartment that they could not hear,that assertion can not be treated as true,and there are no facts alleged in the complaint that would permit the inference that goines heard noises in the apartment.indeed,given goines allegations that the noise occurred when the television was turned on and that the officers never turned on the television,the only permissible inference that can be drawn from the complaint is that goines did not hear noises because the television was never turned on.see,united states ex rel.oberg.higher educ.assistance agency,cir explaining that when reviewing a b motion to dismiss,we construe facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor citation,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.
the facts as alleged in the complaint likewise provided no reasonable basis for the officers to have concluded that goines was a danger to himself or others.goines alleged that he went to the police because he did not know how the neighbor would react to a confrontation with goines and he did not want to get in a fight with the neighbor,and that he never made any threat to do harm to any person or to himself.these allegations are contradicted by assertions contained in the incident report,but,again,those assertions can not be treated as true.by quoting from and referring to the incident report,goines effectively alleged that the officers viewed the facts differently,but he did not adopt the officers version of the facts as his own.goines preemptive acknowledgement of the defense may be unusual as a matter of pleading style,but it does not make goines allegations of the relevant facts implausible or otherwise support a rule b dismissal in the face of disputed facts.see gale hyde park bank,cir t he plaintiff may tell the court what his adversary has said without throwing in the towel.
accepting the allegations of the complaint as true,goines,though having speech and other physical difficulties,exhibited no signs of mental illness and made no threats to harm himself or others,but instead sought the help of the police to avoid a confrontation and potential fight with a neighbor who had spliced into goines cable line.under these facts,the officers lacked probable cause for an emergency detention,and goines complaint therefore alleges a constitutional violation.see bailey,at if probable cause was lacking,then the plaintiff has successfully asserted the violation of a constitutional right specifically his fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizure.
and again accepting goines allegations as true,the constitutional violation alleged is one for which the officers would not be entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity shie
