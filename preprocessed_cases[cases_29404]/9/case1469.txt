the provision of the individuals with disabilities education act idea states that a disabled child shall remain in his or her current educational setting during the pendency of proceedings to resolve a dispute over the child placement.see j.this case requires us to decide two issues of first impression in this circuit concerning the obligation of school districts to pay for private school education during that interim period whether parents are eligible for reimbursement for private school costs if they do not file a claim seeking payment until after a court has ruled in favor of the school district,and whether the right to interim funding,if applicable,extends through the time of a judicial appeal.
the district court answered both questions in the affirmative.it thus held that defendant ridley school district ridley must reimburse the plaintiff parents for the cost of roughly three years of their daughter private school tuition notwithstanding judicial findings disagreeing with the hearing officer rendered before the parents sought payment that ridley had complied with the idea by offering the child a free,appropriate education in its own schools.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court judgment.
this court has previously described in detail the dispute between ridley and the plaintiffs and over the educational placement of plaintiffs daughter,see ridley sch.dist.m,cir ridley i.we briefly review here the factual and procedural background pertinent to the legal issues now before us.
attended kindergarten and first grade at grace park elementary school in the ridley school district during the and school years,receiving special services to address her learning disabilities and problems.during the summer after first grade,plaintiffs concluded that the public school was not meeting their daughter needs,and they enrolled her at a private school,benchmark,that specializes in educating students with learning disabilities.plaintiffs subsequently filed a complaint with the pennsylvania department of education claiming,inter alia,that ridley had violated the idea and the rehabilitation act by failing to provide with a suitable individualized education program iep,thereby denying her the free appropriate public education fape required by those laws see a a among other remedies,plaintiffs sought reimbursement for the cost of sending to benchmark for second grade 
on april,an administrative hearing officer found that ridley had committed no violations during kindergarten year,but that was denied a fape for part of first grade and all of second grade.the hearing officer awarded compensatory education for the school year when attended first grade at the public school and ordered ridley to reimburse the plaintiffs for the tuition and transportation costs associated with enrollment at benchmark in nearly two years later,in february,a federal district court reversed the hearing officer placement assessment,finding that ridley proposed iep was adequate and,hence,that the school district had offered a fape in the local public school.this court affirmed the district court ruling on may.see ridley i,at.
meanwhile,in march,after filing their appeal from the district court judgment,plaintiffs sent a letter to the school district requesting payment for benchmark costs from the date of the hearing officer decision forward at that point,from april through spring pursuant to the idea provision.see infra section ii describing j and related authority.when the school district declined to pay,plaintiffs responded with this action claiming that the idea required ridley to finance private placement until all appeals had concluded in the previous litigation over the adequacy of her iep.
ridley denied responsibility for the benchmark expenses on both procedural and substantive grounds.the school district asserted that the demand for interim tuition was barred at the threshold because it was untimely.this argument relied on three theories res judicata,the compulsory counterclaim requirement of federal rule of civil procedure,and the statute of limitations.ridley also contended that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief because,by the time of their second idea lawsuit,the district court had already held that ridley had properly designated the local public school as appropriate placement.the school district argued,in effect,that its validated placement determination had become the baseline for determining the parents entitlement to a remedy and,accordingly,the idea did not provide for recovery of the private school costs.
on for judgment on the pleadings,the district court ruled in favor of plaintiffs.the court rejected each of ridley timeliness contentions and concluded that the idea provision entitled the parents to reimbursement for the costs they incurred to send to benchmark for the entire period they had requested.the costs at issue,as stipulated by the parties covered the approximately three years from the hearing officer decision in april through proceedings in the court of appeals which had by then concluded with this court decision affirming the district court judgment.
this appeal followed.ridley again challenges both the timeliness of plaintiffs reimbursement claim and the legal basis for the award.our review of the district court judgment on the pleadings is de novo.see sheridan ngk metals,cir.
the premise of the idea is that parents and schools working together to design an iep is the ideal way to reach the statute goal of a fape for every child.see ridley i,at see also schaffer weast.congress anticipated,however,that the collaborative process may at times break down.ridley i,at.hence,the act allows either party to respond to a stalemate in the discussions by requesting an impartial due process hearing before a state or local administrative officer.see f sch.comm.of town of burlington dep t of,burlington ridley i,at.a variety of disputes may arise concerning placement.for example,the parents may argue for removing the child from public school because they believe the services are inadequate.or the school district might argue for the same result,over the parents objection,because it considers the child too disruptive to be in a regular school setting.alternatively,either party could be advocating for placement with the school district insisting that an expensive specialized private school is unnecessary or the parents insisting that participation in a regular classroom is essential for their child development.see generally honig doe,discussing school system limited authority to exclude disabled students burlington,at stating that one purpose of the provision was to prevent school officials from removing a child from the regular classroom over the parents objection pending completion of the review proceedings id.at discussing whether parents are entitled to reimbursement for private school tuition drinker colonial sch,cir addressing parents objection to school district plan to move child from a placement outside the district to a local public school.
the parties have the right to seek state or federal court review of the administrative decision,i a,and under the provision at issue in this case the child has the right to remain in his or her educational placement during the pendency of the dispute resolution proceedings,id.j.section j states,in pertinent part 
d uring the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child 
this provision,known as the idea rule,serves in essence,as an automatic preliminary injunction,drinker,f d at,reflecting congress conclusion that a child with a disability is best served by maintaining her educational status quo until the disagreement over her iep is resolved,pardini allegheny interm.unit,cir drinker,at.once a court ascertains the student current educational placement,the movants are entitled to an order maintaining that placement without satisfaction of the usual prerequisites to injunctive relief.drinker,at quoting woods dep t of,indiv.disabilities educ.lrp publications,cir,see also pardini,at congress has already balanced the competing harms as well as the competing equities zvid.ambach,cir the statute substitutes an absolute rule in favor of the status quo for the court discretionary consideration of the factors.
the rule thus requires that the child placement under the idea at the time a disagreement arises between the parents and the school district what the statute terms the educational placement be protected while the dispute is pending.to determine that placement,this court has looked to the iep actually functioning when the stay put is invoked.drinker,at citing thomas cincinnati bd.of,cir see also susquenita sch.dist.raelee,cir raelee.the operative placement could be either a public school or a private school that the local district was financing to satisfy the requirement that every child be given a free,appropriate education.see,florence cnty.sch.dist.four carter,congress intended that idea promise of a free appropriate public education for disabled children would normally be met by an iep provision for education in the regular public schools or in private schools chosen jointly by school officials and parents.raelee,at noting that providing a fape may involve placement in private schools at public expense quoting burlington,at 
the provision protective purpose means that it is often invoked by a child parents in order to maintain a placement where the parents disagree with a change proposed by the school district.see raelee,at.during the pendency of the dispute process,the child is entitled to remain in her educational setting see j.where the parents seek a change in placement,however,and unilaterally move their child from an program to their desired alternative setting,the rule does not immediately come into play.raelee,at.in such circumstances,the parents will be responsible for the costs of the child new placement at least initially.
the new placement can become the educational setting protected by the rule if the parents and the state or local educational agency agree to the change.see j.also,importantly,a decision favorable to the parents during the administrative review process must be treated as an agreement between the state and the parents,d see also burlington,at noting that an administrative decision in favor of the parents and private school placement would seem to constitute agreement by the state to the change of placement raelee,at citing burlington accordingly,an administrative ruling validating the parents decision to move their child from an public school to a private school will,in essence,make the child enrollment at the private school her educational placement for purposes of the rule.having been endorsed by the state,the move to private school is no longer the parents unilateral action,and the child is entitled to stay put at the private school for the duration of the dispute resolution proceedings.see raelee,at.
although j does not specify which party pays when a child pendent placement becomes a private school based on an administrative decision,the school district obligation to do so is well established by case law.see raelee,at.hence,the school district is obliged to fund a private placement if it was either the educational setting prescribed by the current iep or is subsequently designated by a hearing officer or administrative appeal official as the appropriate setting to meet a child needs.in this case,the provision became effective in april,when the hearing officer determined that ridley had denied a fape and concluded that benchmark was her appropriate educational setting.could thus stay put at benchmark at the school district expense while the court proceedings were pending.because was entitled to reimbursement for her costs at benchmark beginning in april,the parents could have requested that ridley reimburse any tuition they already had paid for the remaining portion of the school year and also could have asked the school district to reimburse the benchmark costs in the following years or pay those amounts as they became due.
at issue in this case is whether the school district financial responsibility dissolves if the parents do not request reimbursement for their private school costs until after an administrative decision in their favor has been reversed by a court upon further review.ridley emphasizes that the remedial subsection of the idea provision that authorizes a ny party aggrieved by the administrative ruling to file a civil action allows a court to grant only such relief as the court determines is appropriate.i a,i c iii the school district maintains that it was inappropriate in this case to award reimbursement for private schooling that the district court had found unnecessary by the time the request for payment was made.ridley argues that the court ruling returned placement to grace park elementary school with respect to the school district funding obligation,eliminating the justification for any interim reimbursement.ridley further asserts that,even if we conclude that interim reimbursement is required under the idea,any obligation for interim funding does not include the period of the appeal to the third circuit.
before confronting those merits arguments,we address ridley procedural claims.
ridley asserts that parents should have demanded tuition reimbursement for their daughter pendent placement as part of the relief they requested through counterclaims in the earlier action,which was filed by the school district to challenge the hearing officer ruling.ridley offers a trio of rationales to support its contention that plaintiffs request for reimbursement should be denied as untimely.we find none of them persuasive.
res judicata 
ridley argues that plaintiffs,having failed to assert their claim for reimbursement in the earlier idea lawsuit between the same parties,may not do so in this subsequent action under the principles of res judicata,or claim preclusion.to rely on the affirmative defense of res judicata,a party must establish three elements a final judgment on the merits in a prior proceeding that involved the same parties or their privies and the same cause of action.see,duhaney att y,cir sheridan,at explaining that the central purpose of the res judicata doctrine is to require a plaintiff to present all claims arising out of the same occurrence in a single suit third alteration in original internal quotation mark omitted.the first two elements are not disputed.in examining the similarity of the claims the third element,we focus on whether the acts complained of are the same,whether the material facts alleged in each suit are the same and whether the witnesses and documentation required to prove such allegations are the same.united states athlone,cir.
we agree with the district court that the reimbursement claim in this case differs materially from the issues addressed in ridley i.although both cases concern the rights of and her parents under the idea,the similarity ends there.ridley i focused on the substance of an appropriate education for,while the current case is a payment dispute over expenses.the former was,requiring the courts to review testimony and documentary evidence about needs and the school district plans for meeting them,while the latter is centered on the legal question of financial responsibility and the undisputed fact that a hearing officer ruled in plaintiffs favor that the cases are related does not erase these significant differences between the causes of action at issue.indeed,this court previously has recognized,albeit in the different context of review,that resolution of and rights is completely separate from the merits issues which focus on the adequacy of the proposed iep.raelee s,at allowing appeal of ruling as a collateral order subject to review under co hen beneficial indus.loan,see also haw.dep t of,cir holding that a order resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the child ultimate placement.
we therefore conclude that the res judicata doctrine does not bar this action.
b.the compulsory counterclaim rule 
federal rule of civil procedure a requires a party to assert as a counterclaim any cause of action that is available against the opposing party that arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim.the failure to plead a compulsory counterclaim bars a later independent action on that claim.baker gold seal liquors,new york life ins.deshotel,cir charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.
the inquiry to determine if a claim is compulsory under rule a is whether the counterclaim bears a logical relationship to an opposing party claim.transamerica occidental life ins.aviation office of,cir quoting xerox scm,cir.this court has stated that a logical relationship exists where separate trials on each of the respective claims would involve a substantial duplication of effort and time by the parties and the courts.great lakes rubber herbert cooper,cir see also transamerica,at.the compulsory counterclaim inquiry thus requires essentially the same comparison between claims as the res judiciata analysis.see transamerica,at noting the close connection between rule a and the doctrine of claim preclusion.
as discussed above,despite a relationship between the two lawsuits,there is no meaningful overlap between the facts and law underlying the different claims at issue.ross bd.of educ,cir holding that current claims under americans with disabilities act,rehabilitation act,and were compulsory counterclaims in a prior suit where both lawsuits deal with the school district placement decisions,the services it offered the plaintiff,and its response to her disability.plaintiffs were therefore not compelled to advance their reimbursement demand by means of a counterclaim.
moreover,as the district court observed,rule a effectively operates as a waiver,ridley sch,wl,at,ridley ii,and this court previously has expressed doubt that parents can lose their stay put protection except by affirmative agreement to give it up,drinker,at.parents did not explicitly agree to forgo their child rights.hence,as in drinker,even assuming that in a proper case the stay put provision can be waived,we find nothing in the record here that leads us to believe this is such a case.id.
accordingly,rule a does not foreclose this independent action seeking reimbursement for interim placement expenses.we emphasize,however,that our conclusion that neither res judicata nor federal rule of civil procedure a bars the instant action does not mean that claims for reimbursement should not be brought in the same civil action with substantive idea claims,such as those addressing the child placement or the provision of a fape.we hold only that,in the context of this case,plaintiffs were permitted to bring them separately.
statute of limitations 
ridley argues that plaintiffs claim is barred by the idea provision requiring a ny party aggrieved by a hearing officer decision to file suit within ninety days of that decision.see i a,b.as the district court concluded,that statutory limitations period does not by its terms apply to plaintiffs reimbursement claim.although the parents did seek reversal of the hearing officer decision on certain issues they had prevailed on the issue of placement at benchmark for second grade.that favorable decision included an award of tuition and transportation costs for and,under the provision,made benchmark pendent placement going forward with the right to interim tuition reimbursement hence,the parents were not aggrieved by the hearing officer decision on the issue raised in this case.ridley points to no other applicable limitations period,and we therefore reject its defense to plaintiffs claim.
ridley challenge on the merits also focuses on issues of timing.its primary argument is that parents are not entitled to any reimbursement under j because they filed their claim for payment too late,after the administrative ruling in their favor was reversed by the district court.the school district further argues that,even if the parents may recover some of the private school costs,the covered period ended with the district court entry of judgment rather than at the time of the appeals court decision.both contentions require us to consider aspects of the right that this court has not previously addressed.
ridley assertion that plaintiffs right to reimbursement expired when the district court overturned the hearing officer decision necessarily depends on two assumptions about how the scheme works.first,the school district maintains that the reimbursement right does not ripen until a claim seeking payment is presented to the court.second,ridley contends that once the district court ruled that ridley had offered a fape in its public schools,benchmark was no longer pendent placement.in ridley view,the parents failed to seek payment while the private school was designated as pendent placement and,hence,their potential right to reimbursement never ripened into an entitlement.
we consider below ridley two assumptions that the right to reimbursement ripens only when parents file a claim with the court seeking payment,and that relevant educational placement had returned to the public school by the time her parents filed their claim.we then address ridley argument that the financing obligation lasts only until judgment at the district court.
a.when does the right to reimbursement accrue 
ridley argues that the idea does not automatically provide for reimbursement for the cost of private schooling during the period and that parents must make an affirmative request to the court for that remedy.as support,the school district cites the idea remedial provision,i c iii,which states that a court shall grant such relief as it determines is appropriate.ridley infers from that statutory language that parents have no entitlement to reimbursement until a court rules that it is appropriate.
we reject this interpretation as inconsistent with the idea guarantee and this court prior case law.the provision titled maintenance of current educational placement directs that the child shall remain in the educational placement throughout the pendency of any proceedings conducted to resolve a dispute over the provision of a fape.j emphasis added.ridley does not dispute that the hearing officer decision in this case had the effect of switching pendent placement from the public school recommended by her iep to the private benchmark school.as noted above,see supra section ii,we have expressly held that financing goes with pendent placement 
it is undisputed that once there is a state agreement with respect to pendent placement,a fortiori,financial responsibility on the part of the local school district follows.thus,from the point of the state administrative decision forward the student pendent placement,by agreement of the state,is the private school and the school district is obligated to pay for that placement.
raelee,at see also bd.of educ.schutz,cir holding that once the parents challenge to a proposed iep succeeds,consent to the private placement is implied by law,and the requirements of j become the responsibility of the school district.
we have thus recognized that the provision itself impliedly,and necessarily,deems reimbursement for the costs of pendent placement in a private school an appropriate remedy.see raelee,at without interim financial support,a parent choice to have his child remain in what the state has determined to be an appropriate private school placement amounts to no choice at all.there is no separate requirement of a court finding of appropriateness rather,the obligation arises automatically from a determination that the private school is the protected status quo during the period in which the dispute resolution process is ongoing.indeed,ridley admitted as much before the district court in this case when it acknowledged that the court would have been obliged to order reimbursement if the parents had sought the funds through a timely counterclaim.ridley ii,wl,at.we think it pointless to insist on a formal demand for interim tuition reimbursement when there is no viable response to that demand.
hence,plaintiffs secured the right to reimbursement when the hearing officer ruled in their favor in april.we must now consider whether that right survived the subsequent district court ruling in favor of the school district.
b.the current educational placement 
ridley contends that any reimbursement entitlement the parents may have had under j dissolved in february,when the district court reversed the hearing officer decision.the school district argues that the court ruling rendered the hearing officer decision inoperative and reinstated the public school as placement,making the parents ineligible for reimbursement at the time they requested payment from the school district in march.at that point,according to ridley theory,the parents unilateral decision to send to benchmark no longer had the state imprimatur that made reimbursement appropriate.ridley position thus depends on whether the district court ruling in fact recalibrated the assessment.
this court observed in drinker that the dispositive factor in deciding a child current educational placement should be the individualized education program actually functioning when the stay put is invoked.at quoting woods,indiv.disabilities educ.at.according to ridley,plaintiffs did not invoke the until after the district court determined that the school district iep was appropriate and,hence,the original iep,placing the student in the school district,is the one now actually functioning.
ridley argument lacks support in the law.the operative placement is not determined by the date the parents seek reimbursement for expenses,but by the date the dispute between the parents and the school district first arises and proceedings conducted pursuant to the idea begin.id.quoting thomas,at.at the latest,the pertinent proceedings in this case began with the parents filing of their due process complaint in december,at which point current placement was the public school.see,at a placement is effective from the date a student requests an administrative due process hearing.collingswood borough bd.of,cir by filing the due process petition,triggered the idea requirement.as described above,however,operative placement switched by law to the private benchmark school when the administrative hearing officer agreed with the parents that ridley had not offered the child a fape in the public school.
nothing in the statute or this circuit law provides a basis for changing placement back to the public school during the pendency of the dispute process,notwithstanding the school district successful appeal of the administrative decision.to the contrary,j states that the child shall remain in the current educational placement until all idea proceedings have been completed emphasis added.we can not conclude that congress intended a placement based on an agreement with the state or local educational agency to be less secure than one based on an iep.id.indeed,any other conclusion would be at odds with our expressly stated understanding that the provision is designed to ensure educational stability for children with disabilities until the dispute over their placement is resolved,regardless of whether their case is meritorious or not.drinker,at quoting woods,indiv.disabilities educ.at emphasis added see also,at stating that a student who requests an administrative due process hearing is entitled to remain in his educational placement regardless of the strength of his case or the likelihood he will be harmed by a change in placement joshua rocklin unified sch,cir t he stay put provision acts as a powerful protective measure to prevent disruption of the child education throughout the dispute process.mackey bd.of,cir quoting the drinker language above.
thus,under the statute and this court precedent,pendent placement under j remained the benchmark school through at least the conclusion of the proceedings in the district court,and the school district correlative obligation to pay for her schooling there also remained intact.the only remaining question is whether ridley financial responsibility extended through final judgment in the appeals court.
c.the duration of the school district reimbursement obligation 
ridley asserts that its responsibility to finance pendent placement at benchmark terminated,at the latest,when the district court ruled in favor of the school district on plaintiffs idea claim.this court previously has held that j requires a school district to pay for a private school that is a pendent placement through the date of a district court final order in an idea case.see drinker,at.the court has not,however,addressed whether the provision also applies through the pendency of an idea dispute in the court of appeals.the only two circuits to have decided the issue in published opinions are split.compare joshua,at holding that obligation extends through appeals decision,with andersen dist.of columbia,holding that congress did not intend financing to cover federal appellate review.see also kari franklin special sch,cir table,wl,at,following andersen kitsap sch.dist,holding that period extends throughout the entire process,including any appeals.
having now considered the question,we agree with the ninth circuit and the district court in this case that the statutory language and the protective purposes of the provision lead to the conclusion that congress intended placement to remain in effect through the final resolution of the dispute.ridley ii,wl,at.the statute text is broadly written to encompass the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section.j emphasis added.narrowing the provision scope to exclude the appellate process strikes us as an unnatural reading of such expansive language.the proceedings specifically covered by include civil actions in a district court of the united states.id.i a.the district court reasonably construed that reference to include all phases of the federal proceedings that begin with a district court filing although congress did not explicitly articulate that an appeal is a proceeding under,it seems intuitive that an appeal is part of a civil action in a district court of the united states.in drafting j,congress surely understood that district court review would necessarily include an appeal to a circuit court.ridley ii,wl,at see also joshua,at by giving joshua the right to appeal the alj decision to the district court,also made it possible for joshua to appeal the dispute to this circuit court.
even if we had doubts about the clarity of the language itself,we would nonetheless adopt the same construction because that reading best accords with the overall purposes of the statute.nugent ashcroft,cir quoting moskal united states,overruled on other grounds by al sharif citizenship immigration,cir en banc see also long tommy hilfiger,cir noting that,in addition to language and context,we consider the overall object and policy of the statute,and avoid constructions that produce odd or absurd results or that are inconsistent with common sense quoting disabled in action of se.transp,cir.we have stated consistently that the provision is designed to preserve the status quo until the dispute with regard to the child placement is ultimately resolved.drinker,at quoting woods,indiv.disabilities educ.at see also,pardini,at orange twp.bd.of,cir.we can not sensibly find that a fape dispute is ultimately resolved before proceedings have run their course through a final,unappealed decision by an administrative body or an appellate judicial decision.see joshua,at it is unlikely that congress intended the protective measure to end suddenly and arbitrarily before the dispute is fully resolved.
moreover,the rationale that underlies a school district obligation to finance a child pendent placement remains compelling through the appellate process.if we concluded that protection terminates while an appeal is pending,the parents of a child with disabilities would be faced with the untenable choice of removing their child from a setting the appeals court might find appropriate or risking the burden of private school costs they can not afford for the period of the appeal.see,joshua,at raelee,at.in addition,
