the sons of confederate veterans,virginia division the scv,initiated this action against the city of lexington,virginia,plus several of its officials,alleging that lexington city code section c the ordinance contravenes the scv first amendment rights and breaches a consent decree resolving an earlier lawsuit between the scv and lexington.enacted in,the ordinance bans any private access to cityowned flag standards.the district court ruled that the ordinance is constitutional and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.see sons of confederate veterans.div.city of lexington,cv.june,the opinion the scv has appealed,and,as explained below,we agree with the district court and affirm.
in early,the scv began planning a parade in honor of the upcoming lee jackson day,a holiday held in in the commonwealth of virginia to celebrate the births of robert lee and thomas stonewall jackson two months beforehand,the scv requested permission from the lexington city council to use flag standards affixed to certain light poles along the street to display the confederate flag during the parade.the city council had theretofore permitted the flag standards to be used by private organizations,including washington and lee university,the virginia military institute,and several college fraternities.
at its december,meeting,the city council granted the scv request by a vote.soon thereafter,at a subsequent meeting,the dissenting councilman moved the adoption of a policy,suggesting that the city attorney and city manager be charged with the policy development.the motion passed unanimously,and at a march meeting after the scv had displayed its confederate flag at the january parade the council received public comments,most opposing the display of the confederate flag within the city.
six months later,in september,lexington adopted the ordinance,restricting any future use of the flag standards to three flags only.the ordinance,codified in the signs article of the zoning chapter of the lexington city code,provides 
only the following flags may be flown on the flag standards affixed to light poles in the city and no others 
a the national flag of the united states of america the american flag.
b the flag of the commonwealth of virginia,code of virginia,title,chapter.
c the city flag of lexington.
the american flag,the flag of the commonwealth of virginia and the city flag of lexington may be flown by the city on the light poles that have flag standards affixed to them on dates adopted by city council currently the holidays or designated days are as follows independence day,labor day,veterans day,flag day,martin luther king day,memorial day,lee jackson day,presidents day,and on the day of the annual rockbridge community festival.on such dates or days the flag s may be flown for more than one day.no other flags shall be permitted.nothing set forth herein is intended in any way to prohibit or curtail individuals from carrying flags in public displaying them on private property.
lexington city code c.
similar to this action,the scv had sued the city in,alleging constitutional violations involving the display of the confederate flag.see sons of confederate veterans.div.city of lexington,cv.that lawsuit arose out of the rededication of a stonewall jackson statue in lexington.members of the scv sought to display the confederate flag as they marched in a parade celebrating the occasion,but,as alleged,the city prohibited the display.that suit was settled by a consent decree,under which the city and its agents were permanently enjoined from denying or abridging the rights of the scv and its members 
to wear,carry,display or show,at any governmentsponsored or place or event which is to any extent given over to private expressive activity,the confederate flag or other banners,emblems,icons or visual depictions to bring into public notice any logo of stars and bars that ever was used as a national or battle flag of the confederacy.
consent decree 
on january,the scv filed its complaint against lexington,six of its city council members,the mayor,and the city manager collectively,the city.the first claim,entitled civil contempt,alleges that the ordinance impermissibly conflicts with the consent decree.the second claim,designated simply as,asserts that enactment of the ordinance was the city response to the scv request to engage in protected expression within the flag standard forum and,thus,constitutes viewpoint and content discrimination that is violative of the free speech clause.the complaint seeks declaratory relief,an adjudication of civil contempt,fees,costs and sanctions,plus damages.
on march,the city moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the motion made several points,including that the flag standards are not a public forum and the ordinance survives constitutional scrutiny because it is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.the city also maintained that the ordinance is consistent with the consent decree,which only enforced the scv existing first amendment rights,without creating any special right for the scv to display flags from government property.
although the district court granted the motion to dismiss by its opinion of june,the court rejected the city assertion that the flag standards are forums.the court explained that,although flag standards are not a traditional public forum,the scv had alleged facts showing that lexington had established them as such by allowing private entities to use them.viewing the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to the scv,the court proceeded under the assumption that the city created a designated public forum when it allowed private entities to fly their flags from flag poles.opinion.the court therefore assessed whether lexington was entitled to close the designated public forum,recognizing that 
m otive is a central issue in certain constitutional inquiries when government action has a discriminatory effect.and,t o be sure,if a government regulation is based on the content of the speech or the message,that action must be scrutinized more carefully to ensure that communication has not been prohibited merely because public officials disapprove the speaker view.
id.at footnote omitted quoting postal serv.council of greenburgh civic ass ns.the court determined that,because the ordinance makes no distinction as to viewpoint or subject matter and advances no particular position,it is content neutral.id.at.as a result,the alleged discriminatory motivation of the city in closing the forum does not taint the otherwise facially valid ordinance.id.at.
next,the district court ruled that the ordinance is reasonable,emphasizing that t he constitution does not compel a municipality to provide its citizens a bully pulpit,but rather requires it to refrain from using its own position of authority to infringe speech.opinion.the court recognized that there were compelling and practical reasons for lexington to close its flag standards to the public,such as the possibility of the city being forced to hoist messages with which it would rather not associate,and the potential for private expression to subsume the intended official purpose of the flag standards.the opinion stressed that the ordinance leaves ample opportunity for the scv and every other group to display the flags of their choice.id.finally,the court concluded that,because the city has not abridged the scv constitutional rights,the city has not violated the consent decree.id.at.
the scv filed a timely notice of appeal,asking us to reverse the judgment of the district court.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.see brown dep t of,cir.as the supreme court has explained,rule b authorizes a court to dismiss a claim on the basis of a dispositive issue of law.neitzke williams.
the scv contends that the district court erred in determining that,because the ordinance is facially neutral,the city motivation for closing the designated public forum was immaterial.maintaining that the city restriction of the flag standards was,the scv argues that c ontrary
