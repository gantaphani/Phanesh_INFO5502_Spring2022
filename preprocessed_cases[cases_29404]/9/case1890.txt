reya boyer liberto,an african american woman,commenced this action against her former employer,the fontainebleau corporation,trading as clarion resort fontainebleau hotel,in ocean city,maryland,and its owner,leonard berger,for racial discrimination and retaliation,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and.she grounds her racial discrimination claim on a hostile work environment allegedly created by two conversations she had with a coworker about an incident that occurred on september.during the conversations,which took place on two consecutive days,the coworker twice called liberto a porch monkey.and she grounds her retaliation claim on the termination of her employment after she complained about the statements.
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that the conduct was too isolated to support either of liberto claims.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
liberto began working at the clarion resort fontainebleau hotel the clarion on august.the clarion is a typical oceanfront hotel,with several restaurants,bars,a nightclub,and banquet facilities,and it typically employs people in its service department.liberto began as a morning hostess in one of the hotel restaurants.
according to richard heubeck,the clarion food and beverage director,liberto did seem to be happy in the morning hostess position.he stated that she had difficulty keeping pace with the job and that it was not a good fit for her.because liberto had previously expressed a preference for other jobs in the hotel,she was allowed to work in other departments,engaging in serving and bartending,as well as working banquets.according to berger,the clarion owner,liberto also struggled with these other jobs.as he stated,she behaved unprofessionally,clashed with other employees,disregarded clarion policy,and responded poorly to criticism.berger said that because liberto had failed at four jobs and had failed the clarion bartending test,he terminated her employment on september.
during her employment,liberto interacted with trudy clubb,a longtime employee at the clarion and a friend of berger.clubb described herself as a restaurant manager,reporting to food and beverage director heubeck,as well as mark elman,another supervisor.while clubb exact role at the clarion is not made clear in the record,clubb described her job as getting things going for the early part of the day,seeing that the crew is and ready to present themselves to the customers,getting the tables ready,getting the buffet ready,and overseeing all the items that need to be done.clubb was not involved in the hiring and disciplining of fellow employees.
liberto testified during her deposition that she never understood clubb to be a supervisor or manager.liberto said that she was told by her that clubb was just berger friend and she was just there to say hello and greet people as a glorified hostess.she also stated that she was never told that clubb was a manager to the contrary,she was told that clubb did not have the power to make decisions and did not have management cards or keys.liberto stated that she herself reported to heubeck and to another manager named jamie.she acknowledged that she did listen to clubb,but she did so only to the extent that she had to be respectful and listen to anyone she work ed with.while clubb would occasionally ask liberto or other employees to do something,liberto testified that it was not a regular routine for clubb to instruct other employees,and clubb did not ever correct the work that liberto did.
when liberto and clubb were first introduced,clubb compared liberto with another employee,stating,you look like stacy,but stacy nice,which liberto took as offensive.but the incident central to this action occurred on september,more than a month after liberto had been hired.
on the evening of september,liberto was serving drinks to customers,and one customer ordered a hula hula,a drink that was particularly to make.when the bartender at the clarion primary bar refused to make the drink,liberto went through the kitchen to order the drink from the clarion pub bar.while passing through the kitchen,clubb called out to liberto several times,telling her not to use the kitchen as a shortcut.liberto did not hear clubb calls.when clubb finally got liberto attention,clubb began yelling at liberto for not acknowledging her when she had tried to get liberto attention.liberto said that the distance between the two was close enough that she could feel clubb breath and spittle from clubb mouth was hitting her.clubb called liberto deaf and said that she was going to make liberto sorry.as the conversation concluded,clubb called liberto a porch monkey.
when liberto went to heubeck office the next day to complain about clubb conduct,clubb came in and said to liberto,i need to speak to you,little girl.the two then spoke alone outside the office,and clubb scolded her for abandoning her station the previous day.as this meeting broke up,clubb again called liberto a porch monkey.
liberto reported the conduct to nancy berghauer,the clarion human resources director,and the two spoke over the telephone on september.berghauer made typewritten notes of the conversation and forwarded them to berger and elman.elman met with liberto to discuss the situation and to ensure that berghauer notes were correct.the next day,september,heubeck met with clubb,who denied liberto allegations.he nonetheless issued her a written warning.
one day prior to heubeck meeting with clubb,berger and heubeck discussed liberto performance problems,as well as her conflict with clubb.during the conversation,berger observed that liberto had substantial performance issues and felt that the clarion should terminate her.over the next few days,before berger had made a final decision on liberto employment,he discussed liberto performance with elman and berghauer.when berger looked at liberto work file,he discovered that she had failed the clarion bartending test.elman and berghauer both told berger that because of liberto s complaint,firing her could create a situation.berger replied that there not going to be any good time to let her go.the situation will be there.on september,berger terminated liberto employment.he asserted in his deposition that liberto allegations against clubb did not play any part in his decision.moreover,clubb was not involved in the decision,only learning of it a week later.
liberto filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on september,alleging discrimination based on her race and retaliation based on her engagement in protected activity,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the eeoc issued liberto a notice of right to sue,following which liberto commenced this action.
in her complaint,liberto asserted four claims for relief two counts of racial discrimination,in violation of title vii count i and count iii,and two counts of retaliation,also in violation of title vii count ii and count iv.
following discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.in deciding the motion,the district court excluded from consideration the vague answers to interrogatories given by liberto,which were not executed on personal knowledge and included hearsay.the court did,however,take as true the testimony in liberto deposition,in which she described the two conversations in which clubb called her a porch monkey.the court held that based on the summary judgment record so defined,the offensive conduct was too isolated to support liberto claims for discrimination and retaliation.accordingly,by order dated april,the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.
this appeal followed.
liberto contends first that the district court erred in excluding her answers to interrogatories as part of the summary judgment record.the court concluded that the answers were not only vague as to time,place,and identity of the hearer but also were not based on liberto personal knowledge.liberto had executed the answers with the oath that they were true to the best of her knowledge,information and belief.moreover,in the text of the answers themselves,liberto stated that the information was not based solely upon her knowledge but include d the knowledge of her agents,representatives,and attorney.the answers identified other persons who had knowledge of the relevant facts,as alleged in the complaint.
liberto nonetheless argues that the language referring to other persons information and her belief was a boilerplate disclaimer that is commonly used.she explains,obviously,a lay plaintiff can not be expected to answer complicated discovery requests fully and accurately without the benefit of counsel.
as the advisory committee notes to federal rule of civil procedure observe,the very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.advisory committee note amends.emphasis added.because the rule is a mechanism to obviate trial,the facts forming the basis for a summary judgment must be material.a be undisputed,and be admissible in evidence.c.thus,a declarant of facts used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment must demonstrate that he or she has personal knowledge of the facts and is competent to testify to them.see.c see also szego comm r.lexis,at cir.june,per curiam concluding that interrogatory answers were not properly in the summary judgment record because they were filed by the defendant attorney and not based on the defendant personal knowledge williams griffin,cir noting that a verified complaint could be used to oppose a motion for summary judgment when the allegations contained therein were based on personal knowledge emphasis added.highways contractors ass maryland,cir h earsay evidence,which is inadmissible at trial,can not be considered on a motion for summary judgment.
while it is no doubt true that answers to interrogatories are routinely given on knowledge,information and belief,if a declarant wishes to use such answers to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment,she must either state the information in an affidavit that complies with rule or execute the answers to interrogatories on personal knowledge.
in this case,liberto did neither.liberto supplied her answers to interrogatories based not only on her own knowledge,but also on information she received from others and on her belief that the information was true.and in this case,the information was explicitly stated to have been obtained from her agents,representatives,and attorney.such evidence certainly would not be admissible at trial,as it would amount to hearsay,speculation,or both.
we conclude that the district court did not err in excluding liberto answers to interrogatories from consideration as part of the summary judgment record.
liberto next contends that the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record,viewed in the light most favorable to her,did not demonstrate a hostile work environment,as prohibited by title vii and.she argues that the use of the term porch monkey was particularly severe and humiliating and that,because the duration of her employment was short,clubb two uses of the term were relatively frequent.moreover,she argues,because clubb was physically close to her during the first conversation when the term was used,it was threatening.
the porch monkey term that clubb used was indeed racially derogatory and highly offensive,and nothing we say or hold condones it.nonetheless,we conclude that a coworker use of that term twice in a period of two days in discussions about a single incident was not,as a matter of law,so severe or pervasive as to change the terms and conditions of liberto employment so as to be legally discriminatory.
title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of her race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.see a.and requiring an employee to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment violates that provision.harris forklift.a hostile work environment exists when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in making a determination whether an employer has created an abusive working environment,a court is required to examine all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.at see also okoli city of baltimore,cir.
viewing the facts of the summary judgment record,we conclude that liberto has not presented evidence such that a reasonable juror could find that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.particularly important is the fact that liberto points to only two conversations,on consecutive days,in which clubb called her a porch monkey,both of which arose from a single incident at the clarion.our cases have made it clear that u nlike other,more direct and discrete unlawful employment practices,hostile work environments generally result only after an accumulation of discrete instances of harassment.jordan alternative resources,cir see also passenger morgan,hostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts.their very nature involves repeated conduct.while clubb statements to liberto were racially derogatory and highly offensive,as we have noted,they were singular and isolated,and liberto has not pointed to any other specific indicators in the record that clubb,or any other employee,made racist or hostile statements to her.
liberto relies on three cases that,she argues,support her claim of racial discrimination through a hostile work environment tawwaab virginia linen,d spriggs diamond auto glass,cir and ayissi etoh fannie mae.none of these cases,however,advances her argument.
in tawwaab,an african american employee at a linen and laundry service was consistently harassed by his supervisor,miller,regarding his race.as the court observed 
carter alleges that miller constantly used racial slurs and profane insults in his presence in reference to the african americans he supervised that included the terms dumb,stupid,motherfuckers,black motherfuckers,bastards,black bastards,and black fresh princes of bel air.carter alleges that miller did not use this type of invective when addressing white employees.he specifically identifies an incident wherein miller said of virgil wingate,another african american route sales representative i ca stand that black motherfucker.i going to kick that black bastard ass and drag his motherfucking ass across the fucking parking lot,black bastard.i ca stand that motherfucker.
miller also allegedly made racial jokes in carter presence about traditional african american hairstyles and names.in addition,miller kept a statue on his desk of what plaintiffs assert is an african american golf caddy with the appearance of a monkey,and that miller would deliberately place this statue in front of carter and other african american employees when he would meet with them,as if to say,this is what i think of you.you are monkeys to me.
id.at.in denying the defendant summary judgment motion,the court noted that the plaintiff identified approximately ten actionable incidents of harassment that took place between and and that several of the incidents were particularly offensive,involving at least some kind of physical threat.id.at.in contrast,liberto only refers to two conversations,about a single incident,occurring on consecutive days,during which clubb twice used a racial epithet.
similarly,in spriggs,the offensive statements at issue,which were made by the plaintiff supervisor,included nearly every racist insult one can imagine,including nigger,black bitch,monkey,and dumb monkey,extending repeatedly over the course of two stints of employment spanning three years.at.in vacating summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants,the court emphasized the frequency of the comments.id.at.again,that circumstance is not presented in this case.
finally,in ayissi etoh,the plaintiff an african american senior financial modeler asked a white supervisor why he had not received a raise in conjunction with a recent promotion.ayissi etoh,at.in response,he was told,for a young black man smart like you,we are happy to have your expertise i think i already paying you a lot of money.id.at.several months later,during a discussion with a more direct supervisor about the plaintiff work responsibilities,the supervisor yelled at him,get out of my office nigger.id.the plaintiff was forced to continue working with the second supervisor,eventually causing the plaintiff to have an anxiety disorder and miss work.the plaintiff brought,inter alia,a hostile work environment claim and a claim that he was denied a raise because of his race,both under.the circuit concluded that the defendant was not entitled to summary judgment on either claim.id.at.those circumstances,however,are substantially distinguishable from those in this case.first,as the court in ayissi etoh noted,the hostile work environment was not precipitated by a single event,but rather by two independent statements having ongoing applicability,made by two different supervisors of the plaintiff,ultimately leading to health problems and directly causing the plaintiff to miss work.id.additionally,the racist comments were made during conversations directly about the plaintiff pay and work assignments clear situations in which the statements alter ed the conditions of the victim employment.harris,at.in contrast,this case presents statements made by a coworker,that did not relate to liberto terms of employment and did not have ongoing consequences.
liberto has not pointed to any fourth circuit case,nor could she,finding the presence of a hostile work environment based on a single incident.compare jordan,at addressing a single racist statement directed in response to a television news report and made in the presence of plaintiff and noting that it was a far cry from alleging an environment of crude and racist conditions so severe or pervasive that they altered the conditions of plaintiff employment,with anderson,cir denying summary judgment where plaintiff was subjected,on a daily basis,to verbal assaults of the most vulgar and humiliating sort conner schrader bridgeport int l,cir noting frequency and regularity of the unwelcome conduct amirmokri baltimore gas,cir c abused plaintiff almost daily,calling him names like the local terrorist,a camel jockey and the emir of waldorf.
liberto hostile work environment claim under is governed by the same principles applicable to her hostile work environment claim under title vii.see spriggs,at.and because we conclude that liberto has not demonstrated a hostile work environment under title vii,we likewise conclude that she has not done so under.
finally,liberto contends that the district court erred in dismissing her retaliation claims under title vii and.she asserts that her employment was terminated because she complained about clubb porch monkey statements.in entering summary judgment on this claim,the district court concluded that she lacked an objectively reasonable belief that she was actually being subjected to unlawful harassment.liberto nonetheless argues that rather than assessing whether she had an objectively reasonable belief of harassment,the district court,by requiring that the conduct be sufficiently severe or pervasive,required her to prove actual harassment.in arguing that her belief was an objectively reasonable one,she relies on the offensiveness of the porch monkey epithet.
to demonstrate retaliation,a plaintiff must show that she was terminated because she engaged in protected activity,because she respond ed to an employment practice that she reasonably believe d was unlawful.jordan,at emphasis added.liberto contends that she had such an objectively reasonable belief based on clubb two statements made in relation to the incident on september.
but just as her claim as to an actual hostile work environment failed as a matter of law,her claim that she had an objectively reasonable belief that she was complaining about a hostile work environment fares no better in the circumstances of this case.the conversations forming the basis for liberto belief were isolated to one coworker about one incident over two days.and liberto concedes that clubb had not called her by racial epithets before or after the conversations at issue here.moreover,liberto relationships with her supervisors and her other coworkers were free from such epithets.
in addition,when these conversations occurred,liberto thought that she was simply being redressed by a coworker,not her supervisor.when liberto was asked whether she knew that clubb was the restaurant manager,liberto emphatically testified that she did not.in response to the question,you never knew throughout your entire employment with the clarion that she was a manager she responded 
never.i reported to jamie,and jamie,as a matter of fact,told me not to go to clubb because clubb did not have the power to do voids or make decisions.i had to report to jamie or richard.and at the time clubb did not hold any management cards or keys as jamie did.
liberto explained that she would only listen to clubb as she would to any other person that she worked with.in these circumstances,liberto understanding of clubb role lessens the risk that clubb statements alone caused liberto to reasonably believe that clarion had altered the terms and conditions of her employment.see burlington,ellerth,noting that a supervisor power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character.
finally,the analysis of the hostile work environment claim that we conducted earlier in this opinion tends to confirm the absence of an objectively reasonable belief that a violation had occurred.in the circumstances of this case,if no objectively reasonable juror could have found the presence of a hostile work environment,as we today hold,it stands to reason that liberto also could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment existed.
in short,we conclude that liberto could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that,in complaining to management about the two related conversations,she was complaining about conduct that was unlawful either under title vii or.
liberto points out that under title vii,she need not wait until her work environment is actually hostile and threatening before her opposition is protected.she is correct in noting that where conduct is likely to ripen into a hostile work environment,the employee opposition may be protected before the hostile environment has fully taken form.see jordan,at navy fed.credit union,cir.but this case does not present any indicators that the situation at the clarion would have ripened into a hostile work environment.there was no series of events that were set in motion by clubb statements,unlike cases where we have denied summary judgment on a retaliation claim because the conduct complained of was likely to lead to a title vii violation.see,e,navy,at see also jordan,at w e can not simply assume,without more,that the opposed conduct will continue or will be repeated unabated.indeed,after the incident,clarion management warned clubb,and clubb and liberto thereafter had no further contact.moreover,liberto has pointed to no other specific indicators in the record to evince that workplace racism was afoot before then.
just as in jordan,we conclude here that while in the abstract,continued repetition of racial comments of the kind clubb made might have led to a hostile work environment,no allegation in the record suggests that a plan was in motion to create such an environment,let alone that such an environment was even likely to occur.jordan,at see also faragher
