opinion of the court 
in,arthur newmark filed a bivens action against the secretary of the united states department of veterans affairs,and against the acting chief of staff,the director and emergency room director of the philadelphia veterans affairs medical center,hereinafter pvamc,and the center itself.in,he filed an amended complaint adding claims against pvamc for violations of the age discrimination in employment act hereinafter adea.later that year,newmark agreed to dismiss all claims in return for an offer of judgment that paid in back pay.the terms of the offer of judgment entered by the court,provided for the payment of attorneys fees to be determined by the court under the equal access to justice act for the portion of the work attributable directly to the adea claims.after briefing by the parties,the district court determined that since the offer of judgment specifically provided for the award of attorneys fees under the eaja,the court did not need to establish whether the adea would independently authorize such fees.the court considered newmark argument that under b he was entitled to fees against the government to the same extent as he could have recovered from a private party under the adea.the district court disagreed,finding that the limit of under d applied and that the amount of the fees was required by the statute to be capped at per hour.newmark has challenged only the final the statutory provisions of the equal access to justice act require that attorneys fees be capped at per hour.for the reasons cited below,we conclude that the district court erred in so finding,and we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,since newmark claims arose under the adea,et and under bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d.the fee award was also determined pursuant to a federal statute,the equal access to justice act eaja.the district court issued a final order in this case,and we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
appellant urges that we apply a plenary standard of review,since we are being asked to construe a statute.we agree.an award of attorneys fees under the eaja is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.see,dewalt sullivan,cir.here,however,as in dewalt,the question of whether the district court abused its discretion turns on whether the court properly applied the statutory provisions,which presents a question of law to which we apply plenary review.id.
we note at the outset that this case comes to us in an unusual procedural posture.the department of veterans affairs argued convincingly before the district court for an interpretation of the statute that was very close to the district court actual interpretation,namely that the cap on fees set forth in subsection d controls an award under b.between that time and the briefing before us,the district of colorado issued villescas richardson,d,in which the court determined that,for the purposes of an adea claim,the analysis under the statute should be bifurcated,and attorneys fees should be awarded under the second sentence of b.id.at.because private litigants under the adea have remedies governed by the flsa,the court interpreted the second sentence of b to refer it to the flsa allowance of reasonable attorney fee and costs of the action.the court calculated the reasonable attorney fee using a traditional lodestar method.id.according to the attorney appearing before us,this opinion generated sufficient internal discussions among the department of justice components and attorneys offices that they have changed their position.appellee was thus constrained to argue before us that while its arguments were made before the district court in good faith,it now concedes the correctness of newmark position.however,the district court order to the contrary is still before us and appellant urges us to reverse and remand.because decisions made in other jurisdictions are not binding on us,we will examine and interpret the statute ourselves in the light of our precedent.
ii.the equal access to justice act 
a.the structure of the act 
the relevant portions of the statute in question,the eaja,provide 
costs and fees 
a except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a judgment for costs,as enumerated in section of this title,but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys,may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the united states or any agency or any official of the united states acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action.a judgment for costs when taxed against the united states shall,in an amount established by statute,court rule,or order,be limited to reimbursing in whole or in part the prevailing party for the costs incurred by such party in the litigation.
b unless expressly prohibited by statute,a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,in addition to the costs which may be awarded pursuant to subsection a,to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the united states or any agency or any official of the united states acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action.the united states shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.
d a except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses,in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection a,incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
for the purposes of this subsection 
a fees and other expenses includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses,the reasonable cost of any study,analysis,engineering report,test,or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party case,and reasonable attorney fees.the amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished,except that i no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the united states and ii attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor,such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved,justifies a higher fee.
emphasis added.
the fee cap appears in d a,and is specifically limited for purposes of this subsection,to d.if d serves only to expand upon and clarify b,then fees awarded under b might be subject to the cap on fees.if,on the other hand,b and d present alternative awards,the limit under d should not apply.the district court noted that courts frequently have relied on a general authorization of fees under b as the predicate for the award calculation under d from that consistent coupling,the district court inferred that the two sections were part of an integrated statute.in so concluding,the district court overlooked the distinctions between the specific provisions that follow the general authorization in b.we acknowledge that we have been imprecise in awarding fees under the equal access to justice act without specifically indicating the statutory provisions under which the award is being sought.however,this is understandable,because we have not previously been presented with the precise issue before us,namely whether the specific provisions of b do in fact stand alone as authority for attorneys fees,separate from d rather,our cases have assumed the general grant in b as authorizing the calculat
