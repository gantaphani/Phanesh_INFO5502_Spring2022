procedural and factual background

afterward,filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol,arguing that spencer failed to establish a claim of hostile work environment and that,even if she had established such a claim,she was still not entitled to back pay.simultaneously,spencer filed a motion to amend the judgment to include injunctive relief,as well as a motion for reimbursement of attorney fees and costs.

the district court also denied spencer request for injunctive relief and for reimbursement of attorney fees.id.at.specifically,the court found that injunctive relief was inappropriate because spencer had not established a pattern of discrimination by and because spencer would not benefit from an injunction as she was no longer an employee of.id.at.the court also found that spencer did not receive any benefit from litigation,because her back pay award had been vacated,and because her emotional distress award was offset by a prior settlement agreement id.at.thus,the district court denied spencer request for attorney fees.spencer then filed a motion to alter and amend judgment and a motion for relief from judgment,arguing that it was appropriate for the jury to consider the back pay issue because back pay is not an equitable remedy.spencer also contested the denial of attorney fees.spencer argued that the settlement agreement did not affect her status as a prevailing party because she signed the agreement after the jury rendered its decision.
the district court upheld its ruling as to the back pay issue but reconsidered its decision on attorney fees.spencer stores,wl.june,dist.lexis,at.the court agreed that the settlement agreement did not affect spencer status as the prevailing party because it was signed after trial.id.at.the court reasoned that the timing of the agreement was important because it indicated whether spencer had gone into the trial having already bargained away her potential recovery.id.the court,however,found that spencer had achieved limited success at trial,and thus,it reduced her lodestar by and awarded her in attorney fees.id.at.
