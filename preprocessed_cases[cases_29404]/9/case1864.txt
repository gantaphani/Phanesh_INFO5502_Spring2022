andrew adams contends that the board of education of anne arundel county violated his rights under the family and medical leave act of fmla and the americans with disabilities act of ada.his allegations include interference with his medical leaves,retaliation for taking those leaves,discrimination and retaliation on the basis of his disability,and a failure to accommodate his condition.we find no merit to these related claims and affirm the judgment of the district court.
on january,adams was involved in an incident with a student in a hallway at macarthur middle school in fort meade,maryland,where he was an assistant principal.although witness accounts differed significantly,the student initially claimed that adams grabbed her by the arms,shook her,and pinned her against a wall.as a result of the incident,child protective services cps launched a child abuse investigation,and the matter was also referred to the school board employee case management committee.cps acts to prevent and investigate incidences of child abuse under the auspices of the department of social services dss,whereas the board employee case management committee has as its focus conduct detrimental to the proper functioning of the school system.adams was temporarily reassigned from macarthur in the meantime.
on february,adams met with board investigators.adams contends that at that meeting he was shown a document stating he was completely cleared of all charges.the board denies adams was shown any such document and claims its independent investigation,which focused on school district policy violations,continued on a parallel track.in all events,the board transferred adams back to macarthur on february.that same day,however,he went on medical leave upon the recommendation of kim bondurant,an internal medicine specialist,because he suffered from stress,anxiety,and high blood pressure,presumably related to the january incident and the child abuse allegation.adams returned to macarthur on march,but had a panic attack,during which he claims he was berated by principal reginald farrare.adams took a second medical leave,and bondurant referred him to a psychiatrist,lawrence adler.adams claims that when he came back to work on march,farrare again berated him,this time in front of other staff.
two weeks later,adams began his third and final medical leave after adler diagnosed him with acute stress disorder.adler informed the board that,when adams returned from leave,he will require assignment to another school,because being at macarthur could spur panic attacks and other manifestations of his illness.adler later updated the diagnosis to stress disorder,as reflected in the fmla paperwork that he submitted on may.the board required adams to attend three sessions during the summer with a specialist of its choosing,psychologist anthony wolff.wolff cleared adams to work on july.
the board investigative process continued while adams was on that extended leave.the board sent a letter to adams on april,notifying him that a conference had been scheduled for may.the meeting was delayed by four days so that adams attorney could attend.two weeks after the conference,adams received a letter from the board formally reprimanding him for engag ing in physical contact by using a technique that escalated a situation that could have been handled differently.
adams began working at a new school,albert adams academy jaa,on august.the board had first informed adams in early june that it intended to transfer him to jaa.however,adams agrees that the transfer did not occur in practice until august,as he was on leave until late july.in the spring,adler had recommended a transfer,and wolff later agreed that adams would best be assigned to a supportive,school environment.adams,wolff stated,is not averse to the possibility of being assigned to a specialized program such as the albert adams academy,which has been mentioned as a possibility.
the student population of jaa,a specialized middle school for children with behavioral issues,used to reach,but now is capped at.in contrast,macarthur has more than students and a less favorable ratio.in accordance with a union contract,adams salary remained the same for two years and then was reduced by less than one percent because of jaa smaller size.jaa employees are also ineligible for certain discretionary bonuses available at other schools.adams has reportedly excelled at jaa.he has received exceptional performance reviews,has served as acting principal for a month,and has not been subject to any further discipline.he has not requested a transfer from jaa.
adams filed this lawsuit in maryland state court,and the board removed the case to federal court.adams alleged various violations of the fmla,the ada,title vii of the civil rights act of,and maryland state law.after allowing adams to amend his initial complaint,the district court dismissed all of the allegations in the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim,except for adams fmla interference and retaliation claims and his ada discrimination and retaliation claims.see.after discovery,the district court granted the board motion for summary judgment on those remaining claims.see.
on appeal,adams presses his various fmla and ada claims,all of which arise from the same set of operative facts.we review de novo both the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the grant of a motion for summary judgment.bland roberts,cir du pont de nemours kolon,cir.under our summary judgment standard,of course,the facts are generally viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d see dennis columbia colleton med,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.a.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment.
adams contends that the board both interfered with his fmla rights and retaliated against him for taking medical leave.
the fmla grants employees the prescriptive right to take up to a total of workweeks of leave during any month period when,inter alia,an employee is burdened with a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform his job.u.a d.when returning from fmla leave,an employee is also entitled to be restored to his previous position or an equivalent position,so long as he would have retained that position or an equivalent one absent the taking of leave.yashenko harrah nc casino,cir citing a.that is,there is no absolute right to restoration to a prior employment position.id.at.nonetheless,it is unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise an employee fmla rights.a.
to make out an interference claim under the fmla,an employee must thus demonstrate that he is entitled to an fmla benefit his employer interfered with the provision of that benefit and that interference caused harm.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,d citing a wonasue of.alumni ass n,d.
we begin by noting one salient fact adams was not denied fmla leave.in fact,he took three separate medical leaves totaling well over twelve weeks.the supreme court has observed that the purpose of an interference claim is to permit a court to inquire into matters such as whether the employee would have exercised his or her fmla rights in the absence of the employer actions.ragsdale,at.adams has not suggested that the board denied him any fmla leave he requested.on the contrary,adams received more than the statutorily guaranteed amount.
nevertheless,adams argues that the board interfered with his leave in a variety of ways that stopped short of actually denying him leave.in particular,he asserts that the board took adverse employment actions against him,which interfered with his fmla rights by discouraging the taking of leave.see b interfering with the exercise of an employee rights would include,for example,not only refusing to authorize fmla leave,but discouraging an employee from using such leave.
adams first objects that the board required him to submit to three unnecessary examinations by a specialist.but the fmla and the applicable regulation explicitly allow employers to seek a second opinion and even a third,if the first two opinions conflict.c,d b,c.such medical opinions allow an employer to verify the claimed medical condition,to assess how long the employee might be out of work,and to fashion the best environment for the employee upon his return to the workplace.
the regulation concerning the authenticity of the initial certification by a medical professional,a,is not applicable here.employers may order a second or third medical evaluation out of concern that the original certification of a serious medical condition is invalid,not that it is inauthentic.see c allowing a second evaluation where the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification.employers are entitled to seek a second opinion regardless of whether the certification notice proffered by the employee is real or not.in requiring adams to attend the sessions with wolff,the board simply exercised its statutory right to seek another professional medical opinion.
second,adams argues that the board conference interfered with his leave by forcing him to work.appellant br.at.in certain circumstances required meetings may unlawfully interrupt an employee leave.here,however,the conference was a legitimate piece of an ongoing investigation into the january incident between adams and the student.adams argues more broadly that the board continued disciplinary investigation ran contrary to the understanding reached at the february meeting with school officials,during which they allegedly indicated the entire matter had been wrapped up.he also submits several deposition statements from macarthur staff to the effect that his reinstatement at macarthur indicated everything was fine.see statement of reginald farrare when he returned to school it signified to me that he had been cleared of those allegations s omeone informed me that he had been cleared of the allegations statement of deanna natarian u pon his return i assumed everything was fine.he would have returned if it was.the staff members had not been at the february meeting and relayed general information apparently conveyed by unspecified other persons.
for several reasons,we do not believe adams proffers suffice to create an issue of triable fact as to the events surrounding the february meeting,or in a larger sense the board continuation of its own investigation.see celotex catrett,d finding summary judgment proper,after adequate time for discovery and upon motion,against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case.although the dss committee by early february had cleared adams in its child abuse investigation,there is little evidence that the board in some way closed and then reopened its own investigation into whether adams had violated school district policies,much less that its actions had anything to do with adams fmla leave.
indeed,the evidence overwhelmingly points to the contrary conclusion that the board separate investigation into school district policy violations was continuous.the only document in the record that resembles what adams claims was a fully exculpatory resolution of the january incident is the february decision by a committee of the dss to rule out the child abuse allegation.by contrast,the employee case management log shows that the board own investigation report was not completed on february,the date on which adams claims the investigation was closed.in fact,the school district interview of adams about the incident was not even scheduled until that same day,because dss had just completed and finalized its investigation of the child abuse allegations and the school district investigation could thereafter proceed unfettered.the draft report was not finished until march,and the report was not finalized until april.the board then notified adams of the conference by letter.the conference was postponed for several days so that adams counsel could attend.
it is surely true that the investigative processes of any institution are open to abuse,but the record here points to a standard procedure during which due process was accorded to adams every step along the way.adams does not dispute that the board was entitled to conduct its own investigation into the january incident.indeed,school districts must often engage in investigations like this one or else face accusations and lawsuits for not looking promptly into allegations of improper teacher contact with students or violations of school district policies.the conference was part of the investigatory and disciplinary process,which adams has not adequately linked to his ample fmla leaves,and seeking the participation of adams and his attorney in that process did not constitute an impermissible interference with adams fmla leave.and adams never objected or sought a continuance he did not get.
third,adams asserts that farrare alleged verbal attacks and the written reprimand constituted adverse employment actions.appellant br.at.but however bad the relationship between adams and farrare,adams can not demonstrate that these verbal and written reprimands in fact discouraged him from taking fmla leave.indeed,adams began his second medical leave the same day as the first alleged verbal attack.nor did the written reprimand inhibit adams final medical did not return to work until more than two months after the reprimand was issued.
regardless,neither the written nor the verbal reprimands qualify as adverse employment actions,because they did not lead to further discipline.see,hopkins balt.gas,cir jeffers thompson,d.the written reprimand,in particular,was the final step in the board legitimate ongoing investigation.these incidents were what the board said they,not signposts on a predetermined path to a true adverse employment action.in fact,adams has received excellent reviews of his performance since returning from the third and final fmla leave.
adams also contends that the board retaliated against him for exercising his fmla rights.see a making it unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by the fmla see also c noting that employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions.
retaliation claims brought under the fmla are analogous to those brought under title vii.laing federal express,cir yashenko,at.plaintiff must prove three elements to establish a prima facie case of retaliation she engaged in a protected activity her employer took an adverse employment action against her and there was a causal link between the two events.boyer liberto fontainebleau,slip op.at cir en banc quotation marks omitted.if the defendant advances a lawful explanation for the alleged retaliatory action,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant reason for taking the adverse employment action was pretextual.see laing,at,citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.
many of the board actions here were simply not retaliatory.as noted above,the board disciplinary investigation into adams conduct was never concluded,and thus it could not have been reopened in order to retaliate against adams.the board review,including the conference and the written reprimand,observed due process requirements.other board decisions fail to qualify as adverse employment actions.the eventual result of the board investigation the reprimand letter did not adversely affect adams employment position or his pay and benefits.similarly,farrare verbal reprimands did not adversely affect adams employment.although the board required the medical examinations in reaction to adams taking of fmla leave,such a request for a second medical opinion is expressly allowed under the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.
nor was adams transfer from macarthur to jaa in retaliation for his exercise of fmla rights.crucially,both adler and wolff recommended that adams be transferred to a different and less stressful school,and adams reportedly was not averse to the possibility of being assigned to jaa.the board effectuated the transfer promptly adams first day at jaa came merely a week after wolff
