defendant susan duffy duffy,a captain at perry correctional institution perry ci a state prison within the south carolina department of corrections system placed plaintiff anthony fred martin martin,an inmate at perry ci,in segregation after martin filed a grievance against a prison sergeant contending that the sergeant inappropriately touched him during a shakedown.alleging that his placement in segregation violated his constitutional rights to freedom from retaliation for filing a grievance,equal protection,and due process,martin filed a pro se complaint under against duffy.
the district court dismissed martin complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.we agree that martin failed to state claims under the equal protection and due process clauses.but construing martin complaint liberally,as we must,we conclude that martin pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim that duffy violated martin first amendment rights by placing him in segregation as retaliation for filing a grievance.and we further conclude that duffy is not entitled to qualified immunity from martin retaliation claim because,under this court precedent,it was clearly established at the time duffy placed martin in segregation that retaliating against an inmate for filing a grievance violates the inmate rights under the first amendment.booker dep t of,cir.accordingly,we reverse,in part,the district court dismissal of martin action.
on september,martin filed an electronic message through the prison kiosk system,alleging that a prison sergeant inappropriately touched him during a shakedown.the next day,duffy removed martin from the general inmate population and placed him in a holding cell in the administrative building.martin alleged that,once in holding,duffy questioned him relentlessly about an informal resolution attempt of his grievance alleging inappropriate an d unwanted touching battery against the sergeant that martin had filed the day before.martin also alleged that,following duffy questioning,duffy placed martin in detention or segregation in an attempt to maintain the integrity of the investigation into martin complaint against the sergeant.
subsequently,on november,martin submitted a request to staff member chit to duffy complaining that duffy had no justifiable means to lock him away and that i f an investigation was or is being conducted,no one ha d spoken to him concerning the matter.in this same request to staff member chit,martin accused duffy of violating south carolina department of corrections procedure by reprising against him for his participating in an informal resolution of his earlier grievance.a month later,duffy responded to martin,stating that martin had been placed under investigation by the division of investigations that he was no longer under investigation and that he was currently on the yard list to return to the general population.
when prison officials arranged for martin to return to the general inmate population on december,days after his initial placement in segregation,martin refused to reenter the general population and instead requested a transfer to another prison as a resolution to the situation.later that afternoon,a lieutenant filed an incident report recounting martin refus al to go to the yard per classifications and citing martin for r efusing to obey orders.
nearly two weeks later,on january,martin submitted an inmate request through the prison offender management system,reciting his interactions with duffy,his allegation that duffy placed him in segregation for attempting to informally resolve an allegation of battery against a sergeant by way of the electronic kiosk,and his attempt to informally resolve the issue with no response.in response to martin inmate request,a prison official notified martin that he was not under investigation that officials believed his allegations had been found invalid by investigators and that his refusal to return to the general population had resulted in a pending charge.consequently,on january,prison officials held a hearing regarding martin refusal to return to the general population on december.martin refused to attend the hearing.a hearing officer found martin guilty of the charged offense and imposed various sanctions.
approximately five months later,martin received his requested transfer to broad river correctional institution.according to martin,during the days that he remained in segregation,he never received a hearing regarding his detention,nor was he ever informed of the progress of any investigation related to the grievance that he had filed.
on december,martin,proceeding pro se,filed a complaint against duffy in the united states district court for the district of south carolina.in his complaint,martin alleged that duffy unequal treatment of him was an act of reprisal,harassment and retaliation simply because martin had attempted to informally resolve a grievance duffy did not like.martin also alleged that duffy placement of martin in segregation,when other inmates who had similarly attempted to informally resolve grievances of inappropriate an d unwanted touching had not been placed in segregation,violated his right to equal protection.and martin alleged two claims sounding in denial of procedural due process that his placement in segregation caused him to generally suffer an atypical and significant hardship and that his placement in segregation caused him to lose good time credits for each month he was in segregation invalidly.
on december,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that martin complaint should be summarily dismissed pursuant to e b.noting its obligation to construe liberally martin pro se complaint,the magistrate judge found that martin failed to state cognizable equal protection and due process claims under.in particular,the magistrate judge first found that martin failed to state a due process claim because south carolina law confers no protected liberty interest upon inmates from being classified or being placed in administrative segregation.and regarding martin equal protection claim,the magistrate judge found that martin failed to state a plausible claim because he provide d no factual allegations to show that duffy treated martin differently than any other similarly situated inmate or that his placement in segregation resulted from intentional or purposeful discrimination.the magistrate judge report and recommendation did not explicitly address martin retaliation claim,nor did it address martin procedural due process claim arising from his alleged loss of the opportunity to earn good time credits.
martin filed an objection to the report and recommendation on january.in his objection,martin specifically requested to be allowed to proceed with discovery on his equal protection claim,again alleging that the unequal treatment he experienced was the result of intentional and purposeful discrimination.and though martin did not specifically set out his other claims in his objection,martin attached an amended complaint to his objection restating his due process claim relating to his allegedly improper segregation without a hearing and his first amendment retaliation claim,recounting the facts in a substantially similar manner as his first complaint.
after conducting a de novo review,the district court affirmed the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and dismissed martin complaint without prejudice on january.martin timely filed a notice of appeal.
as an initial matter,we must determine whether this court may properly exercise appellate jurisdiction over martin case.duffy argues that we lack jurisdiction to entertain martin appeal for two reasons first,because martin waived his right to appellate review when he failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation concluding that martin failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted and second,because the district court dismissal of martin complaint without prejudice is not a final and appealable order.we will discuss both of these contentions in turn.
a plaintiff is deemed to have waived an objection to a magistrate judge report if he do es not present his claims to the district court.united states benton,cir.failure to raise an argument before the district court typically results in the waiver of that argument on appeal.in order to preserve for appeal an issue in a magistrate judge report,a party must object to the finding or recommendation on that issue with sufficient specificity so as reasonably to alert the district court of the true ground for the objection.united states midgette,cir.even so,when confronted with the objection of a pro se litigant,we must also be mindful of our responsibility to construe pro se filings liberally.see erickson,at.
as set out earlier,although martin identified only his equal protection claim in his objection to the magistrate report and recommendation,martin also attached an amended complaint that restated all of his claims with the exception of his due process claim relating to his alleged loss of the opportunity to accrue good time credits.because we must liberally construe martin objection and martin presented to the district court anew in the attached amended complaint his claims of first amendment retaliation,equal protection,and due process relating to his segregation,we conclude martin sufficiently alerted the district court that he believed the magistrate judge erred in recommending dismissal of those claims.however,because martin did not incorporate his due process claim regarding his loss of the opportunity to earn good time credits in his objection or amended complaint,we find that martin has waived the right to challenge on appeal the dismissal of that claim.
we further conclude that the district court dismissal of martin complaint without prejudice did not deprive this court of jurisdiction to decide martin appeal.article iii courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,possessing only the authority granted by congress and the constitution.united states ex rel.lutz united states,cir.generally,a party may only appeal an order that is final,that is,nothing remains for the district court to do except execute the judgment.id.at citing mohawk,carpenter.because a n order which dismisses a complaint without expressly dismissing the action is generally not an appealable order,a plaintiff generally may not appeal the dismissal of his complaint without prejudice.domino sugar sugar workers local union,cir.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting ruby sec y of the navy,cir.however,a district court dismissal of a plaintiff complaint without prejudice will not bar the plaintiff appeal when the grounds for dismissal clearly indicate that no amendment to the complaint could cure the defects in the plaintiff case.id.at quoting coniston vill.of hoffman estates,cir.thus,in assessing whether the district court dismissal of martin complaint constitutes a final,appealable order,we must evaluate the particular grounds for dismissal in martin case to determine whether martin could save his action by merely amending his complaint.id.at see also chao rivendell woods,cir.interpreting domino sugar to require an appellate panel to examine the appealability of a dismissal without prejudice based on the specific facts of the case in order to guard against piecemeal litigation and repetitive appeals.
on the specific facts before us,we find that the district court dismissal order qualifies as an appealable order because martin can not save his action by merely amending his complaint.regarding the first amendment retaliation claim,in particular,martin and duffy agree that the district court did not address that claim in its order dismissing martin complaint without prejudice.although a district court failure to address a claim may foreclose appellate review of that claim,courts have found that an order that fails to explicitly address or dispose of all claims presented to the court may nevertheless qualify as a final,appealable order i f the language used in the order is calculated to conclude all the claims before the district court,munson,hajjar,cir.citing armstrong trico marine,cir,or where the district court obviously was not trying to adjudicate fewer than all the pleaded claims,computervision,cir.quoting lockwood wolf,cir.see also moreau harris county,cir.a judgment reflecting an intent to dispose of all issues before the district court is final.
although the magistrate judge did not analyze martin retaliation claim within the framework this court has set out for evaluating first amendment retaliation claims,see infra part,the magistrate judge looked to this court precedent in adams rice,cir,for the proposition that the constitution creates no entitlement to grievance procedures or access to any such procedure voluntarily established by a state,at,as well as virginia,supp,in which a district court in this circuit held that a prison official failure to comply with the state grievance procedure is not actionable under section,supp.at.the district court thereafter affirmed the magistrate judge analysis of the applicable case law.
when the district court rendered its decision,adams had been construed by district courts in this circuit to preclude claims by inmates alleging prison officials retaliated against them for filing grievances.see,pearson simms,supp,boblett angelone,supp,concluding that,under adams,a state grievance procedure does not confer any substantive right upon prison inmates,and holding that retaliation for lodging complaints via a grievance procedure does not state a retaliation claim,which requires that the retaliation come in response to the exercise of a fundamental right.accordingly,we conclude that the magistrate judge invocation of adams and its progeny and the district court affirmance of the magistrate report and recommendation made clear that the court intended its order to dispose of martin first amendment retaliation claim on grounds that adams foreclosed such claims as a matter of law.therefore,because the district court order clearly preclude d amendment,we may review martin retaliation claim.goode cent.legal aid soc y,cir.holding that appellate panel lacked jurisdiction where district court grounds for dismissal in this case did not clearly preclude amendment.
second,martin reformulation of his equal protection claim in his amended complaint marked his third attempt to state a claim for an equal protection violation.in particular,in addition to his original complaint and the amended complaint that martin attached to his objection,martin earlier in filed a substantially similar action in the same district court alleging virtually identical facts that was likewise dismissed without prejudice.see martin duffy,cv,wl,affirming magistrate judge report and recommendation and dismissing martin complaint without prejudice martin duffy,wl,at june,recommending that complaint be dismissed without prejudice because martin fail ed to plead facts that would support a plausible equal protection claim see also martin duffy,app x cir.per curiam concluding that deficiencies in martin complaint could be remedied by filing an amended complaint and dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction.such repeated,ineffective attempts at amendment suggest that further amendment of the complaint would be futile.see united states ex rel.willard humana health plan of,cir.finding that allowing plaintiff a third chance to amend would prove futile where plaintiff had two opportunities to amend his complaint and there was no indication that he would be able to allege the necessary elements of a fraud claim.as district courts have thrice concluded that martin has been unable to allege sufficient facts to establish a viable claim under the equal protection clause,we find that martin pleading deficiency can not be cured by amendment of his complaint.accordingly,we maintain jurisdiction to review the dismissal of martin equal protection claim.see domino sugar,at.
finally,regarding martin procedural due process claim stemming from his placement in segregation,the magistrate judge dismissed that claim not because martin failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim,but because,as a matter of law,south carolina law confers no protected liberty interest upon inmates from being classified or being placed in administrative segregation.and the district court summarily affirmed the magistrate judge report and recommendation,finding that the magistrate judge report accurately summarized the applicable law and martin case.therefore,by adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court order clearly preclude d martin from amending his complaint to correct any pleading inadequacy relating to that claim.see goode,at.thus,we may also review martin procedural due process claim.
in sum,the district court dismissal of martin complaint without prejudice is a final and appealable order.
on appeal,martin argues that the district court erred in failing to address his first amendment retaliation claim and in dismissing his remaining claims pursuant to e b ii,which provides that a court shall dismiss a prisoner case at any time if the court determines that the action or appeal fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.the standards for reviewing a dismissal under section e b ii are the same as those for reviewing a dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.angelone,cir.therefore,we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to section e b ii de novo.moore bennette,cir.
a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless after accepting all allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff favor,it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.veney wyche,cir.quoting edwards city of goldsboro,cir.additionally,l iberal construction of the pleadings is particularly appropriate where,as here,there is a pro se complaint raising civil rights issues.smith smith,cir.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting loe armistead,cir.nonetheless,w e are not required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory,unwarranted deductions of fact,or unreasonable inferences.veney,at quoting sprewell golden state warriors,cir.
with these principles in mind,we now turn to the question of whether martin complaint sufficiently alleged cognizable claims for first amendment retaliation,denial of equal protection,and denial of procedural due process regarding his placement in segregation.
martin first complains that duffy violated his first amendment rights by repris ing,harass ing,and retaliat ing against him simply because he had attempted to informally resolve a grievance.in order to state a colorable retaliation claim under section,a plaintiff must allege that he engaged in protected first amendment activity,the defendant took some action that adversely affected his first amendment rights,and there was a causal relationship between his protected activity and the defendant conduct.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.see also hill lappin,cir.citing blatter,cir.en banc outlining substantially similar elements for a first amendment retaliation cause of action by an inmate alleging retaliation for filing grievances against prison staff.based on the facts martin has alleged in his complaint,we conclude that martin has stated a plausible first amendment retaliation claim against duffy.
first,martin has sufficiently alleged that he engaged in protected first amendment activity.constantine,at.the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances,kirby city of elizabeth city,cir.quoting const.amend.i,and the supreme court has recognized that prisoners retain this constitutional right while they are incarcerated,turner safley,p risoners retain the constitutional right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.in his complaint,martin stated that he filed an electronic kiosk message against a prison sergeant for inappropriate and unwanted touching battery.thus,by alleging that he filed a grievance against a sergeant for battery,martin has sufficiently pleaded that he engaged in protected conduct see watison carter,cir.the filing of an inmate grievance is protected conduct.herron harrison,cir.an inmate has an undisputed first amendment right to file grievances against prison officials on his own behalf.
second,martin has adequately pleaded that duffy placement of martin in segregation adversely affected his first amendment rights.constantine,at.f or purposes of a first amendment retaliation claim under section,a plaintiff suffers adverse action if the defendant allegedly retaliatory conduct would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness from the exercise of first amendment rights.id.at quoting washington county of rockland,cir.a plaintiff actual response to the retaliatory conduct is not dispositive of the question of whether such action would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness.id.here,martin alleged that,after he filed his grievance,duffy placed him inside of the administrative building holding cell and placed him on segregation after she questioned him relentlessly about an informal resolution attempt of the grievance he had filed the day before.further,martin alleged that he remained in segregation for days before being allowed to return to the general prison population.certainly,placing an inmate in administrative segregation could deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his first amendment rights.herron,at quoting holden,wl,at cir,unpublished table disposition see also watison,at finding that placement in administrative segregation constitutes an adverse action allah seiverling,cir.finding that plaintiff confinement in administrative segregation resulting in reduced access to amenities and programs would allow a fact finder to conclude that placement in administrative segregation amounted to an adverse action.accordingly,martin has sufficiently alleged that duffy took adverse action against him by confining him in segregation.
lastly,we find that martin has likewise sufficiently alleged that duffy retaliatory act of placing him in segregation was taken in response to the exercise of a constitutionally protected right.adams,at.again,in his complaint,martin alleged that,o n the morning of september,duffy placed him in segregation after she questioned him relentlessly about an informal resolution attempt of the grievance martin had filed the day before.martin allegation that duffy took this adverse action the day after he filed a grievance against a prison sergeant,as an act of reprisal,satisfies the third element necessary to state a retaliation claim.see also watison,at finding that plaintiff alleged a sufficient connection between defendants retaliatory actions and plaintiff protected activity where plaintiff alleged defendants took the adverse actions shortly after,and i n retaliation for,plaintiff filing of grievances against one of the defendants second alteration in original.
accordingly,martin has made out a prima facie claim of first amendment retaliation,having alleged that he engaged in protected conduct by filing a grievance,petitioning for a redress of grievances that he was subsequently placed in segregation a placement that might deter a person of ordinary firmness from filing grievances and that his protected activity and duffy decision to place him in segregation were causally linked.
duffy argues that even if martin pleaded sufficient facts to state a first amendment retaliation claim,she is entitled to qualified immunity.under section,courts are directed to dismiss a case at any time if the court determines that the action or appeal seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.e b iii emphasis added.because we may affirm the dismissal by the district court on the basis of any ground supported by the record even if it is not the basis relied upon by the district court,ostrzenski seigel,cir,and because martin pleadings are adequately developed for us to decide the issue,we now turn to duffy qualified immunity defense
