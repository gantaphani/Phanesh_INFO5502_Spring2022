opinion of the court 
the prison litigation reform act plra,imposes quantitative limits on the amount of attorney fees a court may award a plaintiff who prevails in a civil rights action that he filed while incarcerated.see d plra fee caps or fee caps.the plra does not,however,impose similar limits on the amount of attorney fees a court may award such a plaintiff who filed suit while not incarcerated.this case requires us to determine whether the plra fee caps unconstitutionally deny prisoners equal protection of the law,and,if they do not,to review the district court application of the fee caps.
the district court held that the plra fee caps are constitutional.we will affirm the district court judgment,including its application of the fee caps.
while glenndol parker was a prisoner in the pennsylvania correctional facility at which joseph conway was a guard,parker filed a lawsuit against conway,pursuant to,alleging that conway assaulted him in violation of the eighth amendment.the district court appointed counsel to represent parker.the case proceeded to trial and a jury found for parker,awarding him in total damages.parker then filed a motion for attorney fees,seeking a total of.

d attorney fees 
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized by virtue of the plaintiff having prevailed in a action,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation 
whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph,a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney fees awarded against the defendant.if the award of attorney fees is not greater than percent of the judgment,the excess shall be paid by the defendant.
no award of attorney fees in an action described in paragraph shall be based on an hourly rate greater than percent of the hourly rate established under section of title for payment of counsel.
parker argued to the district court that the plra fee caps unconstitutionally discriminate against successful prisoner litigants because b,which governs an attorney fee award made to a prevailing civil rights plaintiff who was not incarcerated at the time he filed suit,requires only that the award be reasonable.therefore,parker contended,the court should not use the fee caps to compute his attorney fee award.conway disagreed.conway also argued that the provision requiring a court to apply a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent to satisfy the attorney fee award compels the court to apply the full percent whenever the attorney fee award is greater than percent of the judgment,as it is in this case.

subsection d of the plra limits a prevailing attorney fee award to percent of the judgment,and subsection d independently limits the attorney fee award to percent of the lodestar amount hours worked multiplied by hourly rate with an hourly rate equal to the hourly rate the criminal justice act cja authorizes for criminal defense attorneys.further,subsection d also requires the court to apply some portion of the judgment not to exceed percent to satisfy the attorney fee award.
parker appeal is an equal protection challenge to the plra fee caps.he asserts that congress decision to impose these numerical caps on the attorney fees that a court may award a successful civil rights plaintiff who filed suit while not on the attorney fees that a court may award such a plaintiff who filed suit while not prisoners equal protection of the law 
parker concedes that his equal protection challenge to the plra fee caps implicates rational basis review.see,parker br.r ational basis review requires merely that the statute be rationally related to a legitimate government objective.tenafly eruv ass borough of tenafly,cir.the supreme court has explained just how much freedom a legislature has in enacting a statute to which rational basis review applies 
the distinctions drawn by a challenged statute must bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state end and will be set aside as violative of the equal protection clause only if based on reasons totally unrelated to the pursuit of that goal.legislatures are presumed to have acted constitutionally even if source materials normally resorted to for ascertaining their grounds for action are otherwise silent,and their statutory classifications will be set aside only if no grounds can be conceived to justify them.with this much discretion,a legislature traditionally has been allowed to take reform one step at a time,addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind,and a legislature need not run the risk of losing an entire remedial scheme simply because it failed,through inadvertence or otherwise,to cover every evil that might conceivably have been attacked.

parker argues that congress prisoner versus classification does not rationally relate to any legitimate government objective.
parker is not the first equal protection challenge to the plra fee caps to come before us.in collins montgomery county board of prison inspectors,cir en banc,this court,sitting en banc,divided equally over whether the fee cap limiting an attorney fee award to percent of the judgment irrationally discriminates against prisoners,and we did not reach the merits of the equal protection challenge to the other limiting provisions.id.at 
every other court of appeals to address challenges to any or all of the plra fee caps in a precedential opinion,however,has rejected the challenges.see,royal kautzky,cir riley kurtz,cir johnson daley,cir en banc jackson state bd.of pardons and paroles,cir robinson hager,cir foulk charrier,cir walker bain,cir hadix johnson,cir boivin black,cir madrid gomez,cir.we join them.this litany of court of appeals precedent offers multiple legitimate government objectives on which we could focus.one such government objective will suffice,however.see mcdonald,at.
congress could have legitimately intended to reduce the variability in attorney fee awards.johnson,at.congress could have rationally believed that reasonableness,d a,and proportionality,d b i,are qualitative standards that may vary from district court to district court.see id.at.use of these qualitative standards alone therefore ensures inconsistency.id.a numerical cap is not susceptible to as much interpretive variation as these qualitative standards are.thus,congress rationally could the ground of equitable treatment a quantitative rule should supplement a qualitative one id.at.further,it is not cons
