opinion of the court 
appellant willard buskirk sued his employer,apollo metals,claiming discrimination in violation of title i of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.stat.ann.et.buskirk also raised a common law claim of tortious interference with contractual relations arising out of the termination of his settlement negotiations with apollo metals workers compensation insurance carrier,the pma insurance group.
at the conclusion of buskirk presentation of his at trial,the district court granted apollo metals rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law and entered judgment for apollo metals on all remaining counts of buskirk complaint.the district court concluded that buskirk could not recover under his regarded as disabled claim because regarded as plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable accommodation.the district court alternatively found that even were apollo metals required to provide reasonable accommodations,it did so.finally,the district court concluded that apollo metals was in a privileged position to interfere with buskirk settlement negotiations with pma.
buskirk challenges all of the above conclusions.he also contends that the district court abused its discretion in limiting the testimony of one of his experts and in sustaining apollo metals objection to a communication between apollo metals counsel and its insurance provider.
backgrounda.facts 
buskirk was hired by apollo metals in.he held a number of positions there throughout his employment,including slitter helper,polisher,finish helper,box maker,and.
on february,buskirk injured his back when he slipped on ice and fell in apollo metals parking lot on his way to work.after taking two days off to recover,buskirk returned to work and continued to work until june.his back injury prevented him from returning to the position of a box maker,the job he held prior to the injury.instead,apollo metals placed buskirk in light duty positions,such as buff building,quality control,and sample cutting.throughout that time period,buskirk received treatment for his back injury from several doctors as well as a chiropractor.
in june,buskirk doctors advised him to discontinue working entirely in order to rest his back and buskirk did so until october.during this leave of absence,buskirk filed a workers compensation claim and received partial benefits.on october,buskirk returned to work at apollo metals in light duty positions,working less than a full work week.in addition to the reduced hours,apollo metals allowed buskirk to leave work early on occasion so that he could attend aquatic therapy sessions.buskirk testified that he still experienced pain in the light duty jobs but that he was able to work through it.buskirk further testified that he only once complained of his back pain to any of his supervisors,and that was in february soon after the accident when he had to leave work early due to his pain.in response to occasional inquiries by his supervisors,he replied that he was having a little bit of pain,but was putting up with it.app.at.throughout this period,buskirk continued to receive medical treatment and underwent physical therapy,a work strengthening program,and a work hardening program.
on or about may,apollo metals terminated buskirk.in a letter to buskirk,apollo metals stated 
the reason for our decision is that you are not presently able and are not expected to be able to perform your former position,with or without reasonable accommodation,since you sustained your injury on february.you have missed considerable time due to a restricted work schedule and while undergoing treatment.since returning to work on september,you have been unable to perform the duties of a box maker.we had attempted to place you in other temporary positions which were consistent with your medical restrictions but had been periodically informed by you that even that work was too strenuous and could not be performed by you.
most recently you have been asked to perform light duty work.however,this work is not of a permanent nature and we can no longer offer that employment to you.
we have also received and reviewed documentation from your treating physicians concerning your prognosis.pollock advises that you will be unable to work at his present position as a box maker in the foreseeable future and kuhns has advised that you will not be able to resume work duties as a box maker due to your lower back condition.neither has suggested any accommodation to allow you to continue to be gainfully employed.
as we can not accommodate you within the box maker position or any other vacant position and have no position that meets your limited physical capabilities,we have no choice but to discontinue your employment.
buskirk was given this termination letter at a meeting with members of apollo metals management and two union representatives.deborah schnabel of the human resources department,the author of the letter,presided over the meeting and explained that buskirk was being terminated from apollo metals.buskirk union filed a grievance on his behalf,and as a result,apollo metals changed buskirk status so that he would no longer be considered terminated,but rather would be considered on a leave of absence allowing him to accrue workers compensation benefits.
on june,buskirk union presented apollo metals with a list of six different job classifications that it claimed buskirk was able to perform.on this same date,buskirk received a note from mark kuhns stating that his lifting restrictions were being increased to twenty pounds frequently,and to a maximum of thirty pounds occasionally and that buskirk could work eight hours a day,five days a week.however,apollo metals responded that although buskirk condition was improving,he still could not perform any work at apollo metals.apollo metals contends that it did not attempt to place buskirk in another position prior to december,because it believed buskirk had not received a full medical release to return to work until that date.on december,buskirk treating physician released him to work with a permanent restriction on lifting of forty pounds.app.at.after this date,buskirk was placed in the next available position consistent with his permanent forty pound lifting restriction,that of a polisher,on february.he remains in this position to this day.
buskirk union representatives took responsibility for informing buskirk of any vacancies at apollo metals and provided apollo metals with the results of buskirk medical evaluations throughout this time period.buskirk contends that he was medically released to full work no later than march,when an evaluation by an independent medical examiner gave buskirk a release to return to,medium work with a weight restriction of fifty more generous than the december,medical report.however,a medical evaluation entered by buskirk treating physician one day later,march,stated that buskirk continues to improve but is not yet ready to return to regular work.app.at.
prior to his reinstatement,buskirk negotiated a settlement of his workers compensation claim with pma for,a figure that largely represents future lost earnings.after apollo metals reinstated buskirk,pma discontinued settlement negotiations and the agreement was not executed.
procedural history 
on january,shortly before his reinstatement,buskirk filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging disability discrimination in violation of the ada and phra,and tortious interference with a contract.in his complaint,buskirk alleged that he was a qualified person with a disability,and that apollo metals violated the ada and phra by not accommodating his disability and by unlawfully terminating him.
upon completion of discovery,apollo metals filed a motion for summary judgment.in response,buskirk alleged that even if he did not have an actual disability an impairment that substantially limited major life activities,he was nevertheless disabled under the ada because apollo metals regarded him as disabled because he had a record of impairment.
the district court granted apollo metals motion in part and denied it in part.see buskirk apollo metals,d.the district court granted the motion with respect to buskirk claims that were based on actual disability and record of impairment.the district court concluded that buskirk was not actually disabled under the statute because he had failed to prove that he was substantially limited in a major life activity by his physical impairment.id.at.the district court also concluded that buskirk had not proven that he had a record of impairment that substantially limited a major life activity,another category of disability under the ada.id.however,the court denied the motion with respect to buskirk claim that he was regarded as disabled,finding that genuine issues of material fact existed to support a conclusion that apollo metals erroneously regarded buskirk as disabled.id.at.the district court also denied the motion with respect to the tortious interference claim,concluding that apollo metals had introduced no evidence to support a finding of an underlying financial interest to support a privilege to interfere.id.at.
a jury trial began on august,and two days later,buskirk concluded the presentation of his case.at that point,apollo metals moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.after hearing argument on the motion,the district court granted the motion,concluding that an employer is not obligated to provide reasonable accommodations to an employee who is regarded as disabled but is not actually disabled.the district court went a step further and found that even were apollo metals required to reasonably accommodate buskirk,it did so.finally,the district court found that buskirk did not present sufficient evidence from which a jury could find apollo metals liable for tortious interference.
buskirk timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over the grant or denial of a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.rule a provides 
if during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue,the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that can not under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.
a district court should grant this motion only if viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference,there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.lightning lube,witco,cir.a directed verdict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.mcdermott int l,wilander,d.we apply the same standard as the district court.
discussiona.ada phra 
the supreme court recently has stated that the primary purpose of the ada is to diminish or to eliminate the stereotypical thought processes,the thoughtless actions,and the hostile reactions that far too often bar those with disabilities from participating fully in the nation life,including the workplace.us airways,barnett,d.in order to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada and phra a plaintiff must establish that has a disability,is a qualified individual,and has suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability.gaul lucent techs,cir.
regarded as disabled 
the ada defines disability,the first requirement of a discrimination case,as,
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
because buskirk does not appeal the district court rejection of his claim of an actual disability or record of impairment,this appeal focuses solely on the third category of disability,that of being regarded as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.
the regulations addressing this category of disability define an individual who is regarded as having such an impairment as one who,
has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation 
has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitude of others toward such impairment or 
has none of the impairments defined in paragraph h or of this section but is treated by a covered entity as having a substantially limiting impairment.
l.buskirk claim is grounded in the first definition because he argues that he had a physical impairment that limited his ability to perform some work,but did not substantially limit any major life activities,and that apollo metals regarded that impairment as one that limited major life activities.
in order to determine whether apollo metals regarded buskirk as disabled,we must consider the information apollo metals had regarding buskirk condition and its response to that information.in olson general electric astrospace,cir,we held that a reasonable factfinder could have found that the employer perceived the employee to be disabled where the evidence showed that a supervisor knew of the employee illness and hospitalizations and that this knowledge factored into its hiring decision.e ven an innocent misperception based on nothing more than a simple mistake of fact as to the severity,or even the very existence,of an individual impairment can be sufficient to satisfy the statutory definition of a perceived disability.deane pocono med,cir en banc.further,in another regarded as case,we held that the analysis focuses not on the plaintiff and his actual disabilities,but rather on the reactions and perceptions of the persons interacting or working with him.kelly drexel,cir stating that the mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee impairment is insufficient to demonstrate that the employer regarded the employee as disabled.
i n general,an employer perception that an employee can not perform a wide range of jobs suffices to make out a regarded as claim.taylor pathmark stores,cir.in taylor,we concluded that taylor employer regarded taylor as disabled due to its conclusion,based on a mistaken interpretation of his medical records,that taylor was unable to perform a wide range of jobs,not just his previous position.see id.in that case,we stated that if an impairment at a certain level of severity would constitute a disability,then it follows that an employer who perceives an employee as having such an impairment perceives the employee as disabled.see also sutton united air lines,d stating that a regarded as plaintiff is required to show that the employer regards him or her as unable to work in a broad class of jobs.
here,apollo metals terminated buskirk because it believed that buskirk was not presently able and not expected to be able to perform his former position,with or without reasonable accommodation,since he sustained his injury,and that it had no position that meets his limited physical capabilities.app.at.the company was familiar with buskirk injury and medical treatment and surmised that he was unable to perform any work.several vacancies in positions other than a box maker became available after buskirk release from work and apollo metals concluded that buskirk was unable to work in any of those positions.in a letter to the union dated july,schnabel wrote that a lthough buskirk condition has shown improvement through increased lifting capacity,there still exists a concern about his ability to perform any of the job classifications.the job classifications state lifting requirements but also general physical activity.app.at.these perceptions support buskirk contention that apollo metals regarded him as disabled.
moreover,on appeal apollo metals no longer appears to dispute that it regarded buskirk as disabled but instead focuses its argument on its obligations to a regarded as employee.because the evidence shows that apollo metals perceived buskirk to be unable to perform any of its positions based on his medical condition,buskirk presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the first prong of a discrimination case under the ada and phra.
qualified individual 
in order to pass the second prong of the test for disability discrimination,a plaintiff must prove that is a qualified individual.qualified individual is defined as one who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.the eeoc regulations divide this inquiry into two parts whether the individual has the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements of the position sought,and whether the individual,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of that position.m.
neither party disputes that buskirk satisfied the first part of the inquiry in that he had the qualifications to perform the positions sought.additionally,both parties agree that buskirk could not return to his former position as a box maker and thus could not perform the essential functions of that job without reasonable accommodation.buskirk claims that the reasonable accommodation that he requested,and to which he was entitled,was transfer upon vacancy to one of the six positions listed in the union june letter.
the ada provides that reasonable accommodations include,inter alia,job restructuring,or modified work schedules,and reassignment to a vacant position.b.the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is subject to certain limitations.for example,an employer is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation if it would impose an undue hardship,p,if it would pose a direct threat to the safety of the employee or others,b,see chevron echazabal,d,or if to do so would conflict with seniority rules,see us airways,barnett,d.
however,the courts of appeals are divided as to whether the employer is obliged to provide reasonable accommodations to a regarded as plaintiff,and we have not answered the question directly once again,we will reserve the answer to this question for a future case because,as we explain forthwith,we conclude that apollo metals provided buskirk with reasonable accommodations.having reached this conclusion,we need not answer the difficult question of whether apollo metals was obligated to do so.
reasonable accommodations 
apollo metals provided buskirk with a series of light duty assignments,medical leaves of absence,and reduced hours from the date of his original injury in february through his termination on may.by may,apollo metals had provided these light duty positions and reduced hours for almost fifteen months.although apollo metals initially terminated buskirk,after negotiation of a grievance filed on behalf of buskirk by his union,apollo metals eventually changed buskirk status to that of a leave of absence,during which period buskirk was entitled to receive workers compensation benefits.
the ada does not require an employer to create a new position to accommodate an employee with a disability.see shiring runyon,cir interpreting analogous section of rehabilitation act.nor is an employer required to transform a temporary light duty position into a permanent position.see mengine runyon,cir interpreting analogous section of rehabilitation act.buskirk does not dispute that apollo metals need not have created such a position,but argues that there were vacancies in less strenuous positions to which he should have been transferred after may,the date of the letter that stated he was being terminated.
however,prior to the medical release on december,buskirk own doctors stated that he could not return to permanent work.his treating physician,barry pollack,stated on september,that buskirk could only perform light duty work for four hours a day and that he was limited to lifting no more than ten pounds,and reiterated these limitations on october.none of the doctors notes written prior to the termination in may changed to leave of absence stated that he could perform,permanent work.
the medical reports that were issued subsequent to the may letter were not entirely consistent in their articulation of buskirk limitations,but together they demonstrate that buskirk did not receive medical leave to return to regular work before december.on june,buskirk chiropractor,mark kuhns,wrote that buskirk work restrictions had been lightened and that he could lift a maximum of thirty pounds occasionally,twenty pounds frequently,and could work eight hours a day,five days a week.although this evaluation showed signs of improvement,apollo metals advised the union by letter on july,there still exists a concern about his ability to perform any of the job classifications.the job classifications state lifting requirements but also general physical activity.since buskirk does not have a full release his status remains as worker s compensation leave.app.at.
buskirk argues that he was released to work on march,when dane wukich,an independent medical examiner,determined that buskirk was capable of returning to medium work and was capable of working full time with the restriction of pounds.app.at.however,buskirk was examined one day later by his treating physician,pollack,who stated that buskirk continues to improve but is not yet ready to return to regular work.app.at.pollack did not release buskirk to return to work until december,when he wrote that buskirk was released with a lb.lifting limit.this is a permanent restriction.app.at.after receiving this release,apollo metals placed buskirk in the first vacancy that arose in one of the less strenuous positions he requested,thereby reasonably accommodating buskirk in a position for which he was physically qualified arguably,the evidence shows that buskirk did not meet the second prong of the eeoc definition of a qualified individual,but the parties have focused instead on the obligation to provide accommodation.
nor could a reasonable jury conclude that apollo metals did not engage in the interactive process with buskirk.from the date of injury until the date that buskirk resumed working at apollo metals,representatives of apollo metals frequently communicated with buskirk union representative,thomas novack,regarding buskirk ability to return to work.novack testified that he was in an ongoing dialogue with apollo metals and that apollo metals cooperated with him in his efforts on behalf of buskirk.app.at.apollo metals allowed and expected novack to bid on vacancies on behalf of buskirk and evaluated buskirk ability to work in light of his medical evaluations as transmitted by buskirk or his union representatives.
buskirk argues that the question of whether apollo metals reasonably accommodated him is a question of fact that should have gone to the jury and was not appropriate for disposition on a rule motion.generally,the question of whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable is a question of fact.see hovsons,township of brick,cir.however,pursuant to rule,the district court should enter judgment as a matter of law i f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.here,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to buskirk,we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could not have found that apollo metals did not reasonably accommodate buskirk.in addition,because apollo metals has reinstated buskirk and no longer misperceives his medical condition,we see no need for any additional remedies.see deane,at if it turns out that a regarded as plaintiff who can not perform the essential functions of her job is not entitled to accommodation,he or she need not necessarily be without remedy.the plaintiff still might be entitled to injunctive relief against future discrimination.citations omitted.thus,whether or not apollo metals was required to provide buskirk with a reasonable accommodation,it did so and buskirk challenge under the ada fails
