opinion of the court 
ralph detz lost his job with greiner industries on november.detz subsequently convinced the social security administration ssa that,as of the date of his termination by greiner,he was disabled and unable to work.detz was awarded social security disability insurance ssdi,and he continues to collect those benefits.in detz brought an action against greiner alleging wrongful termination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.to establish a prima facie case under the adea and the phra,detz asserts that,at the time of his termination,he was qualified for the position he held at greiner and was capable of continuing to perform it.
the district court found that detz was judicially estopped from proceeding on his claim of age discrimination,due to his earlier statements to the ssa regarding his disability and inability to work,and granted summary judgment in favor of greiner on all claims.the issue before us is whether detz statements regarding his disability for ssdi purposes should preclude his subsequent claim that,for the purposes of the adea and the phra,he was qualified for his position at greiner and can thus pursue a wrongful termination action under the adea and phra.we hold that his failure to adequately reconcile the two contrary positions is fatal to his prima facie showing of age discrimination,and we will,therefore,affirm.
greiner industries,is a mechanical contractor and manufacturer located in mount joy,pennsylvania.as such,greiner work force engages in a variety of services throughout lancaster county,including welding,duct work,structural steel fabrication,and sand blasting.due to the cyclical nature of work in the construction industry,greiner periodically suffers downturns in its business and,in response,occasionally reduces the size of its work force.
ralph detz was employed by greiner industries on three separate occasions beginning in.each of these periods of employment ended when detz was let go due to downturns in greiner business.his last and most lengthy period of employment at greiner began in and ended with his layoff on november.detz usually was employed as a millwright on greiner road crew.in this capacity,his duties included installing,servicing,and repairing machinery welding steel for duct work installing duct work and insulation and setting up rigging to move construction equipment.according to detz,this position involved the use of machines and tools,the application of technical knowledge,significant amounts of walking,and frequent lifting and carrying of objects weighing over fifty pounds.in addition,he was often required to work overtime.
on december,detz injured his left hand and arm.despite several attempts to repair the damage through surgery,he continues to suffer from permanent nerve damage and weakness in his injured hand and arm.this injury rendered detz unable to perform his duties as a millwright,as they involved heavy lifting and manipulating equipment using both hands.according to detz,his injury is permanent,and it is neither improving nor worsening.
when employees are recovering from injuries,greiner typically assigns them to its tool room for light duty work,which includes processing shipments and delivering materials to other workers.employees remain in the tool room until they are able to return to their regular positions.pursuant to this practice,detz was placed in the tool room when he sought to return to work in april of.he remained there,taking time off for surgeries on at least two occasions,until october of,when he began to complain of harassment by the tool room supervisor.detz also asserted that greiner was failing to follow the medical restrictions placed on detz in the wake of his injury.although an internal investigation found that the claims were unsubstantiated,detz was moved to work in a temporary office trailer,where his duties involved copying and making deliveries.
greiner eliminated a total of positions between april and december of as a result of a downturn in business,through layoffs,retirements,and terminations for cause.detz was laid off on november.
on april,detz filed a disability report and an application for disability insurance benefits application with the ssa.the disability report contained information about his condition,his medical history,his usual activities,and the work he had been doing.on this report,detz described his disabling condition as loss of use of left hand and arm high blood pressure lung problems,depression.he indicated that he stopped working due to his condition on the date of his layoff.in response to a question asking the applicant to e xplain how his condition now keeps him from working,detz stated the following i ca lift over lbs.ca use left repetatively sic.i drop things easily with left hand.
later in the disability report,in describing the work he had previously done,he listed both his position as a millwright and his job in the tool room.however,when responding to subsequent questions asking the applicant to further describe the duties of his previous work,detz referred exclusively to his position as a millwright.for instance,he described his basic duties this way i welded steel for duct work and building construction.i set up rigging to move equipment.he went on to indicate that he spent eight hours a day walking,that he sometimes worked between ten and fourteen hours a day,that he carried rigging and duct work up to feet,and that he frequently lifted more than fifty pounds.he did not describe his duties in the tool room or in the temporary office trailer anywhere in the report.
his accompanying application for ssdi indicated that he became unable to work because of his disabling condition on the date of his termination,and that he was still disabled at the time of his application.the application,signed by detz,contains the following acknowledgment 
i know that anyone who makes or causes to be made a false statement or representation of material fact in an application or for use in determining a right to payment under the social security act commits a crime punishable under federal law by fine,imprisonment or both.i affirm that all information i have given in connection with this claim is true.
the ssa denied detz initial claim,finding that his disability did not keep him from working in the tool room.the ssa also refused his subsequent request for reconsideration,which again indicated that he was disabled and unable to work.
on november,detz requested a hearing before an administrative law judge,where he might introduce additional evidence in support of his application for ssdi.in requesting a hearing,detz asserted for the third time that he was disabled and unable to work.a senior staff attorney at the ssa reviewed detz application,as well as medical reports from several doctors who had examined detz.in a december,decision,the ssa granted detz application for ssdi,finding that detz had been disabled since the date of his layoff by greiner.the ssa arrived at its conclusion after applying the analysis used to determine ssdi eligibility see cleveland policy mgmt,d discussing the questions asked at each of the five steps.specifically,the ssa found,under steps four and five,that detz either ha d no past relevant work or was unable to perform the past relevant work,and that no occupations exist ed in significant numbers which detz could perform.see e f,b c.thus,detz was awarded ssdi benefits retroactively,beginning on november,and he currently continues to receive those benefits.on february,a final order confirming the ssa decision was entered on the issue of detz disability.
on january,detz filed complaints with the pennsylvania human relations commission phrc and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging age discrimination by greiner.in doing so,detz submitted a related questionnaire questionnaire to the phrc detailing the basis for his complaint.he indicated that prior to his termination he had been treated differently and harassed at work due to his age and his disability,which he described as loss of use of his left hand,and arm.he noted that the disability was permanent,but was not worsening,and that he received workers compensation after his injury.
in response to questions about his job,he described his work in the tool room,never mentioning,as he had on the ssdi application,the duties that accompanied his prior position as a millwright.he described the job in question as follows a tool room helper receives packages and shipments,unpacks materials and distributes them.also,a tool room helper may help get tools for other employees.i can do most duties within restrictions.the restrictions to which he refers were set by various doctors who treated his injury,and they include permanent limits on how much detz should lift.his complaint alleges that greiner refuse d to follow the restrictions.the following acknowledgment appears above detz signature on the phrc questionnaire i hereby verify that the statements contained in this complaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge,information,and belief.i understand that false statements herein are made subject to the penalties relating to unsworn falsification to authorities.
the eeoc eventually dismissed detz charges,as did the phrc,and detz was advised of his right to sue greiner.detz initiated this action in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania with a complaint filed on october,alleging violations of the adea,and the phra.in his first amended complaint,detz asserted that he was years old at the time of his discharge,and that he was replaced by someone who was under forty years old.he specifically alleged that he had performed in his position for over nine years and was fully qualified for the position.furthermore,he alleged that the circumstances surrounding his discharge demonstrated that the reason given by his employer for his termination lack of work was pretextual.detz sought various forms of relief,including damages and reinstatement.
greiner answer listed a number of affirmative defenses,one of which asserted that detz claims may be barred by the doctrine of estoppel.on july,greiner filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that detz was judicially estopped from establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination.specifically,according to greiner,detz was precluded from showing that he was qualified for the position from which he was discharged,because such an assertion is irreconcilably inconsistent with his earlier statements to the ssa that he was unable to work,offered in support of his claim for ssdi benefits.
in opposing the motion for summary judgment,detz attempted to reconcile the two positions.according to detz,he became disabled,for ssdi purposes,by virtue of his discharge by greiner.before that,he was not disabled,as he had a job in the tool room and could perform that job.after that,he was disabled,because he was no longer allowed to continue performing that job,and he would not be able to find another job similarly tailored to his physical limitations.in other words,there was only one job in the economy that he was capable of performing the job in the tool room and the loss of that job rendered him disabled for ssdi purposes.he urged that he did,however,remain qualified for that one job for the purposes of the adea and the phra.
the district court,in an opinion and order issued on august,granted summary judgment in favor of greiner on both of detz claims.detz greiner,d.applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel,as we structured it in montrose medical group participating savings plan bulger,cir,the district court found that all three prongs of the analysis were satisfied,that the two positions were irreconcilably inconsistent,that detz had acted in bad faith,and that judicial estoppel was an appropriate remedy.detz,d at.in its discussion of the first prong,the court applied the rule from cleveland policy management systems,d,and found that while detz might have survived summary judgment if he had offered a sufficient explanation of the apparent inconsistency between his two positions,he failed to adequately reconcile the positions.detz,d at.the court also found that detz had taken the conflicting positions in bad faith,and that judicial estoppel was an appropriate remedy in this case.id.at.thus,the court held that detz was judicially estopped from claiming that he remained qualified for his previous work at greiner,and,therefore,he failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.id.at.
after the district court entered summary judgment against him,detz filed this timely appeal.
the district court had federal question jurisdiction over detz claim under the adea,and supplemental jurisdiction over his claim under the phra.see,a.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment.klein stahl gmbh.maschinefabrik,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists,and where,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.this is so where the plaintiff fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to her case,and on which she will bear the burden of proof at trial.cleveland,at.quoting celotex,at.
the case before us involves the application of judicial estoppel in the context of a motion for summary judgment.the district court was correct to note that we have applied a analysis to determine whether a party is judicially estopped from making certain assertions that are contrary to assertions he has made in the past.see,dam things from denmark russ berrie,cir listing three considerations in a judicial estoppel analysis montrose,at same krouse am.sterilizer,cir listing two main considerations in a judicial estoppel analysis ryan operations lumber,cir same.that test is concerned with whether the party positions are inconsistent,whether he has acted in bad faith,and whether judicial estoppel is an appropriate remedy that is tailored to address the harm caused to the integrity of the court.detz,d at.while this analysis is still appropriate in many types of cases,the supreme court has articulated the standard somewhat differently in considering its application to a set of facts resembling the ones we face here.see cleveland,at.see also motley state police,cir recognizing that cleveland provides the standard to be used when applying judicial estoppel in the context of a motion for summary judgment where the initial assertions were accepted by a court or agency.
in cleveland,the supreme court explained the method that courts should use in deciding whether a party,in the face of her own contrary assertions made in a prior proceeding,can make a preliminary showing sufficient to survive summary judgment in a subsequent case.there,the court was considering a case involving a plaintiff who was suing her employer for wrongful termination under the americans with disabilities act ada.cleveland,at.she had previously obtained ssdi benefits,claiming that she was totally disabled and unable to work.id.at.in pleading her prima facie case under the ada,she asserted that she was a qualified individual in other words,that she could perform the essential functions of her job,at least with reasonable accommodation.id.quoting the ada.
in deciding whether the plaintiff previous claim of total disability precluded her from subsequently claiming to be a qualified individual under the ada,the court applied judicial estoppel principles in terms that are familiar at the summary judgment stage.the court was convinced that pursuit,and receipt,of ssdi benefits does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ada claim.nor does the law erect a strong presumption against the recipient success under the ada.id.at.emphasis added.the court instructed,however,that when a defendant claims a bar based on previous inconsistent assertions,a plaintiff can not simply ignore her previous statements to the ssa.instead,in order to establish her prima facie case,she must explain why that ssdi contention is consistent with her subsequent assertion in connection with her ada claim.id.at.thus,the court essentially told us how to approach a claim of judicial estoppel in the summary judgment context.
upon deciding that the ssdi and ada claims did not inherently conflict to the point where courts should apply a special negative presumption,id.at,the court went on to explain how the facts of each particular case should be examined in order to determine whether a genuine conflict exists between the plaintiff contrary positions.id.at.the court first laid out the framework for basic summary judgment analysis,and then articulated the following standard 
when faced with a plaintiff previous sworn statement asserting total disability or the like,the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ada claim.to defeat summary judgment,that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror concluding that,assuming the truth of,or the plaintiff belief in,the earlier statement,the plaintiff could nonetheless perform the essential functions of her job,with or without reasonable accommodation.
id.at.in other words,a plaintiff could not simply ignore the apparent contradiction,or create a genuine issue of material fact simply by contradicting her own previous sworn statement.id.at.instead,a plaintiff in this position is required to offer a sufficient explanation,as described above.id.
the court also drew a distinction between conflicting legal positions and contradictory factual assertions.in concluding that a claim under the ada is not inherently inconsistent with a claim of disability for ssdi purposes,the court noted that a n ssa representation of total disability differs from a purely factual statement in that it often implies a legal conclusion,namely,i am disabled for purposes of the social security act.id.at.the court,therefore,limited the import of its decision to cases involving such legal conclusions,and permitted courts to proceed with the usual judicial estoppel analysis when evaluating conflicting statements that are purely factual.id.
after examining the explanation offered by the plaintiff in cleveland,the court concluded that she had adequately reconciled her two positions.id.she had done so by first pointing out the differences between the analyses conducted under the ssa and the ada the ada considers whether a person might be able to perform her job with reasonable accommodation,while that possibility is ignored when determining disability for ssdi purposes.id.additionally,she had indicated that her statements on her ssdi application were true when she originally made them.id.thus,the case was remanded so that she might survive summary judgment and proceed to trial to present her explanations,in sworn form where appropriate.id.
while cleveland only specifically addressed a conflict between ssdi and ada claims,the analysis is not limited in its application to cases involving those particular statutory and administrative schemes.like an assertion that one is a qualified individual for ada purposes,a declaration that one is a qualified individual under the adea is a legal conclusion.therefore,a prima facie showing under the adea that conflicts with earlier statements made to the ssa is subject to the same analysis,as the reasoning of the court in cleveland also applies in the context of the adea.in fact,the district court here properly observed that scenarios may exist in which it is possible for a plaintiff adea claim to be consistent with his or her earlier application for social security benefits.detz,d at.for example,a person who files for and is granted ssdi benefits several months after his discharge would not be precluded from advancing a successful adea claim against his employer where his disability did not prevent him from working at the time of his discharge,but where it subsequently worsened to a point where he is no longer able to perform that work.it is true that these scenarios might be less common with adea claims than they would be with claims under the ada,because the adea does not include any additional considerations for identifying qualified individuals that might be analogized to the reasonable accommodation language of the ada.id.at.this does not,however,render cleveland any less applicable to cases involving ssdi claims followed by attempts to establish the elements of a prima facie showing under the adea.
our sister courts of appeals that have addressed this issue in the wake of cleveland have uniformly recognized that their prior judicial estoppel analyses are to be replaced with the methodology articulated by the supreme court.see holtzclaw dsc communications,cir applying cleveland rather than typical judicial estoppel analysis in reviewing a ruling on a motion for summary judgment where the plaintiff original position was accepted by a court or agency eeoc mills,cir same lloyd hardin county,iowa,cir same parker columbia pictures,cir same feldman am.mem l life ins,cir same lee city of salem,cir applying the cleveland analysis in the context of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.we have similarly applied cleveland rather than our traditional judicial estoppel approach as the guiding force in the context of a summary judgment motion where,as here,the claimant clearly made a contradictory assertion after benefitting from a previous sworn assertion,the court or agency thus having accepted the previous assertion see motley,at.
so,we must determine whether a plaintiff assertions are genuinely in conflict,and then evaluate that plaintiff attempt to explain away the inconsistency.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has aptly explained what is required of a plaintiff under the cleveland analysis this way 
cleveland s analysis suggests that an ada plaintiff may not,simply by disavowing a prior claim of total disability,perform an and assert that he is a qualified individual who is capable of working.rather,the plaintiff must proceed from the premise that his previous assertion of an inability to work was true,or that he in good faith believed it to be true,and he must demonstrate that the assertion was nonetheless consistent with his ability to perform the essential functions of his job.
explanations of the sort cleveland requires are,in short,contextual they resolve the seeming discrepancy between a claim of disability and a later claim of entitlement to work not by contradicting what the plaintiff told the social security administration,but by demonstrating that those representations,understood in light of the unique focus and requirements of the ssa,leave room for the possibility that the plaintiff is able to meet the essential demands of the job to which he claims a right under the ada.
lee,at.and we were guided by a similar understanding of cleveland when we recently scrutinized an ada plaintiff attempt to reconcile two apparently inconsistent positions 
a n ada plaintiff must provide some additional rationale to explain his apparent concerning the extent of the injuries the additional justification presented by the plaintiff could,in theory,go into detail regarding the facts of his case,demonstrating how the differing statutory contexts makes their statements made under one scheme reconcilable with their claims under the other.
motley,at.again,although the analysis only directly refers to claims under the ada,the reasoning and conclusion apply with equal force to adea plaintiffs.
guided by cleveland and motley,the first question we must ask is whether the positions taken by detz in his ssdi application and his adea claim genuinely conflict.we answer this question on a basis,by examining the unique facts presented by detz claim.see motley,at.after considering the facts before us in the instant case,we conclude that the two positions taken by detz are truly inconsistent with one another.
in order to be disabled for ssdi purposes,an applicant must be incapable of performing his past relevant work,and he must be found unable to perform any other job existing in significant numbers in the nation economy.see d a e f,b c.on the other hand,in order to establish a prima fac
