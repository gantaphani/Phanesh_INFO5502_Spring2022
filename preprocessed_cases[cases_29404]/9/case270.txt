battista is anatomically male but suffers from gender identity disorder gid,a psychological condition involving a strong identification with the other gender.gid is a disorder recognized in the american psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.the diagnostic criteria include not only identification but also clinically significant distress or impairment in social,occupational,or other important areas of functioning.id.at.
in,battista changed her name to sandy and began to seek treatment from the department,including administration of female hormones and access to female garb.her early demands were met with skepticism and resistance in,a department consultant diagnosed her gid,but the department offered no further evaluation or treatment until.prior to this case,battista filed two suits seeking gid treatment and accumulated expert opinions confirming the seriousness of her condition and recommending accommodations including hormone therapy.
battista filed her complaint in the present suit in july and in october sought to castrate herself with a razor blade.the suit,against various officials of the department,charged deliberate indifference to her medical needs in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments and,as well as state law,including.laws ch.in particular,battista sought an injunction requiring that hormone therapy and female garb and accessories be provided to her.
in and around and,the department fenced with its own healthcare provider,the university of massachusetts correctional health program,which offered strong support for the gid diagnosis,asserted that harm could easily occur without adequate treatment,and recommended hormone therapy as medically necessary.the department instead hired another gender specialist,who then agreed that hormone treatment might be appropriate along with other therapy.
battista first request to the district court for a preliminary injunction was denied in march,with a finding that the defendants had not at this stage been shown to be deliberately indifferent to her medical needs.battista dennehy,dpw,wl,at.after the further medical assessments continued to recommend hormone therapy,the department stated that it would not implement treatments until security concerns were further evaluated.this proved to be a process.
in august,the first security review by the department concluded that a feminine appearance would endanger battista.the core security concern throughout has been that sexual contacts or assaults by other detainees would be made more likely by female clothing and accessories and the enhancement of breasts due to hormone therapy.the report,however,was fairly cursory,comprising only a few paragraphs,and in december the district court entered a preliminary injunction requiring psychotherapy,access to women attire and accessories,monthly reports on battista condition,and a recommendation on hormone therapy after a review.
in the report,the doctors again prescribed the hormones.a first dose was administered,but then the department put another indefinite hold on treatment pending a second security review.the september review again found the safety risk too high.this new report was more substantial although it more or less duplicated an earlier report prepared for an inmate who also had requested and been denied hormone therapy.its security evaluation is at the core of the department substantive objection to hormone therapy for battista.
although hormone therapy had been provided for gid to inmates of some male prisons,the september report included data gathered under the prison rape elimination act of prea,to argue that the risk of sexual assault was higher at the treatment center as compared to other facilities of the department,including prisons.the report noted that treatment center residents were sex offenders and that the treatment center had an open floor plan.it stressed battista past infractions and the inability to move her to another facility because of her civil commitment status.
a bench trial took place in june and august.in the course of the trial,battista offered an evaluation from psychiatrist george brown.he testified that battista was eligible and ready for hormonal treatment,that the past treatment for her gid falls below any reasonable standard of care,and that with a 
high degree of medical certainty when this patient loses hope again regarding access to appropriate care,she will engage in surgical by autocastration or will hire someone to do this for her.this could lead to an inadvertent death due to exsanguination.
on august,the court stated that it would enter a modified preliminary injunction order requiring hormone therapy to begin shortly.on august,the district court delivered a detailed oral decision,which recounted the history and made numerous findings in support of its injunction,applying the usual test for preliminary relief,iantosca step plan,cir likelihood of success,irreparable harm,balance of hardships on the opposing sides,public interest.
in its decision,the district court unqualifiedly required hormone therapy the injunction is styled as preliminary because both sides sought a ruling on implementation issues specifically,how restricted battista may be in her confinement which the district court now has under consideration but hormone therapy has now been definitively decreed.that directive was stayed by the district court pending appeal,as defendants requested,solely because the district court feared harm to battista if hormone therapy were begun and later stopped again.
the district court ultimate finding of deliberate indifference rests on several different subordinate findings,which can be recast and summarized under two headings first,that battista has an established medical need for hormone therapy,may suffer severe harm without it,and implicitly that such therapy is feasible despite safety concerns and second,that the defendants reliance on their administrative discretion in invoking and dealing with security concerns has been undercut by a collection of pretexts,delays,and misrepresentations.
the focus of this appeal is narrow.the department concedes that battista suffers from gid and needs treatment and that hormone therapy has been recommended as medically necessary but it says that security concerns reasonably underpin its refusal and contests the finding of deliberate indifference.because the individual defendants are sued only in their official capacity for injunctive relief and no damages are sought,qualified immunity is not an issue nor need the separate roles of individual defendants be sorted out 
defendants suggest that review is de novo the plaintiff,that it is essentially for abuse of discretion in the grant of preliminary relief.in truth,the standard of review varies depending on the precise underlying issue in the mosaic of arguments and.legal issues are open to de novo review,factual findings are reviewed for clear error,and judgment calls by the district judge may get deference depending on the circumstances.venegas hernndez asociacin de compositores y editores de msica latinoamericana acemla,cir.
the substantive standard for liability is a more complicated story.in the district court,the parties and the judge focused on the eighth amendment test used to assess medical care,or the lack o
