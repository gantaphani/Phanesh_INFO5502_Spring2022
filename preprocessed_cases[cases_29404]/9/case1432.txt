opinion of the court 
this case is an appeal from an interlocutory decision denying defendant joseph mercatili claim to qualified immunity.edward zaloga,who had been engaged in an ongoing feud with local government officials,publicly opposed mercatili reelection as the president of the moosic,pennsylvania borough council.mercatili allegedly retaliated against zaloga by seeking to damage his business interests.
zaloga brought this suit against several county entities and individuals,alleging various constitutional violations,including mercatili retaliation.the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania granted the defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to all defendants except mercatili.the court decided that mercatili claim to qualified immunity depended on disputed facts and would have to be resolved by a jury.
mercatili now appeals,arguing that he is entitled to qualified immunity because his conduct,even if zaloga allegations are true,did not violate clearly established law.we agree and will reverse and remand for the district court to grant summary judgment in mercatili favor.
background 
factual background 
the plaintiffs in this case are edward zaloga and correctional care,a medical company he owns and that provides contracted services to correctional facilities.zaloga borough of moosic.ca mwb docket item,at.zaloga resides in the borough of moosic in lackawanna county,pennsylvania.at all relevant times,lackawanna county,through the oversight of the lackawanna county prison board,has contracted with correctional care to provide medical services to the lackawanna county prison.
although the plaintiffs initially sued the borough of moosic,the borough council,the borough planning commission and zoning board,and various borough officers,the only remaining defendant is mercatili.the legal friction between zaloga and the borough originated in disputes between the zaloga family and a tire company that occupied a facility immediately adjacent to the zalogas home.frustrated by the borough handling of those disputes,zaloga launched political attacks on mercatili and john segilia the of the borough now deceased publically opposing their nominations for reelection to public office.
about a month later,the lackawanna county solicitor notified zaloga that the county intended not to continue its contractual arrangement with correctional care upon expiration of the contract term.the solicitor also said,however,that correctional care could compete with other health care providers in bidding for a new contract.it indeed did so,but zaloga attorney informed him that,according to conversations with a lackawanna county prison board member,segilia and mercatili were attempting to block correctional care contract renewal.shortly thereafter,a prison board member told zaloga that both segilia and mercatili were upset with zaloga persistent opposition to their decisions regarding the t ire facility and zaloga challenge to their nominating petitions,and that segilia and mercatili wanted the prison board member to oppose correctional care upcoming contract renewal,at.later,a second prison board member informed zaloga that segilia and mercatili contacted him and demanded that he also vote against the renewal of correctional care contract in exchange for their support for his,the board member political campaign,at.sometime between april and november,segilia and mercatili also approached john szymanski the lackawanna county sheriff and a prison board member and told him that they would support his campaign for only if he would oppose zaloga company contract renewal.emphasis in original.
the record contains several additional instances of segilia and mercatili purportedly applying political pressure on prison board members.the district attorney for lackawanna county,also a prison board member,averred that,when discussing correctional care contract renewal with segilia in,segilia indicated that he had a problem with zaloga because of his ongoing legal battle in moosic and because zaloga attempted to have segilia and mercatili thrown off the ballot.according to the district attorney,just prior to correctional care medical contract renewal,another prison board member told him that segilia and mercatili were angry at him for considering a vote in favor of renewing correctional care contract with the lackawanna county prison.the board member went on to express his personal concern that segilia and mercatili would either not support him or even work against him in his bid.the district attorney himself did not speak with mercatili until after the county had already renewed its contract with correctional care.
ultimately,the county unanimously voted to award correctional care a contract renewal,and the contract was renewed again in.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs filed their first complaint in,and subsequently amended it three times.count i of the third amended complaint alleges that the defendants retaliated in response to zaloga exercise of his first amendment rights.count ii says that the defendants violated the plaintiffs substantive due process and fourteenth amendment rights by interfering with the plaintiffs reputational,constitutional,and property rights.finally,counts iii and iv allege that the defendants conspired against the plaintiffs in violation of both and state common law.
after completion of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment on all counts against all defendants,except for counts i,iii,and iv against mercatili.as to mercatili,the court concluded that his assertion of qualified immunity hinged upon fact questions that would need to be settled by a jury.
mercatili appealed.
iv.discussion 
qualified immunity shields government actors from suit insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald.in saucier katz,the supreme court divided the analysis of qualified immunity into two parts first,a court considering qualified immunity must ask whether the alleged facts,taken in the light most favorable to the injured party,show that the government official conduct violated a constitutional right second,the court must ask whether the right was clearly established in light of the specific context of the case,and not as a broad general proposition.notwithstanding the sequence of the saucier questions,federal courts are permitted to exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.pearson callahan.summary judgment based on qualified immunity should be granted when the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful.saucier,at.
here,the district court erred in its consideration of the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis.we therefore do not need to decide whether mercatili actions could have violated zaloga constitutional rights,and we decline to do so.discussing the constitutionality of mercatili actions would require us to grapple with the tension between his first amendment right to speak and zaloga right to be free of government retaliation.because the law does not clearly address how to harmonize those competing interests,the second saucier prong is not met and any analysis addressing the first prong would be an essentially academic exercise.pearson,at.the doctrine of constitutional avoidance counsels against unnecessarily wading into such muddy terrain.id.at justifying resolving a dispute solely on the basis of the second prong due to older,wiser judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable internal quotation marks omitted.we thus move directly to an explanation of our conclusion with respect to the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis.
a.the clearly established standard 
the standard for qualified immunity is tilted in favor of shielding government actors and gives ample room for mistaken judgments by
