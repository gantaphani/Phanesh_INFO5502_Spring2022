this case arises from plaintiff kathleen burns claims of sex discrimination and sex harassment.burns worked for over ten years as a transportation security administration tsa employee in the boston field office of the federal air marshals service fams,where her primary role was scheduling international flights for the federal air marshals fams.she was considered an excellent employee,and the scheduling system she in part designed was recognized as a best practice for other field offices to follow.
in may,david johnson assumed the role of supervisory air marshal in charge sac at the boston field office and within weeks transferred burns flight assignment duties to a group of male employees.johnson also spoke to and interacted with burns in a way that burns asserts was hostile and unlike his treatment of male employees.this included johnson holding a baseball bat in what burns described as a swinging position in almost every interaction with her.
in late june,burns took early retirement.she then filed this suit against johnson and the department of homeland security dhs alleging,inter alia,violations of title vii of the civil rights act of.the district court dismissed johnson from the suit and later allowed summary judgment in favor of dhs.on appeal,burns argues that the district court erred by requiring her to present direct evidence to establish sex discrimination under the theory.we agree with burns.the district court also erred by requiring her to show that johnson conduct was severe and pervasive to establish sex harassment.furthermore,we conclude that under the correct legal frameworks,there is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could find in burns favor on both claims.we reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings 
on review of an order granting summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see tang citizens bank,cir.many of the facts are not in dispute,and we draw from them accordingly.
shortly after september,kathleen burns began working as a tsa employee in the boston field office of fams.burns was the only female employee in the operations unit and one of only five non law enforcement employees in the office.in addition to the fams,there were supervisory fams sfams,two assistant supervisory air marshals in charge asacs,and one sac,who was in charge of the entire office.burns was a program assistant in operations and the employee primarily responsible for international flight scheduling.fam abc was her.sfam james ouellette was her direct supervisor,and asac timothy was her supervisor.
the international scheduling system used in the office was in part burns creation.sfam ouellette was also involved in the system creation.asac stated in an affidavit that inspection teams had on two occasions noted that international planning and scheduling within the office was a best practice for other field offices to follow.sfam darin devine,who was involved with operations,testified in a deposition to the same.burns also regularly received high performance evaluations.
burns spent about percent of her time scheduling flights.she worked thursday,friday,saturday,and sunday from to,for a total of hours per week.asac stated in an affidavit that burns worked the night shift and filled a lot of holes that others did not want to work.burns preferred this alternative work schedule so that she could care for her five children.before his arrival,johnson knew about burns role in international flight scheduling,her alternative work schedule,and the reason for it.
on may,johnson assumed the role of sac at the boston field office.while in that role,johnson sometimes carried a louisville slugger baseball bat according to burns,every time she saw johnson in the office,he was carrying the bat.johnson sometimes held an unlit cigar in his mouth.
two pertinent incidents transpired between johnson and burns near the time of johnson arrival.during the first,johnson approached burns in the operations office and asked who are you and what do you do for me after burns answered,johnson turned around and walked out of the office.fam abc,who witnessed this,described johnson tone as demeaning and n ot like you would have a typical casual conversation.fam abc also testified in a deposition that johnson never asked him that question.the second incident occurred on may,when johnson approached burns and commented so you do still work here.he was carrying the bat.later that day,again holding the bat,johnson approached burns and said he had done his homework at headquarters on burns and that although everyone there spoke very highly of her and there were no complaints,he had some concerns because someone told him that she was sometimes hard to reach.burns replied that if a problem arose on her days off,she handled the issue either by or telephone.johnson said that he was not paying burns to work from home.burns replied that she never sought compensation for any additional overtime or work she completed outside of her regularly scheduled shifts.after this meeting,burns told her direct supervisor,sfam ouellette,that she felt uncomfortable because of the way johnson spoke with her and looked at her,and that she believed johnson used the bat against her as a method of intimidation.the parties dispute whether johnson was aware of burns complaints prior to the may,decision to change the international flight scheduling system.
on or before may,johnson decided to reassign international flight scheduling from burns to the sfams,who were all men.dhs argues that johnson made this decision for two reasons first,he wanted to create consistency with other fams field offices and,second,he wanted to foster leadership by the sfams.on june,during a weekly meeting,johnson discussed the new scheduling system.burns was not present.sfam ouellette defended the system burns had in part developed,and johnson referred to it as stupid.at some point johnson put his hand up to ouellette face as if motioning him to stop and stated i done it.i get it.johnson then got up and left the room.he returned approximately one minute later and was carrying the baseball bat.he then turned to face sfam ouellette and began to tap the baseball bat between his legs while staring down at sfam ouellette.when someone at the meeting asked,what the bat for johnson replied,things were getting a bit heated in here.
burns learned about the international flight scheduling change from sfam ouellette on may.burns testified in a deposition that she understood that under the new system she would be doing the data entry of the flight scheduling grid,into which the sfams would fill the information themselves.she felt this job would be degrading and that no intelligence was needed whatsoever.
after the changes had been announced,in early june,johnson approached burns when she was alone in the operations office.while holding the bat in a swinging position and often tapping it in his hand,johnson told burns how much better things were going to be,including that he would get new carpet for the office.when burns began to voice a concern about the flight scheduling change,johnson left the room.
at some point in june,burns spoke with an administrative officer ao about an early retirement program that was being offered.burns may have also inquired about the availability of early retirement the year before.on june,burns emailed sfam devine that she was retiring,that june would be her last day in the office,and that her retirement would be effective august.she made a formal complaint about johnson to her supervisor,sfam ouellette,on june he reported those concerns to burns supervisor,asac and asac reported them to johnson on june.
on july,burns made a complaint to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging that she was discriminated against and subjected to sic hostile work environment based on sex female and retaliation.she also filed a complaint with the tsa office of inspection,leading to an investigation into allegations against johnson for use of abusive,offensive,disrespectful,inflammatory or similarly inappropriate language,gesture,or conduct to or about other employees or members of the public f ighting,threatening,intimidating,attempting to inflict or inflict ing bodily harm on another harassing or provoking quarrel engaging in horseplay any violent,reckless,or disorderly act,language,gesture,or conduct and l ack of candor.after a investigation,on november,tsa circulated a report substantiat ing the above stated allegations and finding that it was inappropriate for johnson to carry a baseball bat in the office.tsa did not announce the decision to demote and transfer johnson to another field office until january and did not put the transfer into effect until about six weeks after that 
on august,burns filed a complaint in federal court,alleging,inter alia,gender discrimination count i and sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment count vi.she sought compensatory damages,including for emotional distress,multiple punitive damages,costs and attorney fees,and equitable relief.the defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss all but count i,which the court allowed except as to count vi,on may,see burns johnson,supp.after some discovery,dhs moved for summary judgment on all counts on december.on june,the court allowed the motion.burns johnson,wl,at.june.this appeal concerns only the sex discrimination and sex harassment claims

burns challenges the district court entry of summary judgment against her on her claims of sex discrimination and sex harassment.we address each claim in turn.
the district court concluded that burns sex discrimination claim failed under the classic mcdonnell douglas framework because she could not show johnson conduct was motivated by her sex,burns,wl,at,and under the theory because she lacked evidence with a high degree of assurance of discrimination,id.at quoting fernandes costa.masonry,cir,abrogated by desert palace,costa.dhs argues that burns also can not show that she has suffered an adverse employment action and so can not succeed under either mcdonnell douglas or the framework.
we disagree.as a threshold matter,it was error for the district court to expect that under the theory burns had to present direct evidence of discrimination,a standard that it invoked by reference to a portion of our decision in fernandes.id.quoting fernandes,at.a plaintiff is entitled to prove discrimination by circumstantial evidence alone.chadwick wellpoint,cir.see also desert palace,at holding that direct evidence of discrimination is not required to obtain a jury instruction.as such,we must consider the circumstantial evidence that burns has presented under both mcdonnell douglas and the theory.upon review of the record,we conclude that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude,first,that burns suffered an adverse employment action and,second,that the action was more probably than not caused by discrimination.chadwick,at.
adverse employment action 
dhs argues that burns can not show that she suffered an adverse employment action.an adverse employment action is one that affect s employment or alter s the conditions of the workplace.see potter,cir.alterations in original quoting burlington santa fe ry.white.the test for whether an employment action is adverse is whether it materially change s the conditions of plaintiffs employ.gu bos.police dep t,cir.the change must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities,at quoting marrero goya of,cir.r eassignment with significantly different responsibilities may be actionable.id.quoting burlington,ellerth.
burns asserts that the change to international flight scheduling left her with nothing but menial tasks and clerical duties.we gauge whether such a change is materially adverse by an objective standard.id.fam abc testified in a deposition that the international flight scheduling for which burns was responsible was if not the most important,the second most important,in my opinion,aspect of the operations unit.burns was one of the architects of the system she had ten years of experience in the office and she was recognized both inside and outside the boston field office for her work.the reduction transferred percent of her responsibilities to others and replaced a system she had in part designed.in these circumstances,a reduction from duties of such importance as those outlined here to performing clerical work is material.indeed,such changes are more dramatic than those that were accepted as an adverse action in rodriguez board of education,cir.there,the second circuit found a transfer of an art teacher from a junior high school to an elementary school to be an adverse action despite no change in salary,workload,or general subject taught,where the plaintiff previously spent many years teaching junior high school students and had graduate degrees in adolescent art education programs.see id.at see also id.at noting the district court description of the change as a severe professional trauma.
dhs does not seriously contest the conclusion that if such a reduction had happened to burns,it would qualify as an adverse employment action.rather,dhs argues as a factual matter that the new flight scheduling system was only a future change in her job duties which she did not stay long enough to experience.burns does not contend that a future adverse employment action is discrimination within the statute purview.see a.rather,burns argues that there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that her job responsibilities decreased significantly before she retired.
we agree with burns.the record contains deposition testimony from asac affirming his prior statement in an affidavit that burns was basically reduced to clerical duties,and that s he went from having a great deal of responsibility to answering telephone calls from fams.sfam devine,who was involved with operations,testified in a deposition that burns was assigned to menial tasks because all the other planning and whatnot was assigned to other people.from the context in which those questions were asked,and given the use of the past tense,a jury could reasonably interpret asac and sfam devine testimony to show that burns experienced a reduction in duties shortly following the announcement regarding the transfer of flight scheduling made in late may.indeed,despite ultimately bypassing the adverse employment action question,the district court specifically credited this testimony as support ing burns contention that her job responsibilities had decreased significantly.burns,wl,at.burns own deposition testimony further supports the conclusion that material changes occurred prior to june,as does a june,from sfam ouellette to everyone in operations stating that the sfams would return their scheduling grids by july.dhs points to burns admission that t he new assignment system was going to be implemented in july,starting with roster,and that u p until her last day in the office,june,plaintiff continued to work on international scheduling for rosters and.but those admissions are consistent with burns duties being significantly reduced before june and announced even earlier.there is no question that we must resolve all factual disputes in favor of the party on summary judgment.tang,at.a reasonable jury could find that burns duties were significantly reduced in june prior to her retirement.
dhs argues nonetheless that burns should have waited to see how her job duties would shake out starting in july.dhs has offered no evidence about what duties it intended to offer burns had she stayed.and there is no evidence that after the may decision to transfer burns responsibilities elsewhere that dhs ever indicated to burns what her new responsibilities,if any,would be after the new system went fully into effect in july.the record suggests that things would get worse,not better,especially given that there was no plan for what burns would do in the long term and johnson continued to exhibit arguably hostile behavior toward burns.a reasonable jury could find that burns had every reason to believe that she would never again reclaim the job directing international flight scheduling and would simply be given menial duties so long as johnson was her supervisor.
given these circumstances,a jury could easily find facts sufficient to support the determination that burns experienced an adverse employment action.
motivation because of sex 
burns asserts that a jury could reasonably find that johnson decision to change the international flight scheduling system was made because of burns sex,under both mcdonnell douglas and the theory a see id.m.our decision here,however,is not dependent on analyzing her claim under each of these theories.chadwick,at.u nder both approaches,plaintiffs must present enough evidence to permit a finding that there was differential treatment in an employment action and that the adverse employment decision was caused at least in part by a forbidden type of bias.id.quoting hillstrom best tlc hotel,cir.see quigg thomas cty.sch,cir.noting that m and discrimination are different theories of discrimination,as opposed to distinct causes of action.we determine only whether burns has put forth sufficient evidence from which a jury could decide that the change to international flight scheduling was more probably than not caused by discrimination.chadwick,at.
burns has presented evidence that during a meeting about who should be responsible for flight scheduling,the,johnson,questioned why burns should be in charge of the task and referred to burns not by name but by the pronoun she,emphasizing the pronoun,and using a condescending tone.comments made by the close in time to the alleged adverse action can be probative evidence.see centennial wireless,cir.johnson comments were made in the context of a meeting discussing who should be in charge of the flight scheduling.the district court concluded that t he use of the feminine pronoun when referring to a woman,however,hardly suffices to demonstrate gender bias.burns,wl,at.but t he speaker meaning may depend on various factors including context,inflection,tone of voice,local custom,and historical usage.ash tyson foods,per curiam rejecting an appeals court requirement that boy be modified by a racial classification in order to evince racial bias.here,a meeting attendee,sfam ouellette,stated in an affidavit that johnson made frequent references to the way she was doing things.he emphasized the word she.sfam ouellette opined that he felt it was a condescending way to speak about her and picked up on johnson disdain for her and for ouellette when he defended her.sfam ouellette observations about johnson tone are based on his perception as a seasoned manager on what he had just observed,not mere speculation.see united states,cir.personal knowledge can include inferences and opinions,so long as they are grounded in personal observations and experiences.quoting united states rodriguez,cir.see also fed.evid.on summary judgment we credit the plaintiff version of the facts.see ahmed johnson,cir.determining which view more accurately reflects reality requires factfinding and credibility judgments that are properly the task of a jury.straughn delta air lines,cir.crediting plaintiff description of employer use of an offensive southern black accent at meetings where she was present,despite employer denial.in these circumstances,a reasonable jury could infer from johnson emphasis and condescending tone that he was not motivated by either of his stated reasons,a desire to achieve conformity with the other field offices or to give the sfams leadership,but because he disliked that a woman was responsible for the task 
dhs counters that there is no evidence that johnson used sexist or slurs against burns or any other woman.the idea that discrimination consists only of blatantly sexist acts and remarks was long ago rejected by the supreme court.see price waterhouse hopkins,plurality opinion,superseded in part by statute,civil rights act of,pub,stat.as this circuit has repeatedly held,stereotyping,cognitive bias,and certain other more subtle cognitive phenomena which can skew perceptions and judgments also fall within the ambit of title vii prohibition on sex discrimination.thomas eastman kodak,cir.see chadwick,at.the ultimate question is whether the employee has been treated disparately because of sex,and t his is so regardless of whether the employer consciously intended to base the adverse employment action on sex,or simply did so because of unthinking stereotypes or bias.thomas,at.as we recently said in ahmed,unlawful discrimination can stem from stereotypes and other types of cognitive biases,as well as from conscious animus.at quoting thomas,at.
one such stereotype is the idea that men are better suited than women for positions of importance or leadership in the workplace,particularly where the task concerns national security or defense johnson testified in a deposition that he intended the change in burns duties to give more leadership to the sfams in the scheduling process.a reasonable jury could find that a stereotype was behind johnson questioning of why she was in that role as well as his belief that leadership should instead be given to the group of male sfams,and that these biased beliefs precipitated the decision to give burns duties to a group of men.see chadwick,at concluding that a reasonable jury could infer from a comment exhibiting that the employer took an adverse employment action based on the belief that the plaintiff would not give her all to her job because she was a woman with four young children bray marriott hotels,cir.suggesting that title vii should not be applied in a manner that ignores the sad reality that discriminatory animus can all too easily warp an individual perspective to the point that he or she never considers the member of a protected class the best candidate regardless of that person credentials lindahl air france,cir.his comments could suggest that he made his decision to promote on the basis of stereotypical images of men and women,specifically that women do not make good leaders because they are too otional.
burns claim that johnson decision was motivated by an impermissible bias,and not by his purported reasons,is supported by several additional facts.first,burns has presented evidence of incidents and situations which suggest that johnson had a general disregard for burns professional abilities and status,thomas,at,despite the complete absence of any factual basis for that disregard.dhs concedes that johnson sometimes made comments that were,frankly,tone deaf and asked questions that were awkwardly phrased.dhs then argues that despite those remarks,t here is no evidence that johnson harbored discriminatory animus against any woman,pointing to johnson deposition testimony that he never doubted burns performance ever.
the record shows otherwise.fam abc deposition testimony was that when johnson first met burns,he approached and asked her who are you and w hat do you do for me in a tone described by fam abc as demeaning.johnson did not make the same inquiry of or use the same tone with fam abc,the male fam who provided burns with and who was present when johnson questioned burns.a reasonable jury could infer that johnson questioned burns and not her male colleague because she was a woman,and that his comment a few weeks later,so you do still work here,further demonstrated his low regard for burns as an employee,despite the complete absence of a factual basis for that low regard.
that the comments exhibit a general demeaning of burns professional abilities is further supported by the fact that johnson knew that burns was the employee primarily in charge of international flight scheduling,and yet there is no evidence that johnson solicited input or feedback from burns about his proposed changes to the system.to the contrary,during their conversation in june when johnson told burns how much better things were going to be,when burns began to voice a concern about the change to international scheduling,johnson turned and abruptly left the room.it is undisputed that he also called the system burns in part designed stupid.
and contrary to dhs assertion that johnson had no issues with burns job performance,there is evidence that johnson challenged several aspects of her performance.johnson admitted that,even before he arrived,he knew about burns alternative work schedule,the reason for it,and that he had some misgivings about it.a few weeks later,he said he had done his homework on burns and despite hearing several reports that she performed very well,he nonetheless had concerns.there is no evidence that johnson asked about any other employee alternative work schedule.
johnson negative assessment of burns performance is all the more stark when set against the positive evaluations and numerous accolades burns garnered for her work.it is undisputed that o ver the course of her employment,burns was categorized as an excellent employee and extraordinary sic who received exemplary performance evaluations.burns received numerous letters of commendation from her former sac at the boston field office.sfam ouellette,her direct supervisor,testified in a deposition,s he was probably one of the best employees that i ever worked with.and beyond this,the flight scheduling system itself,which burns in part created,was considered a best practice for other field offices to follow.a reasonable jury could find it highly suspect that despite these indicia of high job performance,johnson persisted in challenging burns alternative schedule.see chadwick,at t he assumption that a woman will perform her job less well due to her presumed family obligations is a form of and adverse job actions on that basis constitute sex discrimination.while i t is undoubtedly true that if the work performance of a woman or a man,for that matter actually suffers due to childcare responsibilities or due to any other personal obligation or interest,an employer is free to respond accordingly a n employer is not free to assume that a woman,because she is a woman,will necessarily be a poor worker because of family responsibilities.id.at.
the evidence burns has presented regarding johnson comments and conduct toward her also supports a finding that johnson was at times inappropriately upset or angry with burns,to the point of behaving unprofessionally.thomas,at.in thomas,as here,a employee,thomas,had received excellent performance reviews for many years.id.at.she was the only in her division.id.at.a new white manager,flannery,gave thomas significantly lower performance reviews than thomas had received before and in comparison to her white,resulting in thomas being fired.id.at.we found it significant to the question of whether the manager evaluations were motivated by race that the manager sometimes became inappropriately upset or angry with thomas,and we concluded that such evidence suggests that she did not respond neutrally to thomas,such that a jury might reasonably infer from thomas description of these incidents that thomas race was an issue for flannery and that flannery evaluations of thomas were affected by some form of conscious animus or less conscious bias.id.at.similarly,here there is sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that johnson did not respond neutrally to burns and that johnson decisions regarding international scheduling were affected by some form of conscious animus or less conscious bias.id.
that conclusion is also supported by evidence that johnson used a baseball bat around burns in an intimidating manner.dhs argues that even if the bat was used as a tool of intimidation,johnson intimidated men and women alike and burns has not alleged that johnson treated her as severely as he treated sfam ouellette in the june,meeting.but a jury could find the evidence more nuanced than that.at the june,meeting,johnson left to get his bat only after sfam ouellette had defended the scheduling system created in part by burns and had objected to johnson plans.it was at that point,upon returning to the meeting room,that johnson turned to face sfam ouellette and began to tap the baseball bat between his legs while staring down at sfam ouellette.when someone at the meeting asked,what the bat for,johnson replied,things were getting a bit heated in here.a reasonable jury could find that johnson disregard for burns triggered johnson conduct.likewise,a jury could find that johnson used the bat as a tool of intimidation in the meeting and infer that he used the bat in that manner at other times with burns.
a reasonable jury would not be required to draw the inference in dhs favor that johnson used the bat in an equally intimidating way against men as he did against burns.contrary to dhs position,there is evidence that johnson used the bat with burns in every interaction after he officially took over,but not constantly with men,and that johnson used the bat in a manner with burns that was different from how he used it with men.burns testified in a deposition that during one encounter,johnson banged it on her desk in front of her.he held it in a very menacing tight grip.it went from being here,to here,to here,the entire time he spoke with her.apart from the incident involving sfam ouellette,addressed above,dhs has not presented evidence showing that johnson used the bat in a similar manner and frequency around men as he did with burns.nor has dhs disputed burns testimony that during another incident,in which burns was meeting with an ao to discuss early retirement based on her issues with johnson,that johnson popped out of his office with his baseball bat and proceeded to walk up and down the hallway with his bat in a swinging position.
on this record,a jury could find that a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence shows that discrimination has occurred.ahmed,at quoting holland gee,cir.that is,a reasonable jury could conclude that the change to international flight scheduling was more probably than not caused by discrimination.chadwick,at.we stress that we are judging merely the claim viability under summary judgment,rather than as to ultimate liability,id.at,and we emphasize that w e only conclude that burns has presented sufficient evidence of discrimination to have her day in court,id.at.our holding rests on the cumulative weight of the points we have made and the evidence presented about johnson conduct,comments,and tone toward and regarding burns,all without any basis in her performance or behavior.
the district court found that burns sex harassment claim failed because the evidence burns pointed to did not support an inference that johnson behavior was severe and pervasive.burns,wl,at emphasis added.dhs argues that we can affirm because johnson conduct was not or by accepting the district court rationale.alternatively,dhs says summary judgment should be affirmed because the defense precludes the secretary from being held vicariously liable for the alleged harassment.we address each issue in turn.
harassment 
dhs argues that there is insufficient evidence that johnson behavior toward burns was based on her sex.certain comments by dhs in its brief and at oral argument,where dhs emphasized that in one incident t
