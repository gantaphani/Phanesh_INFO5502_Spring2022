in this title vii employment discrimination case,we conclude that when an insolvent employer sells a substantial portion of its assets to another corporation,that company may be subject to successor liability.we also decide that because substantial portions of title vii are governed by laches,rather than a statute of limitations,the relation back provision of federal rule of civil procedure c does not apply to the joinder of the successor corporation as an additional defendant.
plaintiff was employed by defendant correctional services,correctional,from until she was discharged in.correctional was a subchapter s corporation engaged in the business of supplying medical services to incarcerated inmates in several states.kenan umar and his son emre umar each held of the stock.
alleging gender discrimination,plaintiff exhausted eeoc administrative requirements and then filed a complaint in the district court in may,asserting claims under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the pennsylvania human rights act,phra.ann,et.unknown to plaintiff at the time,correctional had agreed in march to sell a substantial amount of its assets to prison health services prison,an organization in a similar business.these assets consisted primarily of contracts with various states to provide medical services to prisoners.
the sales agreement disclaimed prison potential liability for certain law suits and eeoc claims pending against correctional.specifically mentioned were discrimination claims brought by the plaintiff and two other individuals.the agreement also provided for the creation of an oversight committee,which was to be responsible for disbursing the million proceeds from the sale to creditors of correctional.the committee was specifically directed to pay each to umar and his son.
according to the deposition of kenan umar,the fund was exhausted in august.after that time,however,it appears that prison paid some debts of correctional in order to maintain credibility with the commonwealth of pennsylvania.the contract between the commonwealth and correctional was one of the assets that had been sold to prison.other efforts at collection of receivables and payment of creditors were still underway at the time of umar deposition in february.nonetheless,he stated that correctional was financially defeated by that point,and that it owed more than it could collect.
in december,counsel who had been retained to defend correctional in this litigation filed a petition to withdraw his appearance,citing the inability of his client to pay its legal fees.plaintiff asserts that this event was the first notice she received of the sale of assets and correctional insolvency.after a hearing,the district court granted counsel withdrawal motion.
soon thereafter,on march,plaintiff moved to join prison as an additional defendant,alleging that it was a successor to correctional.the district court sustained prison objections and denied the motion on the ground that prison should not be held responsible on a successor liability theory.
after the district court denied reconsideration or certification of a controlling issue of law,correctional stipulated that judgment be entered against it and in favor of plaintiff for.in addition,it was agreed that plaintiff would not sue or seek to collect the judgment from umar or any other individual associated with correctional.in accordance with the stipulation,the district court entered judgment on august.
plaintiff has appealed,arguing that a title vii claimant in appropriate circumstances may be entitled to the benefit of successor liability.prison maintains that correctional was in a precarious financial position before march and the sale of assets had no real effect on the plaintiff ability to recover money damages.thus,prison asserts that successor liability should be inapplicable in this instance.prison also contends that this court lacks jurisdiction because the plaintiff consented to the judgment against correctional and,in the alternative,that plaintiff claim is because the provision of federal rule of civil procedure c is not applicable.
we will first address the contention that we lack appellate jurisdiction because the order of the district court refusing joinder of an additional party is interlocutory.ordinarily,such an order does not support appellate jurisdiction under.lockett general finance loan of downtown,cir charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.here,however,the judgment against correctional gives us jurisdiction.although entered by consent,it is unconditional,and will remain undisturbed no matter what our ruling on the interlocutory order denying the joinder of prison.see bethel mcallister,cir.see also kahn chase manhattan bank,cir.
prison cites federal home loan mortgage freddie mac scottsdale ins,cir,and verzilli flexon,cir,where we concluded that a consent judgment was conditional and therefore not final.as we observed in verzilli,a party standing to appeal a consent judgment requires a reservation of that right.verzilli,at.the intention to appeal was not included in the stipulation here,but it was made clear in the letter by plaintiff counsel to the district court forwarding the stipulation for approval and filing.
in the letter,counsel explained that the consent judgment would permit brzozowski to take an appeal of the final judgment to pursue her successor liability claim against prison health services,although it would have been the better practice to add a statement to that effect in the stipulation itself,we are satisfied that the letter was adequate to establish the plaintiff intent to appeal.we conclude,therefore,that the objections to our jurisdiction must be denied.
the substantive aspects of the plaintiff appeal challenge the district court refusal to apply the successor liability doctrine.at common law,where one corporation sells or transfers all or a substantial part of its assets to another,the transferee does not become liable for the debts and liabilities,including torts,of the transferor.polius clark equipment,cir.there are certain exceptions to that general rule.a purchaser may be liable where it expressly assumes liability,the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger,the transaction is fraudulent and intended to escape liability,or the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller.fletcher,cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,perm.ed.
the supreme court has expanded the common law rule in the field of labor relations.in golden state bottling nlrb,d,the court recited the general successorship principle but found that federal labor relations policy required consideration of additional factors.for example,when a successor continues to operate the business without substantial change,the employees will assume that their job situations will also remain the same and that past unfair labor practices will be remedied.failure to meet these expectations may well result in the labor unrest which federal labor policies are designed to avoid.id.at.
moreover,the avoidance of labor strife,prevention of a deterrent effect on rights granted employees under the national labor relations act,and protection for victimized employees are important goals which can be achieved at minimal cost to a successor.the expense resulting from successor liability can be considered in setting the price paid for the business,or through the inclusion of an indemnity clause in the purchase agreement.id.at.
similarly,in john wiley sons,livingston,d,the court recognized that employees and their union generally do not take part in the negotiations resulting in a change of corporate ownership and,thus,are placed at a disadvantage.as a result,the objectives of national labor policy must balance an employer option to rearrange its business with some protection for employees from a sudden change in the employment relationship.id.at.
in eeoc macmillan bloedel containers,cir,the court of appeals noted that title vii was molded to a large degree on the national labor relations act,including its relief provisions.the court specifically noted the emphasis that both acts place on extending protection to and providing relief for the victims of prohibited practices,and concluded that this federal policy is sufficient,in our view,to warrant imposing liability on a corporate successor for title vii violations of the predecessor company.id.at.however,liability in this context must be determined on a basis.id.
in rego arc water treatment of pennsylvania,cir,we recognized that,in employment discrimination cases,the doctrine of successor liability applies where the assets of the are transferred to another entity.rego,at.an aggrieved employee may enforce a claim or judgment against a successor that would have been valid against the predecessor.the doctrine is derived from equitable principles,and fairness is the prime consideration in its application id.at.
citing criswell delta air lines,cir,rego listed three principal factors applicable to successor liability in the employment discrimination field continuity in operations and work force of the successor and predecessor employers notice to the of its predecessor legal obligation and ability of the predecessor to provide adequate relief directly.id.at.this court has committed itself to recognizing successorship liability in the appropriate title vii context although the underpinnings of successor liability have been derived from equitable principles,they are nonetheless legal considerations which,when satisfied as they are here,warrant the application of the doctrine.
the plaintiff motion for permission to file an amended complaint alleges that each of the rego tests is met.notice is not an issue the agreement of sale between prison and correctional specifically refers to the plaintiff claim.prison assertedly has continued correctional operations and work force.correctional financial debacle makes it unable to satisfy the plaintiff monetary claims and it can not reinstate her.
we can not discern any undue prejudice to the imposition of successor liability should plaintiff be able to establish the validity of her claim.and,because the potential for this obligation has been in the law for some time,there is nothing unfair about its application at this juncture.we note that prison included an indemnity clause in the agreement of sale.realistically,it is probably of no value now,but the existence of such a provision was cited in golden state bottling as a factor supporting successor liability.prison might have made provisions for meeting correctional obligation to plaintiff through a lower price or an escrow arrangement.on the other hand,the plaintiff had no knowledge of the asset sale and no opportunity to protect her claim.the fact that prison did not take appropriate steps to insulate itself does not serve to make application of successor liability unfair in the circumstances.prison had means at its disposal to anticipate such a situation and offset expected costs associated with a potential claim like that of the plaintiff.
we are struck by the agreement provision for establishment of an interim committee to oversee the distribution of the million sale proceeds.this arrangement provided an opportunity for prison to guard itself to some extent from claims like that of plaintiff.in this connection,too,a reasonable person might question the payment of million to umar and his son,the two stockholders of correctional,without any consideration of the plaintiff claim.
relying on the opinion of the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in musikiwamba essi,cir,the district court concluded that enforcing successor liability in the case before us would be unfair.in musikiwamba the court of appeals stated that,u nless extraordinary circumstances exist,an injured employee should not be made worse off by a change in the business.but neither should an injured employee be made better off.id.at.the district court reasoned that here successor liability should not be imposed if the predecessor was in financial ruin prior to,and not as a result of,a sudden sale of assets.the court believed that giving an employee the right to pursue a claim against the successor in this situation does not protect preexisting rights,but instead creates new rights.
preliminarily,we note that the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in a later opinion substantially weakened the comment it made in musikiwamba.in eeoc vucitech,cir,the court wrote,w e do not understand these decisions to have imposed an ironclad requirement in all cases of successor liability.rather,emphasis should be on balancing the interest in sanctioning unlawful conduct and the interest in facilitating the market in corporate and other productive assets.id.moreover,no other court has adopted an expanded view of successor liability similar to the one espoused by musikiwamba.
concededly,the language in musikiwamba is somewhat confusing,at least when read as an assertion that it is somehow unfair to provide a plaintiff with a better chance of recovering damages in a title vii case from a successor rather than a penniless predecessor.to the extent that the plaintiff gains another source for satisfaction of her claim,of course,she is better off than the claimant whose only recourse is against a defunct or insolvent defendant.however,the mere substitution of a responsible defendant for an insolvent one is not a basis for denying successor liability.
the notion that successor liability can not be invoked where it would leave the creditor better off is a curious one.the doctrine of successor liability is premised on the idea that the creditor can not obtain satisfaction from the predecessor.to read this factor,or to impose a new one to require a court to look at whether the creditor is better off,seems to undermine the basic rationale underlying the doctrine.moreover,we note that,as a factual matter,there was money available here for creditors that was disbursed without regard to the possibility that the plaintiff might succeed in her claim.
although we do not agree with the district court application of musikiwamba,there is an area where it might have some relevance the establishment of liability for the alleged wrongful act.in that setting,a plaintiff claim should not be weakened or improved by presenting it against the successor rather than the guilty predecessor whose wrongdoing underlies the claim.
we conclude that the district court erred in refusing to allow joinder of prison as an additional defendant.the plaintiff should be given the opportunity to establish her claim of successor liability.we caution,however,that should the cause continue to the merits,the plaintiff may not simply rely on the consent judgment arranged with correctional.prison was not a party to the stipulation for a judgment and must be afforded the opportunity to defend itself against the claim de novo.
prison contends that as a separate and independent ground the district court should be affirmed because the plaintiff effort to add prison as a defendant was untimely and the claim would not relate back to the date of the original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c.conceding that the original complaint was filed against correctional within the limitations period set out in f prison argues,however,that the time had expired as to derivative claims that could be brought against it as a successor.
federal rule of civil procedure c provides that an amendment to a complaint relates back to the date of the original pleading when permitted by the statute of limitations applicable to the action the claim or defense arose out of the occurrence set forth in the original pleading or the amendment changes a party and the foregoing is satisfied.when is based on,the new party must also have received notice of the suit within the period set under rule m,must not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense,and should have known that,but for a mistake in identity,the suit would have been brought against it.
prison asserts that it had no notice of the lawsuit within the period under rule m.in essence,prison is contending that the period is a statute of limitations for title vii claims,and plaintiff failure to comply with rule c bars relation back.
the basic flaw in prison argument is that title vii does not contain a statute of limitations applicable to joinder in the situation here.
title vii sets a time limit after the discriminatory action occurred to present a claim to the eeoc,and a period for filing suit in the district court after receipt of a notice of letter from the agency.the act does not address the question presented an additional defendant may be joined after the period has expired.
generally,in federal litigation,if congress does not provide a limitations period,courts look to analogous state statutes for the appropriate time within which a suit must be brought title vii is an exception to that policy.in occidental life ins.eeoc,d,the court held that absorption of state limitations would be inconsistent with the congressional intent underlying title vii.that case was not a suit by an individual,but by the eeoc which is not bound by the limitation of title vii.nevertheless,the refusal to look to state statutes of limitations has been cited in individual suits as well.see,burgh borough council of the borough of montrose,cir cleveland newspaper guild,local plain dealer publishing,cir en banc.
just as macmillan bloedel held that a plaintiff need not repeat the administrative process for the benefit of a successor corporation,we see no reason why the restriction must be applicable to a defendant joined after the plaintiff has timely filed suit against the original employer.see macmillan bloedel,at.the plaintiff here name d those who were known to her and could have been charged during the period of limitations,and requiring more could encourage evasion through corporate transfers and would frustrate the equitable power of the court to make plaintiff whole.id.
courts have strictly construed the limitations period against plaintiffs who either misnamed the appropriate party in their complaint,see,williams army air force exchange,cir,or have otherwise entirely failed to meet the filing requirements in the statute.see baldwin.welcome center brown,d.those cases involved situations in which the plaintiff did not file a proper complaint within the period and are thus distinguishable from the litigation here where the original complaint was timely filed.
generally,when no specified or analogous statute of limitations applies to a cause of action,laches must be considered.a title vii defendant who has been prejudiced because of a delay in the administrative process does have the right to invoke the equitable defense of laches.in addition to other equitable defenses an employer may raise a laches defense,which bars a plaintiff from maintaining a suit if he unreasonably delays in filing a suit and as a result harms the defendant.national railroad passenger morgan,d.this court,along with a number of other courts of appeals,has cited that principle in cases where the eeoc has unduly delayed an individual claimant law suit before issuing a letter.waddell small tube products,cir 
the application of laches is in accord with title vii,which vests district courts with broad discretion to award appropriate equitable relief to remedy unlawful discrimination.local of the sheet metal workers int l eeoc,d.the courts are empowered to order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employees or any other relief as the court deems appropriate.g.id.at.
prison is not left without a defense.when laches applies,a plaintiff may not be entitled to relief if her conduct of the case has improperly and substantially prejudiced the other party.see albemarle paper moody,d.in jeffries chicago transit authority,cir,the court held that the plaintiff had inexcusably failed to prod the excessively slow administrative proceedings and the delay materially prejudiced the defendant.accordingly,the plaintiff was found guilty of laches.in national of gov t employees city public serv.board,cir,on the other hand,the court emphasized that there must be more than inexcusable delay.plaintiff must also show that the delay caused a disadvantage in establishing and asserting a defense.
the relation back provisions of rule are primarily concerned with alleviating unfair prejudice in circumstances involving statutes of limitations.it has no controlling force where,as here,a defendant remedy is provided by the equitable doctrine of laches.
in this case,the timeliness issue in terms of the period in the context of a statute of limitations was raised in the district court,but it was not ruled upon.on remand,the parties may bring the issue to the court attention.as we observed in waddell,the decision to consider a laches defense is within the sound discretion of the trial court which,of course,must make the requisite findings.the district court must consider whether the plaintiff conduct was unreasonable and whether the defendant was materially prejudiced.
accordingly,the order denying plaintiff the right to join prison as an additional defendant is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority of this panel has remanded brzozowski case to the district court for further inquiry into the timeliness of her attempt to amend her complaint to add prison as a defendant i am pleased that the majority has seen fit to remand,but distressed that it has not affirmed in toto the district court judgment which denied brzozowski relief.i therefore respectfully dissent.
considering the equitable nature of the successor doctrine,the prejudice that prison would suffer if brzozowski were allowed to amend her complaint,and the inescapable conclusion that brzozowski desire to add prison as a defendant represents the paradigm search for the deepest available pocket,it is evident to me that the district court correctly denied brzozowski motion to join prison as an additional defendant and that prison should prevail.the polestar of the successor doctrine is equity,and i suggest strongly that equity has not triumphed in the opinion of the majority 
equity has been said to be the body of principles constituting what is fair and right the recourse to principles of justice to correct or supplement the law as applied to particular circumstances.black law dictionary ed.as this court has stated,successor liability is a doctrine derived from equitable principles,and the principle of fairness is the prime consideration in its application.rego arc water treatment of,cir.that doctrine,however,has necessarily been qualified.in ed peters jewelry,c j jewelry,et al,cir,the first circuit said that the successor doctrine is derived from equity principles and it would be grossly unfair,except in the most exceptional circumstances,to impose successor liability on an innocent purchaser when the predecessor is fully capable of providing relief.
the seventh circuit added to the equitable gloss of the successor liability doctrine when,using some of the same language,it stated 
the successor doctrine is derived from equity principles,and it would be grossly unfair,except in the most exceptional circumstances,to impose successor liability on an innocent purchaser when the predecessor is fully capable of providing relief or when the successor would not have the opportunity to protect itself.
musikiwamba essi,cir.other courts have chimed in to the same effect.see,criswell delta air lines,cir citing to musikiwamba,at 
in rego,where we adopted the doctrine of successor liability,we specified that the district court should analyze a successor claim by considering three principal factors before making a successor liability determination continuity in operations and work force of the successor and predecessor employers notice to the successor employer of its predecessor legal obligation and ability of the predecessor to provide adequate relief directly.rego,at emphasis added.
to this extent and to this point,the majority opinion and i are in complete agreement.however,where we part company is in our analysis of the third prong of rego.that is,could financially insolvent correctional the predecessor and brzozowski original employer provide adequate relief directly to brzozow
