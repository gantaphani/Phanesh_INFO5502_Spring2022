this appeal illustrates,in a dramatic context,the tension between the judicial system instinct to provide a remedy for every wrong and the system recognition that the passage of time must leave some wrongs without a remedy.david pearl appeals from the july,judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york leonard wexler,district judge dismissing,as barred by the statute of limitations,his suit seeking damages for police brutality allegedly inflicted upon him years ago.acknowledging the normally applicable barrier of the statute of limitations,pearl contends that he may sue at this late date because the settlement of his prior timely lawsuit was obtained by fraud,his currently pleaded causes of action were concealed by fraud,and he can now establish the truth through the testimony of a police officer who admits that he participated in the brutality and that he and the other defendants lied about pearl claim.we are obliged to agree with the district court that pearl evidence,accepted as true for purposes of this appeal,does not permit his current suit to proceed.we therefore affirm.
background 
the alleged assault.pearl alleges the following circumstances.in,pearl,then sixteen years old,was stopped on the street and brutally attacked by four city of long beach nassau county,police leo nolan and vincent milo,and george ellert and sergeant james rosengrave,both now deceased.as detailed in pearl state court civil complaint,on august,he was called over to a police car by officer nolan.after asking pearl a few questions,nolan told him to get into the back of the police car.in the course of being transported to the police station,pearl was repeatedly punched in the stomach and face by nolan,while restrained by officer milo.officer ellert drove the car.nolan and the other officers continued to hit and kick pearl at the police station,causing pearl to lose consciousness for a period of time.pearl injuries required a period of hospitalization and left him permanently blind in one eye.
the officers,including appellee arthur whitman,testified to a different version of the episode at two state court criminal trials.they said that pearl swore at officer whitman,who was on traffic patrol,as he was walking by.officer nolan called pearl over to his car after hearing him swear.pearl then swore at nolan and,after getting into the police car,struck him.the officers other than whitman used force in the car and in the station only in order to subdue pearl.
the criminal case.the nassau county prosecutor charged pearl with assaulting a police officer,resisting arrest,and disorderly conduct.pearl was initially convicted at a bench trial,but the conviction was overturned on appeal because pearl had unconstitutionally waived his right to a jury trial,which pearl had done in order to maintain juvenile offender status.people david,dep t.the second trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial.at each trial,all four officers involved in the incident testified against him,as did officer whitman.pearl was informed that prosecutors would proceed with a third trial.
the state court civil case.just prior to sentencing in the first trial,pearl and his mother,florence wexler,brought a civil suit in nassau county superior court under against the city of long beach and officers nolan,milo,and ellert,alleging excessive force by them,and recklessness on the part of the city in allowing its officers to assault pearl.in their pretrial depositions for the civil case,the officers again gave their account of the episode.in,with the third criminal trial impending,pearl and his mother chose to settle their civil suit.at the settlement hearing,pearl mother made it clear that the sole reason she agreed to settle was that the prosecutor had indicated that the criminal charges would be dropped if pearl settled.pearl attorney advised that it would be an uphill battle to convince a jury in the civil trial and the impending criminal trial that four police officers were lying on the stand.pearl also believed that his witnesses were intimidated by the police and failed to fully support his defense.pearl and his mother agreed to settle the civil case for,an amount that did not cover his medical bills and the fees and expenses of his criminal defense.the individual police officers and the city were released with respect to all actions and claims arising out of the incident which occurred on august.the city paid the.
milo recantation.in june,milo,one of the officers involved in the episode,submitted a sworn statement to the nassau county district attorney,stating that the officers testimony in the pearl case was fabrication.he confessed that he never saw pearl throw a punch or kick any of the police officers involved,and that nolan laid out the story as to what the reports should say.
in a second affidavit given in may,milo recounted the extent of brutality within the long beach police department t here existed a pattern of brutality within the department in which not all police officers participated but in which all acquiesced b eatings by senior officers,especially the detectives to extract confessions were common place he recalled other instances of suspects being beaten and that it was nothing out of the ordinary,just standard operating procedure and b lackjacks,clubs and rubber hoses and telephone books were all part of our unofficial equipment.
he also stated when we were sued by pearl we insisted that the city hire as our attorney leon stern.he was most familiar with the facts of the case as he was allowed to be present in the grand jury room while the pearl case was being present ed.in fact,he gave us detailed accounts of each civilian witness s testimony so that we could adjust our presentation h e was one of the boys while an assistant district attorney and understood the way we operated.milo also stated that he left the long beach police department and transferred to the long beach fire department.
pearl current lawsuit.milo first affidavit prompted pearl to institute the instant lawsuit on january,asserting federal causes of action under and rico,et,claims under the fourth,fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments,and state law claims.the defendants are nolan and milo,the two officers still living who participated in the episode,whitman,who testified against pearl,the city,and the long beach police department.pearl seeks to revive claims arguably extinguished by the settlement,such as his excessive force claim against the individual officers,and also seeks to assert,purportedly for the first time,claims that he alleges became known to him only in.the latter include section claims against the officers for conspiracy to,against the city for failure to protect,and against the city based on the supreme court decision in monell department of social services,d false imprisonment,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence under state law fraud under state law and a rico claim.
judge wexler granted defendants b motion,dismissing pearl complaint on statute of limitations grounds.this appeal followed.
discussion 
in section actions,the applicable limitations period is found in the general or residual state statute of limitations for personal injury actions,owens okure,d,and the parties agree that in this case that period is three years,see mckinney the appellant contends that the statute of limitations does not bar his pending lawsuit,even though it was filed years after the episode,because the appellees concealed his causes of action from him by their false statements in their official reports,and their false testimony in the two criminal trials and in depositions in the state court civil suit that was settled.as the appellant frames his contention,the statute of limitations has been tolled by reason of the appellees fraudulent concealment.brief for appellant at.this contention requires consideration of several related issues when does a cause of action accrue,what circumstances toll the running of a period of limitations after a cause of action accrues,and what circumstances estop a defendant from asserting a limitations defense preliminary to consideration of these issues is the choice of law question whether state or federal law applies to their resolution.
federal law determines when a section cause of action accrues,heard sheahan,cir harvey waldron,cir singleton city of new york,cir and we have ruled that accrual occurs when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action,id.quoting bireline seagondollar,cir see pinaud county of suffolk,cir.as the ensuing discussion will show,this concept of accrual,sometimes referred to as the discovery rule,trw,andrews,d,is related to and sometimes confused with the concept of fraudulent concealment of a cause of action.
the supreme court has instructed that in section actions,we borrow not only a state limitations period but also its tolling rules,board of regents tomanio,d see keating carey,cir,unless applying the state tolling rules would defeat the goals of the federal statute at issue,hardin straub,d.the seemingly bifurcation between accrual,governed by federal law,and tolling rules,governed by state law,obscures two matters.first,it is not clear from tomanio whether in section actions we are to borrow only a state tolling rules that have been incorporated into state statutes or,in addition,other aspects of a state common law concerning avoidance of a statute of limitations that either have been labeled tolling or serve an equivalent function,to relieve the plaintiff from the bar of a statute of limitations.second,it is not clear whether state or federal law applies where the circumstances governing accrual are similar,if not identical to,circumstances pertinent to a state tolling rule,a recurring issue in cases where tolling is sought on the ground of fraudulent concealment 
the first scope of borrowed tolling the easier of the two.tomanio noted that new york has by statute codified a number of the tolling rules developed at common law,at,citing statutory provisions concerning the defendant absence from the state or residence under a false name,and the plaintiff disability such as infancy,insanity,or imprisonment,id.at.citing,mckinney.because the supreme court wanted section actions to be subject to state tolling rules,it seems likely that both statutory and common law rules are to be borrowed.see shropshear corporation counsel of chicago,cir borrowing state common law rule of equitable tolling wade danek medical,cir same.
the second overlap between accrual and tolling based on fraudulent more troublesome,in part because of the varying uses of terminology.the taxonomy of tolling,in the context of avoiding a statute of limitations,includes at least three phrases equitable tolling,fraudulent concealment of a cause of action,and equitable estoppel.the initial difficulty encountered in trying to compare accrual,governed by federal law,with tolling,governed by state law,is that the reported decisions of the federal and state courts do not always mean the same thing by their use of these phrases,and phrases to which some judges ascribe different meanings are used interchangeably by other judges.
in the seventh circuit,judge posner has identified two tolling doctrines equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.cada baxter healthcare,cir see shropshear,at.he uses equitable estoppel to mean a bar that prevents a defendant from relying on a statute of limitations as a defense where the defendant takes active steps to prevent the plaintiff from suing in time,as by promising not to plead the statute of limitations.cada,at.he notes that equitable estoppel is sometimes called fraudulent concealment,id.at,but must not be confused with efforts by a defendant in a fraud case to conceal the fraud,id.emphasis added.if successful,those efforts,he says,postpone the date of accrual and are thus within the domain of the discovery rule,id.citation omitted,the rule that determines when a cause of action accrues however,in his more recent discussion of the issue,he calls fraudulent concealment one instantiation of equitable estoppel.shropshear,at.he uses equitable tolling to mean suspension of a statute of limitations where the plaintiff despite all due diligence is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of a claim absent a by the defendant to prevent the plaintiff from suing.cada,at.in the third circuit,judge lewis has viewed fraudulent concealment of a cause of action as one circumstance warranting equitable tolling,oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir he has regarded the discovery rule accrual as concerned with a plaintiff awareness,actual or imputed,of actual injury and equitable tolling as concerned with awareness,actual or imputed,of the facts supporting the plaintiff cause of action,id.at see forbes eagleson,cir following terminology of oshiver.
our court has used equitable tolling to mean fraudulent concealment of a cause of action that has in some sense accrued earlier,see pinaud,at characterizing the plaintiff argument to allege that even if the plaintiff claims in some sense accrued earlier,the statute of limitations was equitably tolled by virtue of the individual defendants fraudulent concealment of their actions,and to mean fraudulent concealment that postpones the accrual of a cause of action,cerbone international ladies garment workers union,cir under this doctrine of equitable tolling,the statute does not begin to run until the plaintiff either acquires actual knowledge of the facts that comprise his cause of action or should have acquired such knowledge through the exercise of reasonable diligence the doctrine has been applied where the facts show that the defendant engaged in conduct,often itself fraudulent,that concealed from the plaintiff the existence of the cause of action internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we have also used equitable estoppel to mean fraudulent concealment that postpones the running of the statute of limitations,see keating,at noting that under federal law when the defendant fraudulently conceals the wrong,the time does not begin running until the plaintiff discovers,or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the cause of action and ruling that new york has adopted the same equitable estoppel doctrine.
new york appears to use the label equitable estoppel to cover both the circumstances where the defendant conceals from the plaintiff the fact that he has a cause of action and where the plaintiff is aware of his cause of action,but the defendant induces him to forego suit until after the period of limitations has expired.joseph mclaughlin,practice commentaries,at mckinney.see simcuski saeli,equitable estoppel because of concealment of cause of action kamruddin desmond.dep t equitable estoppel because of concealment of medical records that were needed to pursue malpractice cause of action of which plaintiff was aware croop odette,misc d.oneida cty equitable estoppel because of defendant representation that compensation would be paid without need for lawsuit,aff,dep t see also merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,ohnuma,misc d,equitable tolling concerns when statute of limitations begins to run,rev on other grounds,dep t.in other states,concealment is sometimes referred to as equitable tolling,snapp associates insurance services,robertson,th,d,or simply the reason that the statute of limitations is tolled,walk ring,and at least one state uses tolling to concern both accrual and stopping of the statute of limitations,see major league baseball morsani,so d,tolling,strictly speaking,is concerned with the point at which the limitations period begins to runs and with the circumstances in which the running of the limitations period may be suspended.
bearing in mind this variety of terminology,we discern a split of authority as to whether tolling based on fraudulent concealment should be governed by state or federal law.compare emrich touche ross,cir where a district court applies or borrows a state statute of limitations,it is also required to apply the state equitable exceptions,to the extent these are consistent with federal law,and rotella pederson,cir state tolling rule of concealment applies whether or not consistent with the federal tolling provisions,with shropshear,at i n a case such as this,where the federal court is applying a borrowed state statute of limitations,the federal doctrine of equitable estoppel meaning fraudulent concealment,not the state doctrine,controls,and farmers merchants national bank bryan,cir when plaintiffs causes of action accrued and whether the statute of limitations was equitably tolled by a form of concealment remained questions of federal law.the first circuit has stated that e ven when a federal court borrows a state statute of limitations,the court applies federal equitable estoppel principles,and has recognized,but not decided,the issue of whether state rules of equitable tolling apply.see commonwealth of puerto rico,cir.
in our circuit,keating appears to regard concealment as a tolling rule to which borrowed state law applies see keating,at,but the opinion is not clear on this point,and the issue was of no consequence because the federal accrual and the state tolling rules were the same,see id.
whether concealment of a cause of action postpones accrual of a cause of action and is therefore a matter of federal law or whether,in new york,where it is an example of equitable estoppel,it is one of the state tolling rules we are to borrow in section actions which seems the more likely alternative after keating,the analysis of pearl claims is unaffected,because,as discussed below,his current claims are barred whether the issue is viewed as one of delayed accrual or tolling.and the outcome is unaffected no matter which of the tolling concepts is applicable.because pearl casts his argument in terms of equitable tolling,by which he means fraudulent concealment of a cause of action,we will use that phrase in discussing all aspects of his contention.
in the pending case,we clearly borrow new york rule of tolling during infancy,see mckinney,and therefore the statute of limitations ran on pearl section claims on september,three years after his eighteenth birthday.citing primarily federal case law pearl invokes the doctrine of equitable tolling and contends that the limitations period has been tolled because the police officers who testified against him lied about the episode,giving a false version that officer nolan had concocted for them.brief for appellant at.
the tolling issue arises in this case in an unusual context.unlike typical tolling cases in which the plaintiff contends that fraudulent concealment prevented him,even in the exercise of due diligence,from acquiring sufficient awareness of a cause of action to permit the timely filing of a lawsuit,see,simcuski,at,at,pearl initiated a suit against the police officers and the city of long beach,and that suit was settled.he now seeks to overcome the obstacle of that settlement by seeking to have the settlement vacated on the ground that it was procured by fraud,the officers false testimony,which,he contends,induced him to settle on unfavorable terms.even if fraud against the appellant or a fraud upon the state court warranted ignoring the prior litigation,see griffith bank of new york,cir,pearl would still have to demonstrate that the circumstances permit him to sue the officers and the city years after the episode.
in considering the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of a prior lawsuit allegedly concluded disadvantageously because of fraud,we find no pertinent new york decision.although we have not previously encountered such circumstances,our own case law provides useful guidance.in applying the doctrine of equitable tolling,we have made an important distinction between fraudulent concealment of the existence of a cause of action and fraudulent concealment of facts that,if known,would enhance a plaintiff ability to prevail as to a cause of action of which the plaintiff was previously aware.see paige police department of schenectady,cir.thus,in paige,we acknowledged that a limitation period could be tolled by fraudulent concealment of a cause of action in a section police brutality suit,but ruled that the suit was because the plaintiff had enough information when she became an adult to bring her claim.id.at.although some of the facts putatively concealed by the defendants might have strengthened the plaintiff case by corroborating her story,we find that the absence of those facts did not sufficiently justify the plaintiff in not pursuing her cause of action as to merit equitable tolling.id.at.if state law tolling principles apply,we have no reason to think that new york,whose tolling rules we have termed less liberal for plaintiffs than those of federal law,see saylor lindsley,cir,would not make the same distinction we made in paige.
although we have broadly stated,as pearl notes,that we will apply the equitable tolling doctrine as a matter of fairness where a plaintiff has been prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising his rights,miller international telephone telegraph,cir,we made it clear that we had in mind a situation where a plaintiff could show that it would have been impossible for a reasonably prudent person to learn about his or her cause of action.id.emphasis added see johnson nyack hospital,cir.
claims against the police officers.thus understood,the doctrine of equitable tolling,as pearl calls it,or equitable estoppel,as new york calls it,does not permit pearl to sue the individual police officers at this late date.pearl was obviously aware of his cause of action for police brutality at the time of the episode and not only could have sued the officers,but did so.even if we assume that the alleged fraud of the officers in concocting a false account of the episode would provide a basis for setting aside the settlement of pearl state court civil suit,see griffith,at,a renewed assertion of his claims against the officers would be.although the police officers allegedly false testimony in pearl two criminal trials and in the depositions for his state court suit undoubtedly induced pearl and his mother to settle that suit for a modest sum,the facts of the episode,as he now alleges them to be,were fully known to pearl in.what he has now,like the plaintiff in paige,is more persuasive evidence,not newly developed awareness of a previously concealed cause of action.
although bell city of milwaukee,cir,where equitable tolling was permitted,id.at,involves police misconduct somewhat similar to what pearl alleges,the rationale for the seventh circuit decision reveals why such tolling is not available to pearl.in bell,as is alleged here,police officers perjured themselves on the stand as to the circumstances of a shooting that caused the victim death,and a police officer who participated in the episode came forward years later with a recantation.the central fact underlying the decision in bell,however,was that,because daniel bell was killed by the officers,his family lacked specific,information about what had occurred.they were aware of the death,but not of the facts that made the death actionable.although bell family did not believe the reports and testimony relating to the shooting,the family had no basis for knowing or proving what actually happened because bell did not survive to tell his version of the episode.as the seventh circuit later explained,the conspiracy had prevented a full and open disclosure of facts crucial to the cause of action,rendering hollow the plaintiffs right of access.vasquez hernandez,cir.moreover,in bell,the court of appeals quoted extensively from the district court view of what it considered the applicable and binding wisconsin state rule of law on the application of the doctrine of estoppel by fraudulent concealment,which considers whether the defendants conduct and representations were so unfair and misleading as to outbalance the public interest in setting a limitation on an action.at quoting bell city of milwaukee.neither new york case law nor ours adopts such an expansive approach to equitable tolling.
also superficially similar but ultimately distinguishable is yeadon new york city transit authority,a class action brought by individuals who had been subject to false arrests by the officers of the new york city transit authority.
