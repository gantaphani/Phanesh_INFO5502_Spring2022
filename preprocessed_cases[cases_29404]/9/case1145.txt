the present action arises out of a recent legislative attempt by defendant city of new york city to combat the widespread problem of graffiti vandalism,the unauthorized placement of graffiti on the property of another.as amended in december,the city administrative code code or city code prohibits the sale of,inter alia,aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers to persons under years of age,see admin.code c,and generally prohibits persons under the age of from possessing such items on property other than their own,see id.the present action was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in april by or on behalf of artists whose ages then ranged from to,challenging the constitutionality of c and on the grounds that those subsections prohibitions with respect to spray paint and markers a violate plaintiffs first amendment rights to freedom of expression,and b discriminate against plaintiffs on the basis of age in violation of their rights to equal protection.plaintiffs promptly moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing those provisions during the pendency of the action.
the district court,george daniels,judge,granted the motion for a preliminary injunction to the extent of prohibiting the city from enforcing the spray paint and marker provisions of c and against young adults over the age of but under the age of.under new york law,see,dom.rel.law mckinney,and oblig.law mckinney,new york residents are adults at age.the court found,inter alia,that plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims that the challenged provisions violate their first amendment and equal protection rights.defendants have appealed,contending principally that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims defendants also contend that plaintiffs failed to show that they would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the preliminary injunction on the basis of plaintiffs first amendment claims.
background 
for decades,the city has been confronted with a growing problem of vandalism and public defacement by means of making unauthorized graffiti.complaint.in the city administrative code in code,the predecessor of,contained provisions that,inter alia,forbade any person to write,draw,or paint any inscription,figure,or mark on public or private property without the express permission of the owner or operator of the property,see code a prohibited any person from carrying an aerosol spray paint can or a broad tipped indelible marker into any public building or other public facility with the intent to violate a,see code b and prohibited the sale of such items to any person under the age of,see id.c see also new york state laws of,ch,renumbering city code as.
in december,amendments to were adopted to expand former c prohibitions by raising the age restriction on the sale of such items from to and by introducing a provision that prohibits persons under the age of from possessing such items in certain places,regardless of intent.
a.the challenged provisions of the city code 
the new or amended subsections that are challenged in this action provide as follows 
c no person shall sell or offer to sell an aerosol spray paint can,broad tipped indelible marker or etching acid to any person under years of age.
no person under years of age shall possess an aerosol spray paint can,broad tipped indelible marker or etching acid on the property of another or in any public building or upon any public facility.
admin.code c and.the term broad tipped indelible marker is defined as it was in the code to mean any felt tip marker or similar implement containing a fluid that is not water soluble and which has a flat or angled writing surface inch or greater,id.e.the term public facility is not defined.
for persons charged with violating subsection,the code provides for affirmative defenses as follows 
when a person is found to possess an aerosol spray paint can,broad tipped indelible marker or etching acid while on the property of another or in any public building or upon any public facility in violation of subdivision of this section,it is an affirmative defense that 
the owner,operator or other person having control of the property,building or facility consented to the presence of the aerosol spray paint can,broad tipped indelible marker or etching acid or 
such person is traveling to or from his or her place of employment,where it was or will be used during the course of such employment and used only under the supervision of his or her employer or such employer agent.
a first violation of the sale prohibition in c is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to imprisonment for up to three months a second or successive violation of that provision is a class a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to imprisonment for up to one year.see id.f.noncompliance with the possession prohibition in is a violation that is punishable by a fine of up to imprisonment for up to days.id.f.
b.the plaintiffs and the preliminary injunction motion 
the present action was brought by or on behalf of artists and aspiring artists who wish to create graffiti art in lawful venues on lawful surfaces such as canvas,wood,and apparel.plaintiffs include two college students lindsey vincenty and nellie dumont studying film visual arts parents of three high school students,suing on behalf of those students valerie adams,on behalf of her son kereem adams,gino castignoli,on behalf of his daughter melissa castignoli,and rhea david,on behalf of her daughter loyette david one aspiring graffiti artist fernando carlo whose father is a well known graffiti artist and one person who is employed as a painter apprentice vincent schiano.the complaint seeks a a declaration that c and of the code violate the first and fourteenth amendments,and b a permanent injunction against enforcement of those subsections.
by order to show cause,plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the spray paint and marker provisions of c and,clarifying in their memorandum of law that they did not challenge or seek an injunction with respect to so much of those subsections as regulate the sale or possession of etching acid plaintiffs memorandum of law in support of order to show cause at since no plaintiff wishes to possess etching acid,this provision of the code is not before the court.in support of their request for an injunction with respect to the provisions governing sale and possession of aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers,the aspiring graffiti artists submitted,inter alia,affidavits describing their desire only to produce lawful graffiti art and ways in which the challenged provisions stifle their artistic expression.for example,vincenty,who attends the school of visual arts in manhattan and has already created more than lawful works of graffiti art,asserted 
i literally can not function without spray paint and markers.spray paint covers differently than other paints applied with a brush,such as mists,fades and blends.it dries faster,so i can layer more quickly.it covers well,smoothly and evenly.the fact that i can not purchase spray paint or broad tipped markers legally limits my ability to express myself creatively.
affidavit of lindsey linzie vincenty dated april,vincenty aff.however,because of c,vincenty has been unable to purchase spray paint and broad tipped indelible markers at stores in the city.see id.further,although she needs those materials for her classes,she can not,in light of,take them with her on the subway from her home in brooklyn to the school in manhattan.see id.
dumont,a film major who also attends the school of visual arts,is also a visual artist who uses spray paint.she attempted to buy spray paint in a manhattan hardware store in order to stencil a canvas in her room but learned that she could not purchase it because of her age because she could not purchase the spray paint,she did not paint her picture.see affidavit of nellie dumont dated april.she purchases spray paint near her parents home in upstate new york see id.but she fear s being arrested in public,if she walk s around with spray paint or markers in the city id.
each of the plaintiffs uses broad tipped indelible markers and would like to use spray paint to produce art work on such surfaces as paper,canvas,or clothing.they like to use broad tipped markers because,inter alia,the work goes faster,and such markers produce brighter colors and different textures.these plaintiffs have been unable to buy broad tipped indelible markers they have received them from adult relatives but fear arrest if caught possessing them while en route to school.see,affidavit of kereem adams dated april,affidavit of loyette david dated april,david aff,affidavit of melissa castignoli dated april.in addition,castignoli stated that she had felt compelled to decline a friend request to artistically his shirt,for which she would have been paid.see id.
schiano is both a graffiti artist and a unionized painter apprentice.he uses spray paint in connection with his job,and his responsibilities include procuring painting supplies.he stated that in connection with his job,he has used 
spray paint on surfaces such as metal,door hinges,hardware,and any other surfaces the customer wishes to be spray painted.i have spray painted a mural in the auditorium of a public school is,in marine park.i have spray painted cartoon characters in children bedrooms.
affidavit of vincent schiano dated april,schiano aff.as an artist,schiano uses spray paint on canvas and,as well as on the wall of his parents garage.however,because of his age at the commencement of this action he feared that if he were caught with spray paint in a truck while working,or on a sidewalk walking home,or anywhere in the city of new york,even for the purpose of making art in his home or painting on the job,he would be subject to arrest and criminal prosecution.id.schiano stated 
there have been occasions when i wanted to create artistic works but i have not,due to the administrative code provisions.i simply wish to be able to buy my art supplies.i wish to be able to carry them home on the subway or in a taxi,or while walking on a sidewalk or through a park,or on my way to or from work,without fear of arrest.i wish to be able to express myself freely and without fear,and i wish to be able to work without fear.under these provisions of the administrative code,i am unable to do so 
at the final hearing on their preliminary injunction motion,plaintiffs concede d that the c ity has a compelling interest in fighting illegal graffiti.hearing transcript,may,may tr,at statement by plaintiffs counsel.but they contended that,in limiting artistic expression by persons who have no intention of making unauthorized graffiti,c and violate their rights under the first amendment because those provisions are not precisely tailored to serve the city interest in combating graffiti vandalism,are not necessary to serve that interest,and do not serve that interest.they also argued that those subsections deny them equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of age.
defendants opposed the preliminary injunction motion,presenting evidence that,nationwide,graffiti is the most common type of property vandalism,constituting of all property crimes see declaration of city assistant chief of police edwin young dated may,young decl,and that the annual costs total billion see declaration of city assistant corporation counsel virginia waters dated april.the city,between and,had cleaned graffiti from more than million square feet of property.see,young decl.
defendants presented evidence that between and april,city police had made more than arrests for alleged violations of new york state laws,penal law and mckinney prohibiting,respectively,the making of graffiti on public or private property with intent to damage such property and the possession of graffiti instruments under circumstances evincing an intent to use same in order to damage such property.the city made such arrests in,in,in,and between january and april,see young decl.and the majority of the graffiti offenders are under years of in,in,in and almost in id.in and approximately of the arrests were of persons.in and so far in.id.with respect to the newly enacted subsection,for which an alleged violator is not arrested but rather is issued a criminal court summons see id,the city had issued five summonses by may,three for persons under age and two for persons over but under see id.
defendants argued that c and are content neutral,do not proscribe any first amendment activity,and are narrowly tailored responses to the problem of unlawful graffiti and to the experience that of the persons violating the provisions were years of age.
defendants also argued that plaintiffs had not shown that a preliminary injunction was needed to avoid irreparable injury.they stated,inter alia,that police officers have discretion not to issue summonses for possession of the prohibited items by a person under the age of on a city street or sidewalk adjacent to his or her school or home 
police officers issue criminal summonses only after they assess each situation individually.officers have been trained to use their discretion and make a decision as to whether or not to issue a criminal summons in a particular situation.so for example,if a person under is seen to be in possession of the prohibited materials on public property adjacent to an art school and explains that is an art student with a valid art school id and has just left the school,the office r may appropriately determine that a summons is not warranted.similarly if an officer sees a person under who is in front of a private house clearly possessing the prohibited materials,the officer,after a preliminary investigation,may decide not to issue a summons.
young decl.emphases added see also defendants memorandum of law in opposition to plaintiffs order to show cause defendants memorandum of law at reiterating the assistant police chief description of police discretion and adding that as to a young adult in front of private property,the officer may inquire of the property owner and decline to issue a summons if the officer decides that the requisite consent has been given.
defendants also stated that although police officers might seek to make random searches of backpacks on the subway,t hese searches are entirely voluntary.a person can refuse to have bag searched and leave the location of the inspection.young decl.defendants memorandum of law at.
c.the decision of the district court 
in a decision announced from the bench at the close of the may hearing,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.as to persons under the age of,the court denied the motion.it found that,in light of the fact that sales of aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers to persons in that age group had been prohibited by the code,the plaintiffs had not shown,inter alia,a likelihood that they would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction.see may tr.
however,as to young adults,and id.at hereinafter young adults the court concluded that plaintiffs had shown both the likelihood of irreparable injury if a preliminary injunction were not issued,and a likelihood of success on the merits of their first amendment and equal protection claims see id.at.the court concluded that the requisite showing of irreparable injury had been made,given,inter alia,the likelihood of plaintiffs success on the merits of their claims see may tr,and the fact that the challenged subsections not only significantly hamper their expressive activities but also subject them to criminal prosecution see id.at.the court noted as to subsection that 
the city has provided information that five summonses have already characterize it as enforcement summonses have already been issued for violation of this section,so that it is obviously sufficient evidence to conclude that future arrests or summonses are likely to occur absent an injunction in this case.
id.at.the court concluded that a preliminary injunction was needed because it was not appropriate to leave it up to the discretion of the police department to decide how to enforce this regulation id.at.
as to the likelihood of plaintiffs success on the merits of their first amendment claims,the court began by finding that the challenged provisions are content neutral and thus are to be subjected to an intermediate level of scrutiny,under which they need not be the least restrictive or the least intrusive means of achieving the governmental interest,so long as they are narrowly tailored to promote a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation s.may tr.regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest are to be upheld as long as they are reasonable,and leave open ample alternative channels for communication.id.at.the court found that although c and were clearly meant to serve the city interest in preventing graffiti vandalism see id.at,those subsections did not meet the two latter facets of the test 
i find that with regard to the first amendment argument,that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits,that the record indicates that the restrictions placed on young adults,and are not reasonable.it is unreasonable,it appears in the abstract,without fully developing the record any further at this point,but for the purpose of a preliminary injunction during the resolution of this case,it initially appears unreasonable to tell young artists that they have the right to express themselves in the manner in which they wish to express themselves,but at the same time telling them that their art is perfectly appropriate,but to set significant,unreasonable restrictions with regard to their ability to obtain the tools to communicate their art.
id.at.given the record before it,the court found it an unreasonable restriction to say to adults id.at who are without criminal intent id.at that they can not purchase and they can not transport in public or possess in any public building or conveyance the supplies they need and intend for lawful use id.at.
this amendment,in prohibiting and criminalizing the sale,the purchase and possession by responsible adults over of spray paint and wide tip markers,even where those individuals have a legitimate purpose for their use,appears to be at this stage of the proceedings an unreasonable restriction and does not,pursuant to the standard that must be used,appears to not leave open ample alternative channels for communication and expression,as is the right under the first amendment.
see also id.at finding it unreasonable that young adult artists who work with spray paint and broad tipped indelible markers have no right to obtain these materials even though their expression is perfectly legitimate and perfectly legal.the court concluded i find at this stage of the proceeding,on this record,there is a likelihood of success on the first amendment claim,as this is not a reasonable restriction on the time,place or manner of expression.it does not leave open alternative channels of communication consistent with the first amendment.id.at.
the district court also found that plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on their equal protection claims,stating that the city must treat individuals similarly in the absence of an adequate reason to distinguish between them may tr.the court noted that the statistics submitted by defendants indicate that while the number of graffiti vandalism arrests had steadily increased,the percentage of arrested persons who were years of age had steadily decreased see id.at,and it found that there was no rational basis to single out,and for different treatment than any other group of people in the adult population id.at.
a written injunctive order was entered,stating as follows 
for the reasons stated on the record,the city of new york is preliminarily enjoined from enforcing that portion of the amendments to admin.code et that prohibit the sale to and possession by adults between the ages of eighteen and twenty of aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers.
order dated may,may order.
d.the issues on this appeal 
defendants have appealed,contending that the district court erred in its application of the standard for a preliminary injunction.plaintiffs have not appealed from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction with respect to persons below the age of.
we note that the language of the may order lacks a certain precision.see generally.d e very order granting an injunction shall inter alia be specific in terms.the may order reference to amendments to et could be interpreted to encompass relevant amendments to sections of the code subsequent to,if any,as well as all amended subsections of,including,for example,subsection b,which prohibits all persons,including young adults,from possessing aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers hereinafter graffiti implements in any public place with the intent to engage in graffiti vandalism.further,the may order reference to persons between the ages of eighteen and twenty emphasis added is facially ambiguous as to the upper age of the group protected by the injunction.
plaintiffs have challenged only c and of the code,however,and the parties have litigated the constitutionality of only those two subsections.see defendants brief on appeal at,plaintiffs brief on appeal at.and both sides plainly understand that the injunction protects young adults not just to,but through,the age of,persons over the age of but under the age of see defendants brief on appeal at,plaintiffs brief on appeal at.thus,no party has raised an issue as to the propriety of the may order language.nonetheless,it would be prudent for the district court to amend the order to clarify the precise sections that are the subject of the injunction and the precise age group protected.
ii.discussion 
a motion for a preliminary injunction that would prohibit a government from taking action in furtherance of the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme should not be granted unless the moving party demonstrates both a likelihood of success on the merits,and the likelihood of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted.see,fifth avenue presbyterian church city of new york,cir bery city of new york,cir,cert.denied,d plaza health laboratories,perales,cir.we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see,ashcroft american civil liberties union,d ashcroft aclu doran salem inn,d bronx household of faith board of education,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.mastrovincenzo city of new york,cir quoting zervos verizon new york,cir.the ultimate question,however,remains whether,in light of the applicable standard,the court has abused its discretion and i f the underlying constitutional question is close,therefore,we should uphold the injunction ashcroft aclu,at.
on this appeal,defendants contend that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits of their first amendment and equal protection claims and in finding that they had demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction.although we are skeptical of the district court conclusion with respect to plaintiffs equal protection claims,see,kimel florida board of regents,d states may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the fourteenth amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest,we need not reach that basis for the district court decision because we find no abuse of discretion in the court issuance of a preliminary injunction on the basis of plaintiffs first amendment claims.
likelihood of success on the first amendment claims 
the district court properly the parties now seem in code c and are content neutral.the applicability of c and does not depend on the nature or content of the idea that an artist wishes to express but only on the materials that would be the medium of expression.in regulating the sale and possession of such materials,the challenged subsections regulate conduct and only incidentally impact the artists speech.see generally ward rock against racism,d government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so long as it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.
the appropriate standard by which to evaluate the constitutionality of a regulation that imposes only an incidental burden on speech is the intermediate level of scrutiny.see,turner broadcasting system,fcc,d clark community for creative,d.under such scrutiny,the regulation must be narrowly tailored it will be sustained if 
it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.
turner,at.quoting united states,d emphasis ours.
to satisfy this standard,a regulation need not be the least means of advancing the government interests.rather,the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.ward,supra,at.quoting united states albertini,d.narrow tailoring in this context requires,in other words,that the means chosen do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.ward,supra,at.
turner,at.emphasis ours.
thus,government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.ward,at.the essence of narrow tailoring is having the regulation focus on the source of the evils the city seeks to eliminate and eliminate them without at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not create the same evils.id.at.for example,a city has a legitimate aesthetic interest in forbidding the littering of its public areas with paper,see,martin city of struthers.schneider state of new jersey.but that could not justify a prohibition against the public distribution of handbills,even though the recipients might well toss them on the street.
a ban on handbilling,of course,would suppress a great quantity of speech that does not cause the evils that it seeks to eliminate,whether they be fraud,crime,litter,traffic congestion,or noise.see martin struthers.for that reason,a complete ban on handbilling would be substantially broader than necessary to achieve the interests justifying it.
ward,at.see also city council taxpayers for vincent,d the esthetic interest in preventing the kind of litter that may result from the distribution of leaflets on the public streets and sidewalks can not support a prophylactic prohibition against the citizen exercise of that method of expressing his views cities may adequately protect the esthetic interest in avoiding litter without abridging protected expression merely by penalizing those who actually litter.although these examples come from cases dealing with limitations on conduct that was itself expressive,they reflect the fundamental general principle,
deeply etched in our law,that a free society prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of speech after they break the law than to throttle them and all others beforehand.
southeastern promotions,conrad,d emphasis in original.
in the present case,the city contends principally that,in applying the standard,the district court erred in a interpreting subsection as prohibiting persons under the age of from possessing aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped indelible markers in all public places,defendants brief on appeal at,see defendants reply brief on appeal at anywhere in the city,and b finding that c and burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the city interest in preventing graffiti vandalism.they also argue that the court employed an inapposite overbreadth analysis,mistakenly characterized subsection c as criminalizing the purchase of spray paint or markers,and erred in finding that c and do not leave graffiti artists sufficient channels of expression and communication.defendants brief on appeal at.for the reasons that follow,we see no basis for reversal.
the scope of subsection as presented by the city in the district court 
in this court,the city has argued that does not prohibit young adults from possessing graffiti implements in all public places.at the oral argument of this appeal,the city proffered the interpretation that subsection prohibits possession of such implements on buses,trains,and subways,but does not prohibit such possession on subway platforms or on city streets or sidewalks.this is contrary,however,to the interpretation of subsection argued by defendants to the district court.
in opposing the preliminary injunction motion in the district court,defendants submitted the declaration of assistant police chief young,which,as set out in part above,described police officers as having discretion under subsection to refrain from issuing a criminal summons to a young adult who possesses graffiti implements on public property adjacent to an art school assuming he or she is an art student with a valid art school id and has just left the school or in front of a private house.young decl.this interpretation was reiterated in defendants memorandum of law.the plain implications of these examples of the city streets or sidewalks on which an officer might exercise his or her discretion to refrain from issuing a criminal summons are that subsection indeed encompasses possession of the prohibited graffiti implements on city streets and sidewalks,and if the young adult possessing the prohibited implements is not in close proximity to his or her home or art school,he or she is likely to be issued a criminal summons.
these inferences from defendants written interpretation of subsection are further supported by the interpretation given to the district court by their attorney in oral argument.for example,counsel argued that the challenged subsections represented a legislative determination that graffiti is largely caused by people who are to and that those materials should not be sold or carried in public by people in that age group.hearing transcript,april,april tr,at emphasis added.the court asked whether the statute restricts or does not restrict the possession in a public place id.at.the assistant corporation counsel responses were that 
in a public place,a person under can not possess markers or spray paint id.at 
you can not under the law carry in public,on public transportation your supplies to school id.at and 
there is no fundamental right to walk around with spray paint or markers id.at.
although on appeal defendants refer to this view of subsection as mistaken defendants brief on appeal at,they can not sensibly be sustained in their argument that the district court abused its discretion by accepting their representations.plainly,the court inference that young adults are forbidden to possess or transport graffiti implements in public accurately reflected defendants own representation that a young adult possessing graffiti implements can not,without vulnerability to prosecution under subsection,carry them in public,on public transportation and can not walk around with them in a public place.
burden on lawful speech need to reach the city goals 
nor can we see error in the district court finding that it appears,at this stage of the proceedings,that the challenged subsections impose a substantially greater burden on innocent speech than is needed for achievement of the city legitimate goal of combating graffiti vandalism.as to the need for subsection c increase of the minimum age from to for persons to whom aerosol spray paint containers and broad tipped inde
