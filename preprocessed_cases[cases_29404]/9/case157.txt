appellant tahar ahmed,a muslim and native of algeria,brought this employment discrimination action claiming that he was passed over for the position of deportation officer in the department of homeland security on account of his religion,race,and national origin.the district court granted summary judgment for appellee,the secretary of the department the department,finding that ahmed failed to rebut the department legitimate reason for choosing other applicants and thus did not raise a factual issue of impermissible animus.
based on a careful review of the record,we conclude that ahmed presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that he was a victim of discrimination.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
the events underlying this case are largely undisputed.to the extent that the parties disagree about what occurred,we adhere to the plaintiff version in keeping with our role in reviewing a grant of summary judgment.see johnson of,cir.we sketch here only the background leading up to the claim of discrimination,reserving for our later discussion a more detailed recounting of the facts pertinent to our decision.
appellant ahmed has worked as an immigration enforcement agent for immigration and customs enforcement ice since,and has been assigned throughout that period to the criminal alien program cap in the boston field office.employees who work in the cap,one of several units within ice detention and removal operations,investigate the alienage and deportability of individuals detected through the criminal justice system.from the perspective of and supervisors,ahmed has been an exemplary employee.one superior stated that he always performed at an outstanding level,and another described him as an e xcellent worker with awesome leadership,and great work ethics.
in the summer of,ice posted a vacancy announcement for the position of deportation officer,which stated that applications would be accepted from june through july.that timing was qualified,however,by the following notice,which appeared in the announcement in all capital,bold letters 
this is a two month open announcement which will be used to fill both current and future vacancies within a variety of organizational components,duty locations and grade levels.if needed,the first for receipt of applications will be june.additional dates may be established throughout the open period of the announcement.only those applications received prior to the dates will be considered.applicants are encouraged to apply early in order to maximize their opportunity for consideration.
the announcement stated that the major duties of the deportation officer position included legal research,assisting government attorneys in court,and working with both criminal and aliens at various stages of their deportation or exclusion proceedings.the specified qualifications included experience in immigration investigations and applicants would be rated based on their responses to a questionnaire asking questions about their knowledge,skills,and abilities.
on july,the boston field office requested the names of qualified applicants for each of the grade levels covered by the announcement.the ice office of human capital sent the field office lists of certified applicants for the grade and levels,each of which contained the names of seventeen candidates,along with their application materials.at that point,ahmed was not yet a candidate for the position,as he did not apply until july the final deadline for submitting an application.
on july the day before ahmed applied assistant field office director john lawler,the recommending official for the deportation officer position,forwarded to his superior the names of three individuals from the grade referral list anthony ciulla,richard lenihan,and daniel shepherd.all three are white males whose primary recent experience in ice was in the travel unit,and all of whom had been within lawler chain of command.in an affidavit,lawler stated that he recommended each applicant based upon their resume,work history and educational background,as well as on what i personally witnessed daily as they performed their duties in the burlington and boston ice offices lawler superior,deputy field office director james martin,agreed with the recommendations and forwarded the three names to the selecting official,boston field office director bruce chadbourne.
on august,the boston field office made a second request for qualified applicants for the deportation officer position.ahmed name appeared on the new grade and grade lists of certified applicants,but there is no evidence that any additional names were recommended to chadbourne based on those lists chadbourne announced the promotions of ciulla,lenihan,and shepherd on three separate occasions in september and early october in an affidavit,chadbourne said the three men were selected as the best qualified candidates based on past performance,experience,training,education and work product.he particularly praised their willingness to accept difficult duties and assignments that others would not,such as working in the travel unit.ahmed was notified on october that he was not selected for a promotion.
the record includes evidence showing a paucity of minority employees serving as deportation officers in the boston field office during chadbourne tenure as field office director.chadbourne acknowledged that no african american had served as a deportation officer in the boston headquarters during the years he ran the office,from to,although he recommended an african american woman for a deportation officer position in the hartford,connecticut office and later promoted her to assistant field office director there.chadbourne estimated that seven or eight hispanics worked as deportation officers or supervisory deportation officers during his tenure.the six new england offices had a total of about fifty deportation officers during that period 
procedural background 
ahmed filed the amended complaint underlying this action on august,alleging that he was denied the promotion to deportation officer based on his muslim religion,his race as an arab and his national origin as an algerian,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.see a.he claimed,inter alia,that he was more qualified than the three individuals selected,his outstanding record contrasted with the very poor work habits of one of the three successful applicants,and there had never been a black deportation officer in the boston field office.the department moved for summary judgment,arguing that ahmed had failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination because he was not an applicant at the time lawler made his recommendations and,even if he had established a prima facie case,there was no evidence that the selections were based on discriminatory criteria.
evaluating the evidence pursuant to the familiar analysis set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d,see infra,the district court concluded that ahmed had failed to make his case with respect to lawler and martin because they made their recommendations before he submitted his application.as to chadbourne,the district court held that ahmed failed to rebut the department assertion that the three selectees were chosen because of their qualifications.concluding that no jury considering the evidence could find the defendant explanation to be a pretext for discrimination,the court held that a trial on these issues is not warranted and,hence,granted defendant motion for summary judgment.
this appeal followed.
standard of review 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.johnson,at.in conducting our fresh look at the record,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,ahmed,and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.gerald of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a gerald,at.to determine whether a issue exists,we look to all of the record materials on file,including the pleadings,depositions,and affidavits.c a johnson,at.we may neither evaluate the credibility of witnesses nor weigh the evidence.see sheehan am.mktg,cir.summary judgment is inappropriate if the evidence is sufficiently openended to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.gerald,at internal quotation marks omitted.
legal principles 
where,as here,a claim of discrimination under title vii rests on circumstantial evidence,we apply the mcdonnell douglas analysis to help the parties sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of the employer motivation.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d see also johnson,at.under that framework,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.johnson,at.if he succeeds,an inference of discrimination arises,and the burden of production shifts to the defendant to produce evidence that the challenged employment action was taken for a legitimate,reason.id.at.if the employer supplies such evidence,the plaintiff is left with the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer proffered reason is pretextual and that the actual reason for the adverse employment action is discriminatory.id.at.
to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,ahmed needed to show that he is a member of a protected class,he was qualified for the open position of deportation officer,he was denied the position,and the position was given to someone with similar or inferior qualifications.see goncalves plymouth cnty.sheriff dep t,cir ahern shinseki,cir.although the district court acknowledged that ahmed had established each of these criteria,it concluded that he nonetheless had failed to state a prima facie case against the recommending officers,lawler and martin,because they submitted their recommendations to chadbourne before ahmed applied for the job.the court thus focused the remainder of its analysis solely on the final selections made by chadbourne.
we disagree with the court approach.particularly when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to ahmed,the key fact about timing is that the promotions were announced after he applied for the job.the record does not reveal what precipitated the request for a new list of qualified applicants after lawler and martin had forwarded their recommendations to chadbourne on july,but the evidence permits the inference that lawler and martin were provided the new lists of certified individuals in time to consider ahmed application.for example,both say in their affidavits that they chose the qualifications of the three selected individuals over ahmed neither says that he did not have the opportunity to consider ahmed application 
moreover,contrary to the department assertion at oral argument,the record contains evidence that would permit a jury to find that chadbourne also knew that ahmed had applied before the appointments were announced.most significantly,chadbourne stated in his affidavit that he had reviewed the referral lists himself,and he reported in his deposition that he must have seen ahmed application as his name appeared on the list.chadbourne also testified in his deposition that it was standard practice for the lists of certified applicants to be forwarded from the ice office of human capital to his office.lawler testified that martin gave him the first packet of application materials.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to ahmed,it is fair to infer that each set of applications was sent from the office of human capital to chadbourne office and that chadbourne or someone in his office passed the materials on to martin,who then gave them to his subordinate,lawler,whose job it was to make the promotion recommendations that went back up the line to chadbourne.given this evidence,a jury could conclude that all three men knew at the end of august before the promotions were announced that ahmed had applied.
in addition,the record does not reveal when chadbourne made the promotion decisions.so far as we know,the decisions could have been made on the days they were announced in september and october,well after ahmed submitted his application.hence,we must presume at this point that lawler and martin had the opportunity to revise their recommendations,based on the second list of certified grade applicants,before chadbourne made his selections.
accordingly,we treat the failure to promote ahmed as a single decision made by the three hiring officials.although lawler made the initial selections,martin and chadbourne affidavits reasonably may be read to say that they also weighed the candidates qualifications before endorsing the recommendations given these facts,it is unnecessary to distinguish here between the recommending employees and the ultimate decisionmaker.staub proctor,d considering the circumstances under which an employer may be held liable for employment discrimination based on the discriminatory animus of an employee who influenced,but did not make,the ultimate employment decision.
ahmed thus met his modest burden to establish a prima facie case against each of the hiring officials.lockridge of me,cir.the department,in turn,has met its burden to identify a legitimate,reason for rejecting ahmed promotion the employer conclusion that the chosen candidates had superior qualifications for purposes of the summary judgment analysis,then,the question becomes whether a reasonable jury could find that the department proffered reason is pretextual and that ahmed was in fact denied the promotion because of his religion,race,or national origin.id.stated otherwise,we must determine if there is a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination.holland gee,cir quoting smith lockheed martin,cir.
in some cases,a plaintiff alleging unlawful employment discrimination can defeat summary judgment simply by rebutting the employer given reason for choosing another candidate because,once the employer proffered justification is unmasked as pretext,the evidence that comprised the prima facie case,with the evidence of pretext,suffices to support a finding of discrimination.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.vélez thermo king de puerto rico,cir holding that employer explanation for firing employee so lacks rationality that it supports the inference that the real reason was his age domínguez cruz suttle caribe,cir explaining that introduction of additional evidence is not necessarily required when plaintiff makes prima facie showing and adduces evidence of pretext thomas eastman kodak,cir where the disparity in treatment is striking enough,a jury may infer that race was the cause,especially if no explanation is offered other than the reason rejected as pretextual.
in other instances,a jury determination that the employer explanation is pretextual will not inevitably reveal discrimination.this is so because the employer may resort to a pretext to conceal an arguably inappropriate,albeit not unlawful,motivation,such as to curry favor with a friend or family member.see,barry moran,cir noting that an employment decision motivated by cronyism,not discrimination,would be lawful,though perhaps unsavory internal quotation marks omitted keyes sec y of the navy,cir stating the need for evidence indicating that discrimination and not other factors,such as cronyism,influenced the decisionmaking process.even where a court looks to additional evidence,however,the plaintiff burden is not onerous all a plaintiff has to do is raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether discrimination motivated the adverse employment action.domínguez cruz,at internal quotation mark omitted see also pearson.bay transp,cir to defeat summary judgment,the plaintiff must offer some minimally sufficient evidence,direct or indirect,both of pretext and of the employer discriminatory animus.internal quotation marks omitted.the question is whether the record contains specific and competent evidence from which a reasonable jury could find discrimination.gerald,at.
with these principles in mind,we consider below whether a jury could conclude on this record that ahmed was passed over for promotion based on his religion,race,or national origin.
discussion 
the department contends that the decision to promote ciulla,lenihan,and shepherd was unrelated to ahmed race,religion,or national origin,and instead reflected the hiring authorities genuine determination that those three men were the best applicants for the deportation officer positions.without question,the record contains sufficient evidence for a jury to accept the department explanation.lawler,for example,cited his experience as a manager overseeing deportation officers for more than twelve years and his own eight years as a deportation officer when asserting that he could identify good applicants for the job.he explained 
the primary responsibility of a deportation officer is the ability to oversee large case management.applicants ciulla,lenihan and shepherd had all previously been assigned to the travel unit,which required them to work directly with the deportation officers in overseeing the final steps of effecting the removal of aliens.their involvement would include knowledge of the progress of the individual cases,knowledge of the immigration and nationality act,and interaction with the office of chief counsel staff on the legality of a final removal order.being assigned to the travel unit required constant interaction with deportation officers and supervisory deportation officers in the oversight of cases in removal proceedings.this responsibility certainly influenced my decision.
lawler went on to say that he deemed the three selected applicants better for the position because they were more capable of performing case management,which is the primary responsibility of a deportation officer.in his deposition,lawler stated that the most important tool in his decisionmaking process was his involvement with the successful applicants.he observed that he dealt with the three men on a regular basis,and thus had a real good idea of their work and their ability to perform duties.martin agreed with lawler recommendation based on,inter alia,the men experiences in the travel unit along with their reputation as proven performers.chadbourne echoed his subordinates sentiments.
ahmed,however,disputes the department depiction of the successful applicants qualifications and performance.he points in particular to his extended assignment to the criminal alien program,which he maintains is better training for a deportation officer than experience in the travel unit.claiming that no travel unit employee had previously been promoted to deportation officer,ahmed describes the work there as perfunctory and,hence,not meaningful preparation for becoming a deportation officer.he further claims to have trained lenihan when the latter joined the cap shortly before his promotion to deportation officer.in addition,ahmed notes that he achieved a higher score on the qualification test than any of the three men promoted,compared to their scores of,and,and he contrasts his excellent performance history with the characterization of shepherd by one of shepherd supervisors as lazy and underperforming.
the department maintains that ahmed claim of superior qualifications is merely a subjective belief unsupported by the record.see rathbun autozone,cir noting that subjective evidence of competing qualifications seldom provides a principled way for a factfinder to determine whether a given employment decision,even if,was anything more than a mistake in corporate judgment internal quotation marks omitted.to the contrary,a reasonable jury could find,on this record,that ample evidence corroborates ahmed assertion that his ice experience was more relevant to the deportation officer position than that of the selected candidates and that he had proven himself to be a significantly more valuable employee than shepherd.with respect to his performance,as noted above,the record contains sparkling appraisals of ahmed work and attitude,contrasting with negative reports of shepherd work ethic.melinda lull,a supervisory deportation officer,stated in an affidavit that ahmed always performed at an outstanding level while under my supervision,and noted in a award nomination that h e has an excellent knowledge of the laws and policy and it s application to his daily work product.in a performance review,lull stated that ahmed is one of the top producers within the criminal alien program.a,kevin williams,praised him for doing his job beyond what was expected,and reported that ahmed had established contacts within many other law enforcement departments that ha ve enabled him to be more effective in his job.
meanwhile,keith foster,an african american who worked as a supervisory immigration enforcement agent in the criminal alien program and supervised ahmed for about five months described shepherd as having one of the worst reputations as far as just being a lazy worker.foster noted that he and shepherd were friends,but foster nonetheless considered the unflattering assessment to be true and had even discussed it with shepherd himself.foster also reported that shepherd was passed over for a transfer to the cap because of his work habits and the view that other people had more value,and he recalled that shepherd was pulled from being a jail liaison because he was unreliable and complaining and not doing his duties.
to be sure,foster would not be the perfect witness to establish shepherd deficiencies.although he worked with shepherd,foster never directly supervised him and,like ahmed,foster applied for the deportation officer position and filed a discrimination claim when he was not selected.moreover,foster acknowledged that his experience with shepherd predated shepherd work in the travel unit.nonetheless,foster role as a supervisor and his more than fifteen years working at ice and its predecessor agency the immigration and naturalization service,ins would allow a jury to credit his assessments.his testimony thus creates a factual dispute concerning the relative qualities of ahmed and shepherd as employees.
ahmed evidence also countered the selecting officials assertion that work in the travel unit the touted experience of all three selected applicants was objectively preferable to work in the cap.foster described the cap as a much more demanding job than the travel unit,observing that a nyone who knows the travel unit knows it not difficult duties at all.foster noted that most of the people who previously had been promoted to deportation officer came from the criminal alien program.though conceding possible bias because he had worked in the cap and not in the travel unit,foster described the cap as particularly good training for being a deportation officer 
i f you work in a cap unit,that the best experience you can get to understand the whole operation of how every job in there works y ou initiate cases.you interview.you determine their immigration status.you have to apply the law.you have to obtain their criminal records.you have to communicate with courts and other law enforcement agencies.you create the case.the case,before it even goes to the deportation officer,is created by the cap agent.
in addition,ahmed undisputedly was a better candidate in one respect.chadbourne stated that fluency in another language was one of the considerations for the deportation officer position.ahmed has advanced language skills,while the three selectees do not also,it is noteworthy that neither lenihan nor shepherd appeared on the second list of certified candidates,perhaps indicating that they had dropped out of the top group after additional applications were submitted this evidence,taken together,goes far beyond a assertion by ahmed that he was more qualified than the successful aspirants.id.
ahmed contention that the decisionmakers reliance on qualifications is pretextual is further supported by the selection process itself.none of the three hiring officials sought information about the applicants beyond the documents provided by the ice office of human capital.they did not interview any of the aspirants and did not review any personnel records.lawler acknowledged that he made no attempt to consult with the supervisors or of individuals on the list before making his recommendations.although ciulla,lenihan,and shepherd were all under lawler in the chain of command,he was not their immediate superior and presumably could have learned more about their capabilities and performance from direct supervisors.
we do not mean to suggest that it was improper for the hiring officials to make the promotion decisions without including these steps in the evaluation process.we have repeatedly recognized that it is not our place to an employer legitimate business decisions,see,goncalves,at rathbun,at,and we would overstep our bounds if we imposed our view of an appropriate selection process on these decisionmakers.indeed,chadbourne offered a plausible explanation for the curtailed process when he testified that the agency m any times did not do interviews if there were a number of applicants.he elaborated there was a need to,because we knew the people.we knew their work product.in addition,lawler noted that he may have spoken about the applicants to their supervisors in the past since w e all worked in the same office,and he also said he constantly would communicate with his supervisors about their staff.moreover,it is undisputed that chadbourne was authorized to hire any of the applicants certified by the office of human capital.
the extent of the decisionmakers efforts to gather information about the candidates is relevant here,however,on the issue of pretext.ahmed contends that the three officials did not genuinely believe that ciulla,lenihan,and shepherd were the best qualified applicants,and that those officials selected three less capable applicants over him because of his race,religion,or national origin evidence that the hiring officials did not seek out all pertinent information about the candidates abilities and job performance would support that theory the jurors could infer from a limited inquiry that the officials falsely claimed to have sought the best candidates for promotion.
the record thus permits two substantially different portrayals of ahmed candidacy as compared to those of ciulla,lenihan,and shepherd.in one view,ahmed language skills and tenure in the criminal alien program provided him with the most pertinent resume for the deportation officer position,and his exemplary record stands in stark contrast to shepherd reputation as an.in addition,the selection process reflected a perfunctory or inquiry from readily available sources into the applicants relative qualifications.in the other view,ciulla,lenihan and shepherd were the candidates better suited for the position because of their ability and willingness to perform the demanding work of the travel unit,and lawler was well positioned to make this assessment because he had knowledge of their work.
determining which view more accurately reflects reality requires factfinding and credibility judgments that are properly the task of a jury.ahmed claim of pretext would be significantly advanced if the jury found that the criminal alien program has traditionally been recognized as the best training ground for deportation officers,and that the travel unit is widely acknowledged as less demanding.such findings would undermine the department insistence that the selected candidates had more opportunity to develop the skills needed by deportation officers.similarly,a jury could choose to credit the negative evidence concerning shepherd work habits and thus discredit the hiring officials professed reliance on the quality of the successful candidates performance.
as explained above,however,the jury would need to conclude not only that the department rationale is pretextual,but also that its asserted preference for the selected applicants conceals an impermissible discriminatory motivation.we therefore now consider whether ahmed has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was not promoted on account of his religion,race,or national origin.see pearson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
discriminatory animus 
as an initial matter,we reject any suggestion that a finding of discriminatory animus requires evidence that the decisionmakers knew specifically that ahmed is a muslim and native of algeria.the record contains more than adequate evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that the decisionmakers viewed ahmed as a member of multiple minority groups.as noted above,chadbourne testified that he believed ahmed was african american,an impression evidently based on visual observation and,hence,likely to be shared by lawler and martin.a jury also could find that all three men knew,or believed,that ahmed was of arab heritage.his name is suggestive and his resume states that he has advanced skills in reading,writing,and speaking arabic.chadbourne stated that he had heard that ahmed was lebanese.further,foster testified that he had heard ahmed former supervisor and a lot of people address ahmed as habibi an arabic greeting that is commonly understood to mean friend or darling and he also reported speaking with other employees about ahmed being a muslim.a jury reasonably could conclude that lawler,martin,and chadbourne were exposed to such exchanges,particularly given ahmed testimony that he interact ed with upper management on a daily basis,and i know them all personally.
the question remains whether ahmed has also adduced the requisite evidence to permit a jury to find that his race,religion,or heritage played a motivating role in the decision to bypass him for promotion.although the record contains no evidence of overt discriminatory conduct or remarks,the mcdonnell douglas framework is premised on the reality that o utright admissions of impermissible discriminatory motivation are infrequent.hunt cromartie,d see also,vélez,at noting that employment discrimination plaintiffs rarely possess smoking gun evidence to prove their employers discriminatory motivations.moreover,unlawful discrimination can stem from stereotypes and other types of cognitive biases,as well as from conscious animus.thomas,at see also bray marriott hotels,cir noting that title vii should not be applied in a manner that ignores the sad reality that discriminatory animus can all too easily warp an individual perspective to the point that he or she never considers the member of a protected class the best candidate regardless of that person credentials.hence,a plaintiff showing of unlawful animus will not necessarily be deemed inadequate for lack of explicitly discriminatory behaviors.
as explained above,sufficient evidence to support a finding of pretext,in combination with the plaintiff prima facie showing,can suffice at times to raise an inference of discrimination that will defeat summary judgment.see domínguez cruz,at.here,however,we have more than that combination.an employer general policy and practice with respect to minority employment can be significant in assessing discriminatory animus,and ahmed has offered telling evidence of a pattern of bypassing minorities for promotion in ice boston office.mcdonnell douglas,at see also mesnick,at,
most significantly,the record reveals a history of hiring and promotions that entirely excluded african americans and,perhaps,muslims from deportation officer positions in boston.chadbourne conceded the absence of black deportation officers in that office throughout his tenure as field office director though he emphasized his selection of the one african american who held that position in any of the new england ice offices in hartford.chadbourne also reported that,to his knowledge,there were no arab or muslim deportation officers in boston during that time.
in addition,ahmed produced evidence depicting an atmosphere in the boston office that was unwelcoming to minorities and hindered their advancement.in his affidavit,ahmed asserted that it is widely known locally,as well as nationally,that the boston office is not diversely populated,and similar observations were made by an hispanic immigration enforcement a
