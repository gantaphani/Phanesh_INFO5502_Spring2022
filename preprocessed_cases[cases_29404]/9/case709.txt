appellant brian kvorjak claims that his former employer,the maine department of labor,wrongfully failed to accommodate his disability when it refused to allow him to work at home after his office closed and his position was relocated to a distant facility.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on his federal and state claims concluding that he had failed to offer evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he could accomplish essential aspects of his job at home.see.after a close review of the record and caselaw,we affirm.
appellant is partially paralyzed as a result of spina bifida,a condition he has had since birth.the condition limits his ability to walk,causes problems with his bowels and bladder,and at times triggers pain when he sits,stands or lies down.despite these difficulties,appellant successfully worked for various state agencies in maine for years,the last seven and as a claims adjudicator for the department of labor division of unemployment field services the division.in that most recent position,he was assigned to an office in rockland,maine,a commute from his home.
in the,the division decided to cut expenses by closing fifteen field offices,including the rockland office,and shifting services to three call centers in other parts of the state.to assist with the transfer,the division sent out two surveys asking employees if they would consider relocating to a call center.in both surveys,appellant indicated that he would be able to work in a call center and listed bangor as his primary choice.
before the transfer in,however,appellant drove the commute from his home to bangor on two consecutive days.the lengthy drive resulted in substantial pain.realizing that he could not commute three hours every day,he applied for a disability pension and asked that he be permitted to use his accumulated sick time until his pension request was processed.the state denied his request to use sick time,and appellant contacted the disability rights center the center.
after consultation with the center,appellant in may requested the accommodation of working at home on a,permanent basis he supplemented his request with a letter from his physician stating that the commute to bangor every day would have a detrimental impact on his health.the doctor also stated that any effort that can be made to allow him to work locally would be highly appropriate and medically indicated.
the division rejected appellant request,stating that the department of labor had checked with the new england business and technical assistance center and the equal employment opportunity commission and had concluded that commuting to the job is not a covered activity under the ada.it noted that it had received other requests from division employees to work at home because of the office consolidation,and had denied all of them.the state,however,did offer to pay relocation costs if appellant moved closer to a call center,a benefit provided to all employees,and also offered to pay for temporary housing appellant declined to move,and he was laid off on june.that same day,kathleen dunford,director of the office of human resources for the department,offered in a telephone conversation to assist him in finding another local job.
in october,the state notified appellant of a job opening in bangor for a claims same position he had left four months earlier.appellant expressed interest,but again requested the accommodation of working at home.the request again was denied.appellant subsequently filed complaints with the mhrc challenging both the original layoff and the later failure to him.the state continued to maintain that it had no obligation to ameliorate appellant commuting difficulties in its view,he was no different from employees who sought the same accommodation of working at home because of the inconvenience of relocating.see this subchapter does not prohibit an employer from discharging an individual with physical or mental disability if the individual,because of the physical or mental disability,is unable to be at,remain at or go to or from the place where the duties of employment are to be performed.the mhrc investigator,however,without determining whether appellant could perform the essential functions of the job at home relying on a supervisor statement that the job could be restructured if the law required,found reasonable grounds to believe that appellant had been subjected to unlawful disability discrimination.
appellant filed his lawsuit in june,asserting that the state rejection of his request to work at home violated federal and state disability laws.in a motion for summary judgment,the state argued that it was not obliged to accommodate appellant because his request to work at home stemmed not from his disability but from a personal preference against moving,and it emphasized that appellant could not in any event perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at home.the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation that summary judgment be granted for defendants,and this appeal followed.we review the district court decision de novo,assessing the facts in the light most favorable to appellant,the nonmoving party.reed lepage bakeries,lst cir.
ii.the interactive process 
before delving into the substance of the accommodation issue,we address appellant contention that the state violated the ada by failing to utilize an informal,interactive process to make an individualized assessment of his needs and abilities.the statute implementing regulations state that it may be necessary for an employer to initiate a dialogue with an employee in order to determine an appropriate accommodation.see o.courts have construed the regulation as imposing various levels of obligation.see barnett united states,cir en banc citing cases,petition for cert.granted in part sub nom us airways barnett,d even in the most rigorous version,however,such as the ninth circuit mandatory obligation in all cases,see humphrey mem.hosps.ass n,cir,petition for cert.filed,june,liability nonetheless depends on a finding that,had a good faith interactive process occurred,the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job essential functions,see humphrey,at barnett,at.
this court has not taken so categorical a stand on the interactive process,preferring instead to resolve the issue on a basis.see phelps optima health,cir ward.health research,cir jacques group,cir.although we have noted that there may be situations in which failure to engage in the process would constitute a failure to provide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation of the ada,jacques,at see also lederle parenterals,cir reversing summary judgment for employer and granting judgment for employee where company had simply rejected the request for the accommodation without further discussion,but not deciding the interactive process issue,we also consider such an omission of no moment if the record forecloses a finding that the plaintiff could perform the duties of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation,see fed.exp,cir.
this being the status of the law,appellant has failed to demonstrate an actionable failure to engage in interactive communication.as we explain in the following section,the record can not support a finding that he is able to perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at his home.in addition,we do not view the circumstances here to constitute the extreme failure to engage in meaningful dialogue that appellant attempts to depict.when appellant asked to work at home because of the new commuting distance,the state had no reason to suspect that his disability also posed issues related to office work.he had been performing the claims adjudicator position at the rockland office with little or no accommodation for more than seven years and,indeed,the doctor who submitted a letter of support for his request saw no problem with him engaging in the type of activities he has been doing 
in a setting of institutional change,with requests to work at home from other employees also seeking to avoid the commute,and after inquiry into statutory requirements the state decision to reject an accommodation based on appellant commute does not demonstrate a disregard for its obligations under the ada.it is unsurprising that state officials would reject such an accommodation if it were not required by the ada,out of a legitimate concern that allowing him such an arrangement would set a precedent for other employees.
moreover,the state did communicate with appellant,making efforts to accommodate his disability with offers to help him both relocate and search for a new job in the rockland area.in addition,after the mhrc adverse finding in december,the department of labor offered him a job in an office in rockland.by that time,however,appellant felt he could no longer work in an office reflecting a shift in his focus from the single issue of his inability to commute to the additional problems presented by office work.the state,however,also had gone beyond the issue of the commute to assert that the essential functions of appellant job could not be performed at his home.
this is not to say that the state behavior was ideal.a discussion might have allowed a more complete understanding of the needs and issues on both sides and avoided appellant understandable sense of frustration and ill treatment appellant,too,however,must bear some responsibility for inadequate communication.his counsel at oral argument made clear that his exceptional job performance for at least a portion of his tenure as a claims adjudicator was not without significant physical sacrifices.yet,so far as the record shows,the state had no reason to know of the extraordinary measures he had been taking to minimize the difficulties of working at the rockland office.see reed,at employee request for accommodation must be sufficiently direct and specific to provide employer with notice of need eeoc interpretive guidance,pt,app.at in general,it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.had the state understood at the outset that appellant need for accommodation was not,in fact,limited to commuting,there is no reason to doubt that the interaction would have progressed differently.
in sum,the circumstances here do not show an egregious failure to engage in the interactive process.we now turn to consider whether the law required the state to provide appellant the accommodation of working at home.
iii.essential functions and reasonable accommodation 
to obtain relief under the ada,a plaintiff must demonstrate that 
he was disabled within the meaning of the act he was a qualified individual,able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation and he was discharged because of his disability.
ward,at.the state concedes that appellant meets the statutory definition of disability.the dispute centers on the second inquiry,whether he was a qualified individual under the ada the particular question we face here is whether appellant can perform the essential functions of the position if given the accommodation he seeks,working at home.the district court concluded as a matter of law that he could not,based on the state evidence that several important functions performed by claims adjudicators could not be accomplished in appellant home.appellant contends that the state both underestimates what reasonably can be done in a home setting and improperly characterizes as essential certain functions that require an office setting.
we recently have confirmed that the plaintiff bears the burden of proposing an accommodation that would enable him to perform his job effectively and is,at least on the face of things,reasonable.phelps,at reed,at.this necessarily entails a showing that the accommodation would effectively enable him to perform his job,reed,at.as a starting point,therefore,appellant must offer evidence that he can perform the essential functions of a claims adjudicator at home.this turns out to be both the beginning and the end of our analysis.
an essential function is a fundamental job duty of the position at issue.see ward,at n.the term does not include marginal tasks,but may encompass individual or idiosyncratic characteristics of the job,ward,at quoting laurin providence,cir.in the absence of evidence of discriminatory animus,courts generally give substantial weight to the employer judgment as to what functions are essential.see also.other evidence also is relevant,including written job descriptions,consequences of not requiring the function,work experience of past incumbents,and work experience of current incumbents.ward,at citing n.
the record contains both a task statement for the claims adjudicator position at a processing center and a list labeled essential functions of a claims adjudicator,the latter of which is simply a shortened version of the former.the task statement contains nine items,and six of them are identified as essential functions in the other document.the first three essential tasks generally describe the job of adjudicating we shall call the adjudicator function and the other three involve the provision of information and guidance to a variety of individuals both inside and outside the our shorthand,the advisor function.
appellant focuses on the adjudicator function and maintains that there is at least a factual dispute as to whether it can be performed by him at his home.he plausibly contends that he could conduct interviews by telephone at home,write decisions,and enter all necessary data into a personal computer.although the state has raised concerns about the confidentiality of records that might be needed in the process,its counsel acknowledged at oral argument that that concern perhaps could be met if it were the only obstacle.indeed,it appears that other department of labor routinely work at home with confidential documents,albeit not on a full time basis.moreover,there is no evidence that the benefits decisions must be made on extremely tight deadlines,and gaining access to records kept at the office or within the division secure computer system would thus seem logistically feasible 
although adjudicating claims may be the core function of appellant former its claims adjudicator advisor function looms large in both the written task statement and the testimonial evidence presented by the state.in a lengthy affidavit,boyett described the transition of the division services from decentralized field offices,such as the one in which appellant worked in rockland,to the call center model,which consolidated the division operations in three offices serving a statewide clientele.in the call center system,unemployment claims are submitted via telephone and routed automatically to one of the three centers in a manner intended to equalize workloads among the locations.
claims adjudicators are the most senior,technical resource at the call centers,and one function resulting from that experienced status is to serve as adjudicator of the day approximately once a week.boyett explained the role as follows 
adjudicators of the day are the primary people responsible for and problem resolution for that day.their names are posted in visible locations within the call centers so that claims staff know who to go to with questions and problems.they remain accessible so that they can help other employees at the other employees workstations if needed.for example,claims adjudicators might help another employee conduct research on the computer database,plug into an employee telephone to assist with a telephone call,or take a portion of a call at their own workstation to resolve a problem before transferring the call back to the other employee or terminating the call.
boyett further stated that,since the change to call centers,claims adjudicators have more often served as a technical resource for other employees because the number of supervisors was reduced from seventeen to six statewide,making them less available for individual questions.although some of this assistance could be provided by phone,it is primarily provided in person because it usually requires jointly reviewing
