opinion of the court 
appellants randy mulholland and christine kurtz appeal a decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania rendered during trial,granting judgment as a matter of law against them on the claims they brought under against berks county,pennsylvania for the following reasons,we will affirm.
a.the july incident 
in july,mulholland and kurtz,who consider themselves married under the common law,were separated they agreed that on the night of july,their daughter,linda kurtz,who was visiting from texas where she lived with kurtz mother,would stay at mulholland apartment.linda called kurtz that evening and said that mulholland was drunk and was making her feel uncomfortable.kurtz promptly called the police and went to pick up linda.when the police arrived at mulholland apartment,they interviewed linda.a police report from that night contains a statement from linda that mulholland masturbated in her presence and made sexual comments to her,including that he was horny,wanted her to rub his private parts,and want ed to hump her butt.app.at.the report also indicates that the police notified children services,the berks county office of children and youth services bccys,of the incident.app.at.
separate from the police investigation and subsequent investigation by bccys,kurtz filed a petition for protection from abuse against mulholland in the berks county court of common pleas on july,accusing him of seeking sex from linda a protection from abuse order was entered after mulholland failed to appear at two hearings.
bccys received the report of suspected child abuse from the police and assigned caseworker brandy neider to investigate.on august,neider completed a document known as a cy form,classifying mulholland as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse,and she sent it to pennsylvania statewide child abuse registry.that registry,known as childline,is operated and maintained by the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw neider stated in her report that linda made consistent and believable statements to a caseworker and a collateral source,and confirmed the statements she had made to the police regarding mulholland inappropriate behavior.app.at.the report also indicated that when kurtz arrived at the apartment to retrieve linda,she saw mulholland in bikini underwear with an erection.app.at.neider noted that mulholland did not respond to a request for an interview.app.at.based on the cy form,mulholland was listed on childline as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse.
mulholland was arrested and charged on july,with indecent exposure and endangering the welfare of a child.the complaint was later amended to include a harassment charge.mulholland pled guilty on september,to the harassment charge,for which he paid a fine,and the remaining charges were dismissed 
subsequent contacts with bccys 
in the years following the july incident,the mulholland kurtz family had further encounters with bccys.in,linda ran away from her grandmother home in texas,where she was still living at the time.when she arrived at the bus terminal in reading,pennsylvania,she called mulholland and asked him to pick her up.mulholland retrieved her from the bus station,called bccys,and agreed to put her in a shelter until she could be returned to texas.a bccys caseworker told linda that she could not see her father because he did something with her.app.at.according to her trial testimony in this action,linda denied the allegation at the time,but the caseworker said she did not care and did not want to hear it.app.at.
in,mulholland and kurtz son irvin was adjudicated delinquent for raping his younger cousin.in connection with that incident,bccys proposed a family service plan in which it identified mulholland as a perpetrator.mulholland and kurtz,who had resumed living together,refused the agency services.in response to the family service plan,a lawyer representing mulholland and kurtz sent a letter to bccys,stating 
y our documentation refers to mulholland as being a perpetrator.it appears that you are insinuating that there has been sexual abuse committed by mulholland.this allegation and reference is unfounded and you should immediately cease and desist from any such reference and delete any such reference from you r records.
app.at.several days later,the lawyer sent a second letter to bccys threatening that,if any bccys record containing allegations of sexual abuse was not immediately expunged,mulholland would take legal action.bccys never responded to either letter,and mulholland took no further action.
on august,a bccys caseworker visited appellants home to inquire about a child of brenda heddy.heddy is kurtz and had,along with her six children,moved in with mulholland and kurtz.the caseworker concluded that the children were safe since all adults in the home heddy,kurtz,and mulholland understood that barry kurtz,the children father,was not allowed to be alone with any of the children because he was listed as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse on childline.the caseworker gave no indication that mulholland himself was similarly listed on childline.a bccys caseworker visited the home again in october and again concluded that all children in the home were safe.
mulholland contacted bccys in september,after kurtz took their granddaughter away from the home of the child parents,irvin and his girlfriend,who,in kurtz view,were neglecting.a bccys caseworker visited mulholland and kurtz home on september,and determined that could stay there over the weekend.no indication was given that mulholland might pose a threat to the children safety.
on september,mulholland and kurtz appeared before a judge of the berks county court of common pleas.in the presence of multiple bccys employees,the judge issued an order granting temporary custody of to kurtz.when mulholland and kurtz returned home with that evening,however,they encountered a group of bccys caseworkers and police officers.following the custody proceeding,bccys had obtained an emergency court order to remove mulholland and kurtz two teenage children,heddy children,and from the home,based on mulholland listing on childline as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse.mulholland and kurtz children were returned to kurtz approximately six weeks later,after kurtz moved into a separate residence.the heddy children were not returned to the care of heddy and kurtz until june 
mulholland and kurtz later testified that they were not told of mulholland listing on childline until march and that prior to that time they were unaware of the listing.that claim is puzzling not only because mulholland,through counsel,had responded in to a bccys statement that he was a child abuse perpetrator,but also because the confrontation with bccys caseworkers and the police in september should surely have given mulholland and kurtz some idea of mulholland childline listing.nevertheless,they say that,upon first becoming aware of the childline listing in march,they took steps to remove him from the registry.the criminal charges of indecent exposure and endangering the welfare of a child,which had been dismissed in but remained on mulholland criminal record,were expunged on may,via a court order.by the time mulholland attempted to appeal his childline listing in late,bccys had destroyed its records of the investigation pursuant to a provision of the pennsylvania child protective services law cpsl that requires county agencies to destroy all records about a child when he or she reaches the age of mulholland did not appeal his childline listing until shortly after linda had turned.
in,dpw bureau of hearings and found that dpw had not sent notice to mulholland in at the time he was listed on childline,and it ordered a hearing on the merits.at the merits hearing,bccys argued that mulholland status should be changed from indicated perpetrator to founded perpetrator because he had pled guilty to the harassment charge arising from the july incident by order dated march,however,the bureau of hearings and appeals adopted the recommendation of an administrative law judge who found that no substantial evidence existed to maintain mulholland listing on childline as even an indicated perpetrator of child abuse.the decision was affirmed upon reconsideration by dpw and on appeal to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania.the childline listing was expunged as of july.
trial and procedural history 
on october,mulholland and kurtz brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against berks county,bccys,and bccys executive director george kovarie in his official capacity.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to the claims against bccys and kovarie mulholland and kurtz remaining claims against berks county proceeded to trial.they claimed that the county was liable for bccys violations of their procedural and substantive due process rights.more specifically,the claims at trial were that the county was liable for failing to conduct an adequate investigation before reporting mulholland to childline as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse failing to notify mulholland of bccys recommendation to list him as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse on childline failing to update childline with exculpatory information,namely,that a the child sex abuse charges against mulholland were eventually dropped and he pled guilty only to harassing christine kurtz,b linda recanted her allegations against mulholland to a bccys caseworker in,and c mulholland denied through his attorney in that he was a perpetrator removing mulholland and kurtz children and grandchild and the heddy children from their home in and attempting to change mulholland status from indicated to founded during the appeals process.
at trial,appellants presented the testimony of various family members,including mulholland,kurtz,and linda.all three testified that nothing warranting a child services investigation occurred that consequential evening of july,that mulholland never made any statements or took any actions of a sexual nature.linda even claimed that she could not recall saying anything to anyone that indicated that her father did anything or said anything sexual.app.at.
they also testified that neither bccys nor the police ever contacted them to investigate the incident.linda testified,for example,that she never spoke with the police or any caseworker from bccys,including neider.mulholland and kurtz further testified that they did not recall ever receiving notice from bccys or dpw regarding mulholland placement on childline.in fact,they reaffirmed,they had no clue that mulholland had been listed on childline until march when bccys finally provided the reason for taking the children from their home.
in her testimony,kurtz sought to downplay evidence that she herself had accused mulholland of inappropriate behavior toward linda in july.she insisted that she filed a petition for protection from abuse against mulholland only because he broke his word by getting drunk in front of linda and her brother,and because she interpreted linda statement that mulholland had made her uncomfortable to mean that he was making remarks about kurtz.app.at.that made her mad,she testified,so she put down that mulholland was talking dirty to linda,even though it was not true,so he could get visits anymore.app.at.in addition,mulholland testified that he understood that he had pled guilty to harassing kurtz in september,not linda.
appellants also called two bccys employees,george kovarie and brandy neider,to testify.each testified regarding bccys policies and customs,and neider testified about her involvement in the investigation by bccys.neider,who at the time of trial was the director of bccys intake services department,had been a caseworker in in the sexual abuse unit.although she had no independent recollection of her investigation in linda case,neider relied on the existing documentation of the investigation to testify that she had indeed interviewed linda.in particular,in the cy form,neider said that linda made consistent and believable statements that mulholland had engaged in the alleged inappropriate behavior.app.at.the form also stated that mulholland did not respond to a request for an interview.id.neider testified that the existing documentation was consistent with her usual investigation practices,and she indicated that,under identical circumstances today,she would still conclude that the report of sexual abuse against mulholland was indicated.
regarding bccys policies and customs,both kovarie and neider said that the mission of bccys is to protect children and to preserve family integrity as provided by the cpsl.each caseworker reports to a supervisor,who in turn reports to a departmental director.newly hired bccys caseworkers go through hours of training on all of the agency functions,before they are certified for direct service with families.they also receive a minimum of twenty hours of training each year.neider,as the director of intake services,develops and applies policies and procedures in that area.she testified that bccys,as a matter of policy,follows the child abuse investigation and reporting requirements of the cpsl and accompanying regulations.
neider also testified that,although the cpsl does not require it,bccys has an internal policy of sending a letter to alleged perpetrators at the conclusion of an investigation,at the same time it submits the cy form to childline,to provide notice of the agency status determination.bccys caseworkers receive training in sending out such notices.neider testified that she could not recall any other situation in which an individual had complained about not receiving a notice from bccys.
with respect to bccys statutory duty to provide supplemental information to childline even after an indicated report has been submitted neider testified that bccys has a policy of submitting cy forms to report birth dates,social security numbers,or additional evidence of abuse,but not to report exculpatory information.accordingly,as neider described the policy,bccys does not submit a cy form when an alleged victim of abuse later recants or when an alleged perpetrator denies culpability.instead,bccys leaves it to the appeals process provided by the cpsl to determine whether a report status should be changed to unfounded.
kovarie,the director of bccys,testified that individual caseworkers lack the authority to unilaterally remove children from a home.rather,bccys must first petition a court for an order requiring the removal of the children,and,before it files such a petition,bccys complies with an internal policy that at least three bccys supervisors must review and sign off on the petition.kovarie testified that this process was followed when bccys decided to petition the juvenile court for the removal of children from appellants home.
after appellants rested their,berks county moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.as discussed in greater detail below,the court granted that motion,and this timely appeal followed.
mulholland and kurtz reassert on appeal their claim under that berks county is liable for violating their procedural and substantive due process rights.section provides 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law 
when a suit against a municipality is based on,the municipality can only be liable when the alleged constitutional transgression implements or executes a policy,regulation or decision officially adopted by the governing body or informally adopted by custom.beck city of pittsburgh,cir citing monell city of social,d.in other words,the county may not be held liable for constitutional torts under on a vicarious liability theory rooted in respondeat superior,andrews city of,cir,but it can be held responsible as an entity when the injury inflicted is permitted under its adopted policy or custom.beck,at.
based on the supreme court reasoning in the landmark monell case,courts have recognized a track to municipal liability under,depending on whether the allegation is based on municipal policy or custom.beck,at.
policy is made when a decisionmaker possess ing final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action issues an official proclamation,policy,or edict.a course of conduct is considered to be a custom when,though not authorized by law,such practices of state officials are so permanent and as to virtually constitute law.
andrews,at citations omitted alterations in original.custom may also be established by evidence of knowledge and acquiescence.beck,at.
an official has policymaking authority for monell purposes when the official is responsible as a matter of state law for making policy in the particular area of county business in question,and the official authority to make policy in that area is final and unreviewable.hill borough of kutztown,cir.
thus,to establish municipal liability under,appellants must show that they were deprived of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,and that the deprivation of those rights was the result of an official government policy or custom.using that framework,we analyze each of appellants constitutional claims.
procedural due process claims 
mulholland and kurtz contend that the district court erroneously granted judgment against them on their procedural due process claims against berks county.to state a claim under for deprivation of procedural due process rights,a plaintiff must allege that he was deprived of an individual interest that is encompassed within the fourteenth amendment protection of life,liberty,or property,and the procedures available to him did not provide due process of law.hill,at.to determine what process is due in a particular situation,courts consider three factors first,the private interest at stake second,the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used and the probable value of different procedures and third,the government interest.see mathews eldridge,d.the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.to sustain a claim under based on a violation of procedural due process,mulholland and kurtz must,at a minimum,prove recklessness or gross negligence and in some instance may be required to show a deliberate decision to deprive the plaintiff of due process.jordan fox,rothschild,frankel,cir.
inadequate investigation 
appellants point out that,on one hand,multiple members of the mulholland kurtz family testified consistently that there was no investigation appellants opening br.at emphasis omitted,that in fact no one involved was ever contacted or interviewed directly by bccys neider regarding the incident id.at.on the other hand,neider,w ith no independent recollection of her investigation,and relying solely on the form,claimed at trial that she spoke to linda at the time of the july incident.id.at.based on that conflicting testimony,appellants argue,i t was up to the jury to decide whether bccys s investigation was constitutionally adequate.id.at.
the district court declined to decide whether bccys investigation was inadequate such that it violated mulholland procedural due process rights.instead,the court found that t here is no evidence that bccys has a policy or custom of conducting inadequate investigations into allegations of child abuse.dist.op.at.to the contrary,the only evidence presented in mulholland and kurtz was that bccys has a policy of complying with the procedures set forth by the cpsl.id.thus,the court determined that even if bccys investigation was inadequate,it can not be said to have been influenced by some policy or custom of bccys.id.
the district court was correct.without more,berks county,the municipality of which bccys is simply an agency,can not be held liable under for a single caseworker alleged deviation from the requirements of the cpsl.see andrews city of philadelphia,cir supervisory liability can not be based solely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior.there is no evidence that bccys employs a policy or has a custom of conducting desultory investigations,and the district court correctly declined to subject berks county to municipal liability for that claim.
failure to provide notice at the conclusion of the investigation 
the district court ruled as a matter of law against appellants claim that the county,through bccys,violated their constitutional rights by failing to notify mulholland of his listing on childline,because the cpsl allocates the responsibility for providing notice of a childline listing to the department of public welfare,not the county agency.op.at citing,a.in so holding,the court acknowledged that dpw bureau of hearings and appeals found that mulholland did not receive proper notice from dpw,which is not a party in this case,but the court held that the county can not be held liable for dpw failure to send proper notice.op.at.the court noted that bccys policy of notifying alleged child abuse perpetrators of the results of an investigation goes beyond what the cpsl requires.op.at.and t here is no evidence that bccys has a widespread practice of failing to provide notice in accordance with its internal policy.op.at.the only testimony about the notification practice at bccys was provided by neider,who testified that she could not recall another situation in which an individual claimed not to have received notice from bccys.op.at.
we agree.not only does the statutory duty to inform an individual that he is to be listed on childline fall upon dpw and not bccys,see providing that childline shall provide notice to an individual that an indicated report of child abuse has been entered into the statewide central register,but,even if bccys were responsible for notifying alleged predators,a failure to do so would not subject the county to municipal liability under because it does not show that the failure resulted from an agency policy or custom.the only evidence regarding the bccys practice in that regard shows instead that the agency consistently complied with its internal policy of notifying the subject of a report of child abuse of the result of its investigation.the district court thus correctly ruled against appellants on that claim.
failure to update childline with exculpatory information 
mulholland and kurtz argue that the county violated their procedural due process rights by failing to update childline when bccys became aware of information that cast doubt on the child abuse allegations against mulholland.the evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that this claim was based on an actual bccys policy,as opposed to the allegedly unconstitutional actions of an isolated employee.neider testified that bccys has a policy of submitting cy forms to childline to report birth dates,social security numbers,or additional evidence of abuse,but not to report exculpatory information,including denials and recantations.accordingly,bccys does not submit a cy form when an alleged victim of abuse later recants or when an alleged perpetrator denies culpability after bccys investigation has concluded.instead,bccys leaves it to dpw appeals process to determine whether a report status should be changed.
despite bccys policy,the district court rejected appellants monell claim because appellants did not offer any support for their view that the due process clause requires a county agency to report exculpatory information after it has completed its investigation and submitted a report to childline.op.at.the district court went on to say that,g iven that the cpsl provides for notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard through the appeals process,there is no basis for imposing on county agencies an additional constitutional burden to update upon receiving exculpatory information.op.at.
that is entirely correct.the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews,at internal quotation marks omitted.the essence of appellants claim regarding exculpatory information is that bccys policy denied them their opportunity to have that new information made of record.but the process provided by the cpsl allows a subject of a report of child abuse the opportunity to air new information at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner and due process does not require more that holds true even if we give full credit to mulholland claim that he did not receive notice of his childline listing.as we have explained,see supra part,the blame for failing to notify mulholland lies with dpw,not with berks county.the county can not be faulted for relying on the statutory notice and appeals process when the alleged breakdown in that process occurred at the hands of a state agency 
substantive due process claims 
in addition to their procedural due process claims,mulholland and kurtz raised two substantive due process claims,both of which the district court rejected.to establish a substantive due process violation by a municipality,a plaintiff must show that executive action was so or malicious that it shocks the conscience.miller city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,a child welfare agency abridges an individual substantive due process rights when its actions exceed both negligence and deliberate indifference,and reach a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.id.at see also somerset cnty.children and youth,cir a substantive due process claim requires by a social worker that is so clearly arbitrary that it can properly be said to shock the conscience.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
that standard is met if the child is removed without an objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse,based on the information available at the time.croft westmoreland cnty.children and youth,cir.absent such reasonable grounds,governmental intrusions of this type are arbitrary abuses of power.id.that is because a state has no interest in protecting children from their parents unless it has some reasonable and articulable evidence giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a child has been abused or is in imminent danger of abuse.id.reasonable suspicion is lacking when a child welfare agency has consciously disregarded a great risk that there had been no abuse.ziccardi city of,cir 
removal of mulholland and kurtz children and grandchild 
appellants contend that the removal of their children and grandchild from their home in violated their substantive due process rights the district court denied that claim as a matter of law because,although municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances,mcgreevy stroup,cir internal quotation marks omitted,plaintiffs offered no proof at trial that an individual with policymaking authority actually reviewed the petition that led to the september,court order.op.at.the court held,therefore,that appellants have not established that bccys role in the removal of their children and grandchild from their home was pursuant to an official policy or custom id,and it declined to address whether appellants underlying constitutional claim had merit.
mulholland and kurtz argue that that holding is nonsensical.appellants opening br.at.they point to the testimony of george kovarie,who testified that petitions to remove children from a home are made by a petition review committee,and they assert that the committee in this case must have comprised final decision makers.id.at.the committee actions,they say,thus represented an official act of the agency.id.at.
as to the merits of their due process claim,appellants contend that t here was no reason or articulable evidence at the time the children were removed from the home that the children were being abused.id.at.in fact,they contend,bccys own investigations in,and demonstrated that there was no risk of harm to the children,and the removal of the children from the family home in september of was therefore made without an objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse.id.at.in their view,bccys decision to remove the children from the home was thus an arbitrary abuse of power that shocks the conscience id.at,and was made without any reasonable suspicion that child abuse was occurring in the home.
we disagree with appellants characterization of bccys efforts in this case,and likewise disagree with their conclusions.t he initial question in a section action is whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.estate of smith marasco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,bccys had reasonable suspicion that,given mulholland listing on childline as an indicated perpetrator of child abuse,the children were at sufficient risk to justify seeking their removal.
this case is much different than croft,upon which appellants principally rely to argue that mulholland listing on childline was insufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion of child abuse.in croft,we held that a child services agency lacked objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse justifying the forced separation of a father from his wife and child,when the only evidence of abuse was a hearsay report by an anonymous informant and when the father,mother,and daughter all provided consistent and credible statements that no abuse had occurred.croft,at.absent reasonable suspicion,we held that governmental intrusions of this type are arbitrary abuses of power.id.
unlike the anonymous and vague report of child abuse against the father in croft,the report against mulholland in was based on specific,credible,contemporaneous,and mutually consistent evidence,including interviews with linda kurtz,who said that mulholland masturbated in her presence and sexually propositioned her.bccys suspicions were accordingly much more concrete than those of the child services agency in croft.what more,mulholland had pled guilty to a harassment charge in connection with the incident and had never challenged his listing on childline through the administrative appeals process provided by the cpsl,so bccys had no sound reason to disbelieve the allegations against him this is in stark contrast to croft,where the facts available to the county child services agency raised serious questions about the veracity of the anonymous informant.croft,at.
nor have appellants provided sufficient proof that the defendants consciously disregarded,not just a substantial risk,but a great risk that their concern about the children was not.ziccardi,at.appellants argue that bccys abrupt and drastic measures are so arbitrary as to shock the conscience,because bccys had had several interactions with mulholland without raising concerns over his presence in the home perhaps,given the passage of time since mulholland was listed on childline and in light of the several cooperative interactions the appellants had with bccys,that agency could have acted in a more deliberate and less sudden fashion by providing mulholland and kurtz the courtesy of letting them know that it intended to petition the juvenile court for removal of the children.but its failure to do so does not reach a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.miller,at.mulholland listing on childline remained unrebutted at the time the children were removed from the home,and it was therefore not plainly unreasonable for the agency to believe he had committed child abuse and posed an immediate threat to the children residing with him.we therefore affirm the district court judgment as a matter of law on this substantive due process claim 
attempt to change mulholland status from indicated to founded 
mulholland and kurtz also sought to hold the county liable for arguing during the appeals process that mulholland status should be elevated in seriousness from indicated to founded because he pled guilty to the harassment charge arising from the july incident.the district court rejected that claim because there was no evidence adduced at trial that bccys litigation strategy represented an official policy or custom of bccys,but rather it represented a specific position on a specific legal issue under facts specific to this case.op.at.that alone is a sufficient basis for rejecting appellants claim.
beyond that,the legal position bccys took during the appeals process was not so arbitrary that it shocks the conscience.as a result of the allegations of child sexual abuse in,mulholland was charged with indecent exposure,endangering the welfare of a child,and harassment.although the indecent exposure and child endangerment charges were eventually dropped,mulholland pled guilty to the remaining charge of harassment.while appellants claim that mulholland pled guilty to harassing christine kurtz,not linda,it was not shocking for the county to believe and to argue that the harassment charge related to mulholland behavior toward linda.the cpsl provides that a founded report is appropriate if there has been any judicial adjudication based on a finding that a child who is a subject of the report has been abused,including the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a finding of guilt to a criminal charge involving the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.ann.emphasis added.thus,it does not shock the conscience that bccys would argue that the report against mulholland should be changed to founded.bccys had a defensible argument that the harassment charge,to which mulholland had pled,stemmed from the same factual circumstances surrounding linda allegations of sexual abuse.
appellants evidentiary claims 
finally,appellants challenge a number of evidentiary rulings of the district court we address the substance of only one of those challenges.appellants claim that the district court improperly admitted into evidence the july police report in which linda kurtz told police that mulholland had engaged in sexually inappropriate behavior toward her.according to appellants,the police report was extremely prejudicial.appellants opening br.at.
rule of the federal rules of evidence provides,
the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.
the district court had broad discretion in its application of rule,see united states lee,cir a district court ruling under rule may be reversed only if it is arbitrary or irrational.quoting united states.rehab.servs.pa,cir en banc,and we can not say that it abused that discretion when it allowed into evidence the police report that initiated bccys investigation.to the contrary,the probative value of the report,which described in detail the allegations against mulholland that he now denies,substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect of the report,not vice versa.in effect,kurtz and mulholland assert that the county failed to properly investigate the claim of child abuse,but they then argue that admission of the report that formed the basis of the investigation was prejudicial.the district court was well within its discretion in rejecting that argument 
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the decision of the district court granting the county motion for judgment as a matter of law.
appellants originally brought their suit against not only berks county,but also berks county children and youth services and its executive director,george kovarie,in his official capacity.the district court granted summary judgment as to the claims against the agency and kovarie,but it denied summary judgment for berks county.appellants do not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment,see infra note,and this opinion accordingly addresses only the subsequent trial involving the remaining claims against the county.
in accordance with our standard of review,see infra note,we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to appellants.see macleary hines,cir holding that judgment as a matter of law is proper only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no question of material fact for the jury and any verdict other than the one directed would be erroneous under the governing law.
at the time,kurtz lived with mulholland brother,robert mulholland.
in,kurtz testified in the present action that she had made up the charge that mulholland had made sexually inappropriate remarks to linda,and that she did so to ensure that he could get visits anymore.app.at.
a county agency,like bccys,may render three conclusions by sending a cy form to dpw namely,that the allegations of child abuse are founded,indicated,or unfounded.a founded report is appropriate if there has been any judicial adjudication based on a finding that a child who is a subject of the report has been abused,including the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a finding of guilt to a criminal charge involving the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.ann.an indicated report is appropriate if an investigation by the county agency or the department of public welfare determines that substantial evidence of the alleged abuse exists based on any of the following available medical evidence.the child protective service investigation.an admission of the acts of abuse by the perpetrator.id.s ubstantial evidence is e vidence which outweighs inconsistent evidence and which a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.an unfounded report is one that is not founded or indicated.id.
as discussed below,neider has no recollection of the investigation,and she based her testimony in solely on the cy form.in contrast,witnesses from the mulholland kurtz family,including linda,testified in that no one from bccys ever interviewed linda.
appellants insisted at the trial in this case in that mulholland pled guilty to harassing christine kurtz,not linda kurtz.
