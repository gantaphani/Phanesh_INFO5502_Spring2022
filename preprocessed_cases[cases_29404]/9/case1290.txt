stewart rodal,appeals from an award of summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the northern district of new york howard munson,judge,in favor of the,anesthesia group of onondaga,the anesthesia group or the group,on rodal claims of employment discrimination under the americans with disabilities act,a ada,and new york human rights law,exec.law mckinney.see rodal anesthesia group of onondaga,d.the district court ruled that,as a matter of law,rodal could not demonstrate his ability to perform the duties of a group anesthesiologist because the accommodation he required,relief from the essential job functions of night and weekend duty,was not reasonable.see id.at.the district court further concluded that even if the requested accommodation were reasonable,the group was excused from granting it because of the undue hardship it would work on the group other physicians.see id.at.while the district court opinion raises legitimate concerns about the merits of rodal claims,we conclude that these concerns can not be resolved as a matter of law on the record presented.the record reveals genuine issues of material fact as to whether rodal ever sought a scheduling accommodation from the group in if he did,whether the accommodation was reasonable in light of receptive statements by the group president and,if the accommodation was reasonable,whether its implementation would work a demonstrable undue hardship on the group.accordingly,we reverse the award of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in doing so,we note that the supreme court ruling in clackamas gastroenterology associates,wells,d,entered since the district court judgment,raises a further question as to whether rodal qualifies as an employee of the group entitled to pursue ada relief,resolution of which will require further development of the record on remand.
factual background 
a.the undisputed accommodation 
stewart rodal is a anesthesiologist who,in,became a shareholder in the anesthesia group,a medical practice providing anesthesiology and related services to two hospitals in the vicinity of syracuse,new york.beginning in,rodal experienced various health problems attributable to a metastatic islet cell tumor,a rare form of cancer.in,rodal advised anthony ascioti,the director and president of the anesthesia group,that he wished to continue working but that his illness precluded him from performing night and weekend shift duty.ascioti agreed to excuse rodal from these responsibilities,and for the next six to seven months,rodal worked on a modified schedule receiving full compensation.
at the same time,rodal and the group discussed the possibility of a compensation reduction if his modified schedule were to become permanent.when the parties failed to reach an understanding on this point,rodal returned to duty in january.on occasions when his health did not permit him to cover night and weekend shifts,rodal paid other physicians to handle these duties.
b.the disputed accommodation 
by,it was clear to rodal that he could no longer work a full schedule.on may,he spoke with ascioti and requested a return to a schedule.receiving no response,rodal announced his intention to take disability leave from the anesthesia group,which he did on july.
rodal discrimination claim 
on may,rodal filed a disability discrimination charge against the anesthesia group with the buffalo office of the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc dismissed rodal complaint on june,on the alternative grounds that jurisdiction was lacking because rodal was a shareholder and director of the anesthesia group rather than an employee,and the evidence failed to indicate a violation of law.
on september,rodal filed the present action demanding compensatory and punitive damages from the anesthesia group under federal and state law for disability discrimination both in failing to accommodate his disability and failing to hire him as the group billing manager.on this appeal,rodal pursues only the accommodation claims accordingly,we make no further mention of the failure to hire claims 
the group acknowledged that under this court ruling in hyland new haven radiology associates,cir,rodal was one of its employees for purposes of the ada.nevertheless,it moved for summary judgment on the ground that rodal could not establish that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job because he had stated otherwise in an affidavit filed in a state lawsuit against the group and was,therefore,judicially estopped from taking a contrary position in this action and his health condition presented a threat to proper patient care the group further argued that rodal could not establish that he had sustained an adverse employment action based on disability discrimination because he had not,in fact,sought any accommodation from the group in the period between.
on may,the district court granted the group motion for summary judgment,ruling as a matter of law that rodal request to be excused from night and weekend duty was not a reasonable accommodation because such duties were essential functions of his position,and granting the accommodation would be unduly harmful to other physicians in the group,who would have to assume greater responsibility for night and weekend duty.see rodal anesthesia group of onondaga,d at.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.noco motor fuel,cir quoting.c and matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.we conduct de novo review of the district court award of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.id.
rodal ada claim 
a plaintiff suing for disability discrimination under the ada bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case.where,as in this case,a disabled plaintiff claims that he can perform a particular job with a reasonable accommodation,the prima facie burden requires a showing that plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ada an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability with reasonable accommodation,plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue and the employer has refused to make such accommodations.id.at on this appeal,the parties focus on the third and fourth requirements and present the following questions for our review should rodal be judicially estopped from claiming that he was qualified to perform his job in,did rodal request an accommodation of his disability,which the group thereafter denied if rodal did seek such an accommodation,was the request unreasonable in asking the group to relieve rodal of night and weekend duty and would granting the accommodation have caused undue hardship to the group 
whether rodal should be judicially estopped from claiming that he was qualified to perform his job with the group 
the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a factual position in one legal proceeding that is contrary to a position that it successfully advanced in another proceeding.see mitchell washingtonville cent.sch,cir.thus,a party invoking judicial estoppel must show that the party against whom the estoppel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner,such as by rendering a favorable judgment.id.citation omitted.
in this case,the group submits that rodal should be estopped from asserting,as he does in his affidavit in opposition to summary judgment,that he was fully capable of performing the essential functions of the position as an anesthesiologist with the group had he been accorded the accommodation of a reduction in hours,rodal aff,in light of a contrary statement in an affidavit he filed in state court in support of a successful summary judgment motion in a case concerning the group financial obligations to rodal as a consequence of his taking disability leave.in that aff
