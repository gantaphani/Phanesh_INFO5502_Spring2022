evan washington,howard pierson iv and secunda crump collectively,plaintiffs,correction officers employed by the rockland county sheriff department rcsd or the department brought suit,pursuant to and,against the county of rockland the county and rockland county sheriff james kralik,in his individual capacity collectively,defendants plaintiffs claimed that defendants engaged in malicious prosecution by bringing meritless disciplinary charges against plaintiffs because of plaintiffs race and in retaliation for plaintiffs decision to speak out against defendants allegedly discriminatory policies and practices.plaintiffs further allege that defendants selectively maintained meritless disciplinary proceedings against them because of their race and prior opposition to defendants allegedly discriminatory practices.the district court conner,granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of plaintiffs claims.
on appeal,we hold that plaintiffs malicious prosecution claims fail because a malicious prosecution claim may not be premised on a civil administrative proceeding of the type at issue here plaintiffs discrimination claims accrued at the time the disciplinary charges were filed,and thus,plaintiffs filing of the claims more than three years after they accrued rendered them untimely and although plaintiffs suffered an adverse employment action,their retaliation claim fails nonetheless because they did not demonstrate a causal connection between the adverse employment action and the protected speech.
background 
in august,rcsd initiated an investigation to determine whether corrections officers were distributing contraband materials to inmates in the rockland county jail.information obtained from inmate interviews suggested that washington gave an inmate a cigarette,that pierson gave food and beer to an inmate,and that crump knew that cigarettes were stored in the jail.because this information was obtained through uncorroborated inmate testimony,rcsd investigators declined to pursue criminal charges against the three officers and instead referred the matter to joseph suarez,counsel to the sheriff of rockland county,to determine if internal administrative charges should be filed.
although subordinates expressed reservations about the reliability of inmate testimony and suggested that the matter be addressed in an internal conference,suarez ultimately recommended that sheriff kralik proceed with administrative disciplinary charges against plaintiffs.
on october,washington was charged with promoting prison contraband.on july,and august,respectively,pierson and crump also were charged with promoting prison contraband plaintiffs were suspended without pay for thirty days,pursuant to civ.serv.pierson and crump were given administrative hearings before a hearing officer,while the disciplinary charges against washington were resolved in arbitration proceedings.each plaintiff was found not guilty of promoting prison contraband.the disciplinary charges against crump and washington,respectively,were dismissed on february,and july.although the contraband charge against pierson was dismissed on february,pierson was found guilty on a separate charge of permitting two inmates to fight and was discharged by the sheriff.
on september,plaintiffs filed this suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that rcsd decision to file administrative disciplinary charges against them constituted malicious prosecution because of the evidentiary infirmities undermining the charges rcsd decision to pursue administrative disciplinary charges against them was motivated by racial discrimination and in pursuing administrative disciplinary charges against plaintiffs,rcsd was retaliating against plaintiffs exercise of their first amendment rights in speaking out against rcsd allegedly discriminatory policies and practices.
on july,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.see washington county of rockland,d.the district court concluded that because the crux of plaintiffs and discrimination claims was that defendants selectively maintained disciplinary proceedings against them on account of race,the claims accrued at the time plaintiffs knew,or had reason to know,of the charges,and thus were untimely.see id.at.the district court further held that although plaintiffs malicious prosecution claims were timely,they failed on the merits because a malicious prosecution claim brought under could not be maintained where the alleged prosecution occurred in a civil administrative proceeding.see id.at.finally,the district court held that plaintiffs claims of first amendment retaliation could not be maintained because plaintiffs failed to establish that they suffered an adverse employment action.see id.at.
plaintiffs subsequently filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see lombard hamilton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.oneida indian nation of new york city of sherrill,cir.when there are no disputed issues of material fact,our task is to determine whether the district court correctly applied the law.mario p c food,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.malicious prosecution claims 
the district court concluded that a malicious prosecution claim brought pursuant to may not be premised on an administrative disciplinary proceeding.washington,d at.section authorizes a court to grant relief when a party constitutional rights have been violated by a state or local official or other person acting under color of state law.parratt taylor,d eagleston guido,cir.to establish a constitutional violation under,plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants were acting under color of state law at the time of the alleged malicious prosecution and the action was a deprivation of a constitutional or federal statutory right.hayut state of new york,cir.it is undisputed that defendants were rockland county officials acting under color of state law.the remaining question is whether the initiation and pursuit of the administrative disciplinary charges constituted a deprivation of plaintiffs federally protected rights for purposes of.
although provides plaintiffs with a federal cause of action,generally we borrow the elements of the underlying malicious prosecution from state law.cook sheldon,cir.plaintiffs argue that because new york recognizes the tort of civil malicious prosecution,they may base their claim on a civil malicious prosecution arising out of administrative disciplinary proceedings.in concluding that administrative disciplinary proceedings were inadequate to support a claim for malicious prosecution,the district court relied on easton sundram,cir.washington,d at.in easton,this court noted that because civil proceedings do not implicate the same constitutional rights as criminal proceedings,the mere fact that new york state law recognizes a civil tort of malicious prosecution did not transform plaintiff claim of civil malicious prosecution into a constitutional cause of action redressable under.easton,at.plaintiffs argue that although easton suggests that it is unlikely that a civil proceeding could be the basis for a claim for malicious prosecution,it did not expressly foreclose such claims.we disagree as fully explained below.
the issues presented in easton are similar to those in the instant case.in easton,the plaintiff brought suit,pursuant to,claiming malicious prosecution in the context of a civil proceeding.we noted that we have never determined whether a state law tort for civil as opposed to criminal malicious prosecution gives rise to a cause of action under.id.we further recognized that a lthough we ha d previously held that the state tort of malicious criminal prosecution gives rise to a cause of action under,criminal malicious prosecution generally implicated constitutional rights not automatically implicated in a malicious prosecution civil suit.id.while we did not foreclose the possibility that civil prosecution could give rise to a cause of action under,we surmised that,absent official conduct that is,it normally will not.id.at.
since easton,the landscape of malicious prosecution suits has changed.in albright oliver,d,the supreme court,in a plurality opinion,determined that only violations of the fourth amendment could support claims for malicious prosecution.id.at.in so doing,the court reasoned that the various criminal procedure protections of the fourth amendment were intended to protect against arbitrary exercises of prosecutorial power.thus,only those claims of malicious prosecution that implicated fourth amendment rights were appropriate bases for malicious prosecution claims brought under.id.at.
the following year,in singer fulton county sheriff,cir,we considered the impact of albright on malicious prosecution claims brought under the auspices of.following albright reasoning,we observed that t he fourth amendment right implicated in a malicious prosecution action is the right to be free of unreasonable seizure of the,the right to be free of unreasonable or unwarranted restraints on personal liberty.singer,at.accordingly,we concluded that a plaintiff asserting a fourth amendment malicious prosecution claim under must therefore show some deprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of seizure.id.considered in tandem,singer and albright stand for the proposition that to sustain a malicious prosecution claim,there must be a seizure or other perversion of proper legal procedures implicating the claimant personal liberty and privacy interests under the fourth amendment.id.at.
despite albright and singer,plaintiffs maintain that they have alleged a viable malicious prosecution claim under.specifically,plaintiffs argue that although the disciplinary charges against them were filed in an administrative context,they nonetheless implicate fourth amendment rights because plaintiffs could have been criminally prosecuted if found guilty in the administrative proceeding and because the stigma of the disciplinary charges would impede their future advancement within the rcsd.we disagree that these possibilities implicate the fourth amendment to such a degree as to permit a claim based on a civil administrative proceeding of the type at issue here.
the factual circumstances of this case do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation sufficient to warrant redress under.plaintiffs were charged in an administrative proceeding,and,critically,were never taken into custody,imprisoned,physically detained or seized within the traditional meaning of the fourth amendment.see united states mendenhall,d holding that,under standard fourth amendment analysis,a person is considered seized if he is unable to leave an officer presence without permission.although the disciplinary charges included offenses for which plaintiffs could have been criminally prosecuted had they been found guilty in the administrative proceeding,plaintiffs were never the subjects of an actual criminal prosecution.moreover,although plaintiffs were suspended without pay for thirty days pending the disposition of the disciplinary charges,no seizure or restriction of their personal liberty occurred.see singer,at holding that a complainant asserting a malicious prosecution claim must show some deprivation of liberty consistent with a seizure easton,at noting that criminal malicious prosecution typically implicates constitutional rights,such as a deprivation of liberty,which are not attendant in a civil prosecution.
as we have noted,our case law does not forbid a malicious prosecution claim premised on a civil or administrative proceeding however,because such claims must,under albright and singer,be premised on a violation of fourth amendment rights,it is unlikely that a civil proceeding of the kind at issue here would implicate constitutional rights in a manner that would warrant redress under.because the circumstances of this case do not constitute a deprivation of liberty sufficient to constitute a violation of plaintiffs fourth amendment rights,plaintiff malicious prosecution claim fails.
iii.timeliness of plaintiffs discrimination claims 
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants discriminated against them in violation of and,by selectively maintaining administrative disciplinary charges against them on the basis of their race.the district court dismissed these claims,holding that,for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations,plaintiffs claims accrued when they were charged with disciplinary violations.washington,d at.because the last of the disciplinary charges was filed on august,and plaintiffs did not commence their suit until september,than three years district court found plaintiffs claims untimely.
on appeal,no party disputes that the applicable statute of limitations period is three years from the time the claim accrued.see connolly mccall,cir eagleston,at.nor do they dispute that,under federal law,t he claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the harm.eagleston,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.employing a continuing violation theory,plaintiffs assert that defendants continued prosecution of the disciplinary charges amounted to an ongoing illegal practice permitted by the employer to continue unremedied for so long as to amount to a discriminatory policy or practice.plaintiffs maintain that their claims are timely because the prosecution continued until the last of the charges was dismissed in july.alternatively,plaintiffs argue that under roesch otarola,cir,and abstention principles,it would have been premature at best for plaintiffs to claim defendants had discriminatorily charged them with misconduct before the hearing officer ruled in their favor.instead,plaintiffs assert that it was proper to wait until the administrative process was resolved thus,they argue,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the administrative process was completed and the disciplinary charges were dismissed.we reject both of plaintiffs arguments.
continuing violation doctrine 
under title vii continuing violation doctrine,if a plaintiff has experienced a continuous practice and policy of discrimination,the commencement of the statute of limitations period may be delayed until the last discriminatory act in furtherance of it.fitzgerald henderson,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.plaintiffs argue that defendants decision to prosecute fully the administrative disciplinary charges against them,even though there were evidentiary infirmities underlying the charges,was tantamount to an ongoing policy of discrimination.we disagree.
conduct that has been characterized as a continuing violation is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.passenger morgan,d internal quotation marks omitted elmenayer abf freight,cir.here,the conduct in question was rcsd decision to file disciplinary charges against plaintiffs.such conduct is clearly a single act,discrete in its nature.although rcsd could have revisited its decision after the charges had been filed,doing so would not have turned the act of filing the charges into a continuous or ongoing policy or practice.the alleged discrimination occurred when rcsd undertook the individual act of initiating disciplinary charges against each plaintiff.because rcsd prosecution of the charges to ultimate disposition is wholly separable from the act of initiating the charges,we reject plaintiffs contention that this series of separate acts should be characterized as an ongoing policy of continuous discrimination sufficient to toll the applicable statute of limitations 
abstention and roesch otarola 
plaintiffs also assert that under roesch otarola,cir,and abstention principles enunciated in younger harris,d,they were obliged to wait until the resolution of the administrative disciplinary charges before filing this suit in federal court.they maintain that the statute of limitations should have been tolled until the resolution of the disciplinary charges.based on the facts presented,we disagree.
