opinion of the court 
brian prowel appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of his former employer,wise business forms.prowel sued under title vii of the civil rights act of and the pennsylvania human relations act,alleging that wise harassed and retaliated against him because of sex and religion.the principal issue on appeal is whether prowel has marshaled sufficient facts for his claim of gender stereotyping discrimination to be submitted to a jury.we also consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to wise on prowel religious discrimination claim.
we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and we apply the same standard as the district court.norfolk ry.basell usa,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.norfolk,at quoting abramson william paterson coll.of,cir.because summary judgment was entered against prowel,we view the record in the light most favorable to him.
prowel began working for wise in july.a producer and distributor of business forms,wise employed approximately workers at its facility in butler,pennsylvania.from until his termination,prowel operated a machine called a nale encoder,which encodes numbers and organizes business forms.on december,after years with the company,wise informed prowel that it was laying him off for lack of work.
prowel most substantial claim is that wise harassed and retaliated against him because of sex.the theory of sex discrimination prowel advances is known as a gender stereotyping claim,which was first recognized by the supreme court as a viable cause of action in price waterhouse hopkins,d.
prowel identifies himself as an effeminate man and believes that his mannerisms caused him not to fit in with the other men at wise.prowel described the genuine stereotypical male at the plant as follows 
b lue jeans,blue collar worker,very rough around the edges.most of the guys there hunted.most of the guys there fished.if they drank,they drank beer,they did drink gin and tonic.just you know,all into football,sports,all that kind of stuff,everything i was.
in stark contrast to the other men at wise,prowel testified that he had a high voice and did not curse was very wore what others would consider dressy clothes was neat filed his nails instead of ripping them off with a utility knife crossed his legs and had a tendency to shake his foot the way a woman would sit walked and carried himself in an effeminate manner drove a clean car had a rainbow decal on the trunk of his car talked about things like art,music,interior design,and decor and pushed the buttons on the nale encoder with pizzazz.
some of prowel reacted negatively to his demeanor and appearance.during the last two years of his employment at wise,a female frequently called prowel princess.in a similar vein,made comments such as did you see what rosebud was wearing did you see rosebud sitting there with his legs crossed,filing his nails and look at the way he walks.
prowel also testified that he is homosexual.at some point prior to november,prowel was outed at work when a newspaper clipping of a ad was left at his workstation with a note that read why do you give him a call,big boy.prowel reported the incident to two personnel and asked that something be done.the culprit was never identified,however.
after prowel was outed,some of his began causing problems for him,subjecting him to verbal and written attacks during the last seven years of his tenure at wise.in addition to the nicknames princess and rosebud,a female called him fag and said listen,faggot,i do have to put up with this from you.prowel reported this to his shift supervisor but received no response.
at some point during the last two years of prowel employment,a pink,feather tiara with a package of lubricant jelly was left on his nale encoder.the items were removed after prowel complained to henry nolan,the shift supervisor at that time.on march,as prowel entered the plant,he overheard a state i hate him.they should shoot all the fags.prowel reported this remark to nolan,who said he would look into it.prowel also overheard conversations between,one of whom was a supervisor,who disapproved of how he lived his life.finally,messages began to appear on the wall of the men bathroom,claiming prowel had aids and engaged in sexual relations with male.after prowel complained,the company repainted the restroom.
in addition to the harassment prowel allegedly experienced because of his sex,he also claims that he was discriminated against because of religion.specifically,prowel argues that his conduct did not conform to the company religious beliefs.when asked at his deposition what those religious beliefs were,prowel responded a man should not lay with another man.
for a few months during the spring of,prowel found anonymous prayer notes on his work machine on a daily basis.prowel also found messages indicating he was a sinner for the way he lived his life.additionally,he found a note stating rosebud will burn in hell.prowel attributed these notes and comments to michael croyle,a christian employee who refused to speak to prowel.moreover,prowel testified in his deposition that nothing was left on his machine after croyle left the company.
another,thomas bowser,stated that he did not approve of how prowel lived his life.prowel testified that bowser brought religious pamphlets to work that stated the end is coming and have you come clean with your maker 
prowel alleges that his shunned him and his work environment became so stressful that he had to stop his car on the way to work to vomit.at some point in,prowel became increasingly dissatisfied with his work assignments and pay.prowel believed he was asked to perform more varied tasks than other nale encoder operators,but was not compensated fairly for these extra tasks,even though work piled up on his nale encoder.
in april,prowel considered suing wise and stated his intentions to four personnel,asking them to testify on his behalf.prowel allegedly told his colleagues that the lawsuit would be based on harassment for not fitting in he did not say anything about being harassed because of his homosexuality.these four colleagues complained to management that prowel was bothering them.
on may,general manager jeff straub convened a meeting with prowel and supervisors nolan and john hodak to discuss prowel concern that he was doing more work for less money than other nale encoder operators.prowel compensation and workload were discussed,but the parties did not reach agreement on those issues.straub then asked prowel if he had approached employees to testify for him in a lawsuit,and prowel replied that he had not done so.prowel has since conceded that he did approach other employees in this regard.
on december,prowel was summoned to meet with his supervisors,who informed him that he was terminated effective immediately for lack of work.
after exhausting his administrative remedies before the equal employment opportunity commission,prowel sued wise in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,alleging claims under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the pennsylvania human relations act,et phra.prowel alleged harassment and wrongful termination because of sex and religion and concomitant retaliation.following discovery,wise moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the company motion in its entirety.as relevant to this appeal the district court held that prowel suit was merely a claim for sexual orientation is not cognizable under title he repackaged as a gender stereotyping claim in an attempt to avoid summary judgment.prowel religious discrimination claim failed for the same reason.as for prowel retaliation claim,the district court held that prowel had a good faith belief that he had
