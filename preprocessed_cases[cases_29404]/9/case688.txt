at the time of the events at issue,appellant tara gorski was employed by the new hampshire department of corrections the department as a sergeant assigned to duty in a secure psychiatric unit in the men state prison in concord.in her amended complaint,gorski alleged that the department had constructively discharged her in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii.gorski claimed that she had been the victim of direct sexual harassment and of a hostile work environment.
more particularly,gorski alleged that she had become pregnant in june,and shortly afterward had told her supervisors of that fact.thereafter,she alleged,both her direct supervisor,identified as kench,and her ultimate supervisor,unit director joseph panarello,made derogatory comments about her pregnancy so as to give rise to a sexually hostile working environment.the amended complaint set forth a series of specific facts in support of the claim of discrimination the complaint then alleged the conduct described above was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a sexually hostile work environment.as a result of this hostile environment,plaintiff was forced to resign in august,a constructive discharge.
the department moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to comply with title vii administrative filing requirements and for failure to state facts which if true would meet the requirements for a claim of harassment based on gender under title vii.the district court rejected the first ground,concluding that gorski had complied timely with the prerequisites to a title vii suit.what the district court did with respect to the second to state a viable claim under title rise to this appeal.
recognizing that a claim of discrimination supported by a theory of sexual harassment or hostile work environment could be made out if a plaintiff were to show severe or pervasive conduct such that it constitutes a change in the terms and conditions of employment,the district court concluded 
the comments allegedly made by gorski superiors regarding her pregnancy do not rise to the level required to be actionable under title vii.sporadic use of abusive language does not create a hostile work environment because such conduct is not extreme enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment.moreover,the remarks directed at gorski were not physically threatening or humiliating.while the remarks panarello and kench made were insensitive,inappropriate and arguably offensive,these circumstances alone do not describe a workplace that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.
having found that the complaint failed to state a viable claim for discrimination by reason of sexual harassment or a hostile work environment,the district court went on to conclude that the complaint did state a claim of pregnancy discrimination,namely,that her supervisors had refused to grant her a transfer to another unit because she was pregnant.in effect,the district court parsed what had been pled as a single count into two distinct claims one for discrimination by reason of sexual work environment and one for pregnancy discrimination.the court understood the complaint allegation that gorski was told her request for a transfer would not be granted because she was pregnant as asserting a claim of disparate treatment because of pregnancy.satisfied that the latter claim was adequately asserted within the amended complaint,the district court entered an order denying the department motion to dismiss.
we think it is clear,not only from the amended complaint itself but also from the tenor of the arguments advanced by gorski in opposition to the motion to dismiss,that gorski conceived of her complaint as presenting a hostile environment claim,not a claim that a discrete employment of a itself a distinct act of disparate treatment discrimination.that latter theory is not,we think,either in the complaint or in gorski legal argument opposing the motion to dismiss.in context,the allegations about kench comments concerning her prospects for a transfer were intended as examples of harassing conduct to support the broader allegation that there was a hostile work environment.
nonetheless,no doubt trying to make the best of the situation,gorski accepted the court invitation to pursue the newly suggested theory.the parties proceeded to conduct discovery on the theory that gorski had been subjected to disparate,the denial of a of her pregnancy.there is nothing in the record or otherwise called to our attention that suggests that discovery was pursued by either side on the hostile work environment theory.rather,it is clear that both the parties and the district court considered the court dismissive treatment of that theory to be the equivalent of a formal dismissal of a claim resting on the theory,even though,as a formal matter,the court had denied the motion to dismiss without distinguishing between the different claims the court had found to lie within the allegations of the complaint 
following discovery,the department moved for summary judgment as to a claim based on a denial of a transfer.on the summary judgment record,it was undisputed that neither kench nor panarello had authority to transfer gorski to another unit and that gorski did not apply for a transfer to another unit.under these circumstances,the district court concluded that gorski unsupported speculation about what might have happened if she had applied for a transfer is insufficient to raise a material factual dispute,and it granted the motion.judgment in favor of the department was entered accordingly.
gorski has appealed both the order limiting her claim to one for pregnancy discrimination and the order granting summary judgment on that claim.we review both rulings de novo.see aldridge t cross,cir reviewing motion to dismiss rochester ford sales,ford motor,cir reviewing motion for summary judgment.we hold that the district court erred in concluding that gorski had failed adequately to plead a claim under title vii for sex discrimination based on a theory of hostile work environment.we affirm the district court conclusion that a claim of disparate treatment by gorski premised on a denial of a transfer request can not be sustained on a factual record which shows that she had never requested a transfer and that the representative of the department who purportedly discouraged her from requesting one lacked the authority to grant or deny such requests.
discrimination by reason of a hostile work environment 
before considering whether gorski complaint adequately stated a claim upon which relief could be granted,it is useful to recall some general principles pertaining to a substantive claim of sex discrimination by reason of the existence of a hostile work environment.
title vii prohibits employment discrimination because of an employee sex.a discrimination because of a woman pregnancy is discrimination because of her sex.see k the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex include,but are not limited to,because of or on the basis of pregnancy.see also smith morse,cir.
the scope of title vii prohibition of discrimination because of sex is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination.the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d citations and some internal quotation marks omitted.thus,discrimination because of sex includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.harris forklift,d.when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
sometimes,a workplace becomes a hostile working environment for a female employee because of other employees sexual innuendos,see id.at,or unwelcome sexual advances or demands for sexual favors,see meritor,at.sexual harassment,whether by means of a demands for sexual favors as a quid pro quo or by the employer creation or tolerance of a hostile and abusive work environment,constitutes discrimination prohibited by title vii.see id.at.see also faragher city of boca raton,d.
we have previously observed that while evidence of or salacious behavior is often sufficient,it is not necessary to the proof that a work environment was sufficiently hostile or abusive to a female employee to amount to discrimination on the basis of sex.see city of providence,cir noting that harassment that is not overtly sexual is nonetheless actionable under title vii lipsett of puerto rico,cir stating that male employees verbal attacks directed at female employees that were not sexual in nature but were could be found to contribute to hostile work environment see also oncale sundowner offshore,d h arassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.as we noted in,incidents of nonsexual as work sabotage,exclusion,denial of support,and in context contribute to a hostile work environment.at.indeed,the theory that a hostile work environment was a species of employment discrimination prohibited by title vii was originally recognized in cases decided by various courts of appeals involving discrimination on bases other than sex,such as national origin,race,and religion.see meritor,at.citing,among other cases,rogers eeoc,cir holding that an hispanic claimant had sufficiently alleged a title vii claim where her employer discriminatory service to its hispanic clientele created an offensive work environment and firefighters inst.for racial equality city of louis,cir holding that black firefighters sufficiently alleged a hostile work environment where the city allowed white firefighters to use the firehouse kitchen facilities in a discriminatory and segregated manner 
what is essential is proof that the work environment was so hostile or abusive,because of conduct based on one of the prohibited factors identified in title vii,that the terms or conditions of the plaintiff employment were caused to be altered.for this there is no mathematically precise test.harris,at.rather,whether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances,which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.at.
the issue presently before us,however,is not what the plaintiff is required ultimately to prove in order to prevail on her claim,but rather what she is required to plead in order to be permitted to develop her case for eventual adjudication on the merits.in determining that gorski had not sufficiently stated a claim for sex discrimination by reason of a hostile work environment,the district court focused on the specific instances of harassing comments alleged in the complaint and concluded that,assuming the allegations to be true,the comments did not add up to conduct that was extreme enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment.this was error because the district court resolution implicitly measured the complaint against a stricter standard of pleading than is required.in undertaking to assess how extreme the complained of conduct was,the district court was not determining whether the complaint adequately had alleged the elements of a hostile work environment claim,but rather was performing an evaluative judgment,usually left to the trier of fact,as to whether the hostility or harassment that was alleged was sufficiently severe or pervasive enough to warrant relief.
it is a familiar principle that a complaint should be dismissed under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.the factual allegations of the complaint are to be accepted as true,and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them are indulged in favor of the pleader.see kiely raytheon,cir per curiam garita hotel ponce fed.bank,cir.
like most federal civil actions,all that is required to plead adequately a cause of action under title vii is a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court jurisdiction depends,a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.a 
the supreme court has recently confirmed that complaints alleging employment discrimination need only satisfy the simple requirements of rule a.swierkiewicz sorema,d.in assessing whether a complaint satisfies rule requirements,the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.id.at quoting scheuer rhodes,d.although some cases have suggested that a heightened pleading standard may exist in certain civil rights cases,see,dartmouth review dartmouth,cir suggesting there is a greater need to plead specific factual allegations in a civil rights suit swierkiewicz makes clear that the federal rules do not contain a heightened pleading standard for employment discrimination suits.at.
gorski complaint adequately pled a cause of action for employment discrimination by reason of an abusive or hostile work environment.first,she alleged that her supervisors discriminated against her on the basis of her gender female and of her pregnancy by making derogatory comments about her pregnancy so as to give rise to a sexually hostile working environment.she went on to allege specific facts in support of her claims,consisting of seven separate examples of what she asserted were hostile or abusive comments.she then alleged that the conduct previously described was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a sexually hostile work environment.
the district court apparently assumed that the seven specific instances of harassing comments pled in the complaint constituted the sum total of the plaintiff evidence of the hostility or abusiveness of the work environment and then proceeded to evaluate those allegations in light of the applicable legal standard.but the complaint did not allege that the specific instances of harassment set out were the only evidence available to support the discrimination claim.nor was there any obligation on the pleader to identify in the complaint all the evidence that would later be offered in support of the claim pleaded.see conley gibson,d t he federal rules of civil procedure do not require a claimant to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim.the district court error lay not in its application of the appropriate legal standard to a fixed set of facts,but rather in its belief that there was a fixed set of facts to which the standard could be applied.
it is not necessary at this point to decide whether the plaintiff could sustain a hostile work environment claim if the factual evidence she could marshal at trial were limited to the facts alleged in the amended complaint.we do observe,however,that proof of such a claim is highly fact specific.see harris,at.w hether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances see also conto concord,cir whether there was a hostile work environment necessarily entailed a assessment of all the attendant circumstances.in addition to the plaintiff subjective perception of it,the tenor of the environment must be such that an objectively reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive.see harris,at.subject to some policing at the outer bounds,that question is commonly one of as to severity and be resolved by the trier of fact on the basis of inferences drawn from a broad array of circumstantial and often conflicting evidence.lipsett,at quoting stepanischen merchants despatch transp,cir.
when the allegations of the complaint are read favorably to gorski,with the understanding that notice pleading does not require recitation of detailed evidence in support of the claim,it is clear th
