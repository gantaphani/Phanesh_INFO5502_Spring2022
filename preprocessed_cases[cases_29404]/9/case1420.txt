opinion of the court 
in this title vii retaliation action,millicent appeals from an order of summary judgment granted in favor of her former employer,delaware state university,and two of its employees,john austin,dean of the college of education,health and public policy,and alton thompson,provost and vice president for academic affairs.grevious alleges that by retaliating against her for complaining about discriminatory employment practices based on race and gender,the university violated title vii of the civil rights act of,and that by retaliating against her for complaining about discriminatory employment practices based on race,dean austin and provost thompson violated.in this appeal,we consider whether a plaintiff asserting a title vii retaliation claim must establish causation as part of her prima facie case pursuant to university of texas southwestern medical center nassar.we hold that,at the prima facie stage,a plaintiff need only proffer evidence sufficient to raise the inference that her engagement in a protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse employment action,not the reason.
with respect to grevious contract revision claim against the university and provost thompson,we will reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings.we will affirm in all other respects.
the university hired grevious as an associate professor and as chairperson of the department of social work the department in august both terms of employment were contracted to end on june,but were subject to reappointment.as chairperson,grevious supervised nine employees and managed the department.but her main focus was to facilitate the department reaccreditation efforts,which included submitting a comprehensive and other supporting documentation to the office of social work accreditation oswa by august.grevious reported to dean austin,who in turn reported to provost thompson.provost thompson was primarily responsible for the department reaccreditation.
from the beginning of grevious employment,she struggled with the reaccreditation process,in part due to the department being in complete disarray,and in part due to the faculty and staff lack of structure.grevious br.grevious also experienced personal difficulties with the department faculty and staff.within her first three months as chairperson,grevious recommended the nonrenewal of two professors,the replacement of two of her administrative staff,and the termination of a department consultant.three of those individuals submitted written complaints to dean austin describing grevious actions as unprofessional and unwarranted,claiming to have been degraded,belittled,and harassed,and subjected to retribution related to grevious personal grudges.although her relationships with junior faculty and staff were strained,two senior faculty members and some of her students submitted positive evaluations of her performance as part of the university formal evaluation process.
the department scheduled an election in february to determine whether grevious would be reappointed as chairperson for an additional term.as the election approached,grevious relationship with dean austin soured.on january,grevious requested a meeting with provost thompson to discuss,among other things,her frustrations with dean austin governance.grevious claimed that dean austin was hindering the reaccreditation process and campaigning against her reappointment as chairperson by soliciting junior faculty members to vote against her.she asked provost thompson to intervene.
grevious first complaint of discrimination and retaliation 
on january,having failed to resolve her issues with dean austin,grevious emailed provost thompson regarding what she described as dean austin unilateral and arbitrary management style and,for the first time,to report that he allegedly made discriminatory comments.grevious alleged that,when she confronted dean austin,he told her that his management style was meant to stop back biting among women,especially black women,that is keep sic women from fighting amongst themselves to their own detriment.grevious complained that she found dean austin overtly sexist and claimed that he reduced interpersonal interaction between a department chair and her faculty and staff to race and gender issues,as a cover for making unilateral decisions.
on february,provost thompson spoke to dean austin,who denied making the alleged discriminatory comments.the following day,dean austin formally evaluated grevious as chairperson.in the category addressing academic leadership and department activities,dean austin rated grevious a one out of five and commented that her l eadership appears to be a major problem.grevious contested the evaluation,and the next day dean austin submitted a revised,evaluation.in the aforementioned category,dean austin upgraded grevious rating from a one to a two out of five and commented that w hile chair indicates the activities she has accomplished in her academic development,there is no clear indication where she is demonstrating leadership and development of faculty and staff.
in an email to provost thompson and the university general counsel,sent early on the morning of the department election february,grevious argued that dean austin negative evaluation evidenced his retaliatory animus toward her for reporting his misconduct.grevious referenced the allegations raised in the january email and requested that provost thompson insulate the election from dean austin interference.because grevious was unable to produce evidence of dean austin interference,the election went forward as scheduled.including grevious,the faculty voted five to four to appoint marlene saunders as the new department chair,effective june,
on march,in accordance with the cba,grevious filed a grievance with the office of the provost alleging that dean austin sexually harassed her and that,when she reported dean austin harassment to the provost,dean austin retaliated by submitting a negative performance evaluation.responding to the grievance on behalf of the university,provost thompson stated that further action was unnecessary because investigations into grevious claims did not yield evidence of cba violations.
the university issues grevious a renewable contract 
on april,based on provost thompson recommendation,the university tendered to grevious a renewable contract as an associate professor for the academic year.around the same time,provost thompson learned that,under grevious,the department progress toward reaccreditation was significantly behind schedule.provost thompson requested a postponement of the reaccreditation deadline,citing the transition to a new chairperson as his justification.on april,oswa denied the request.that same day,grevious filed a formal complaint of sexual harassment,racial discrimination,and related retaliation against dean austin with the university human resources department hr.
the university prematurely terminates grevious term as chairperson 
on may,grevious met with the vice president of hr to discuss her complaint later that day,the university informed grevious that she would be dismissed as chairperson on may,but that she would continue to receive the chairperson salary through the natural expiration of her contract term.in response,on may,grevious filed an equal employment opportunity commission eeoc charge of discrimination claiming that the premature termination of her term as chairperson was unlawful retaliation for her complaints about dean austin sexual harassment,racial discrimination,and related retaliation.dean austin,provost thompson,and the university became aware of the eeoc charge sometime in early june.
the university issues grevious a revised terminal contract 
on june,based again on provost thompson recommendation,the university revoked grevious april renewable contract and issued her a terminal contract ending her employment effective may.grevious claims that on august,at a meeting to discuss the issuance of the terminal contract,provost thompson admitted that his recommendation was based on grevious filing of the may eeoc charge and that the ultimate decision was unrelated to her teaching or professional performance.grevious thereafter filed a second eeoc charge alleging that she was issued a terminal contract in retaliation for having filed the initial eeoc charge.provost thompson denies making such admissions at the august meeting and claims that the decision was based on grevious documented interpersonal conflict at the university.
the following year,on june,when the terminal contract expired,provost thompson recommended that the university not reappoint grevious for the academic year because of her consistent inability to work collegially with her colleagues.grevious subsequently filed a final eeoc charge alleging that her ultimate termination was retaliation for filing the earlier eeoc charges.
after exhausting her administrative remedies,grevious filed this suit in the district court for the district of delaware alleging retaliation in violation of title vii,against the university,and retaliation in violation of against dean austin and provost thompson collectively the defendants.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that grevious failed to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to the third element of her prima facie case causation.in granting the defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court relied primarily on university of texas southwestern medical center nassar,which held that a plaintiff asserting a title vii retaliation claim must prove that the employer unlawful retaliation was the cause of the adverse employment action,see delaware state,wl,at.the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that,but for grevious complaints about harassment and discrimination,she would have been retained as chairperson or kept her renewable contract.therefore,it held that grevious did not establish the causation element of her prima facie case.see id.at.the district court also concluded that grevious failed to establish that provost thompson explanation for the issuance of a terminal contract was a pretext for discrimination.id.grevious filed this timely appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review over a district court order granting summary judgment and apply the same standard the district court applied.daniels sch.dist.of,cir.we will affirm if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting fed.civ.a.
title vii prohibits an employer from discriminating based on an employee race,color,religion,sex,or national origin,a,and from retaliating against an employee for complaining about,or reporting,discrimination or retaliation,id.a.the substantive elements of a racial discrimination claim under are generally identical to the elements of an employment discrimination claim under title vii.brown kaz,cir.we will therefore address these claims together.see,schurr roserts int l hotel,cir.title vii and,however,are not coextensive,and to the extent that any of grevious retaliation claims against either provost thompson or dean austin are based on grevious complaints of gender discrimination,those claims are not cognizable.see anjelino new york times,cir.affirming dismissal of gender discrimination claim on the basis that,on its face,is limited to issues of racial discrimination.
to state a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in a protected activity,she suffered an adverse employment action,and there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse action.moore city of philadelphia,cir.a plaintiff seeking to prove her case through indirect evidence,as grevious seeks to here,may do so by applying the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework.daniels,at.after establishing a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate reason for its conduct.moore,at.if it does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to convince the factfinder both that the employer proffered explanation was false that is,a pretext,and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action.id.the onus is on the plaintiff to establish causation at two stages of the case initially,to demonstrate a causal connection as part of the prima facie case,and at the final stage of the mcdonnell douglas framework to satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion by proving pretext.
the question before us is what a plaintiff must bring as part of her prima facie case of retaliation to survive a motion for summary judgment in the wake of the supreme court decision in nassar,which held that title vii retaliation claims must be proven according to traditional principles of causation.at.our sister circuits are split on this question.see foster of shore,cir.collecting cases.we conclude that nassar does not alter the plaintiff burden at the prima facie stage proving causation as part of her ultimate burden of persuasion comes later,and not at the stage.
importantly,the causation standard required by nassar does not conflict with our continued application of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm in title vii retaliation cases.smith allentown,cir.analyzing gross fbl financial services,and the causation requirement in proving claims under the age discrimination in employment act.applying mcdonnell douglas to title vii retaliation claims,we have made clear that a lthough the burden of production of evidence shifts back and forth,the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times.daniels,at.because the mcdonnell douglas framework affects the burden of production but not the standard of causation that the plaintiff must prove as part of her ultimate burden of persuasion,nassar does not forbid our adherence to precedent applying mcdonnell douglas.smith,at.
a plaintiff asserting a claim of retaliation has a higher causal burden than a plaintiff asserting a claim of direct discrimination under title vii.see m a n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.emphasis added woodson scott paper,cir.holding that the civil rights act of addition of m standard of causation does not apply to title vii retaliation claims.in woodson,we held that a plaintiff must prove that retaliatory animus had a determinative effect on the employer decision to subject the employee to the adverse employment action.at.and in moore,we stated the plaintiff causal burden slightly differently,holding that a plaintiff proceeding under a pretext theory,as grevious seeks to here,must convince the factfinder that the employer proffered explanation was false,and that retaliatory animus was the real reason for the adverse employment action.at emphasis added.
more recently,the supreme court concluded that a retaliation plaintiff ultimate burden is to prove that retaliatory animus was the cause of the adverse employment action.nassar,at.as we did in woodson,the nassar court limited m standard to discrimination claims.the supreme court reasoned that the plain text of m which is notably silent as to retaliation claims and the detailed statutory structure of title vii,indicate that congress did not intend to extend the standard to retaliation claims,which come under a.id.at see also woodson,at.
although this court determinative effect or real reason causation standard and the supreme court causation standard differ in terminology,they are functionally the same.to prove a determinative effect,the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a causal connection between the adverse employment action and retaliatory animus.miller cigna,cir.quoting hazen paper biggins,similarly,a plaintiff who proves that retaliatory animus was the real reason for the adverse employment action will necessarily be able to show that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of that is,but for the defendant conduct.nassar,at internal quotation mar
