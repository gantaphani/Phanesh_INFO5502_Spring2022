opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on plaintiffs appeal from orders entered in this action under,denying their motion for a judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial and granting defendants partial summary judgment and a partial judgment as a matter of law.in addition,plaintiffs appeal from an order awarding them attorneys fees,claiming that the award was inadequate.
this case arose from encounters between the philadelphia police and revelers at an impromptu street celebration following the philadelphia eagles national football conference championship win on january,the four mckenna his parents,michael and beth mckenna hereinafter and mckenna and his aunt,patricia the game on television and then,bringing two video cameras,left home to join thousands of other eagles fans celebrating in the streets of northeast philadelphia in the vicinity of cottman and frankford avenues.eventually,the gathering started to get out of control,and plaintiffs crossed paths with police officers attempting to disperse the crowd so that injuries and property damage could be avoided.
at the trial,plaintiffs and the officers offered what in some respects were differing accounts of their encounter.they all agreed,however,that during the encounter the police,in particular officer andrew jericho,arrested timothy mckenna.after they arrested timothy,the police brought him to the district headquarters the district for processing.his parents arrived at the district sometime later.while arguing with sergeant mark stoots regarding timothy status,mckenna was using his video camera to film activities in the district operations room,an area that was not open to the public for unrestricted access but which could be viewed through a window by occupants of the public area of the district building.after sergeant stoots repeatedly asked mckenna to stop videotaping,mckenna gave the camera to his wife to take to the car,but she returned with the camera hidden under her jacket,still recording ultimately,the police escorted and mckenna from the building after which they were free to go to wherever they wished.the police,however,transported timothy to a hospital for evaluation because he complained of injuries.moreover,on their own initiative,and mckenna and sullivan also went to the hospital seeking evaluation and treatment.when the family returned to the district,the police released timothy to his parents.though the police filed disorderly conduct charges against timothy,a local court dismissed the complaint for lack of prosecution after the police did not appear for several scheduled proceedings.
on january,the four plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court alleging that the city of philadelphia hereinafter,the city and various police officers directly had committed or were responsible for multiple violations under section of their constitutional rights during the course of the foregoing events.the city successfully moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs claims against it,but the case then proceeded to trial against defendants captain deborah kelly,officer jericho,sergeant stoots,and sergeant jonathan josey on claims of fourth amendment malicious prosecution,false arrest,excessive force,and first amendment retaliation.the first amendment claim alleged that defendants improperly delayed timothy release in retaliation for mckenna action in bringing a prior lawsuit against the city,and for the mckennas refusal to stop videotaping the operations room at the district where the police were holding timothy.
at the trial the district court granted officer jericho motion for judgment as a matter of law on the malicious prosecution claim and granted judgment in favor of sergeant stoots and sergeant josey on supervisory liability claims.the court also granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of captain kelly,finding that there was no evidence that she witnessed either the arrest or an improper delay in timothy release.
on september,following a trial on the remaining claims,the jury found in favor of defendants on all charges except timothy mckenna false arrest claim against officer jericho.the jury awarded timothy in damages on that claim.
subsequently,timothy attorney,brian puricelli,filed a fee petition pursuant to,seeking for representation of timothy.moreover,he separately filed a bill of costs with the clerk of the district court seeking the taxation of costs,but only against officer jericho,the sole defendant who had been held liable in the case.in a motion,plaintiffs also raised multiple grounds for the grant of a judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,a new trial.on september,the district court denied plaintiffs motions and,in a separate opinion and order,awarded them in attorneys fees,explaining at length its reasons for awarding so much less than the amount sought in the fee application.see mckenna city of philadelphia,civ,dist.lexis,wl.the court declined to rule on timothy request for costs,noting that the clerk of its court had not yet taxed costs and that,therefore,under the procedure outlined in eastern district local rule b,there was nothing for it to review.
subsequently,plaintiffs filed an appeal challenging certain aspects of both orders.for the reasons we discuss below,we will affirm the district court award of attorneys fees and its denial of plaintiffs motion for a judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial and will dismiss the appeal insofar as plaintiffs are seeking costs for the district court proceedings 
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs section claims pursuant to and,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to to review the orders challenged on this appeal,except we lack jurisdiction over the district court action in deferring disposition of timothy request for it to fix costs.under the procedures outlined in.d and local rule b,the clerk taxes costs,and then,if there is an objection to the clerk action,the district court reviews the clerk award.here,the district court declined to take any action on timothy request for costs because the clerk had not yet taxed costs.thus,because neither the clerk nor the district court has made any determination of whether timothy is entitled to costs,let alone settled on the quantum of the costs,there is not a final order on the costs issue for us to review therefore,to the extent that timothy seeks a review of the disposition on his application for costs,we will dismiss the appeal without prejudice to further proceedings with respect to costs in the district court 
iii.discussion 
attorneys fees 
we exercise plenary review in considering whether the district court applied the proper legal standards in determining the fee award,and we review the reasonableness of the fee award for abuse of discretion jama esmor corr,cir.we will conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion if a reasonable person could not have adopted the district court view of the appropriate amount of an award.rode dellarciprete,cir.we review the court factual findings on an attorneys fee application,including the court determination of an attorney reasonable hourly rate and the number of hours he or she reasonably worked on the case,for clear error.interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,cir.
the district court awarded fees pursuant to,which provides that prevailing parties in civil rights cases may be granted a reasonable attorney fee.the starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the lodestar,which courts determine by calculating the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,d.hensley instructs that courts are to exclude from the determination of the lodestar any hours not reasonably expended.hours subject to exclusion under hensley include those deemed excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.id.at.at.
a court calculation of the lodestar,however,does not end its inquiry on a fee application.a district court can adjust a fee award upward or downward based upon the results obtained in a case.id.at.at.in addition,an attorney work on unsuccessful claims not related to the claims on which the attorney succeeded is not compensable,because such work can not be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.see id.at.at internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,as we have held,the district court has a positive and affirmative function in the fee fixing process,not merely a passive role and should reduce the hours claimed by the number of hours spent litigating claims on which the party did not succeed,that were distinct from the claims on which the party did succeed,and for which the fee petition inadequately documents the hours claimed.loughner of pittsburgh,cir.
here,timothy trial attorney,brian puricelli,requested a total fee award of,comprising for hours of his own work and for hours logged by his,theodore kravitz.the city,though entirely successful as an entity,filed detailed objections to the fee petition,in theory on officer jericho behalf,and suggested that an appropriate award would be after making several sets of deductions and adjustments to the fee request,the court awarded timothy a total attorneys fee of,representing for puricelli work and for kravitz work.bearing in mind that our review of the court award is quite deferential,we now examine its adjustments.
deductions for hours not reasonably expended 
the district court began by applying hensley to exclude from the lodestar those hours that were not reasonably expended in the pursuit of timothy successful claim,a process that entailed reviewing the time charged,deciding whether the hours set out were reasonably devoted to each of the particular purposes described,and then excluding the hours that were excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.see at.at.see also loughner,at.in making this determination,the court excluded a substantial portion of the hours the attorneys billed for preparing the complaint,the proposed jury instructions,and the fee petition after concluding that the fee request included excessive time for these undertakings in light of the nature and quality of the work produced after reviewing the documents in question and the court discussion of them,we can not quarrel with its finding that some of the time claimed was excessive and was not reasonably expended 
adjustments to hourly rates 
after the district court reduced the hours allowed for the preparation of the complaint and eliminated the hours spent preparing the proposed jury instructions and fee petition,it arrived at a lodestar of hours for puricelli and hours for kravitz.next,the court determined a proper hourly rate for each attorney for his different types of work.based on the rate puricelli requested,along with his experience and what he had been paid for work on other cases in the same legal market,the court concluded that puricelli should receive per hour for work in court and per hour for work the court concluded that per hour was an appropriate rate for kravitz.in the case of both attorneys,however,the court decided to award fees at a reduced rate of per hour for hours that they spent performing clerical tasks such as faxing,emailing,filing,scanning,assembling,and conforming.also,because the fee application failed to break down trial time by category to reflect time spent in and out of court,the court used its own records to estimate the proper separation of time for those periods and awarded fees accordingly.
in the circumstances confronting the district court,it was entirely appropriate for the court to separate time for work,trial preparation,and clerical tasks for compensation at different rates.see loughner,at a claim by a lawyer for maximum rates for telephone calls with a client,legal research,a letter concerning a discovery request,the drafting of a brief,and trial time in court is neither fair nor reasonable.a district court determination of market billing rates is a factual question which is subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.jama,at quoting smith philadelphia hous,cir.the court reached a reasonable rate for each of the separate types of tasks performed,amply supported by its findings and well within its discretion,and we see no error in its reductions.
reduction for unsuccessful trial claims 
the district court also made a downward adjustment of the requested fee to reflect timothy lack of success on claims distinct from his successful false arrest claim.the propriety of this action depends upon whether the unsuccessful claims were,in fact,distinct.hensley cautions that courts should not reduce fees simply because some of a prevailing party related claims are unsuccessful.see at.at.for example,where a plaintiff claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories,m uch of counsel time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis.id.at.at.however,where a party brings claims that do not depend on the same sets of facts and legal theories as the claims on which the party has succeeded,fees should not be awarded for work on those unrelated claims because the work can not be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.see id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in a case,the proper allocation is of critical importance.the district court must ensure that a partially successful defendant is not required to provide compensation for an attorney unrelated efforts on behalf of an unsuccessful plaintiff,or in pursuit of the unsuccessful claims of an only partially victorious plaintiff,as section provides that only a prevailing party may be granted a reasonable attorney fee.here,of course,inasmuch as only one claim by one plaintiff succeeded in the district court,the court faced a difficult task in sorting out the work that was fairly compensable,which could include only the work that reasonably was expended in pursuit of the sole successful claim.see hensley,at.at.moreover,a plaintiff has the burden to establish that the time spent pursuing the unsuccessful claims contributed in any way to his success on his remaining claims.id.
the district court determined that timothy successful false arrest claim did not share a common core of facts with his own unsuccessful claims or with the other three plaintiffs unsuccessful claims.therefore,the district court ruled that the time spent in pursuit of these unsuccessful claims was not compensable under hensley.see id.at.at.
in reviewing the district court conclusion,we note that the unsuccessful malicious prosecution and first amendment retaliation claims concerned separate incidents that occurred after timothy arrest,and plaintiffs brought them under separate legal theories.on the other hand,the excessive force claims concerned events that were temporally proximate to timothy wrongful arrest.nonetheless,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that these claims did not share a common core of facts with the successful false arrest claim.establishing relatedness on a basis in the attorneys fees context is a determination that rightfully belongs within the district court discretion,given the trial court superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.id.at.at.here,the district court reasonably concluded that timothy failed to carry his burden to establish that the time spent pursuing the unsuccessful claims contributed in any way to his success on the false arrest claim,and that therefore no fees should be awarded for time spent on those unsuccessful claims.
after reaching this conclusion,the district court then had to determine what portion of the time billed was attributable to the unsuccessful claims.in the absence of proper records separating time spent on plaintiffs claims individually,the district court concluded that of the lodestar appropriately reflected the hours the attorneys reasonably expended representing timothy on his lone successful reduction which puricelli contends was arbitrary and mathematical.as the court acknowledged,o f course,a fee award should not be calculated using a simple mathematical approach based on the ratio between a plaintiff successful and unsuccessful claims.mckenna,dist.lexis,at,wl.it is incumbent on the fee applicant,however,to maintain billing time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct claims.hensley,at.at.
puricelli did not attempt to omit from his fee petition time spent on unsuccessful claims and failed to maintain records with sufficient specificity to allow the court to perform this calculation with precision.nonetheless,rather than merely considering the ratio of successful to unsuccessful claims,the court compared the time spent on timothy deposition and on his claims at trial with time spent on the parties depositions and claims,and it also took into account the amount of the recovery on timothy successful claim.in the absence of specific time entries to indicate how the attorneys spent their time on the distinct claims,the court reasonably used the information available to it to estimate a proper division of time.in this regard,we can not say that its findings were clearly erroneous.
in sum,we find that all of the district court deductions and adjustments were well reasoned and amply supported by the record.
defendants objections to the fee award 
in a statutory fee case,once the fee petitioner submit s evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed,id.at.at,the party opposing the fee application has the burden to challenge the reasonableness of the requested fee.see rode,at.a district court should not decrease a fee award based on factors not raised at all by the adverse party.bell united princeton,cir.timothy claims that defendants voiced few objections to his requested fees,and contends that the district court erred in adopting a method of reaching a reasonable fee award different from the method suggested by defendants.appellants br.at.
we find,however,that defendants detailed objections sufficiently raised the issues that the district court subsequently addressed.in addition to seeking reduction of the lodestar based on unsuccessful claims,defendants explicitly objected to the excessiveness of the hours spent in light of the quality of the work produced,noting that puricelli written work,including the complaint,motions,jury instructions,and the instant petition for attorneys fees,is careless,vague,ambiguous,unintelligible,verbose,and repetitive,and pointing to several specific instances where these filings were inaccurate and confusing.see app.at.clearly,defendants objections were sufficiently specific to provide puricelli with notice that he should be prepared to defend the hours billed for preparation of the complaint,the jury instructions,and the fee petition,which were the three filings for which the court deducted hours 
defendants made two further requests,asking for a reduction of hours based on the questionable accuracy of the attorneys time records,and for the district court to address other specific objections to the total compensation requested by reducing the total hourly rate uniformly to a blended rate of.as we held in bell,the type of reduction made by a district court need not be exactly the same as that requested by the adverse party,as long as the fee applicant is given sufficient notice to present his or her contentions with respect to the reduction that the district court ultimately makes.at.the court decision to address defendants objections by scrutinizing the time records,eliminating excessive hours,and applying hourly rates was well within its discretion.
review of denial of motion for a new trial,including subsumed arguments 
although their arguments before this court primarily have been directed towards the issue of attorneys fees,plaintiffs also appeal the denial of their motion for a new trial,asserting several grounds for error by the district court.the standard of review on a motion for a new trial is abuse of discretion,except where a district court bases its denial of the motion on an application of law,in which case an appellate court review is plenary.curley klem,cir.to the extent that this appeal involves review of a summary judgment or the granting or denying of a judgment as a matter of law,we exercise plenary review,see lightning lube,witco,cir,and to the extent that it involves review of evidentiary rulings we use an abuse of discretion standard,see acumed llc advanced surgical,cir.as we discuss below,plaintiffs arguments are without merit 
excessive force claims 
the district court properly rejected timothy mckenna argument that it should have instructed the jury,which rejected plaintiffs excessive force claims,that any amount of force used to effect an arrest without probable cause is per se excessive timothy statement of the law is unsupported by citation,and,moreover,is wrong.as the court correctly concluded,the jury was required to review any excessive force claims under a totality of the circumstances test,as enunciated in graham connor,d,to determine whether the force used was reasonable.see jones parmley,cir.
the district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs argument that they are entitled to a new trial on all of their excessive force claims because they presented evidence to show that force was used against them,whereas defendants did not present any lawful basis to use such force against them.appellants br.at.although there was in fact evidence that the police did not use excessive force,the court noted,correctly,that the jury was not required to accept plaintiffs evidence whether or not contrary evidence was presented.
supervisory liability 
plaintiffs contend that because they presented evidence that supervisors witnessed relevant misconduct,the district court erred in granting defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on their supervisory liability claims.to be liable in this situation,a supervisor must have been involved personally,meaning through personal direction or actual knowledge and acquiescence,in the wrongs alleged.see rode dellarciprete,cir.here,the only record citation that plaintiffs offer in support of their argument that supervisors witnessed misconduct is mckenna testimony that sergeant josey was in the vicinity of the arrest at some point after timothy was handcuffed,after timothy arrest.this is not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the plaintiffs and does not provide us with a reason to reverse the court grant of judgment as a matter of law on this issue.
exclusion of police directives on use of force 
plaintiffs allege that the district court erred when it excluded evidence of philadelphia police department directives on the appropriate use of force.the court ruled that even if the directives were relevant,they were subject to exclusion under rule of the federal rules of evidence,which permits the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.a trial court is afforded substantial discretion when striking a rule balance with respect to proffered evidence,see united states eufrasio,cir,and a trial judge decision to admit or exclude evidence under.may not be reversed unless it is arbitrary and irrational,bhaya westinghouse,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the court concluded that the directives had the potential to lead the jury to equate local policy violations with constitutional violations,and that this risk of confusing the issues substantially outweighed the directives probative value.we do not find that in making this determination the court abused its discretion.moreover,plaintiffs could have offered evidence of police practice standards in other ways for example,plaintiffs had the opportunity police witnesses about proper police conduct.
malicious prosecution claim 
timothy argues that the district court improperly granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants on officer jericho fourth amendment malicious prosecution claim.to prevail on a malicious prosecution claim under section,a plaintiff must
