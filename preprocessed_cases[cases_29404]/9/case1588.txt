amended opinion 
in,the pennsylvania department of corrections doc implemented a new prison mail policy.this policy required attorneys and courts to affix control numbers to mail sent to inmates before those communications would be separated from regular mail,and opened and inspected for the first time in the addressee inmate presence.appellees derrick dale fontroy,theodore savage,and aaron christopher wheeler the inmates successfully challenged the constitutionality of this policy on first amendment grounds in the district court.officials from the doc have appealed.we are mindful that important first amendment interests are at stake.but because we conclude that the new policy is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,turner safley,d,it passes constitutional muster,and we will reverse the district court.
to ensure that inmates can not obtain contraband through the mail system,the doc has policies for opening and inspecting incoming prison mail.the doc receives mail addressed to inmates in mailrooms,which are located outside the perimeter of each corrections facility.there,the mail is and sorted.mail inspectors at these facilities then open and inspect regular mail for contraband.legal mail however,must be treated differently.although the doc prohibits mail inspectors from reading mail addressed to inmates except in special circumstances,constitutional obligations require the doc to take additional measures to ensure that legal mail remains unread.see jones brown,cir holding that state prisoners have an interest protected by the first amendment in being present when their incoming legal mail is opened.see also bieregu reno,cir a pattern and practice of opening properly marked incoming court mail outside an inmate presence infringes communication protected by the right to free speech.emphasis added.a policy that allows the opening of legal mail without the physical presence of addressee inmates deprives the expression of confidentiality and chills the inmates protected expression,regardless of the state protestations that it does not,and will not,read the content of the communications.jones,at.as a result,the doc tries to separate legal mail from regular mail so that legal mail can be opened and inspected for the first time in the addressee inmate presence.how the doc distinguishes between legal and regular mail is at the heart of this dispute.
under the doc mail policy in place from the until,doc staff looked at the return address alone to determine whether the sender was an attorney or court.if the return address indicated that the mail originated from one of those sources,the mail was classified as a privileged correspondence.privileged correspondence was then separated from the regular mail,sent to the corrections facility,and opened and inspected for the first time by housing unit officers in the inmates presence.
in,the doc decided to change its policies and procedures for handling and inspecting legal mail sent to inmates.appellant jeffrey beard,the secretary of the doc,explained during a deposition that the doc had ongoing concerns about the privileged mail that was coming to our institutions,because on a not infrequent basis,and in virtually all of our institutions at one time or another,we have come across attempts by inmates to smuggle various items in what was considered to be privileged mail.two reports prepared in evidenced those ongoing concerns.a november report analyzing the escape of an inmate the escape report suggested that the hacksaw blade and security screwdriver the inmate used to escape were obtained through mail treated as privileged correspondence.additionally,a september report entitled privileged correspondence inspection and contraband the september report contained a random sampling of incidents involving legal mail abuse.the september report advised the doc to revise the existing mail inspection policies because contraband contained in privileged correspondence would pass through corrections facility gates before it could be discovered and the inspection of privileged correspondence was less effective because housing unit officers had less experience and time to devote to the task than the professional corrections mail inspectors.
after negotiating proposed revisions with the american civil liberties union,pennsylvania institutional law project,and the defender association of philadelphia,the doc issued a new mail policy on september,effective september.under the new policy,incoming attorney communications could be treated as privileged correspondence only if they met one of two conditions the attorneys the sealed communications to specified doc facilities or the attorneys obtained a control number from the doc and placed the control number on each envelope mailed to an inmate.attorneys could obtain a control number by faxing a letter request containing the attorney name,address,telephone and fax numbers,state attorney identification number,and a written verification subject to the penalties of.that all mail sent to inmates using the control number would contain only essential confidential,communication and would contain no contraband.the doc must then provide the attorney with a control number one business day after receiving a request a subsequent revision that was issued on may,effective july,made two relevant changes the revision allowed courts to obtain control numbers in the same manner as attorneys and required all incoming mail that did not bear a control number but still appeared to be from a court to be after it was opened and inspected like other regular mail.
on may,the inmates filed a pro se complaint against appellants beard,david diguglielmo,and kim ulisny the doc officials an amended complaint was filed on january,followed by a blizzard of other submissions the inmates alleged that the doc new mail policy unconstitutionally burdened their first amendment rights.they claimed that attorneys and courts had not obtained control numbers,despite repeated requests,and as a result corrections mail inspectors were opening and inspecting legitimate legal mail outside of the inmates presence.the inmates sought both damages and injunctive relief.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment.fontroy beard,d,on may,the district court granted the inmates motion for summary judgment with respect to their request to enjoin the new mail policy implementation,and denied the doc officials corresponding for summary judgment on that issue id.at.the district court determined that the doc new mail policy unconstitutionally infringed on the inmates first amendment rights because there was no reasonable connection between the asserted legitimate penological interest and the mail regulation as required by turner safley.id.at.the court believed that t he connection between the policy change and the rationale for it was tenuous and remote,and characterized the changes as an overreaction to a single escape incident and a few isolated violations of the contraband policy involving legal mail that may or may not have occurred.id.at.accordingly,the court held that the new mail policy failed the first part of turner test there was no rational relationship between the mail policy and the legitimate penological interest in prison safety and security.id.in the alternative,the court held that the new policy did not satisfy turner second step,which is outlined below,and therefore would not have passed constitutional muster even if a rational connection had been established.id.
after the district court denied their motion to alter the judgment,the doc officials filed a timely appeal challenging both the district court granting of the inmates motion for summary judgment and its denial of the doc officials for summary judgment.
the inmates underlying suit is actionable under.therefore,the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction under.our review of the district court summary judgment decisions is plenary,but we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party.nasir morgan,cir.
we first address the district court grant of the inmates motion for summary judgment.the doc officials concede that the doc new mail policy impinges on the inmates first amendment rights because at least some legal mail is opened and inspected outside of the inmates presence.see jones,at reaffirming that a policy of opening legal mail outside the presence of the addressee inmate interferes with protected communications,strips those protected communications of their confidentiality,and accordingly impinges upon the inmate right to freedom of speech.the doc officials point out,however,that the policy can still be constitutional under turner safley if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner,at.
under the teachings of turner,there are two steps to take in determining whether a prison regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.jones,at quoting turner,at.first,we must determine whether there is a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate interest put forth to justify it.monroe beard,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.we afford substantial deference to the doc professional judgment,but the doc officials evidence must amount to more than a conclusory assertion.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.although the inmates bear the ultimate burden of showing that the doc new mail policy is unconstitutional,it is the doc officials burden to demonstrate that a rational connection exists between the policy and a legitimate penological interest.id.
if this rational connection exists,we then consider three other factors in a analysis whether inmates have an alternative means of exercising the right the burden on prison resources that would be imposed by accommodating the right and whether there are alternatives to the regulation that fully accommodate the inmate rights at de minimis cost to valid penological objectives.id.we do not,however,require prisons to use the least restrictive means possible to further legitimate penological interests.id.
under turner first step,we must determine whether the record supports a rational connection between improving the means of verifying the source of legal mail through the use of control numbers and the safety and security problems posed by inmates using the legal mail system to smuggle contraband.
we conclude that the doc officials have established the necessary rational connection here.first,the record provides ample support for the doc belief that its old legal mail policy was being abused.beard testified at his deposition that over the years we have had ongoing concerns about the privileged mail that was coming into our institutions.ulisny,a mailroom supervisor with years of mailroom experience,testified at her deposition that she encountered instances where mail bearing return addresses from attorneys and courts contained contraband.the escape report stated that there was s ubstantial evidence show ing that an escaped inmate was able to introduce contraband in the institution through legal mail.this included the materials suspected to have aided in the inmate escape.the september report included a random sample of about fifteen instances between to where the doc recovered contraband from mail that appeared from its return address to be legal mail.
second,the record shows that some of these abuses of the doc old mail policy involved the falsification of return addresses in order to obtain treatment as privileged correspondence.ulisny testified that she recalled one instance where contraband was discovered in an envelope fraudulently bearing an attorney return address.the september report random sampling of legal mail abuses included at least two instances that involved the use of a fake return address from an attorney.indeed,the escape report specifically pointed out that under the doc old mail policy,it was difficult to confirm whether the mail was actually sent by an attorney,since legal envelopes have been stolen and misused by inmates their associates.
third,evidence suggests that prison security and safety is enhanced when corrections mail inspectors inspect more mail,and housing unit officers inspect less.the september report identified two reasons for this effect inspection kept contraband contained in mail from physically entering the corrections facility and the use of professional corrections mail inspectors increased the likelihood that contraband would be discovered.the escape report echoed these findings.accordingly,reducing the amount of fake legal mail erroneously treated as privileged correspondence would enhance prison security and safety.
for these reasons,we disagree with the district court that t he connection between the policy change and the rationale for it is tenuous and remote.fontroy,d at.most clearly,the record undermines the district court determination that t he concerns articulated now by the doc were not the reasons given for the policy change at the time,and t he only rationale for the revision then was the prevention of escape.id.at.to the contrary,the september report random sampling of instances of legal mail abuse,the escape report specific reference to problems distinguishing between fake and legitimate legal mail,and ulisny testimony about legal mail abuses bolster beard testimony that the doc had ongoing concerns about weaknesses in its legal mail system.although the inmate escape may have prompted the doc to scrutinize its mail policies across penal institutions,the doc certainly had evidence of ongoing and systematic abuses of the legal mail system,including evidence of the use of fake attorney return addresses.this shows that much more than just the prevention of escape motivated the doc new mail policy.
any deficiencies in the escape report and the september report that the district court relied upon do not suggest otherwise.although the escape report did not conclusively determine that the inmate escape tools were smuggled into the prison through legal mail,this does not amount to a fail ure to produce any evidence,let alone substantial evidence,linking the inmate escape tools to legal mail.fontroy,d at.the escape report noted that,in,the escaped inmate was issued a misconduct for the possession of implements of escape and possession of a controlled substance,when marijuana and a security screwdriver tip were found in the binding of a legal brief.also,the escape report conclusion that s ubstantial evidence shows that the escaped inmate was able to introduce contraband into the institution through legal mail must be taken as true in deciding whether to grant the inmates motion for summary judgment.see nasir,at.
more importantly,the september report outlined much more than only a few isolated violations of the doc old legal mail policy.fontroy,d at.as explained in the report preface,the instances of mail abuse mentioned in the report are merely a random sampling of incidents involving legal mail abuse.emphasis added.according to the report,the random sampling illustrate s that legal mail abuse is an ongoing problem that is not going away.therefore,the report is evidence of larger systemic problems with the doc old mail policy.
additionally,we can not agree with the distinction that the district court drew between harmless and dangerous contraband.id.at.there is no meaningful difference.even if some pieces of contraband may be less dangerous than others,an inmate possession of any items that the doc has classified as contraband would pose some risk to prison safety and security.at a minimum,it flouts prison rules and creates inequality among prisoners.this chips away at the doc ability to maintain safe and orderly penal institutions.
we admit that there is much less evidence linking falsified court mail,as opposed to fake attorney mail,with attempts to smuggle contraband.see fontroy,d at noting the scant evidence of demonstrable safety and security threats associated with court mail.this is not enough,however,to persuade us that the doc new policy is unconstitutional.if court mail policies did not change along with attorney mail policies,it is obvious that the abuse of the legal mail system could continue with ease to circumvent the new attorney mail policy,individual
