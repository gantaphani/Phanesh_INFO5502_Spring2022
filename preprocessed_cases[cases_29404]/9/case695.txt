this appeal requires us to decide three issues of first impression in this circuit.answering a question that has divided our sister circuits,we hold that a plaintiff who alleges that local educational officials have flouted her right to a free and appropriate public education may not bring suit for money damages under without first exhausting the administrative process established by the individuals with disabilities education act idea.we next conclude that discrimination is actionable under title ix of the educational amendments of although,due to shortcomings in the amended complaint,the district court dismissal of that claim nonetheless must stand.finally,we hold that the family educational rights and privacy act ferpa does not confer a private right of action upon either an aggrieved student or her parents.the upshot is that we affirm the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs amended complaint.
background 
we approach this appeal mindful that we must accept as true all factual averments contained in the operative pleading the plaintiffs amended complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleading parties.see aulson blanchard,cir see also.b.
we start by identifying the principal players.the plaintiffs in this case are kate frazier a young woman alleged to suffer from learning disabilities and her parents,bradford and judith frazier.their suit,commenced on january,grows out of kate matriculation at,and her troubled odyssey through,high school in a bucolic southeastern massachusetts community the town of fairhaven.the defendants are the fairhaven school committee,the superintendent of schools,the principal of fairhaven high school,and two school administrators a guidance counselor and a discipline matron.
the lower court has written a thoughtful,closely reasoned opinion in which it has catalogued the plaintiffs allegations in considerable detail.see frazier fairhaven sch,d.it would be pleonastic to repeat that recital here.thus,we proceed directly to the issues that confront us,referring those who hunger for factual context to the district court account.
insofar as is pertinent here,the amended complaint asserts three claims arising under federal law a claim that the defendants frustrated kate right to a free and appropriate public education and,therefore,are liable for money damages under a claim that the high school discipline matron sexually harassed kate during school hours and,therefore,that the defendants are liable for money damages under title ix and a claim that the defendants infringed kate right to privacy anent her school records and,therefore,that they are liable for money damages under ferpa.after some preliminary skirmishing not material here,the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that it failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted.b.the district court dismissed the federal claims with prejudice.frazier,d at.at the same time,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims and dismissed those claims without prejudice.id.at.this timely appeal ensued.in it,the plaintiffs challenge the lower court disposition of the three federal claims but do not contest the dismissal of their claims.
ii.the section claim 
the statutory engine that drives the plaintiffs principal claim is.this statute provides in pertinent part that e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured.properly construed,section supplies a private right of action against a person who,under color of state law,deprives another of rights secured by the constitution or by federal law.evans avery,cir.
to maintain such a cause of action,a plaintiff first must allege official conduct,that is,the occurrence of some act or omission undertaken under color of state law.roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir.here,the plaintiffs easily satisfy this requirement the defendants are officials or employees of a public school system,and all of them admittedly were acting under color of massachusetts law.the plaintiffs also must allege that the defendants acts or omissions deprived them of a right.baker mccollan,d nieves mcsweeney,cir.to meet this requirement,the plaintiffs posit that federal law guaranteed kate a free and appropriate public education and that the defendants actions deprived her of that entitlement 
the plaintiffs premise is sound the idea guarantees a free and appropriate public education to all children with disabilities.d a.to realize that promise,the idea imposes a set of procedural safeguards upon state and local educational agencies that receive federal grants earmarked for special education and related services.see id.as a recipient of such federal funds,fairhaven high school was bound by the statutory conditions that congress attached to the grants.since the idea violations alleged by the plaintiffs all transpired while kate frazier was a student attending fairhaven high school,the plaintiffs have brought themselves within the idea reach.
the plaintiffs an idea violation can ground a section claim even without exhaustion of administrative considerably more problematic.to address this aspect of the case,we must explore the anatomy of the idea.we then consider the necessity for exhaustion.
a.the statutory scheme.
the idea is a comprehensive statutory scheme enacted by congress to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services and that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.id.d a b.to that end,the idea provides that public school systems shall establish and maintain procedures to ensure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education by such agencies.id.a.the idea contains a panoply of procedural safeguards designed to assure that parents will have meaningful input into decisions that affect the education of children with special needs.these include the right of parents to examine all records related to their child,to participate in meetings regarding the identification,evaluation,and educational placement of their child,to obtain an independent educational evaluation of their child,and to receive prior written notice whenever an educational agency proposes or refuses to change their child placement or program.id.b.
the idea also provides parents with an opportunity to lodge formal complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.id.b.a complaining parent has recourse to an impartial due process hearing conducted by either the local or state educational agency and if the hearing is conducted at the local level,the parent may then appeal to the state agency.id.f g.in massachusetts,the department of education has created the bureau of special education appeals bsea and empowered it to handle such appeals through mediations and hearings.see.tit.
the idea permits any party who is dissatisfied with the outcome of the due process hearing to bring suit in state or federal court.i.but that right of action is carefully circumscribed.as a condition precedent to its exercise,an aggrieved party must satisfy the idea exhaustion provision.this provision states that 
nothing in the idea shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the americans with disabilities act of,title v of the rehabilitation act of,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under subchapter ii of the idea,the procedures under subsections f and g of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.
id.l.this requirement is not limited to claims based directly upon violations of the idea.the exhaustion principle applies even when the suit is brought pursuant to a different statute so long as the party is seeking relief that is available under subchapter ii of idea.rose yeaw,cir.subchapter ii of the idea includes,in pertinent part,the procedural safeguards set forth in section.
the requirement that plaintiffs exhaust administrative remedies available under the idea is not absolute.for instance,a plaintiff does not have to exhaust administrative remedies if she can show that the administrative remedies afforded by the process are inadequate given the relief sought.id.at see also honig doe,d holding,under predecessor statute,that parents may bypass the administrative process where exhaustion would be futile or inadequate cong.rec.remarks of williams e xhaustion of the administrative procedures should not be required for any individual complainant filing a judicial action in cases where such exhaustion would be futile either as a legal or practical matter.nevertheless,the idea exhaustion requirement remains the general rule,and a party who seeks to invoke an exemption bears the burden of showing that it applies.see honig,at.
the plaintiffs acknowledge that they have not pursued administrative remedies.they view this as inconsequential.their argument for an exemption from the exhaustion requirement,adroitly distilled by the district court,see frazier,d at,runs along the following lines.the amended complaint does not rely upon the idea,but,rather,upon it seeks relief exclusively in the form of money damages.seizing on the fact that the array of remedies available under the idea does not include money damages,see sellers sch,cir heidemann rother,cir crocker.secondary sch.athletic ass n,cir,the plaintiffs argue that pursuing their claim through the idea administrative process would be a waste of time.rather,they should be allowed to forgo exhaustion and bring their section claim directly before a federal district court.
the defendants demur.they insist that the plaintiffs should be required to run the administrative gauntlet established by the idea to the same extent as if they originally had brought suit under that statute,notwithstanding that the plaintiffs seek only money damages.the defendants note that the statutory scheme hinges on facilitating the delivery of educational services,and warn that granting the plaintiffs request would create an device,allowing future plaintiffs to bypass the idea administrative procedures at will and to substitute monetary damages for the educational assistance that congress intended to bestow upon handicapped children.the parties thus join issue to exhaust or not to is the question.
b.the necessity for exhaustion.
the question of whether a plaintiff who seeks only money damages is required to exhaust administrative remedies before instituting a section claim predicated on a violation of the idea is one of novel impression in this circuit.five other courts of appeals previously have grappled with this question.three of them have permitted plaintiffs who seek only money damages to proceed with their section claims without first exhausting the idea machinery.see covington knox county sch,cir witte clark county sch,cir matula,cir.two other courts have reached the opposite conclusion,holding squarely that plaintiffs may not bypass the idea administrative process merely by limiting their prayers for relief to money damages.see charlie bd.of,cir alachua county sch,cir per curiam.
in addressing this problem,we think that it is useful to reflect upon the general rationale that underlies exhaustion requirements in administrative regimes 
in the administrative state,exhaustion of administrative remedies is generally required.this requirement is more than a matter of form.insisting on exhaustion forces parties to take administrative proceedings seriously,allows administrative agencies an opportunity to correct their own errors,and potentially avoids the need for judicial involvement altogether.
gioioso sons,oshrc,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the idea fits comfortably into this general pattern.congress constructed the law on the premise that plaintiffs would be required to utilize the elaborate administrative scheme established by the idea before resorting to the courts to challenge the actions of the local school authorities,at citation omitted.that makes sense because exhaustion enables the educational agency to develop a factual record,to apply its expertise to the problem,to exercise its discretion,and to correct its own mistakes,and is credited with promoting accuracy,efficiency,agency autonomy,and judicial economy.christopher portsmouth sch,cir discussing predecessor statute.
indeed,special benefits adhere to the exhaustion requirement in the idea context.the idea administrative machinery places those with specialized the center of the decisionmaking process,entrusting to them the initial evaluation of whether a disabled student is receiving a free,appropriate public education.these administrative procedures also ensure that educational agencies will have an opportunity to correct shortcomings in a disabled student individualized education program iep.see charlie,at explaining that an animating principle of the idea is that educational professionals are supposed to have at least the first crack at formulating a plan to overcome the consequences of educational shortfalls.this too makes sense because the problems attendant to the evaluation and education of those with special needs are highly ramified and demand the best available expertise.
the reliance of courts upon the detailed evidentiary record developed during the due process hearing further underscores the importance of the idea administrative procedures.the statutory requirement that the reviewing court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings,i b i,means that the court must give due weight to those proceedings.see bd.of educ.rowley,d decided under identically worded provision in predecessor statute.put another way,the provision of judicial review is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.id.thus,judicial review in this type of case falls well short of complete de novo review.lenn portland sch,cir.allowing plaintiffs to bypass the idea administrative process en route to state or federal court disrupts this carefully calibrated balance and shifts the burden of factfinding from the educational specialists to the judiciary.that phenomenon is directly at odds with the method of the idea t o allow parents to come directly to federal courts will render the entire scheme of the idea nugatory.crocker,at.
the plaintiffs concede these they say that their value evaporates where,as here,a claimant seeks a remedy that the administrative machinery can not provide.we do not agree.exhaustion is beneficial regardless of whether the administrative process offers the specific form of remediation sought by a particular plaintiff.after all,the administrative process facilitates the compilation of a fully developed record by a factfinder versed in the educational needs of disabled that record is an invaluable resource for a state or federal court required to adjudicate a subsequent civil action covering the same terrain.fidelity to the idea exhaustion requirement ensures such an outcome.
in concluding that exhaustion of administrative remedies is advantageous even though the administrative process does not offer the specific form of relief sought by the plaintiff,we find instructive a recent supreme court decision involving a different,but analogous,administrative exhaustion requirement.in booth churner,d,an inmate at a pennsylvania state prison claimed that guards had violated his eighth amendment rights by assaulting him and then withholding medical treatment.id.at.the applicable administrative grievance system,promulgated by pennsylvania correctional authorities,did not provide for the recovery of money damages.id.at.booth filed a grievance but,after prison officials rejected it,spurned administrative review,invoked,and sued in the federal district court for money damages.
the district court dismissed the claim on the ground that booth had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.the court of appeals affirmed,cir,and the supreme court granted certiorari.
the crux of the controversy was the plra exhaustion requirement,which provides that no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.booth implored the court to rule that this requirement was inapposite because the administrative review process was not empowered to award the only form of relief that he damages.the court refined the dispute to its bare essence whether or not a remedial scheme was available where the administrative process has authority to take some action in response to a complaint,but not the remedial action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.booth.at.the court answered this question in the affirmative,concluding that a remedial scheme was available to booth notwithstanding the inability of that scheme to yield an award of money damages.justice souter,writing for a unanimous court,observed that 
t he word exhausted has a decidedly procedural emphasis.it makes sense only in referring to the procedural means,not the particular relief ordered it makes no sense to demand that someone exhaust such administrative redress as is available one exhausts processes,not forms of relief,and the statute provides that one must.
id.at.on this basis,the court concluded that congress had mandated exhaustion regardless of the particular relief offered or not offered through a given set of administrative procedures.id.at.
what the court said of the plra exhaustion language is equally true of the idea.the idea exhaustion requirement mandates that the procedures under subsection f and g of this section shall be exhausted.l.by adopting this particular phraseology,congress unmistakably evinced its intent to require exhaustion of procedures available under the idea.given this similarity,there is every reason to apply in the idea context the core holding of booth,that a statutory exhaustion requirement means that a party must exhaust all available avenues of administrative review regardless of whether the administrative process offers the particular type of relief that is being sought.
booth is instructive in another respect as well.the prisoner there staked out a position nearly identical to that staked out by the instant plaintiffs,arguing that exhaustion should be excused under a futility exception on the ground that the administrative process could not yield an award of money damages.the booth court pointed rejection of that argument strongly suggests that,whatever the statutory context,a party must exhaust a mandatory administrative process even if the precise form of relief sought is not available in the administrative venue.this makes perfect sense the administrative process,at the very least,should facilitate the development of a useful record and,thus,assist in the informed disposition of any subsequent litigation.seen in that light,exhaustion of the enumerated administrative procedures is useful even though the procedures can not yield the particular redress that the claimant prefers.it follows inexorably that,in such circumstances,exhaustion should not be excused on the ground of futility.
this result is all the more attractive when one considers the practical consequences of allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their section claim without first exhausting the idea administrative process.that course of action would allow a plaintiff to bypass the administrative procedures merely by crafting her complaint to seek relief that educational authorities are powerless to grant.this would subvert not only the very existence of a mandatory exhaustion requirement but also the overall scheme that congress envisioned for dealing with educational disabilities.we agree with the eleventh circuit that p ermitting parents to avoid the requirements of the idea through such a back door would not be consistent with the legislative intent of the idea,at.
the plaintiffs have two other arguments peculiar to this case.first,they note that since kate already has graduated,the administrative process can do nothing to ameliorate the bungling that marred her educational experience.we do not think that this fact can tip the balance.
first,even after graduation,compensatory education is an available remedy.see pihl.dep t of,cir.more entire matter of timing is largely within a plaintiff control.the idea provides a comprehensive remedial scheme,and the plaintiffs could have invoked it at any of several different points during kate high school years it would be a hollow gesture to say that exhaustion is then to say that plaintiffs,by holding back until the affected child graduates,can evade the requirement.as the district court aptly observed,permitting a plaintiff to proceed with an claim for money damages under another federal statute without first exhausting administrative remedies 
might simply encourage plaintiffs to wait to dispute the adequacy of their educational programs until after graduation precisely in the hope of recovering money damages.this would mean that plaintiffs would not actually address educational issues when they situation directly at odds with the idea primary goal of ensuring the education of children with disabilities.
frazier,d at.
the plaintiffs also assert that the bsea will not hear cases which involve only monetary damages.they attempt to leverage this point into the broader proposition that it is futile for a plaintiff who seeks only money damages to bring an idea claim before the bsea.this argument overstates the matter.while the bsea has acknowledged its lack of authority to award damages in idea cases,it simultaneously has asserted its power to retain jurisdiction over idea claims that seek relief exclusively in the form of money damages.we explain briefly.
although the idea requires impartial due process hearings,congress left the details of those proceedings to the states.in response,massachusetts has adopted a panoply of statutes and regulations.under the state scheme,a parent may request a hearing by the bsea regarding the evaluation of,and the appropriate educational program for,a child with a disability.see mass laws ch.tit.nothing in this mosaic suggests that the bsea is barred from the adjudication of special education disputes in which a plaintiff seeks only money damages.
in furtherance of their claim that the bsea categorically refuses to adjudicate idea claims in which the plaintiffs seek only monetary damages,the plaintiffs cite two bsea proceedings.neither precedent advances the plaintiffs cause.
the first such case,in re natick pub.spec.educ.bsea,involved plaintiffs who requested the hearing officer to confirm that the bsea lacked jurisdiction to award compensatory or punitive damages in connection with their claims.when the school system acquiesced in this position,the hearing officer ruled that the bsea had no authority to award money damages under the idea,but nonetheless retained jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims id.at.this retention of jurisdiction directly contradicts the plaintiffs ipse dixit.
the second bsea proceeding cited by the plaintiffs,in re brockton pub.spec.educ.bsea,similarly fails to support their contention.brockton involved serial hearings.the initial hearings focused on amending the iep of a potentially violent high school student.after a full airing,the hearing officer made extensive findings of fact and concluded that home tutoring represented the appropriate educational placement.the next hearing focused on the plaintiffs claim for compensatory and punitive damages stemming from the school system handling of the educational placement.the hearing officer ruled that the bsea lacked jurisdiction to award money damages pursuant to the idea and deemed the plaintiffs administrative remedies fully exhausted.id.at.the crucial point here is that the hearing officer already had compiled the requisite findings of fact and,thus,a court of competent jurisdiction could rely upon the administrative record developed by the hearing officer to adjudicate the ensuing section claim 
in sum,the plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of proving that pausing to exhaust the idea administrative process would be futile and,therefore,that should be excused.accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs who bring an claim under,in which they seek only money damages,must exhaust the administrative process available under the idea as a condition precedent to entering a state or federal court.
iii.the title ix claim 
the plaintiffs advance a series of claims under title ix of the educational amendments of.these claims stem from an incident that allegedly occurred during kate frazier third year at fairhaven high school.as the plaintiffs describe the incident,kate was relieving herself in a bathroom stall with the door closed when the school discipline matron,defendant janet morency,peered into the stall through a crack between the door and the wall.the plaintiffs allege that the incident caused kate profound distress and that,although they reported it to the school psychologist,school officials took no action against morency.moreover,they assert that morency stalked kate,continually leering,scowling,and pointing at her.
the viability of this statement of claim depends in the first instance on a question of first impression in this circuit is harassment actionable under title ix the parties have,without analysis,assumed that it is.we conclude that the assumption is well founded.although strictly speaking,this is not determinative of our disposition of the title ix claim,which is based on pleading inadequacy,we think it timely to pretermit later speculation by setting forth our analysis.
title ix prohibits discrimination in a wide array of programs and activities undertaken by educational institutions.cohen brown,cir.it provides in pertinent part that n o person shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.the statute enforcement machinery includes an implied private right of action through which an aggrieved party may seek money damages.gebser lago vista indep.sch,d.since this private right of action extends only to claims against the educational institution itself,lipsett of,cir,the plaintiffs title ix claim perforce fails as to all the individual defendants.the fairhaven school committee is,however,potentially liable.
there are arguably two ways in which sexual harassment in the educational milieu can constitute discrimination actionable under title ix the first,quid pro quo harassment,is not implicated in this case.the second,hostile environment harassment,covers acts of sexual harassment sufficiently severe and pervasive to compromise or interfere with educational opportunities normally available to students.see brown hot,sexy safer prod ns,cir explaining that such a violation occurs when the educational environment is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult of sufficient severity citation and internal quotations marks omitted.
we have not previously considered a title ix claim of sexual harassment involving a plaintiff and defendant of the same gender.for guidance,we turn to title vii of the civil rights act of.see wills brown,cir recognizing that certain aspects of title vii and title ix are to be construed in pari materia lipsett,at applying the legal framework governing title vii sexual harassment claims to similar allegations brought under title ix see also franklin gwinnett county pub,d citing a title vii hostile environment case to support a holding that a teacher sexual harassment of a student was actionable under title ix.
the supreme court has found harassment claims actionable under title vii.oncale sundowner offshore,d.we believe that the reasoning of oncale is fully transferable to title ix cases.the court observation that b ecause of the many facets of human motivation,it would be unwise to presume as a matter of law that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against members of their group,id.at.quoting castaneda partida,d,has equal force in a scholastic setting.moreover,the oncale court extended the statutory proscriptions of title vii to harassment even though such harassment was assuredly not the principal evil that congress was concerned with when it enacted title vii,id.at,and there is no principled basis for construing title ix more grudgingly.we therefore hold that a hostile environment claim based upon harassment is cognizable under title ix.accord doe ex rel.doe dallas indep.sch,cir kinman omaha pub.sch,cir.
while our recognition that the sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or school administrator of the same gender is actionable under title ix means that the instant plaintiffs have won a battle,they have not necessarily won the war.it remains to be seen whether the amended complaint brings their case within the confines of this cause of action.to succeed on that issue,the amended complaint must show that kate was a student,who was subjected to harassment based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive to create an abusive educational environment and that a cognizable basis for institutional liability exists.see brown,at.to satisfy the fifth part of this formulation,the plaintiffs must prove that a school official authorized to take corrective action had actual knowledge of the harassment,yet exhibited deliberate indifference to it.gebser,at.wills,at.
the amended complaint flunks this test.discrimination on the basis of sex is the sine qua non of a title ix sexual harassment case,and a failure to plead that element is fatal.higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir explaining that in harassment cases as in all sexual harassment cases,the plaintiff must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,but in fact constituted discrimination because of sex quoting oncale,at.there is nothing in the amended complaint to suggest that morency behavior constituted discrimination on the basis of sex.
nor can discrimination fairly be inferred from the circumstances limned in the amended complaint.as the high school discipline matron,morency was responsible for the general discipline in the halls and ways of the school.frazier,d at citing plaintiffs amended complaint.acting in that capacity,she had authorized access to the restrooms used by female students in order to ensure that nothing was amiss.given the plethora of potential problems that persistently plague high schools in this day and,alcohol,and the actions,though insensitive,do not exceed her mandate.thus,we agree with the district court that t he plaintiffs have not alleged facts from which it reasonably can be inferred that morency action was of a sexual nature or based on kate sex.id.
the plaintiffs argue that the amended complaint,generously read,alleges a second title ix violation the failure of school officials to investigate the bathroom incident.but even if such a claim is properly before matter on which we take no nonetheless fizzles.in the absence of conduct creating a hostile educational environment,laxity on the part of school officials in investigating an incident is not actionable under title ix.karibian columbia,if what occurs is an employer failure to investigate and take remedial measures in response to a complaint of discrimination based upon title vii,and if it turns out that no actual discrimination has occurred,then there is nothing which actually constitutes any conduct banned by the statute.
the plaintiffs claim of retaliation fares n
