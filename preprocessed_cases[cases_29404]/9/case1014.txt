eunice fulton suffers from multiple sclerosis.her illness prevented her from visiting her husband in an upstate new york prison,roughly miles from her new york city home,as part of a inmate visitor program ivp.proceeding pro se,fulton sued officials of the new york state department of correctional services docs,pursuant to the americans with disabilities act ada,and the rehabilitation act,a,seeking relief for the defendants asserted failure to accommodate her disability in administering the ivp.the united states district court for the northern district of new york gary sharpe,judge dismissed fulton suit for both lack of standing and failure to state a claim.the district court,however,was misguided in viewing fulton suit as consisting of claims solely based on the defendants refusal to transfer her husband to a prison closer to new york city,when in fact the basis of fulton claim is broader the defendants failure even to consider whether her disability could be reasonably accommodated.
background 
multiple sclerosis ms is a disease in which the body immune system attacks the central nervous system,repeatedly injuring the nerves and ultimately causing them to degenerate.ms has no cure and can often lead to partial or complete paralysis,but medication can slow the disease progression.
in,twelve years after she was diagnosed with ms,fulton was paralyzed in the lower left side of her body.she required a wheelchair to move,and a health care professional to assist her with her daily needs.although she could stand on her own for short periods,her ms prevented her from traveling long distances.
in april,fulton husband was convicted of two crimes and sentenced in new york state court to a prison term of two to four years.in june,upon his admission to a docs inmate processing facility,he asked to be housed in a prison near his wife because of her disability.docs denied this request and,in july,transferred fulton husband to the altona correctional facility,some miles from new york city in docs clinton county hub area.soon thereafter,when he asked to be placed in a facility closer to new york city,docs told him that,under docs policy,he would have to spend two years in the clinton hub before he would be eligible for a transfer.the docs ivp permitted prisoners to be visited in prison by friends and relatives,docs directive i,but fulton ms made it impossible for her to visit her husband at the altona prison.
in october,fulton wrote to defendant glen goord,docs commissioner,told him of her disability,and,according to the complaint,requested that reasonable accommodations be made to enable her to visit with her husband.compl.she asked that consideration be given to transfer sic her husband to somewhere closer to her.compl.around that time,fulton and her husband each also wrote to defendant theresa david,docs director of classification and movement,to request reasonable accommodation for fulton to participate in the visiting program.compl.
in november,fulton received a letter from david stating that,in light of the docs transfer policy,fulton husband would need to stay in the clinton hub until at least july.the letter did not mention fulton disability or consideration of any other accommodation.
in december,fulton filed this lawsuit pro se against goord,david,and the state of new york.her complaint sought an injunction requiring the defendants to provide reasonable accommodation for her to participate in the docs visiting program and in damages.compl.at.
the district court dismissed fulton complaint.fulton goord,wl,at.the district court held that fulton lacked standing,because she had no protected liberty interest in visiting her inmate husband and therefore her inability to take advantage of a docs visitation program does not constitute a redressable injury.id.at.the district court concluded that,in any event,fulton had failed to state a claim.id.at.
this appeal followed.because her husband has been released from prison,fulton,now represented by counsel,seeks only monetary relief.she argues that she both has standing to proceed and has properly stated a claim.we agree that fulton has standing,and we remand for the district court to reconsider whether she has stated a claim.we also grant fulton leave to amend her complaint,to which the defendants consent.

fulton standing 
we review questions of standing de novo.comer cisneros,cir.because standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings,we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,rooted in article iii requirement,consists of three elements an injury in fact,by which is meant an invasion of a legally protected interest a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.the legally protected interest may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.warth seldin,d internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,standing is gauged by the specific,statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,d.
fulton sued under the ada and the rehabilitation act the ada states,in relevant part,that 
no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
similarly,the rehabilitation act states 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 
a.the ada provides remedies,procedures,and rights to any person alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of section,and the rehabilitation act does the same for any person aggrieved by discrimination,a.because of the breadth of these provisions,we have held that ada and rehabilitation act actions are not subject to any of the prudential limitations on standing that apply in other contexts.see innovative health,city of white plains,cir concluding that standing under these statutes should be defined as broadly as constitutionally permitted,overruled on other grounds by zervos verizon,cir.the ada and rehabilitation act generously confer the right to be free from discrimination by public entities and federally funded programs and,in so doing,confer standing for persons claiming such discrimination to enforce that right.fulton asserts that she was discriminatorily denied a reasonable accommodation for her disability in violation of her rights under the two acts.this is plainly an injury in fact that is sufficient to form the basis for article iii standing.
in arguing otherwise,the defendants,like the district court,misconceive fulton claim.the defendants argue that fulton has no legally cognizable interest in having her incarcerated spouse transferred to a facility she can more readily visit.appellee br.at.whatever the merit of such an argument,fulton complaint is not so narrow the essence of fulton challenge is the defendants refusal,in light of her disability,to provide her with,or even to consider,a reasonable accommodation to participate in the visiting program.compl.the defendants decision to house her husband in altona is only one aspect of this larger issue and not necessarily dispositive,at least at this stage of the proceedings.fulton complaint rests on her right to be free from discrimination,and the defendants fail to explain why a violation of this right,as distinct from any rights if they exist to inmate visitation or transfer,does not create an injury in fact.
the defendants effectively concede that if fulton could show an injury in fact,she could demonstrate the other
