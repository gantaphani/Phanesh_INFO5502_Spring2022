this case does not come to us as a stranger.at the turn of the century,the massachusetts legislature passed a law that created fixed and floating buffer zones around abortion clinics.we rejected serial challenges to the constitutionality of that law.see mcguire reilly mcguire i,cir rejecting facial challenge mcguire reilly mcguire ii,cir rejecting challenge.the supreme court denied certiorari.
one might have thought that the matter would end there,but it did not.in,the legislature revisited the statute and amended it to create a fixed buffer zone around the entrances,exits,and driveways of abortion clinics.the revised statute drew renewed fire and,in,we upheld it against a facial challenge.see mccullen coakley mccullen i,cir,cert.denied.this decision left open the plaintiffs challenge,and they unsuccessfully pursued that initiative in the district court.see mccullen coakley mccullen ii,d granting judgment on the pleadings on certain issues mccullen coakley mccullen iii,d resolving remaining issues after trial.
the plaintiffs again appeal.they advance a salmagundi of arguments,old and new,some of which are couched in a creative recalibration of first amendment principles.
few subjects have proven more controversial in modern times than the issue of abortion.the nation is sharply divided about the morality of the practice and its place in a caring society.but the right of the state to take reasonable steps to ensure the safe passage of persons wishing to enter healthcare facilities can not seriously be questioned.the massachusetts statute at issue here is a,narrowly tailored regulation that protects the rights of prospective patients and clinic employees without offending the first amendment rights of others.we therefore affirm the judgment below.
background 
we briefly recount the historical background and travel of the case and then describe the particular circumstances concerning the three clinic locations that lie at the epicenter of the plaintiffs challenge.
travel of the case.
the centerpiece of this saga is.laws ch,the act.the provenance and pertinent provisions of the act are set out in some detail in mccullen i,at,and we assume the reader familiarity with that account.we rehearse here only what is necessary to place into perspective the issues on appeal.
the act states in pertinent part that n o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to a reproductive health care facility rhcf within a designated and clearly marked buffer zone.laws ch,b,c.the buffer zone spans 
a radius of feet of any portion of an entrance,exit or driveway of a n rhcf or within the area within a rectangle created by extending the outside boundaries of any entrance,exit or driveway of a n rhcf in straight lines to the point where such lines intersect the sideline of the street in front of such entrance,exit or driveway.
id.b.four categories of persons identical to those enumerated in the version of the law are exempted 
persons entering or leaving such facility 
employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment 
law enforcement,ambulance,firefighting,construction,utilities,public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of their employment and 
persons using the public sidewalk or street adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.
on january,the massachusetts attorney general sent a letter to a wide audience,including rhcf personnel and law enforcement agencies.the text of the letter is reproduced as an appendix to our opinion in mccullen i,at.its stated purpose is to summarize the provisions of the act and offer guidance to assist in applying the four exemptions.
on january,the plaintiffs brought this action against the massachusetts attorney general in the federal district court invoking,they alleged a plethora of constitutional claims.
the district court bifurcated the case,separating the plaintiffs facial challenge from their challenge.in due season,the court addressed the facial challenge and upheld the act.
on appeal,we affirmed,holding the act to be,and a valid regulation.mccullen i,at.at the same time,we rebuffed the plaintiffs overbreadth claim,citing hill colorado,in which the supreme court upheld a colorado statute regulating communicative activities within feet of healthcare facility entrances.see mccullen i,at.we likewise rejected the plaintiffs vagueness claim which focused on the attorney general letter,explaining that such an attempt at interpretive guidance can not alter the meaning of a law that is clear on its face.id.at.finally,we ruled that the act did not constitute an unlawful prior restraint on protected speech.id.at.
when the dust had settled,the district court took up the plaintiffs challenge.as a threshold matter,it invoked the law of the case doctrine and resisted the plaintiffs attempt to reargue the facial constitutionality of the act.mccullen ii,d at.next,it granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to seven counts.id.at.turning to whether the act,as applied,constituted a valid regulation,the court concluded that the only trialworthy issue concerned the adequacy of alternative channels of communication at the challenged facilities.id.at.following a bench trial,the court upheld the act as applied.mccullen iii,d at.
b.the three sites.
we rehearse the evidence anent the relevant clinic locations.as a prelude,we note that each of the plaintiffs engages in communicative activities outside one of these three rhcfs.
boston.the boston clinic is situated in a building at commonwealth avenue a main thoroughfare in the brighton section of boston.its front door faces commonwealth avenue its rear garage entrance faces gardner street.all clinic patients enter through the front door and must use the public sidewalk along commonwealth avenue.buffer zones,marked with yellow arcs and posted signs,are appurtenant to each entrance.
three of the plaintiffs mccullen,cadin,and zarrella regularly engage in sidewalk counseling at the boston clinic.mccullen parks her car on commonwealth avenue and festoons it with signage zarrella sometimes prays aloud and cadin from time to time holds aloft a large sign.
a fourth plaintiff,smith,has demonstrated outside the boston clinic for many years.he has displayed a crucifix,sung religious hymns,and prayed aloud.his prayers are meant to be heard by passersby in hopes of persuading them to opt against abortion.he sometimes brings a loudspeaker to amplify group prayers that occur outside the clinic on the second saturday of every month and on good friday.
the plaintiffs insist that they have achieved success in their counseling efforts they speak with prospective patients,elicit responses,and hand out literature.in some instances,they have persuaded women to decide against terminating pregnancies.mccullen estimates that,during the period between november and may,her sidewalk counseling convinced approximately eighty women to refrain from seeking abortions.
despite their accomplishments,the plaintiffs argue that the buffer zones prevent close personal contact with their intended audience and,thus,impede their ability to communicate effectively.by way of illustration,zarrella asserts that,although women always respond to her offers of enlightenment and assistance,she has not been able to convince any of them to opt out of an abortion since the buffer zones were put in place.
worcester.the worcester clinic is situated in a building at pleasant street.its main entrance is accessible from pleasant street and also from a private parking lot behind the building.the public sidewalk on pleasant street is nearly feet from the main door and staggered metal fences shield the front of the building and the private pedestrian walkway that runs between these points.neither the fencing nor the walkway is on public property.the entrance to the parking lot is on dewey street and all vehicular traffic must use that entrance.
there are buffer zones marked with painted white arcs and posted signs on both pleasant street and dewey street.more than percent of all patients arrive by car,park in the clinic lot,and walk directly to the main door without setting foot on any public way.
two of the plaintiffs bashour and clark engage in sidewalk counseling at the worcester clinic.they try to divert women to problem pregnancy,a pregnancy crisis center located across the street.bashour prays quietly outside the clinic,sometimes alone and sometimes with others.for her part,clark often displays a large sign.
here,too,the plaintiffs claim to have achieved some success in their counseling efforts.they speak with patients,distribute literature,and persuade women to refrain from seeking abortions.notwithstanding these successes,the plaintiffs aver that the physical renders their attempts to communicate ineffective by impeding their ability to view and approach individuals entering the front door,to make eye contact with patients,and to demonstrate a caring demeanor.as they recall it,virtually no patients who park in the clinic private lot respond to their overtures or make the effort to venture outside the clinic premises.the buffer zones preclude them from speaking at a normal conversational distance with,or placing literature near,the vast majority of patients entering the clinic.
springfield.the springfield clinic is situated in a medical complex at the corner of main street and wason avenue.the building contains at least eight separate medical offices.it is bordered on two sides by private parking lots a third side abuts another building and the fourth side neighbors an open expanse that contains railroad trackage.approximately ninety percent of individuals patronizing the complex arrive by car and park in one of the lots.
there are five driveways leading to and from the complex,two of which have been painted with white arcs and posted to establish buffer zones one on main street and one on wason avenue.the remaining three driveways have painted white arcs but no signs.they are not,therefore,buffer zones authorized by the act.see.laws ch,c requiring signage to demarcate buffer zones.consequently,they have no legal effect.
a plaintiff shea prays aloud and engages in sidewalk counseling outside the clinic.he habitually displays a large sign that reads they killing babies here.he laments that,from and after the creation of the buffer zones,he has not seen literature provided to anyone in a vehicle.he estimates that only five percent of those who arrive by car leave the clinic parking lots either to accept literature or to investigate the possibility of counseling.
ii.the law of the case 
we start our appraisal of the merits with the plaintiffs exhortation that we revisit mccullen i,in which we held that the act,on its face,is a constitutionally valid regulation.see mccullen i,at.the district court found that the law of the case doctrine barred relitigation of this issue.mccullen ii,d at.we agree.
the law of the case doctrine has two branches.the first,which embodies the mandate rule,prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.united states.matthews,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the second binds a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case to honor fully the original decision.id.internal quotation marks omitted.both branches of the doctrine apply here.
to be sure,the law of the case doctrine admits of certain exceptions.but the circumstances giving rise to those exceptions are narrowly circumscribed 
a party may avoid the application of the law of the case doctrine only by showing that,in the relevant time frame,controlling legal authority has changed dramatically or by showing that significant new evidence,not earlier obtainable in the exercise of due diligence,has come to light or by showing that the earlier decision is blatantly erroneous and,if uncorrected,will work a miscarriage of justice.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.although the plaintiffs allude in desultory fashion to the third exception they make no reference to the second exception and their only colorable claim concerns the first exception.
the plaintiffs base their claim on recent decisions of the supreme court standing for the wholly unremarkable proposition that and speech restrictions are disfavored.see,sorrell ims health.snyder phelps.citizens united fec.in their view,these neoteric decisions have so reconfigured the first amendment landscape as to justify a departure from the law of the case.this impressionistic argument,though ingenious,elevates hope over reason.the propositions for which the plaintiffs cite those cases are no more than conventional first amendment principles recited by the supreme court in the context of factual scenarios far different than the scenario at issue here.
the decision on which the plaintiffs rely most heavily citizens united is emblematic of this point.citizens united overruled austin michigan chamber of commerce,which had held that corporate entities,as opposed to other speakers,could be prohibited from engaging in political speech.citizens united.at.the plaintiffs contend that citizens united announced,for the first time,a blanket ban on all speaker distinctions,whatever the setting.this categorical ban,they say,should serve to invalidate the act as a restriction.
this is an imprecise reading of citizens united.the citizens united court held that government can not entirely prohibit corporate political speech.id.in support,it invoked the central principle laid out in first national bank of boston bellotti,to the effect that the first amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker corporate identity.citizens united.at.the act,of course,makes no such distinction.
the plaintiffs,however,are undaunted.they seize upon an isolated statement in citizens united prohibited,too,are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers,allowing speech by some but not others.see id.at.but they yank this statement from its context and they neglect to mention that the court cites bellotti a case that substantially predates mccullen i for this proposition.see id.at.the court reliance on bellotti is not a mere fortuity.after all,the citizens united court described its decision as a return to classic first amendment jurisprudence rather than a departure therefrom.see id.at.the court did not retreat from its abortion zone jurisprudence.see,hill,madsen women health.seen in this light,we can not read citizens united as undermining the first amendment foundation on which our rejection of the plaintiffs facial challenge rested.
so,too,snyder,in which the court held that the first amendment precludes tort liability against persons who had peacefully protested,on public property,at the funeral of a marine.snyder.at.once again,the court did no more than apply first amendment principles.and while it reiterated the special status of public streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum,it proceeded to confirm that even public fora are subject to reasonable regulations id.at internal quotation marks omitted.it is especially telling that,in making this point,the court referred specifically to the abortion clinic buffer zone that it had upheld in madsen.see id.
the plaintiffs reliance on sorrell is equally mislaid.the sorrell court invalidated a vermont law that restricted the sale,disclosure,and use of pharmacy records for marketing purposes.sorrell.at.the law,on its face,was and,and had been enacted with the avowed purpose of diminsh ing the effectiveness of marketing by manufacturers of drugs.id.at.
the case before us could not be more different.as we explained in mccullen i,at,the act is both and.moreover,the legislature enacted it to serve a valid,purpose public safety.see id.at.
in a effort to turn straw into gold,the plaintiffs dismiss these important differences and focus instead on the sorrell court statement that the inevitable effect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitutional.sorrell.at internal quotation marks omitted.but this hoary legal precept with which we agree is not novel.the inevitable effect language derives from the court decision in united states,which comfortably predates both our decision in mccullen i and the supreme court abortion zone jurisprudence.
more to the point,the sorrell precept is in no way inconsistent with our holding in mccullen i.the inevitable effect of the act is to limit the communicative activities of all demonstrators whether or to exactly the same extent.
the plaintiffs have also marshaled other recent supreme court cases in their ambitious effort to reinvent first amendment doctrine.see,united states stevens.it would serve no useful purpose to canvass these cases.for present purposes,it suffices that these decisions,by no stretch of even the most fertile imagination,sully either the reasoning or the doctrinal infrastructure of mccullen 
the short of it is that the first amendment principles underpinning our core holdings in mccullen i have not been materially altered,let alone abrogated,by any subsequent supreme court precedent.accordingly,the district court did not err in declining the plaintiffs invitation to set the law of the case doctrine to one side and revisit the plaintiffs facial challenge to the act.
iii.judgment on the pleadings 
the plaintiffs challenge the district court entry of judgment on the pleadings on several fronts.we review de novo an order granting or denying judgment on the pleadings.nurses ass adams reg,cir.to withstand a motion for judgment on the pleadings,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.grajales ports,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
viewpoint discrimination.
the plaintiffs principal challenge to the entry of judgment on the pleadings relates to their claim of viewpoint discrimination.they argue that planned parenthood employees and agents have abused the buffer zones and that this activity constitutes viewpoint discrimination under the first amendment.the district court rejected this argument on the pleadings,holding that the plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to support the claim.see mccullen ii,d at.
in their complaint,the plaintiffs aver that advocates surround,cluster,yell,make noise,mumble,talk loudly to clinic clients for the purpose of disrupting or drowning out speech and thwart plaintiffs efforts to distribute literature.they further aver that clinic employees agents stand idly on the public sidewalks and streets inside the buffer zone sometimes smoking,speaking with each other or on mobile phones,or drinking coffee even when clinic clients are not present.
because this issue was resolved at the pleading stage,we assume arguendo that the raw facts are as the plaintiffs have alleged.the question remains,however,whether the depicted conduct can fairly be characterized as viewpoint discrimination attributable to the state.the plaintiffs say that it can.the attorney general demurs.
we begin with the basics.the act,on its face,is.see mccullen i,at.although it contains a clinic employee exemption,that exemption does not purport to allow either advocacy by an exempt person or interference by an exempt person with the advocacy of others.
the plaintiffs strive mightily to overcome this obstacle.they call our attention to the decision in hoye city of oakland,cir.there,a municipal ordinance prohibited,within a foot zone around entrances to rhcfs,any knowing or willful approach within eight feet of an individual seeking entry to the clinic if one purpose in approaching that person is to engage in conversation,protest,counseling,or various other forms of speech.id.at.the ninth circuit concluded that the ordinance was constitutional on its face but unconstitutional as applied.id.at.it predicated this conclusion on a determination that the city did not evenly enforce the ordinance rather,the city actions manifested a firm policy of enforcing the ordinance only against efforts to persuade women approaching rhcfs not to receive abortions or other reproductive health services,and not against communications seeking to encourage entry into the clinic for the purpose of undergoing treatment.id.at emphasis in original.
this case is at a considerable remove from hoye.the hoye court finding of uneven enforcement was inevitable in light of the city frank admission that it consciously enforces the ordinance in a manner.id.at.in contrast,the plaintiffs here have not pleaded any facts that might suffice to ground a claim of uneven enforcement 
the conduct described,without more,has nothing to do with the first amendment.while loitering in a buffer zone by an exempt person is not expressive in nature and arguably does not serve the purposes of the act,such conduct,simpliciter,does not prefer one viewpoint over another 
what is more,the employees and agents about whom the plaintiffs complain are not state actors but unlike the municipal police officers in hoye are agents of a private entity planned parenthood.the act allows these individuals to be in buffer zones under the clinic employee exemption.but to the extent that they have tried to use their exempt status either to advocate a particular point of view or to drown out the plaintiffs message,there is no allegation that such behavior has been sanctioned by the state.
another point is worth making.if the plaintiffs believed themselves to be aggrieved by the behavior that they describe,the commonsense remedy would have been to complain to police officers or other state authorities.the pleadings are barren of any allegation that such a complaint was ever made.
the bottom line is that,to be cognizable,a claim of uneven enforcement requires state action.see mcguire ii,at the first amendment is concerned with government interference,not private jousting in the speech marketplace.whatever actions the clinic employees and agents may have taken,this record reveals no basis for a plausible claim that those actions reflect a viewpoint preference of the state.see id.at.
overbreadth.
the plaintiffs assign error to the district court entry of judgment on the pleadings with respect to their overbreadth claim.although they concede that we rejected a substantially similar overbreadth claim in mccullen i,at,they suggest that the act may be overbroad in particular applications.
overbreadth doctrine invalidates statutes not because the plaintiffs own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.hill,at internal quotation marks omitted.but overbreadth must be both real and substantial,as assessed in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.where an overbreadth attack is successful,the statute is obviously invalid in all its applications,since every person to whom it is applied can defend on the basis of the same overbreadth.bd.of trs.of state of fox,emphasis in original.thus,the appropriate analysis requires consideration of many more applications than those immediately before the court.id.at.
in the case at hand,the parties spar over whether there is such a creature as an overbreadth challenge.compare,farrell burke,cir asserting that a ll overbreadth challenges are facial challenges,with,turchick united states,cir suggesting the contrary.we need not grapple with this conundrum because,even if some overbreadth challenges may contain an component,this one does not.
in explaining the district court supposed error,the plaintiffs repeat their complaint,rejected on their facial challenge,that all communicative activities as opposed to,say,purely violent or aggressive activities are banned within buffer zones.in attempting to convert this previously rejected challenge into a viable challenge,they posit that mccullen i can not control because it did not specifically conclude whether the act is substantially overbroad at the boston,worcester,and springfield locations.withal,they offer no accompanying factual allegations,other than pointing to what they identify as five buffer zones at the springfield location.as we already have explained,see supra part i b,only two enforceable buffer zones exist around the sp
