plaintiff is a young woman now in her who years ago matriculated at medical school where,after completing two years of course work,she experienced difficulties in passing the licensing examination required by the defendant medical school and administered nationally by the defendant testing service.after twice failing the licensing examination,plaintiff asked for an accommodation of more time to take it on the grounds that she had a learning disability.that request was denied and plaintiff took the test and failed it for the third time,and later was dismissed from medical school,prompting the litigation now before us on appeal.
to decide an appeal where what is involved is right versus wrong is not difficult but where,as here,neither party has acted wrongfully,to make a just determination between the parties is difficult.a review of the record reveals plaintiff perseverance and dedication to her studies and also reveals defendant school of medicine truly extraordinary efforts to help plaintiff succeed.applying the relevant legal standards,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in defendants favor.
background 
plaintiff medical school history 
powell enrolled in uconn medical program in august.she was discontinued as a student in.at the time of her enrollment the school was unaware that plaintiff allegedly suffered from a disability.of the courses she took that made up the curriculum,powell was deficient in two of them.the courses are referred to as basic medical sciences i.after successfully completing remedial work with respect to one of the courses,plaintiff was promoted to the curriculum,referred to as basic medical sciences ii.in her second year,powell was deficient in four out of ten courses,resulting in the award of an unsatisfactory grade for.in addition,in june powell failed step i of the united states medical licensing examination.
developed and administered by the defendant national board,a private,corporation,the medical licensing examination is a comprehensive test.it is composed of three parts,or steps,and most medical schools in the united states require their students to pass step i before advancing to the medical school curriculum.further,in all united states jurisdictions,passage of all three steps of the medical licensing examination is mandated in order to satisfy state licensing requirements to become a doctor.step i,the part at issue in this case,is designed to assess a medical student ability to apply the concepts,knowledge and principles that make up the fundamentals of patient care.
the uconn student handbook states that at the end of each of the first two years students are required to take a comprehensive examination,and that taking step i fulfills the requirement.the handbook further provides that the school may place conditions for promotion on a student who receives an unsatisfactory in,including retaking and passing step uconn stated that two to five students per year are asked to obtain a passing score on step i as a condition for promotion to the medical school curriculum.
in june plaintiff was informed by the promotions committee that in order to convert her grade to satisfactory,and thus be eligible to begin the third year,she needed to pass step i and remediate three of her course deficiencies.for two june until june repeatedly attempted to fulfill these and other requirements for advancement to the clinical curriculum.the school actively assisted her in these efforts by providing free tutoring services,overlooking an honor code violation she committed,expressing its concern with her level of stress and allowing her the opportunity to remediate certain subjects multiple times.
in june uconn conditionally promoted plaintiff to the curriculum,again subject to her passing step i of the medical licensing exam.the school wanted evidence that plaintiff had mastered the and subject matter since it had taken four years for her successfully to complete the first two years of the school curriculum.uconn believed passage of step i would provide them with that proof.in october,after the school paid for plaintiff to take a preparatory course,she failed step i again.in response,the school developed a tutorial program for plaintiff to follow during the spring of in preparation for the june step i exam,and did not charge plaintiff tuition for this period.
powell failed the test again in june and the school initiated the process of dismissal.final decision regarding the student dismissal was deferred pending the outcome of her lawsuit against the national board regarding its failure to grant her accommodation request,a matter which will be discussed below.if the national board prevailed,plaintiff would be dismissed.if plaintiff prevailed,she would be given another chance to sit for step i and,if she passed,would be allowed to continue to the third year of the medical program.as it turned out plaintiff did not prevail,and was later discontinued as a student.
plaintiff application to the national board of medical examiners 
in february plaintiff was referred to a neuropsychologist,wallace deckel.deckel was employed by uconn department of psychiatry and the medical school paid for his examination of plaintiff.deckel report concluded that,based on a battery of tests,powell appeared to be suffering from dyslexia and attention deficit disorder add,but the doctor also was of the opinion that anxiety and depression could not be ruled out as the causes of her academic problems.he recommended powell be given extra time to take the step i examination.
plaintiff submitted a redacted version of deckel evaluation to the national board as part of her application for an accommodation of extended or double time to take the june exam.the national board rejected her request because it concluded powell documentation failed to establish that she was disabled and thus a covered individual under the ada.it further noted that her documentation did not include objective evidence of difficulties she experienced before entering medical school,as would be expected were the disability a significant functional impairment.the national board also faulted deckel,stating that when making his diagnosis he did not provide full clinical data to support his conclusions,and that the role of plaintiff anxiety and depression was not ruled out as the cause of her academic difficulties.
powell later submitted an unredacted version of deckel evaluation,accompanied by an additional letter from him,addressing the national board concerns and stating his diagnosis.these materials were received too late for the june exam.powell was told she could resubmit them for a later examination,although the national board informed plaintiff that the additional information and documents she had submitted did not appear to support a test accommodation.
having failed to obtain an accommodation and having been dismissed as a medical student in,plaintiff filed two complaints against the national board and uconn in.the first complaint claimed violations of a number of state and federal statutes and sought all possible relief,including injunctive relief allowing plaintiff to sit for the medical licensing examination with an accommodation,and to be allowed to continue the curriculum at the medical school.in the second,she claimed that uconn violated titles ii and iii of the ada and the rehabilitation act,and that the national board violated title iii of the ada and the rehabilitation act,but sought only damages,not injunctive relief.in november the two complaints were consolidated.defendants moved for summary judgment in april,on all of plaintiff claims.the district court granted defendants motion.
on this appeal plaintiff asks us to review the district court grant of summary judgment only with respect to her ada and rehabilitation act claims.
discussion 
i standard of review 
both parties moved for summary judgment in the district court.when that court denied plaintiff motion and granted defendants,it prompted this appeal.the standard applicable to a motion for summary judgment,resolution of which we review de novo,is a familiar one.summary judgment shall be granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.this form of relief is appropriate when,after discovery,the whom summary judgment is sought,has not shown that evidence of an essential element of her on which she has the burden of.see celotex catrett,d.this form of remedy is inappropriate when the issue to be resolved is both genuine and related to a disputed material fact.an alleged factual dispute regarding immaterial or minor facts between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment.see howard gleason,cir.moreover,the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of nonmovant position is insufficient to defeat the motion there must be evidence on which a jury could reasonably find for the nonmovant.anderson liberty lobby,d.
if the movant demonstrates an absence of a genuine issue of material fact,a limited burden of production shifts to the nonmovant,who must demonstrate more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,and come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.aslanidis united states lines,cir.if the nonmovant fails to meet this burden,summary judgment will be granted against it.gallo prudential residential,cir.
ii provisions of the acts 
ada provisions 
we turn now to the provisions of the acts which plaintiff claims were violated in her case.the ada,which serves to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities,states that a disabled individual is one who suffers from a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.a.title ii of that act proscribes discrimination against the disabled in access to public services.section states n o qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.id.a qualified individual with a disability is defined as a disabled person who,whether or not given an accommodation,meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.id.title ii applies to any state or local government or instrumentality of a state or local government.id.uconn concedes it is an instrumentality of the state of connecticut.
title iii of the ada proscribes discrimination against the disabled in public accommodations.no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns or operates a place of pubic accommodation.id.a.uconn concedes that,as an educational institution,it meets the definition of public accommodation and is therefore subject to title iii.see id.j.the defendant national board of medical examiners also concedes that its services constitute a public accommodation covered by title iii.
rehabilitation act provisions 
enacted before the ada,the focus of the rehabilitation act is narrower than the ada in that its provisions apply only to programs receiving federal financial assistance.a.section states that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any covered program or activity.id.
in short,the rehabilitation act and titles ii and iii of the ada prohibit discrimination against qualified disabled individuals by requiring that they receive reasonable accommodations that permit them to have access to and take a meaningful part in public services and public accommodations.see henrietta bloomberg,cir felix new york city transit,cir quoting b a the statute defines discriminate to include not making reasonable accommodations available to a qualified person with a disability unless the provider of the service can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on its operations.since the standards adopted by titles ii and iii of the ada are,in most cases,the same as those required under the rehabilitation act,see henrietta,at,we consider the merits of these claims together.
in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie violation under these acts,she must demonstrate that she is a qualified individual with a disability that the defendants are subject to one of the acts and that she was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants services,programs,or activities,or was otherwise discriminated against by defendants,by reason of her disabilit y.id.
iii analysis 
injunctive relief 
turning to plaintiff consolidated complaint,plaintiff alleges the national board of medical examiners violated the acts by turning down her request for an accommodation of extended time when taking step i of the medical licensing examination,and that uconn violated the same acts by making her continued advancement in the medical school contingent on her passage of the test.in her complaint,she sought compensatory damages,punitive damages,attorneys fees and costs.monetary relief,however,is not available to private individuals under title iii of the ada.a same remedies available under title iii of ada as under title ii of civil rights act of.a private individual may only obtain injunctive relief for violations of a right granted under title iii he can not recover damages.see newman piggie park,d only injunctive relief available as remedy for violation of title ii of civil rights act of.the district court granted summary judgment to the national board and uconn on the title iii claims based on the fact that plaintiff failed to request injunctive relief specifically against defendants.this ruling was error.
under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court can grant any relief to which a prevailing party is entitled,whether or not that relief was expressly sought in the complaint.see holt civic club city of tuscaloosa,d see also krumme westpoint stevens,cir.the sole exception to this rule is when a court grants relief not requested and of which the opposing party has no notice,thereby prejudicing that party.in such case,unasked for relief should not be granted.see albemarle paper moody,d.lightfoot union carbide,cir,which defendant national board relies on,is distinguishable from the case at hand and from the above cited cases.in that case there was a general prayer for relief in the complaint,and the court recognized that under rule c plaintiff might have been entitled to some form of equitable relief after establishing his claim.yet,damages were,reinstatement had been refused,and plaintiff was unable to articulate what activity ought to be enjoined we ruled that in those circumstances the general prayer for relief was,as a matter of
