appeal from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,approving the settlement of a class action arising from alleged violations of the their constitutional rights,but awarding less than the requested fee to their attorneys from the common fund established by the settlement.rather than base its attorneys fees calculation on a percentage of the fund,the district court elected to calculate fees using a variant of the lodestar method described by this court in arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood association county of albany,cir,superseded by cir.considering the factors set forth in goldberger integrated resources,cir,the district court concluded that counsel were adequately compensated by an award of fees that reflected their normal hourly rates.because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making these determinations,we affirm.
background 
on october,this court issued its decision in shain ellison,cir,in which it determined,relying on its previous decisions in wachtler county of herkimer,cir,walsh franco,cir,and weber dell,cir,that it was clearly established that a corrections officer may not perform a strip search of a detainee charged only with a misdemeanor absent an individualized,reasonable suspicion that the detainee possesses contraband or weapons.see shain,at.in the wake of this decision,a number of lawsuits challenging strip search policies were commenced throughout new york state.see,complaint,mcbean city of new york,july,complaint,kelsey schoharie county,new york,wl,complaint,pritchard county of erie,cv,wl july.
on june,appellants nichole marie mcdaniel and lessie lee davies filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated,asserting that the schenectady county sheriff department maintained a policy,implemented by senior officers including appellees harry buffardi,gordon pollard,and robert elwell,of all individuals who were incarcerated at the schenectady county jail and placed in jail clothing,regardless of the crime with which they were charged.the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.the parties vigorously litigated this action for a period of more than three years,with various attorneys for the plaintiff class spending more than hours working on the case.
throughout the course of the litigation,appellees maintained that the class members were merely required to change into jail uniforms in the presence of a corrections officer of the same sex and that the schenectady county jail had no formal policy of strip searching all detainees.ultimately,however,they agreed to the terms of a settlement,pursuant to which appellees agreed to substantial injunctive relief and the creation of a settlement fund totaling million.the settlement agreement,signed on july,indicated that appellants counsel would petition the court for an award of attorneys fees in the amount not to exceed of the total settlement fund,and also provided for the separate reimbursement of administrative expenses.
during the litigation of this case,counsel for appellants also acted as counsel for the plaintiffs in two other initiated prior to the filing of the complaint in this that other counties in new york maintained impermissible strip search policies.see complaint,kahler rensselaer county,wl,complaint,marriott county of montgomery.in kahler,the parties reached a settlement in march,about three months prior to the initiation of the instant suit,which the district court ultimately approved in substantial part.see motion to certify class and for preliminary approval of class action settlement,kahler rensselaer county,wl,order,kahler rensselaer county.counsel in kahler received attorneys fees of approximately out of a total settlement fund of million,about of the fund in marriott,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment in april,concluding that montgomery county jail policies included an unconstitutional strip search for which the county was liable although reaching no decision as to the scope of damages and that plaintiffs counsel,as counsel to a prevailing party in an action brought under,were entitled to a statutory award of interim attorneys fees.marriott county of montgomery,d.the parties thereafter reached a settlement,which received final approval in may,resulting in an attorneys fees award of out of a total settlement fund of million,or of the fund.see motion to approve consent judgment exhibit a,settlement agreement,marriott county of montgomery,order granting final approval of class action settlement and judgment,marriott county of montgomery,may.
on september,the district court in this case conducted a final fairness hearing regarding the proposed settlement agreement,during which it issued an oral decision regarding the acceptability of the agreement.in determining the proper fees to be awarded to counsel from the common fund,the court noted its duty to act as a guardian of the rights of absent class members and the resulting need to approach fee awards with an eye to moderation.oral decision at.further observing that the calculation of a reasonable fee was committed to its sound discretion,the court indicated that i n the past,both the lodestar and the percentage of fund methods have been available to district judges in calculating attorneys fees in common fund cases,and provided a brief explanation of each approach.id.at.as the court noted,under the lodestar method 
t he district court scrutinizes the fee petition to ascertain the number of hours reasonably billed to the class and then multiplies that figure by an appropriate hourly rate.o nce that initial computation has been made,the district court may,in its discretion,increase the lodestar by applying a multiplier based on other less objective factors such as the risk of litigation and the performance of the attorneys.
id.at.the court stated that the percentage method,by contrast,involves setting some percentage of the recovery as the fee,and recognized that,whether using the percentage method or lodestar method of calculating attorneys fees,a court is guided by the factors articulated by this circuit in goldberger in determining a reasonable common fund fee.id.at see goldberger at.earlier in the fairness hearing,the court had noted that the requested amount of of the total settlement fund,or,was equivalent to a lodestar multiplier of to.
the district court then embarked upon a discussion of this court decision in arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood association county of albany,cir,superseded by cir,quoting our observation that the meaning of the term lodestar has shifted over time and its value as a metaphor has deteriorated to the point of unhelpfulness.oral decision at quoting arbor hill,at.in place of the traditional lodestar method,the district court characterized arbor hill as holding that 
the better course and the one most consistent with attorneys fees jurisprudence is for the district court,in exercising its considerable discretion,to bear in mind all of the case specific variables that this court and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of attorneys fees in setting a reasonable hourly rate.accordingly,the reasonable hourly rate is the rate a paying client would be willing to pay.
id.at.the court indicated that the factors relevant to any such determination were those described in johnson georgia highway express,cir,abrogated on other grounds by blanchard bergeron,d,as well as the underlying intuitions that a reasonable paying client wishes to spend the minimum necessary to litigate the case effectively and that a paying client negotiating position may be strengthened by the attorneys desire to obtain the reputational benefits that might accrue from being associated with the case.oral decision at.finally,citing this court decision in porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america llc,cir,the district court characterized arbor hill as requiring a court to determin e the reasonable hourly rate for each attorney and the reasonable number of hours expended and multiply the two figures together to obtain the presumptively reasonable award.oral decision at.
drawing upon the factors outlined,the district court then determined that application of the percentage method would be inappropriate,choosing instead to determine what amount was reasonable using the factors articulated in goldberger and the most recent arbor hill decision.id.at.regarding the first goldberger factor,the time and labor expended by counsel in the course of prosecuting the case,the district court recognized that class counsel put substantial time and effort into this case,but also concluded that this time and effort was sufficiently compensated by awarding fees determined by the attorneys ordinary hourly rates.id.at.moreover,the court indicated that a multiplier was inappropriate in light of the fact that counsel had previously worked on two similar cases in the same judicial district,in which some of the ground work for this litigation was already established.id.at.as to the second factor,the complexity of the case,the district court determined that the case at bar was not particularly complex as it was an ordinary civil rights case in which liability appear ed reasonably certain.id.with regard to the third factor,the risks involved in the particular litigation,it found that liability was reasonably certain and that although there was risk on the issue of damages,that risk was of little importance to counsel,who would have been statutorily entitled to attorneys fees as the prevailing party in a action,even if only nominal damages were awarded.id.at.the court further noted that,as to the fourth factor,the quality of representation,counsel did a fine job,but were adequately compensated by the ordinary hourly rate counsel charged.id.at.as to the fifth factor,the portion of the overall settlement allocated to attorneys fees,the percentage arising from its use of the arbor hill method roughly was squarely within the range of reasonable percentages in such a case as the instant one.id.with regard to the last goldberger factor,public policy,the district court took note of the compelling public policy reasons for keeping an eye on attorneys fees in class action cases.id.at.finally,the court briefly noted that arbor hill also required a district court to consider whether the burden of litigating the case had precluded an attorney from accepting other gainful employment.
after this discussion,the district court repeated its decision not to employ the percentage method or apply any type of multiplier to the fee calculated by multiplying the attorneys hourly rates by the number of hours worked.at the same time,the court observed that it was awarding attorneys fees based upon the rates ordinarily billed by class counsel,even to the extent that those rates were substantially higher than the prevailing rate in the northern district of new york.this method yielded attorneys fees in the amount of.the district court also allowed the reimbursement of in litigation expenses and in administrative expenses.the total award thus amounted to.
after counsel for appellants objected to the reduction of their fees,the district court clarified its reliance upon arbor hill in the following fashion 
what i saying about arbor hill is this,i simply dispensing with the classic definition of the lodestar method.if that were to be applied as the way it was consistently applied,it would be irrelevant where an attorney was from,it would be what the prevailing rate is for attorneys in this area.that the aspect of arbor hill that i dispensing with when i say that no longer the standard of what constitutes a reasonable attorney fee.that is as substantial an explanation why some of the fees as calculated in the fee schedule submitted by class counsel,they would have exceeded that traditional rate in the northern district of new york.i not discounted them as a result of that.that the impetus of the arbor hill decision.
oral decision at.
on november,the district court issued a final decision and order approving the settlement and explicitly incorporating the content of its oral decision,including the award of attorneys fees.the court slightly increased the total amount to be paid to counsel,granting attorneys fees in the amount of,reimbursement of litigation expenses in the amount of,and administrative expenses in the amount of,resulting in a final award of.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion,goldberger integrated,cir,which occurs when the court decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.kickham hanley kodak ret.income plan,cir quoting vincenty bloomberg,cir.a buse of discretion already one of the most deferential standards of on special significance when reviewing fee decisions because the district court,which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case,is in a far better position to make such decisions than is an appellate court,which must work from a cold record.goldberger,at quoting in re bolar pharm.sec,cir per curiam.
in challenging the district court attorneys fee determinations,appellants make several arguments.first,they contend that the district court committed legal error by failing to calculate attorneys fees using the percentage method,suggesting t he percentage method is the presumptive,preferred method in this circuit.appellants br.at.second,appellants suggest that the district court improperly relied on arbor hill to justify its decision not to use the percentage method,since that case and others cited by the court involved statutory fee shifting rather than a common fund.third,they assert that,whether or not the district court was within its discretion in employing a method to calculate attorneys fees,it committed errors in its application of the goldberger factors,including the use of an unprecedented factor to penalize counsel for their experience in litigating similar cases.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
i.the district court decision not to employ a method 
appellants contend that the district court failed to consider basing its calculation of attorneys fees on a percentage of the fund secured by counsel,that it flouted a clear trend in the law towards using the percentage method,appellants br.at,and even that it defied an instruction by the supreme court in blum stenson requiring the use of the percentage method in common fund cases,see,d observing that u nlike the calculation of attorney fees under the common fund doctrine,where a reasonable fee is based on a percentage of the fund bestowed on the class,a reasonable fee under reflects the amount of attorney time reasonably expended in the litigation.
appellants assertion that the district court refused to consider using the percentage method at all,appellants br.at,is factually incorrect.the court described both the lodestar method and the percentage method of calculating attorneys fees in its bench decision before indicating that it would apply a variant of the former in its written decision and order approving the settlement,the court reiterated its decision to use neither a lodestar multiplier nor the percentage method in calculating the fee award.thus,the assertion that the district court erroneously refused even to consider using the percentage approach is squarely contradicted by the record t he court clearly understood that it could have awarded a percentage fee in this case.it simply chose not to do so.goldberger,at.
although we have acknowledged that the trend in this circuit is toward the percentage method,it remains the law in this circuit that courts may award attorneys fees in common fund cases under either the lodestar method or the percentage of the fund method.stores,visa,cir see also cent.states se,cir in common fund cases,courts typically use either the lodestar method or the percentage method to compute attorneys fees.masters wilhelmina model agency,cir of course,courts may continue to use the lodestar approach alone in calculating attorneys fees in common fund cases.and this court has never treated the supreme court dicta in blum as demanding a single method for calculating attorneys fees in common fund cases or otherwise foreclosing the use of a lodestar approach.see goldberger,at observing that blum indicates that the method is a viable alternative quoting savoie merchants bank,cir,and noting that six other circuits,have given district courts the option of choosing either the percentage or the lodestar method.
appellants nonetheless urge this court to adopt the percentage method as the presumptive approach to fee awards or to abandon the lodestar approach altogether,noting that several other circuits have done so.this court has considered the advantages and disadvantages of the lodestar and percentage methods previously,see goldberger,at,and we need only address them briefly here 
the lodestar method is not perfect.it creates an incentive for attorneys to bill as many hours as possible,to do unnecessary work,and for these reasons also can create a disincentive to early settlement.see id.at citing savoie,at.under certain conditions,moreover,lodestar awards can create the near opposite incentive,encouraging attorneys to settle before trial even when it is not in their clients best interest.while under the lodestar method lawyers share the downside risk of trial,the possibility of an adverse judgment,and hence no fee,they do not share in the potential economic upside,fees as a percentage of a large common fund,especially since trial requires comparatively fewer hours than the process of trial preparation.see janet cooper alexander,do the merits matter a study of settlements in securities class actions,stan,john coffee,understanding the plaintiff attorney the implications of economic theory for private enforcement of law through class and derivative actions,colum,hereinafter coffee,understanding the plaintiff attorney.although the district court is charged with ensuring the fairness of a proposed settlement,including any attorneys fee award,this task is often challenging in common fund cases,especially the attorneys fees are drawn from a common fund rather than being paid separately by the is little incentive for the defendants to contest the size of the fee.to the contrary,plaintiffs and defendants lawyers share an interest in the approval of an agreed upon settlement.goldberger,at.as a result,the district judge los es the benefit of an adversarial process,which may inform and sharpen the judicial inquiry.doe,cir see also baker carr,d goldberger,at it is not without significance that when lead counsel for plaintiffs on appeal stood up at oral argument to petition for a bigger slice of his clients recovery,no one sat adjacent to him at opposing counsel table.
but the percentage method has its limitations as well.as we indicated in goldberger,this circuit adoption of the lodestar method was precipitated by the perception that percentage fees tended to yield too little for the,and an unjustified golden harvest of fees for the lawyer.at quoting city of detroit grinnell,cir grinnell i,abrogated on other grounds by goldberger,at.particularly in cases that result in a very large monetary award,the percentage method holds the potential to result in attorneys fees many times greater than those that would have been earned under the lodestar of hourly rate multiplied by hours worked.the principal analytical flaw in appellants argument for a presumptive percentage award as a benchmark in common fund cases lies in the assumption that there is substantial contingency risk in every common fund case that would justify such a multiplier.id.at.
moreover,although the percentage method has the advantage of aligning the interests of plaintiffs and their attorneys more fully by allowing the latter to share in both the upside and downside risk of litigation,it can create perverse incentives of its own,potentially encouraging counsel to settle a case prematurely once their opportunity costs begin to rise.see coffee,understanding the plaintiff attorney at.and as in the case of the lodestar method,neither defense counsel nor the actual plaintiffs have much of an incentive under the approach to oppose an award of attorneys fees,the latter since t hey have no real incentive to mount a challenge that would result in only a minuscule pro rata gain from a fee reduction.goldberger,at citing in re cont l.sec,cir.
in short,neither the lodestar nor the approach to awarding attorneys fees in common fund cases is without problems.it is for reasons such as those just discussed that in goldberger we declined to junk the lodestar method in favor of the presumptive or exclusive use of the percentage method,see id.at,and instead left the decision as to the appropriate method to the district court,which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case.id.at.while appellants assert that there would be a benefit in allowing district judges to step away from the business of analyzing and reviewing attorneys fee applications,appellants reply br.at,we underscore the importance of the district court duty to act as a fiduciary who must serve as a guardian of the rights of absent class members,city of detroit grinnell,cir grinnell ii internal quotation marks omitted abrogated on other grounds,goldberger,at,and reaffirm the requirement of a searching assessment regarding attorneys fees that should properly be performed in each case.goldberger,at.even were we not bound by circuit precedent on the matter,we would decline to hold otherwise.
ii.the district court reliance on arbor hill 
appellants also contend that the district court impermissibly relied on this court decision in arbor hill concerned citizens neighborhood association county of albany,cir,since that case addressed the use of the lodestar method in the context of statutorily awarded attorneys fees,rather than a common fund they suggest,inter alia,that reliance on arbor hill may have improperly influenced the district court decision to select a modified lodestar approach rather than a approach,though the court bench decision does not,in fact,make it at all evident that the case influenced the court selection.
at the start,we note that it is unclear how any error in the district court decision to use arbor hill modified lodestar approach,even assuming such error occurred,could compel a finding that the court should have used the percentage method instead.given that a district court has the discretion to choose either the lodestar or approach in calculating attorneys fees,see supra section i,any error in a court application of the lodestar method would not necessitate selection of the percentage method on remand.
to the extent that appellants argument depends on the inference that,had the district court not referenced arbor hill,appellants suggested fee would have seemed more reasonable,an analysis of arbor hill and the district court reliance on that decision shows that appellants concern is unfounded.in arbor hill,this court proposed the use of a modified version of the lodestar approach and recommended abandonment of the term lodestar for the alternative term presumptively reasonable fee.at.in brief,the court suggested that a district court efforts to approximate the reasonable fee that a competitive market would implicit goal of the lodestar be better served by considering reasonableness factors earlier in the calculation.instead of first determining the lodestar multiplying an hourly rate by the number of hours worked and then adjusting the lodestar through a multiplicative factor to account for considerations,the arbor hill court suggested that a district court should assess considerations at the outset,factoring them into its determination of a reasonable hourly rate for the attorneys work.see id.at.this reasonable hourly rate could then be multiplied by the number of hours worked to generate a presumptively reasonable fee.id.at.as arbor hill was a statutory fee shifting case,the court pointed towards the twelve factors outlined in johnson,at,as being among those relevant to a district court determination of a reasonable market rate under this revised approach.see arbor hill,at.
arbor hill also indicated that the district court in that case had been unduly restrictive in its interpretation of the forum rule,though it ultimately upheld the district court decision to deny the request of plaintiffs counsel to calculate their hourly fees based on their home district,rather than the less expansive prevailing rates in the district where the litigation occurred.see id.at.in clarifying the forum rule,the court held that 
a district court may use an hourly some rate in between the rate sought and the rates charged by local calculating the presumptively reasonable fee if it is clear that a reasonable,paying client would have paid those higher rates.we presume,however,that a reasonable,paying client would in most cases hire counsel whose rates are consistent with those charged locally.this presumption may be only in the unusual the party wishing the district court to use a higher rate demonstrates that his or her retention of an attorney was reasonable under the circumstances as they would be reckoned by a client paying the attorney bill.
id.at.the court further indicated that the reasonableness of a prevailing party decision to retain counsel is best considered in setting the hourly than deciding whether to adjust a presumptively reasonable fee,since,inter alia,this approach comported with the focus on market rates underpinning arbor hill presumptively reasonable fee approach.id.at.
in the instant case,the district court observed early in its bench decision that the plaintiffs suggested fee award of represented,in its estimation,a multiplier of beyond what counsel would have earned based on their hourly rates.appellants suggest that to the extent the district court impression of the multiplier as being too large may have been responsible for its disinclination to base attorneys fees on a percentage of the fund,the court reliance upon arbor hill worked to their detriment.in clarifying its understanding of that case,however,the court indicated that if the traditional lodestar method were to be applied it would be irrelevant where an attorney was from,and the appropriate rate would be what the prevailing rate is for attorneys in this area.oral decision at.the court then stated that some of the fees as calculated in the fee schedule submitted by class counsel would have exceeded the traditional rate in the northern district of new york.i not discounted them as a result of that.id.at.in other words,had the district court not referenced arbor hill,and instead relied on its understanding of the forum rule as traditionally applied,appellants suggested fee would have represented an even higher multiplier of the lodestar.if appellants are correct that the court assessment of the multiplier contributed to its decision not to use a approach,the court reliance on arbor hill can not have hurt them 
in any event,we find no error in the district court reliance on arbor hill in this case.at bottom,appellants arguments regarding arbor hill are founded upon the assumption that the lodestar method applied in the common fund context is distinct from that employed in the statutory context.while it is true some district courts in this circuit have expressed uncertainty as to the relevance of arbor hill in common fund cases,see in re ramp.sec,civ,wl,at,in re aol time warner erisa,cv,wl,at,this court case law does not suggest that there are two different lodestar methods,see,in re agent orange product,cir w e have adopted a lodestar formula for calculating fees in equitable fund and statutory fee contexts.to the contrary,in discussing the lodestar method,our common fund and statutory fee shifting cases have employed the same definition and referenced the same foundational cases see,arbor hill,at citing lindy.builders,am.radiator standard sanitary,cir as foundational case for lodestar approach in statutory fee case goldberger,at citing lindy in common fund case grinnell i,at citing lindy in justifying adoption of lodestar approach in common fund case.it is therefore not surprising that several district courts within this circuit have referred to arbor hill presumptively reasonable fee approach in common fund cases.see silberblatt morgan stanley,d,referencing arbor hill in use of lodestar as on reasonableness of percentage award in re assicurazioni generali holocaust ins,civ,civ,civ,wl,at,relying upon arbor hill to explain application of lodestar method aol time warner,wl,at concurring with conclusions of arbor of percentage award.from a mathematical perspective,of course,it makes little difference whether a court,following arbor hill,considers factors to estimate a reasonable rate for an attorney services,which is then multiplied by the number of hours worked,or whether the court takes the traditional approach and considers these same factors in calculating a multiplier to the lodestar.the benefit of arbor hill methodology is that by considering factors at the outset,the district court focus on mimicking a market is maintained.see arbor hill,at.
to the extent that the specific factors considered by courts in the common fund and statutory contexts are somewhat different,compare,at,with johnson,at,we note that the district court reliance on arbor hill in this case was limited.while the court referenced johnson in its initial discussion of arbor hill,it later clarified that it was relying on the latter for its presumptive reasonable fee approach and its more flexible application of the forum rule.and in considering factors,the district court clearly followed goldberger,addressing each of the six factors outlined in that case.the one johnson factor separately considered by the court,the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case,oral decision at,weighed in favor of a higher fee award,and its consideration did not prejudice the appellants.we are therefore unconvinced the court modified the goldberger factors in any meaningful way by referencing arbor hill,and accordingly,we find no error in the district court reliance on that case.
iii.the district court application of the goldberger factors 
appellants final arguments concern the district court application of the factors elucidated in goldberger for determining the reasonableness of a common fund fee.appellants contend that,in addition to committing errors in relation to each of these factors,the district court invented an additional factor,holding the attorneys experience in litigating strip search cases against them,when in fact their experience should have weighed in favor of a higher fee.
the goldberger factors are applicable to the court reasonableness determination whether a or lodestar approach is used,see,at irrespective of which method is used,the goldberger factors ultimately determine the reasonableness of a common fund fee,and in the latter context,indicate whether a multiplier should be applied to the lodestar.under the arbor hill approach,they would be factored into the appropriate hourly rate before calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.the goldberger factors include counsel time and labor the litigation magnitude and complexity the risk of the litigation the quality of representation the requested fee in relation to the settlement and public policy considerations.at.importantly,we defer to the district court determinations regarding these factors.see id.at,at the district court applied the goldberger test and made specific and detailed findings from the record,as well as from its own familiarity with the case accordingly,we find no reason to disturb the district court determination.
we address first appellants contention that the district court improperly counted the attorneys experience in litigating strip search cases against them when that factor should have counted,if at all,in favor of the higher proposed fee award.although attorney experience is not explicitly enumerated among the goldberger factors,it is clear that experience might be relevant to several of them,including consideratio
