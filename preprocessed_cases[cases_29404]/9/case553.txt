appellee durwood currier had worked for appellant pratt whitney pratt,a division of united technologies corporation utc,for years before he was terminated in a rif in.he was years old and had advanced to positions of increasing responsibility during his tenure with the company,receiving commendations for the quality of his work and regular merit pay increases.following his discharge,currier filed suit under state and federal law alleging age discrimination a jury found in his favor,awarding him in back pay and in compensatory damages.although the district court viewed the case as very close,it denied pratt motions for directed verdict,new trial or remittitur.pratt now appeals,claiming,inter alia,that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that the district court committed prejudicial error by allowing flawed statistical evidence to reach the jury.after careful review,we join the district court in concluding that,though the case was close,the verdict was supportable.
factual background 
the relevant facts,as the jury could have found them,are as follows.
from to,currier worked as a business unit manager at pratt facility in north berwick,maine,a position in which he supervised employees and developed the strategy for achieving the unit goals in such areas as cost,safety and quality.in,he received a glowing letter of recommendation that praised his leadership,his maturity and business acumen,and his potential.that same year,he took over a troubled business unit,guided it to an improved performance,and was rewarded with a trip to japan to tour similar facilities.
in,thomas mayes became the new operations manager at the north berwick facility,and in that position he supervised currier and the other business unit managers.mayes,who was twenty years younger than currier,conducted an evaluation of the business unit managers in and rated currier more unfavorably than his performance seemed to warrant.for example,currier unit in achieved an approximately percent reduction in defects,but he was given the same rating on a scale of to for quality as two other,younger unit managers who experienced percent and percent increases in defects in the cost category of the review,currier was graded down because his unit cost per standard hour was high the evidence permitted the jury to conclude,however,that the higher cost was attributable to currier success in meeting the company objective of reducing inventory by decreasing production lead time currier perspective was that he was charged with the cost of the surplus labor resulting from that success,even though he assigned the extra workers to help other business units.
in early,currier was moved to a newly created manager position,in which he was responsible for generating new business.mayes testimony suggested that,rather than a promotion,the transfer was a response to personnel issues and the increased costs in currier unit.currier was given no job description and no goals,and his request for supervisory authority was denied.in early,mayes became general manager of the north berwick facility,and stephen pickett took over as operations manager.a few months later,utc told mayes that the salaried workforce in north berwick needed to be reduced by about five percent.mayes,pickett and the head of human resources,thomas murphy,identified the job categories to be affected by the rif,and they included the new business position held by currier as one of the jobs to be eliminated.rather than simply terminating currier,however,management decided to evaluate him along with the six business unit managers.
under pratt standard layoff guidelines,managers in the job categories to be affected assess each employee in a targeted position using a numerical scoring matrix that considers five criteria achieves results,criticality of skills,qualifications,business orientation,and interpersonal skills.the human resources department then reviews the scoring to ensure compliance with the company guidelines and employment laws.the employee with the lowest score in a particular position is laid off.
in his evaluation of the business unit managers,mayes gave currier the lowest score,a out of a possible points.the others,all of whom were younger than currier,received scores of,and.currier criticizes the matrix as a vague and entirely subjective list of criteria and asserts that his score defie d the objective reality of his superb performance over more than years.he points out that mayes,who had been in south berwick for only two years,did not consult with currier past supervisors or review his past performance evaluations.
to carry out the matrix evaluation,mayes utilized a form in which he circled a number from one to ten next to each of the five designated criteria.the evaluation process did not include a written explanation for currier low scores,but mayes at trial gave three reasons for currier unfavorable outcome his unit financial performance target was off by more than any other unit based on cost per standard hour his unit had significant labor relations problems in stemming from an increased expectation that employees work overtime and he did not perform well in the business development position.the jury also heard,however,that currier received a merit pay increase in december,nine months after starting the new job and six months before he was terminated.
currier contended that mayes was infected by age discrimination,and he relied on his record of proven success at pratt to demonstrate that his supposed poor reflected in his low matrix a pretext to mask the real motive.to substantiate his claim that the motive was unlawful age bias,currier presented the testimony of an expert statistician,sat gupta,who concluded that the rif disproportionately affected older employees.gupta reported that the average age of the five employees who were laid off was,while the average age of those retained was.at one point,he testified that the risk of layoff increased by about thousand percent with increased age.
the jurors were persuaded that discrimination occurred and rendered a verdict in currier favor.on appeal,pratt contends that they were improperly and unfairly led astray by gupta flawed statistics.in particular,pratt asserts that gupta incorrectly based his analysis on the total number of salaried employees at the berwick facility,rather than on the employees in the job categories that mayes,pickett and murphy had designated as subject to the.the company also complains that gupta analysis failed to consider whether any factors other than age and as the company need for particular skill sets,salaries or for the differing treatment among employees.pratt maintains that,because gupta statistics were not drawn from the experience of similarly situated employees,his conclusions lacked any probative value and were thus both irrelevant and highly prejudicial.pratt further asserts that,at a minimum,the court erred in refusing its request to instruct the jury on the limitations of statistical evidence.
pratt also argues on appeal that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because currier failed to meet his burden of proving age discrimination.finally,the company challenges the jury assessment of damages.we explain below why we find no reversible error on any of these issues.
ii.discussion 
we begin with pratt challenge to the statistical evidence,which it claims warrants a new trial,and then turn to its contention that the evidence presented at trial simply did not add up to a case of age discrimination.the damages issues are addressed briefly in the succeeding section.
admissibility of the statistical evidence 
pratt made repeated efforts to exclude gupta testimony from the jury consideration,filing multiple motions asserting that his statistical analysis was unreliable,methodologically unsound,incomplete,and irrelevant.the company continued to voice its objections at trial and ultimately was awarded a standing objection on the issue.its primary complaint on appeal is that gupta calculations were based on the wrong set of employees rather than the entire salaried workforce of employees,pratt maintains that gupta data should have been limited either to the six similarly situated business unit managers plus currier,or,at most,to the employees who were actually susceptible to layoff.gupta acknowledged that,if not all salaried employees were subject to layoff,his analysis would be distorted.
assessing the admissibility of complex expert testimony before trial,when the court does not yet know the exact nature of the evidence to be presented,or even during trial,as the case develops witness by witness,is a challenge for any judge.a judge reasonably could resolve many admissibility questions either way,and rampant by appeals courts would paralyze the judicial process.it is thus appropriate that a trial court judgment,when made pursuant to the proper legal standard,be given broad deference.accordingly,appellate courts will reverse a trial court decision to admit or exclude expert opinion only for an abuse of discretion.kumho tire carmichael,d joiner,d hochen bobst group,cir.
under well established supreme court case law,the trial judge serves as a gatekeeper for expert evidence,with the responsibility of ensuring that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand,daubert merrell dow,d see also hochen,at.statistical analyses have been held admissible in disparate treatment discrimination cases unless they are so incomplete as to be inadmissible as irrelevant,mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir quoting bazemore friday,d.
pratt argues that the court failed to perform its gatekeeping duties in this case by ignoring the lack of foundation for gupta statistics.it complains that the court presumed incorrectly that the list of employees that pratt had supplied to currier exhibit in compliance with the older workers benefit protection act,f defined the group subject to termination.and,as a result of that presumption,pratt maintains that the court allowed into evidence irrelevant and prejudicial statistics.
pratt initial difficulty in demonstrating an abuse of discretion is that the district court faced a moving target,both in the nature of the company objections and in the state of the evidence.not until its motion for judgment as a matter of law did pratt explicitly make the argument it now offers about gupta analysis,that his conclusions are invalid because his calculations used the full universe of salaried employees rather than the who were subject to layoff.in its motions,pratt emphasized that the data on which gupta list of flawed because it did not account for variables other than age and was not confined to similarly situated employees,in that there was no breakdown in terms of job,skills,or length of time served.
pratt made similar arguments when it moved for directed verdict both at the close of plaintiff case and at the close of all evidence.in its first motion,pratt also pointed to gupta admission that his statistical thus his be wrong if any of the other layoffs that were part of the rif were attributable to age neutral factors.pratt did not assert at that time,however,that the rif process began with a restricted pool of eligible employees and that gupta analysis was entirely without foundation on that basis 
we suspect that the argument did not surface earlier because the original size of the pool of employees appeared to remain an open question through the end of the trial.although the district court observed that the evidence unequivocally established that ultimately only out of the salaried employees were at risk for the reduction in force,the key word is ultimately.the five job categories chosen to absorb the rif were picked by mayes,pickett and murphy,and the record contains no evidence that would foreclose the jury from reasoning that the original winnowing down of the to was not age neutral.as plant manager,mayes,the individual whom currier accuses of bias,was the person in charge of effectuating the rif,and the jury could have found that he played the leading role in selecting the targeted groups.in brief,while the particular layoff decisions focused on only employees,the jury reasonably could have viewed the layoff process to have begun with mayes scrutiny of the and,in any event,the factual development of the case belies any abuse of discretion in this respect in the court decision to admit the statistical evidence.
pratt related argument that gupta analysis was meaningless because it failed to take into account the wide differences in circumstances among the terminated employees was a point made clearly and repeatedly by pratt through of gupta and in the testimony of the company own expert witness.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to view this weakness in gupta analysis as a matter of weight rather than admissibility and thus properly a subject of argument and jury judgment.as the supreme court has observed,v igorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence,daubert,at.see also mcmillan,at i f the expert analysis omitted what defendants argue are important variables,or was deficient in other respects it was up to defendants to exploit and discredit the analysis during cross examination.
pratt took the opportunity to exploit and discredit gupta conclusions through other evidence as well.mayes,the sole individual accused of acting with discriminatory motive,completed matrix evaluations only for the business unit managers and thus had no direct involvement in the other layoff decisions as the district court noted,mayes limited role diminished the probative value of gupta collective analysis of the five terminations.similarly,pratt elicited evidence that one of the other employees laid off,who also was years old at the time,had a history of performance fact that again challenged the validity of gupta statistical conclusion of age bias.
the cases on which pratt relies to assert reversible error in the admission of the evidence are largely distinguishable.for example,in leblanc great american insurance,cir,the court holding was that the statistical evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a jury finding of discrimination currier does not argue that the statistics here prove age discrimination,but offers them to bolster his claim that other facts pointed to age bias.see infra at.in two other cases,the challenge was to the accuracy or context of the expert conclusions.in irvine murad skin research,cir,the court concluded that the expert lacked adequate factual data to support his conclusions,rendering his computations related to damages unreliable.in hillstrom best western tlc hotel,cir,statistics that showed a high rate of termination for older employees lacked probative value because there was no evidence on the universe of employees supervised by the manager at issue 
here,the information on which the statistical analysis was based was presented,and there is no claim that the statistics were an inaccurate representation of what the expert analyzed.accuracy,of course,is not the whole story.as we have noted,various factors blunted the significance of gupta conclusions and,indeed,we think his analysis skittered near the line of inadmissibility.the jury was not,however,uninformed.challenges to the probative value of gupta analysis were amply brought to the jury attention.in these circumstances,we find no abuse of discretion,and thus no reversible error,in the district court decision to admit gupta statistics and allow the jury to assess their significance 
judgment as a matter of law 
pratt argues that it should have been granted judgment as a matter of law because currier failed to present sufficient evidence to meet his burden of proving age discrimination.we review the district court denial of pratt motion under.de novo,zachar lee,cir,with our review weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir.we must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.walton nalco chem,cir citation omitted.
