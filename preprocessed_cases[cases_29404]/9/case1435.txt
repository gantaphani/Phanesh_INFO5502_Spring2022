opinion of the court 
mark robinson,an inmate in the custody of pennsylvania department of corrections doc at the state correctional institution at rockview sci rockview,appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of lieutenant charles fink on his excessive force claim.the district court held that robinson failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit as required by the prison litigation reform act plra.because we agree with robinson that his attempts to avail himself of sci rockview administrative processes and the prison noncompliance with its own deadline satisfied the plra,we will vacate and remand 
on october,lieutenant fink escorted robinson from the prison showers to his cell.upon removing his handcuffs,fink allegedly twisted robinson left arm real hard and said,since today is my last day,i wanted to leave you with a present.app.robinson felt pain in his arm and shoulder and submitted a sick call request the next day.robinson was prescribed medication but continued to experience pain in the months that followed.
at the time of robinson injury,the doc had two policies in place governing the reporting of abuse by inmates the inmate abuse allegation monitoring policy abuse policy and the inmate grievance system policy grievance policy.under the abuse policy,an inmate could raise a dispute in one of three ways 
report it verbally or in writing to any staff member 
file a grievance in accordance with the grievance policy or 
report it in writing to the department office of professional responsibility opr.
app.in other words,robinson could have brought his complaint to the attention of prison authorities either by reporting it to a staff member or the opr and remain under the strictures of the abuse policy,or by filing a grievance in accordance with the grievance policy.as we shall explain,robinson pursued both administrative channels.
at the time robinson filed his claims,the doc abuse policy provided that once an inmate reported abuse,all subsequent procedures were to be conducted at the initiative of the prison administration.the abuse policy also stated that when a complaint of abuse is received,a prison staff member shall complete form report of extraordinary occurrence part,employee report of incident.app.that form then must be distributed to a supervisor and the facility security office.once the form is received by the security office,the incident shall be investigated and an investigative report shall be compiled for submission to opr.app.opr is tasked with reviewing the security office findings for integrity and thoroughness,and remanding the matter to the facility manager if further investigation is required.if the matter is remanded,the facility manager has days to conduct a investigation,address opr concerns,and resubmit the report.once opr accepts the matter,it has working days to complete its own review and respond to the inmate in writing.
the record shows that robinson filed two written reports to staff members detailing his excessive force claim against fink in accordance with the abuse policy.on october,he submitted form inmate request to staff member in which he described the incident,indicated that his shoulder was injured,and asked the unit manager to investigate the matter.on october,he filed a sick call request in which he again described the incident and requested medical attention.other than confirming that robinson received a medical assessment and medication,the record fails to show that anyone at sci rockview timely followed up on robinson written reports or responded to either complaint of abuse.
the doc grievance policy was more formal than its abuse policy and provided the following process.to initiate a claim,an inmate must file form,part with the facility grievance coordinator within working days of an incident.the inmate must sign and date the form and include a short description of the incident and other basic information.
the facility grievance coordinator shall assign a tracking number and,if the form is compliant,must designate a staff member to serve as the grievance officer for its resolution.app.when the grievance officer submits the grievance for formal resolution,shall provide a written response to the inmate within working days of receipt of the grievance.app.emphasis removed.if the investigation requires more time,the facility manager may authorize a extension,in which case the inmate shall be advised in writing.app.
if the grievance is denied,the inmate may appeal to the facility manager within working days of the date he received his written response.the inmate can not appeal prior to receiving a response,however.if the appeal is denied,the inmate may appeal a second time to the secretary office of inmate grievances and appeals soiga within working days.soiga must then respond with a final resolution.
the record shows that robinson filed form,part on october days after his alleged injury.robinson described the incident,noted that he was injured by fink,requested relief,and mentioned that he had submitted an earlier report pursuant to the abuse policy.he also signed and dated the form.
facility grievance coordinator jeffrey rackovan received the form,signed it on october,assigned it grievance number,and made two notations eaton and due.app.consistent with the grievance policy,these notations indicate that captain lynne eaton was to serve as robinson grievance officer and that she had to respond by november.
november came and went and robinson received no response.after hearing nothing from eaton during november or december,on january,robinson submitted form to rackovan,informing him that he had not received a response he knew it was due november,and he was in need of a response for administrative exhaustion.app.
after more days passed without word from the prison,robinson submitted another to rackovan,stating that he took sci rockview failure to respond as a sign that the prison was refusing to process his grievance and that he would proceed to the next level of appeal.app.
a week later,in a final attempt to spur a response from the prison,robinson submitted another form this time to eaton.therein robinson referenced his grievances,noted that eaton had missed the november deadline,and stated i f i do not receive a response to each grievance or this request slip by you,by the date of february,i will consider that a denial of the two grievances.and i shall proceed from there.app.robinson received no response by february.
on february,robinson filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania asserting several claims against approximately prison officials,including his excessive force claim against fink.
on march,more than four months after eaton november deadline and roughly six weeks after robinson filed suit sci rockview responded to robinson grievance against fink in that response,eaton denied robinson claim,but her findings referenced a different incident from the episode of which he had complained 
that same day,robinson submitted another form,this time appealing eaton denial to the facility manager.he noted that her response was submitted far beyond her november deadline he was never interviewed or examined by eaton during the course of her investigation and her response reference d a totally different matter,indicating a lack of due diligence.app.on march,robinson appeal was denied by sci rockview superintendent.
robinson timely appealed to soiga.soiga remanded the matter and rackovan provided a revised response.rackovan again denied robinson claim,however,citing fink denial of the allegations and the fact that robinson medical report indicated no visible injury and that pain medication was provided to him.
robinson appealed again to soiga,which issued a final appeal decision on july upholding the denial of his grievance.
on january,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation dismissing almost all of robinson claims.however,the court overruled the magistrate judge dismissal of his excessive force claim against fink,finding that neither defendants nor the magistrate judge addressed it.app.
