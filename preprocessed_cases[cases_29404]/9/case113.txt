there are circumstances in which the actions of private parties become so entangled with the actions of public entities that the former may become liable as state actors under.but the line that separates private action from state action is sometimes difficult to plot.this case,which involves the actions of a privately owned storage facility with respect to firearms confiscated by massachusetts police officers,illustrates the point.
the district court,ruling at the summary judgment stage,concluded that the storage facility that was sued here was not a state actor and,accordingly,entered summary judgment in its favor.after careful consideration,we affirm.
i.the statutory scheme 
we begin our odyssey with a sketch of the key elements of the massachusetts statutory scheme for firearms ownership.
in massachusetts,an individual who wishes to own or possess a firearm in his residence or place of business must obtain a firearms identification fid card.see.laws ch,com.gouse.under certain defined circumstances,an fid card may be denied,suspended,or revoked.see.laws ch,d,f,i.pertinently,massachusetts law provides that if a court issues an abuse prevention order against a person who presents a substantial likelihood of immediate danger of abuse,the court must order that person to surrender all of his firearms and his fid card as well as any other firearms license.laws ch.one who has surrendered his firearms pursuant to an abuse prevention order yet wishes to challenge the suspension or revocation of his fid card or license,may petition the ordering court for relief and a hearing must be held within days.see id.
an fid card will expire if the holder does not renew it within the time fixed by law.see.laws ch.if an fid card expires,law enforcement officials are authorized to confiscate both the expired card and any firearms possessed by the former cardholder.see id.the holder may at any time take steps to renew his card and reclaim his property.
the surrender of firearms pursuant to this statutory scheme does not terminate a gun owner ownership rights.after such a surrender has occurred,the gun owner may arrange for the firearms to be transferred or sold to any person with a valid fid card or other firearms license within one year after the date of surrender.see id.the police can not dispose of the confiscated firearms for one year,but they are not required to maintain custody of the firearms for that length of time.rather,the police may transfer possession of such weapon s for storage purposes to a federally and state licensed dealer of such weapons and ammunition who operates a bonded warehouse that is equipped with a safe for the secure storage of firearms id.the statutory scheme therefore puts gun owners on constructive notice that if they do not take action with respect to their confiscated firearms,the police have a right to transfer those firearms for storage 
once a licensed dealer takes possession of confiscated firearms and any associated property,the dealer must inspect the firearms,furnish the owner with a detailed inventory,and store the items as specified by the statute.the gun owner becomes liable for all reasonable storage charges,but he may at any time avoid the continuing accrual of such charges by selling or transferring the firearms to a person with a valid fid card or other firearms license.id.if the owner does not either reclaim the confiscated firearms or arrange for a permitted transfer of them and then fails to pay the accumulated storage charges for a period of no less than days,the dealer is authorized to auction the property in order to recoup its fees.see id.so,too,if one year has elapsed and the owner still has not either reclaimed or transferred his confiscated property,the dealer may sell the property at public auction and defray all accumulated storage charges out of the proceeds.see id.any surplus proceeds will be remitted to the owner see id.
ii.factual background 
with this foundation in place,we turn to the case at hand.there are three groups of plaintiffs here we rehearse their facts and circumstances separately.
james and russell jarvis.
plaintiff james jarvis is a gun owner residing in cheshire,massachusetts.in the early morning hours of july,massachusetts state police troopers arrested him for domestic assault and battery.his wife proceeded to obtain an ex parte temporary abuse protection order.based on this order and in pursuance of state law,see.laws ch,the state police confiscated all firearms and ammunition found in james jarvis home.the confiscated property included firearms owned by not only james jarvis himself but also his son james jarvis,and his father russell jarvis.
that same morning,james jarvis and his wife appeared in court.a state judge extended the protection order until august,and it was thereafter extended to august.
james jarvis moved into his parents residence in adams,massachusetts,where he remained for two years.as long as the order of protection was still velivolant,the state police could not lawfully return his firearms to him.moreover,his presence in his parents home inhibited the ability of the police to return russell jarvis firearms and at any rate,russell jarvis did not himself possess a valid fid card or other firearms license at that time.
on august,over a month after the firearms had been taken from james jarvis the state police transferred custody of the confiscated firearms to defendant village gun shop,doing business as village vault the gun shop.as part of its business,the gun shop operates a bonded warehouse for the secure storage of firearms and ammunition.see.laws ch.the gun shop inventoried the confiscated property and,in a letter to james jarvis dated that same day,laid out its storage terms including fees and costs.the letter,to which a formal inventory was attached,explained james jarvis options for exercising dominion over his firearms,noting that he could at any time transfer or sell his firearms to a firearms dealer or a properly licensed individual.the inventory included russell jarvis firearms and even though the gun shop did not send a separate letter to russell jarvis,he has acknowledged that he saw the gun shop letter and was generally aware that the police had transferred his property along with his son to the gun shop.
on september,the gun shop sent james jarvis its initial invoice.this invoice listed out the accumulated storage charges,the administrative fee,and the handling fee.when over months elapsed without payment,the gun shop sold the confiscated firearms and associated property at public auction.
robert crampton.
plaintiff robert crampton is a gun owner domiciled in tewksbury,massachusetts.in the spring of,crampton reported a burglary at his home,and the local police discovered that crampton owned several firearms for which he did not possess a valid license.in point of fact,crampton fid card had expired decades earlier.on june,the police confiscated crampton guns and associated paraphernalia and explained to him that he needed to acquire a new fid card.
crampton did nothing,and on november,over five months after the firearms had been taken from his home the police transferred the guns to the gun shop for storage.that same day,the gun shop wrote to crampton,furnishing him with an inventory and delineating the sundry charges that he would be incurring.when arrearages mounted and crampton failed to pay them for a period of more than days,the gun shop sold his firearms at public auction.
commonwealth second amendment.
plaintiff commonwealth second amendment,csa is a corporation,which has a stated purpose of education,research,publishing and legal action focusing on the constitutional right to privately own and possess firearms.csa asserts that it expends significant resources assisting those people whose firearms are held by bonded warehouses under the authority of massachusetts law.it does not allege that any firearms owned by it have been either confiscated or auctioned.
iii.travel of the case 
in,james jarvis,russell jarvis,robert crampton,and csa brought suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against the gun shop and mary heffernan,in her official capacity as secretary of the executive office of public safety and security.the plaintiffs sought relief under,maintaining that they had been deprived of their fourteenth amendment right to due process.specifically,they alleged that they were forced to pay storage charges and were permanently deprived of their property the firearms without proper notice and opportunity to be heard.both the gun shop and heffernan denied any constitutional breach.
in due course,the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment against the gun shop.they sought a ruling that the gun shop was a state actor,which could be held liable for damages under section.the district court demurred,concluding that the gun shop was not a state actor for purposes of a section action.see jarvis village gun shop,d.accordingly,the court denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment on the state action issue to the gun shop.see see also.f.
following some procedural wrangling including the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims against heffernan the district court entered a final judgment in favor of the gun shop.this timely appeal ensued 
iv.the merits 
we divide our discussion of the merits into two segments.we begin with the standards applicable to appellate review of summary judgments and the essential elements of the section framework.we then examine the theories of state action undergirding the plaintiffs claim.
a.the legal landscape.
we afford plenary review to a district court grant of summary judgment.see santiago puerto rico,cir.where,as here,a party moves for summary judgment and the court,sua sponte,grants judgment the other way,the usual approach to appellate oversight of rule orders must be inverted.quaker state oil ref.garrity oil,cir.consequently,we view the facts and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom in the light most hospitable to the summary judgment loser here,the plaintiffs.see id.we will affirm the entry of summary judgment as long as the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact and shows that the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see santiago,at.a.
in this context,an issue is genuine if the record permits a rational factfinder to resolve that issue in favor of either party.see borges ex rel.serrano isern,cir.within this rubric,a fact is material if its existence or nonexistence has the potential to change the outcome of the suit.id.at.
here,the correctness of the summary judgment ruling depends on the district court application of.in order to put this appeal in perspective,then,it is necessary to revisit the terrain of section.
section supplies a private right of action against a person who,under color of state law,deprives another of rights secured by the constitution or by federal law.redondo borges dep t of hous.urban,cir quoting evans avery,cir.a cause of action under this provision comprises two essential elements first,the conduct complained of must have been carried out under color of state law,and second,that conduct must have worked a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the constitution or laws of the united states.grajales ports,cir quoting martinez colon,cir.
in this instance,we train the lens of our inquiry on the under color of state law requirement which was the lone issue before the district court at summary judgment.because this requirement is the functional equivalent of the fourteenth amendment state action requirement,see perkins londonderry basketball club,cir,we regard case law dealing with either of these formulations as authoritative with respect to the other,and we use the terminologies interchangeably,santiago,at.
b.the plaintiffs claim.
the centerpiece of the plaintiffs section claim is their allegation that they were deprived of their due process rights by the gun shop.specifically,they allege that their fourteenth amendment rights were abridged because they were forced to pay storage charges and,when they did not do so,their property was peremptorily sold at public auction.
it is true if somewhat of a tautology that the fourteenth amendment applies only to state action performed by a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.lugar edmondson oil,d.when the named defendant in a section case is a private party,the plaintiff must show that the defendant conduct can be classified as state action.see rendell baker kohn,d.the state action inquiry is preliminary to,and independent of,the due process inquiry.if there is no state action,the plaintiff claim fails.see id.
the bar for such a showing is set quite high,and we have cautioned that i t is o nly in rare circumstances that private parties can be viewed as state actors.estades negroni cpc hosp.san juan capestrano,cir quoting harvey harvey,cir alterations in original.this inquiry is typically factbound.see brentwood acad.secondary sch.athl.ass n,d burton wilmington parking,d explaining that o nly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the state in private conduct be attributed its true significance.
the supreme court has mapped out three routes that can lead to a finding that a private party may fairly be said to be a state actor.lugar,at.state action may be found if the private party assumes a traditional public function when performing the challenged conduct,or if the private party conduct is coerced or significantly encouraged by the state,or if the private party and the state have become so intertwined that they were effectively joint participant s in the challenged conduct.santiago,at quoting estades negroni,at.unless the facts of record here,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,are capable of supporting a finding that the plaintiffs have successfully travelled one or more of these avenues,the entry of summary judgment must stand.see id.at.we turn,then,to this inquiry.
joint action.we start with the pathway on which the plaintiffs have placed their heaviest emphasis joint action.to establish state action through this route,a plaintiff must show that the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private party that it was a joint participant in the challenged activity.santiago,at quoting estades negroni,at alterations in original.the relevant inquiry demands a deep dive into the totality of the circumstances,with heightened attention to certain specific factors.see perkins,at.those factors include whether the private party is or is not independent from the state in conducting its affairs,see whether the private party has shared profits generated from its challenged conduct with the state,see barrios velazquez asociacion de empleados del estado libre asociado de,cir and whether the private party has used public facilities,see burton,at.in the case at hand,the plaintiffs do not and can not come close to making the requisite showing.
here,the record reveals no relationship between the activities of the police and those of the gun shop,with one exception a massachusetts statute authorizes the police to transfer possession of lawfully confiscated firearms and associated property to licensed storage facilities,see.laws ch,and the gun shop operates such a facility.although this transfer may occur without a gun owner express authorization,the statute puts such owners on notice that their property may be transferred if they fail to avail themselves of other options.taken alone,that statutory authorization is too fragile a link for purposes of demonstrating the required nexus between state action and private action,we think it insufficient simply to point to a state statute authorizing the actions of the private entity.see jackson metro.edison,d perkins,at.
nor can the plaintiffs bridge this gap by showing that the state acquiesced in the actions of the gun shop.after all,where the state has merely announced the circumstances under which its courts will not interfere with a private sale,state action is not present.flagg,brooks,d.
such a tenuous connection between the state and the gun shop is surely not enough to ground a finding of state action and the record discloses
