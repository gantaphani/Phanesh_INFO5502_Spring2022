joseph and julie doe on behalf of themselves and their minor son,benjamin,filed suit against abington friends school abington and three of its employees.their suit,grounded for federal purposes in the americans with disabilities act ada,see,stat.codified at,alleges that abington did not adequately accommodate benjamin diagnosed attention deficit disorder and related learning disabilities it claims as well that the individual defendants subjected benjamin to a discriminatory environment complete with public humiliation,improper physical discipline,and an orchestrated campaign to force his withdrawal from the school.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,ruling that the ada exemption for religious organizations applied to bar the does claim.it made this decision on the basis of a single affidavit submitted by the defendants and before allowing the does any discovery into the factual basis for applying the religious exemption.we conclude that the court,in so doing,contravened federal rule of civil procedure f,and we thus vacate and remand.
factual background 
established in,abington is the oldest primary and secondary educational institution in the united states that has operated continuously at the same location.it is affiliated with the abington monthly meeting of the religious society of friends quakers.determining the extent of that affiliation forms the background of this appeal.the does assert in paragraphs and of the complaint that 
a lthough abington purports to embrace tenets of the quaker religion in its educational program,it is not a religious entity,a religious organization,or an entity controlled by a religious organization.abington does not conduct itself or hold itself out as a religious organization or an entity controlled by a religious organization.
this allegation is significant because the ada provides that its provisions shall not apply to religious organizations or entities controlled by religious organizations,including places of worship.if abington is a religious organization or controlled by one,then the does ada claim should be dismissed and,likely,their remaining claims sent to state court.
the does filed this action in early october.on november,at a hearing meant to explore the does confidentiality concerns,abington instead raised the issue of the ada exemption for religious organizations and noted the school long religious history.counsel for the does responded that,while abington may have been a religious institution in the past,it has strayed from its religious foundation and,therefore,is not eligible for the ada exemption.after some discussion,the court declined to proceed too far without formal briefing and mentioned that there may have to be some limited discovery on this issue.it expressed a desire to set out a schedule so th e issue could be developed factually and properly presented before me so that i could decide it before we go any further.rather than allow the does any discovery,however,abington filed on november a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment on count i,arguing that it is exempt from the requirements of the ada.
along with its motion,abington submitted the affidavit of thomas price,abington head of school.price referred to abington friends school and the abington monthly meeting as virtually one and the same.he said that abington is under the care of abington monthly meeting and referenced a trust formed for the benefit of both the school and the meeting.according to price,t he meeting owns the grounds and buildings and oversees the school through its standing committees,including the school committee,of whom must be members of the abington monthly meeting.further,t he school committee is responsible for the financial health of the school,for the fulfillment of its mission fidelity to quaker principles and testimonies,and the selection and supervision of the head of school.price reported that t he day to day operation of abington is delegated by the school committee to the head of school and other personnel.in addition,price described various religious aspects of the abington operation,saying it is guided by quaker values,principles and testimonies.teachers and administrators participate annually in professional development activities focused on keeping the school quaker spirit vital and relevant.abington students participate in weekly meeting for worship.moreover,the key quaker testimonies equality,peaceful resolution of conflict,stewardship,community are fully integrated into the curriculum at every level,a process overseen by a quakerism coordinator in each division of the school.in summary,price observed that a n abington friends school education is so fully an experience drawn from quaker values and traditions,it is difficult to identify many practices,rituals or activities that are not rooted in quaker faith and practice.
in response to abington motion and thomas price affidavit,the does moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f for a continuance so that discovery could take place on whether the ada religious exemption properly applied to abington the motion was accompanied by an affidavit from carl hittinger,the does attorney,which argued that abington motion was premature because the case was in its infancy and the does had not had an opportunity to conduct the full and fair discovery needed to respond properly and fairly.hittinger specifically identified six topics on which discovery was necessary 
the ownership of abington,including both tangible and real property 
the control of abington,including the control over operations,policy,finances,curriculum,and its advising system 
the quaker religion as presented in curriculum and activities at abington 
the religious affiliation of the abington student body,faculty,staff,and school committee 
any requirement s that abington students,faculty,staff or school committee members follow or subscribe to the tenets of the quaker religion and any training faculty or staff receive regarding the quaker religion and 
the abington school committee,its composition,activities and alleged control over abington.
to accomplish this discovery,hittinger requested the depositions of thomas price,the three individual defendants,abington corporate designee,and any other witnesses identified in those depositions with personal knowledge of relevant facts.in addition,the does already had submitted several requests for production of documents relating to the same topics addressed in their rule f motion,but abington did not respond.
the district court heard oral argument on abington motion in january.shortly thereafter,the court issued a order construing abington motion as one for summary judgment and granted it.the order rejected the does argument that control is a factual test,but relied exclusively on thomas price affidavit to conclude that the facts as recited therein supported the conclusion that abington is,as a matter of law,a religious organization as well as controlled by a religious organization.the court ruled,therefore,that abington is exempt from the ada and dismissed count i.it also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining counts under and dismissed them as well.the does appealed that same day

standards of review 
our review of a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.surin,at.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue is present when a reasonable trier of fact,viewing all of the record evidence,could rationally find in favor of the party in light of his burden of proof.celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.the party may not merely deny the allegations in the moving party pleadings instead he must show where in the record there exists a genuine dispute over a material fact.celotex,at.the substantive law identifies which facts are material.anderson liberty lobby,at.
when an order granting summary judgment is attacked as premature,we review a district court refusal to delay action for an abuse of discretion.suri
