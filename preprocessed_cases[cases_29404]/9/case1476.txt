opinion of the court 
robert small,an inmate at the camden county correctional facility cccf,appeals the dismissal of his civil rights action against camden county,cccf,approximately thirty individual medical personnel and prison officers,and nine john does collectively,defendants,for his failure to exhaust administrative remedies,as he was required to do by the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat,as amended,a.we will affirm in part and vacate in part.
background 
small is a new jersey state prisoner.he is a paraplegic and confined to a wheelchair.as relevant here,at various times between june and september,and again between may and january,small was a pretrial detainee at cccf.each time,he entered cccf with his own wheelchair equipped with leg rests.
in march,small filed this action,pro se,under.the district court appointed pro bono counsel,and a second amended complaint was filed on january.in that complaint,small asserted claims against defendants arising from fourteen incidents that he alleged occurred between august and september.those incidents involved,among other misconduct,the use of excessive force,the denial of medical treatment,and the confiscation of his personal wheelchair and its replacement with one without leg rests.when left with what he alleges was an improper replacement,he claims he was unable to brush his teeth,shower,and on several occasions,was left to lie for days in his own excrement.
in late,after the completion of merits discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing,among other things,that small failed to exhaust his administrative remedies pursuant to cccf grievance procedures before filing suit these procedures,which are set forth in cccf inmate handbook,are reproduced in full in the appendix to this opinion.in broad summary,however,they provide that a prisoner may,within days after a grievable incident,file a formal,written grievance on a grievance form or,if a grievance form is not available,on plain paper.grievable incidents include violations of civil,constitutional or statutory rights,criminal acts,and unsafe or unsanitary conditions.after a grievance is filed,it is reviewed by a grievance officer who time stamps and logs it into the prison computer system.if improperly filed,the grievance is returned to the prisoner.if properly filed and logged in,it is forwarded to the appropriate shift commander to be addressed within hours.if not resolved in that time,it is returned to the grievance officer for review and resolution within days.if the prisoner is not satisfied with the grievance officer decision,he may appeal,in writing,to the warden or his designee within days.the warden decision is final.
on may,the district court denied defendants motions without prejudice and stated its intention to hold an evidentiary hearing to decide the exhaustion issue before reaching any of the other asserted bases for summary judgment.initially,the court gave small the option of having an advisory jury serve as fact finder at the hearing,an option he accepted.shortly thereafter,however,the court became aware of our decision in drippe tobelinski,cir,which stated,albeit in dicta,that exhaustion of administrative remedies is a question of law to be determined by the judge.id.at.the court provided small with two options brief the issue further or withdraw his request for an advisory jury.small withdrew his request.
on june and,the district court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether small properly filed a grievance and thereafter exhausted each of the fourteen incidents of which he complained.the court heard testimony from small and two prison officials,karen taylor and reginald atkins,and reviewed the extensive collection of documents small submitted to demonstrate his compliance with cccf grievance procedures.the court went through the grievances one by one,ultimately concluding that small failed to exhaust all but one of them,and explaining at length why it had reached that conclusion.by order entered june,the court dismissed the complaint as to all but that one,and after it eventually settled,the court entered the final order in the case on march.small appealed.we granted small motion for appointment of counsel on appeal.

iii.analysis 
in an effort to curb the number of prisoner filings in the federal courts,congress enacted the plra which,as relevant here,mandates that prisoners exhaust internal prison grievance procedures before filing suit.a see woodford ngo,d spruill,at.the exhaustion provision of the plra reads 
no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
a.failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove it is not a pleading requirement for the.jones bock,d see ray kertes,cir holding that failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense and finding that the district court erred in imposing an improperly heightened pleading standard that required the prisoner not only to plead,but also to prove,exhaustion in the complaint.furthermore,the defendant must prove that the failed to exhaust each of his claims.there is no total exhaustion rule permitting dismissal of an entire action because of one unexhausted claim.jones,at.
exhaustion for a judge or a jury 
small argues that,under the plra,a jury,not a judge,should determine factual disputes relating to the issue of exhaustion because seventh amendment rights are implicated.in drippe,however,we stated,unconditionally and in agreement with the seventh circuit holding in pavey conley,cir,that exhaustion is a question of law to be determined by a judge,even if that determination requires the resolution of disputed facts drippe.at.at issue in drippe were the timing requirements for raising exhaustion as an affirmative defense,and so our statement,strong as it was,was dicta.we now hold what we so strongly signaled in drippe,a conclusion that has been reached as well by every one of our sister circuits to have considered the issue.
the seventh amendment provides that i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.const.amend.vii.in an action under,the parties have a right to a jury trial on the merits,city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d,but this right does not guarantee resolution by a jury of all factual disputes.whether the right to a jury trial applies depends upon the nature of the issue rather than the character of the overall action.ross bernhardt,d see dillon rogers,cir.
under the plra,exhaustion is a precondition for bringing suit under.a no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.emphasis added.as such,just as jurisdiction personal jurisdiction,and venue,exhaustion is a threshold issue that courts must address to determine whether litigation is being conducted in the right forum at the right time.dillon,at emphasis added see pavey,at juries decide cases,not issues of judicial traffic control.until the issue of exhaustion is resolved,the court can not know whether it is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.mccarthy madigan,d likening the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies to abstention,finality,and govern the timing of decisionmaking myers bethlehem shipbuilding.describing exhaustion as a rule of judicial administration.those of our sister circuits to have considered the issue have held that a plaintiff in a lawsuit governed by the plra is not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of exhaustion.see messa goord,cir dillon,at pavey,at bryant rich,cir wyatt terhune,cir.no court has held,as small would have us hold,that decision of that issue implicates seventh amendment rights 
as we have already suggested,it is of no consequence that here,as is often the case,there are disputed facts that must be resolved in order to determine whether the claims were exhausted.see bryant,at holding the district court properly acted as fact finder in resolving conflicting evidence that raised a genuine issue of material fact about whether administrative remedies were available to the prisoner plaintiffs accord messa,at dillon,at.matters of judicial administration often require judges to decide factual disputes and the seventh amendment is not implicated as long as the facts are not bound up with the merits of the underlying dispute.see messa,at the seventh amendment does not promise a jury trial on all issues that might,as a practical matter,finally dispose of a case.rather,it guarantees the right to a jury resolution of the merits of the ultimate dispute.citing markman westview instruments,d and in re peterson.see also alliance for envtl.renewal pyramid crossgates,cir.small does not suggest that the facts relating to his exhaustion of administrative remedies or his failure to exhaust are at all intertwined with the merits of his claims.
in sum,we agree with the second,fifth,seventh,ninth,and eleventh circuits and hold that judges may resolve factual disputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the participation of a jury.accordingly,the district court did not err by acting as the fact finder because exhaustion constitutes a preliminary issue for which no right to a jury trial exists 
district court findings of fact 
having determined that the district court did not err by serving as fact finder on the exhaustion issue,we turn our attention to the court findings themselves,findings we must accept unless clearly erroneous.the court correctly placed the burden on defendants to prove and conducted a,painstakingly thorough inquiry into the exhaustion issue as to each of small claims.the court then carefully,and in much detail,reviewed the testimony and documentary evidence,made credibility determinations to which we must defer,and rendered its decision.
availability of administrative remedies 
although the availability of administrative remedies to a prisoner is a question of law,brown croak,cir citing ray,at,it necessarily involves a factual inquiry.see dillon,at w hile it is a question of law whether administrative remedies qualify as being available under a,availability may sometimes turn on questions of fact.available means capable of use at hand.brown,at citing webster ii,new riverside university dictionary ed.remedies that are not reasonably communicated to inmates may be considered unavailable for exhaustion purposes.id.see dillon,at recognizing the importance of ensuring that inmates have avenues for discovering the procedural rules governing their grievances goebert lee,cir that which is unknown and unknowable is unavailable.
the district court found that small received an inmate handbook which,as we have noted,outlines cccf grievance procedures upon his entry to the prison,or shortly thereafter and,in any event,that he was aware of those procedures.we agree that,wholly aside from whether small in fact was given a handbook,there was ample evidence that he nonetheless knew of,and had access to,cccf grievance procedures and,thus,that administrative remedies were available to him.
although small continues to contend he did not receive a handbook until,and therefore was unaware until then of the grievance procedures,we can not help but observe that,among other things,he properly filed his first grievance form,fully compliant with those procedures,on august.indeed,small testified that by that time he knew of the procedures and the need to file a formal grievance.he also testified that although he had access to the law library,he never requested a copy of the handbook.finally,although he claims that prison officials prevented him from accessing grievance forms,he testified that these alleged obstructionist efforts did not prevent him from obtaining a form,one way or another,when he needed one.in any event,the procedures allow grievances to be filed on plain paper.
in sum,the record is clear that small knew of,and was able to access,cccf grievance procedures.we,thus,conclude,that administrative remedies were available to him.
ii.substantial compliance with cccf grievance procedures 
t o properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,rules that are defined not by the plra,but by the prison grievance process itself.jones,at citation omitted quoting woodford,at.to complete the administrative review process,we have held,means substantial compliance with the prison grievance procedures.see spruill,at citing nyhuis reno,cir.the district court found,in its review of the grievances at issue before us,that small had not substantially complied with cccf grievance procedures as to any of them,for different reasons specific to each one,and had thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies 
it has been with some difficulty that we have parsed out the who,what,where,and when regarding each of the grievances at issue,and we applaud the district court for its yeoman efforts in this regard.indeed,we agree with the court as to the failings of the vast majority of the grievances and,without being as specific as the court,we briefly explain why.submitting a sick call request,for example,a form on which a prisoner requests medical attention,is not a submission in compliance with cccf grievance procedures.as the district court explained,sick call requests are prospective requests for medical services,they are not retrospective complaints about the denial of services.moreover,any asserted belief that a grievance was to be filed by means of a sick call request form is belied by small submission of grievance forms complaining about deficient medical care.beyond even that,small testified to the difference between a sick call request,a small little form that you fill out with your information on it to request medical attention,id.at,and a grievance form,a much larger form that you fill out if you have a complaint against something in the institution.id.at.
similarly,the district court properly discounted letters small wrote that were not submitted in compliance with cccf requirements for the proper filing of grievances,they were not directed to the grievance officer or any corrections staff,were not filed within days of the alleged incident,or failed to identify the specifics of the incident indeed,the majority of those letters were sent to individuals outside of prison administration,thus failing to serve the basic purpose of the grievance filing mechanism,which is to notify officials of a problem and provide an opportunity for efficient correction.with respect to the grievances,the subject of small letters and sick call request forms,the court correctly concluded that small efforts were not substantially compliant with cccf grievance procedures and so could not serve as a basis for satisfying the plra exhaustion requirement.
we believe,however,that the district court erred insofar as it found that although grievances had been submitted in compliance with cccf procedures as to the incidents of june,and june,those grievances should nonetheless be dismissed because small did not file an appeal as to either one the court concluded that small failure to appeal rendered his efforts noncompliant with cccf procedures and,therefore,that his administrative remedies as to them were unexhausted.there is no dispute,however,that there was no decision as to either of those grievances or,we note,any of
