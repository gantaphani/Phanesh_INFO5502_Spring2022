boris raishevich raishevich appeals from an amended judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york william conner,judge reducing his compensatory damage award from to raishevich ii,and a order denying his motion for attorneys fees,raishevich foster,d raishevich iv 
raishevich brought suit pursuant to and the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,seeking damages for the destruction of his photographic transparencies by charles foster foster,an evidence custodian for the new york state police.he also sought an award of attorneys fees.after foster conceded liability,the district court held a bench trial,limited to the issue of damages.raishevich now appeals from the reduction of his compensatory award and the denial of his motion for attorneys fees.
for the reasons given below,we affirm the district court order reducing the damage award.we find,however,that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in denying raishevich motion for attorneys fees solely on the basis of his rejection of a settlement figure the district court proposed during a settlement conference.thus,we vacate the court order denying raishevich motion for attorneys fees and remand for further proceedings on that issue.
background 
for approximately fifteen years,raishevich assembled a collection of photographic transparencies of cannabis,or marijuana,plants.raishevich i,d at.in november,officers of the new york state police arrested raishevich and seized numerous items from his home,including transparencies from his cannabis collection.see id.although he requested that the police return his transparencies,they were destroyed by foster,an evidence custodian for the new york state police.on may,raishevich brought suit pursuant to seeking compensatory damages for the destruction of these transparencies as well as an award of costs,including attorneys fees,pursuant to b.
several developments are of interest for our purposes.on march,foster conceded liability.on may,raishevich obtained new counsel,the law firm of michael kennedy,which has continued its representation of raishevich through this appeal.on march,approximately two months before trial,the district court conducted a settlement conference.although each party recollection of the conference differs somewhat,and,importantly,differs from that of the district court,a few facts seem clear.during this conference,assistant attorney general bruce brown brown represented to the district court on behalf of the defendant that any figure over would be beyond the settlement authority of his immediate supervisors and would require approval from albany.raishevich counsel indicated that it would be difficult to convince her client to accept an offer less than.the district court then proposed a compromise at and asked the attorneys to discuss the proposal with their clients and inform the court as to their decision.raishevich iv,d at.at oral argument before this court,brown confirmed that his supervisors refused to authorize a settlement,and both counsel agreed that foster never made an offer of.tr.of oral argument at.also at oral argument,brown went beyond his representation to the district court regarding the extent of his settlement authority and indicated that there was never a formal offer of because any such offer would have required the approval of new york state comptroller.id.at.thus,no offer was made,nor any compromise reached.
during a bench trial solely on the issue of damages,raishevich produced little evidence of his past earnings from his transparencies.the district court evaluation of the evidence reveals that it found much of raishevich proof regarding his past not directly challenged on unsubstantiated or unconvincing.see raishevich i,d at.the district court discredited raishevich expert witness testimony that the value of a use of a transparency was,seemingly finding her testimony to be both flawed and largely irrelevant.see id.at.after receiving conflicting evidence regarding the value of raishevich transparencies,the district court found that was the proper measure of the actual value of each transparency.see id.at.the district court then examined how many prints from his transparencies raishevich could have sold over a period.see id.despite finding that evidence of his past earnings and productions was scant,the district court provided raishevich with the benefit of every doubt and concluded that raishevich peak publication rate was two prints per year.this yielded sixty uses of his destroyed transparencies over a period.id.at per use,the damages amounted to.the district court then doubled the award of to because foster destruction of the transparencies may have hindered raishevich ability to prove his damages with greater specificity.see id.finally,the district court stated that the parties should bear their own costs and attorneys fees.see id.at.
foster then sought an order amending the district court findings of fact and judgment in order to reduce the damage award.raishevich also moved to increase the damage award and to amend the judgment to include an award of attorneys fees.in its december,order raishevich ii,the district court granted foster motion and reduced the amount of compensatory damages to,denied raishevich motion to increase the damages because his motion was untimely,and reserved decision on raishevich motion for attorneys fees pending our decision following rehearing in quaratino tiffany,cir,vacated and superseded on rehearing,cir.in halving the damage award,the district court explained that it had improperly taken the bigelow principle into account twice in its initial decision,both in determining the publication rate of a raishevich transparency and in supplementing the resulting damage figure at the end.the district court,however,had not explicitly discussed the bigelow principle in its initial opinion.
following raishevich ii,raishevich moved for an order amending the judgment in order to increase the compensatory damages and to include an award of punitive damages and prejudgment interest.on january,the district court granted raishevich motion for an award of prejudgment interest but denied his motion in all other respects raishevich iii.in this opinion,the district court explained that it previously had applied the bigelow principle twice first by substantially increasing plaintiff estimated rate of publication by choosing the highest rate ever achieved two compensated publications per year thereby arriving at a total damage figure of,and again by doubling the final determined market value,so as to award.
raishevich filed a notice of appeal to this court on january.on february,the appeal was withdrawn without prejudice to reinstatement after the district court decided the pending issue of attorneys fees.on november,the district court denied raishevich motion for attorneys fees,finding that although raishevich was a prevailing party,special circumstances existed that rendered an award unjust.raishevich iv,d at.the district court concluded that such an award was unjust because liability had been conceded raishevich expert had predicted a large sum in damages and raishevich had rejected an offer of settlement that was greater than the amount he ultimately received in damages.id.
on december,raishevich filed a notice of appeal of the district court amended judgment of december,the initial judgment of august,and its four opinions and orders.on appeal,raishevich contends that the district court erred in reducing the damage award and also abused its discretion in denying his application for attorneys fees.
discussion 
reduction of damage award 
raishevich objects to the district court reduction of his compensatory damage award,arguing that the district court did not include a duplicative consideration of the bigelow principle,see supra note,in its initial judgment.following a bench trial,we will not upset a district court factual findings unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.travellers int l,trans world airlines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,we review de novo a district court conclusions of law.see id.at.
although raishevich bore the burden of persuasion with regard to his entitlement to compensatory relief,he had no obligation to offer a mathematically precise formula as to the amount of damages.wendon,cir.if the plaintiff inability to prove an exact amount of damages arises from actions of the defendant,a factfinder has some latitude to make a just and reasonable estimate of damages based on relevant data.id.quoting bigelow rko radio pictures.the factfinder,however,may not base its award on speculation or guesswork.see sir speedy,l p graphics,cir.when damages are at some unascertainable amount below an upper limit and when the uncertainty arises from the defendant wrong,the upper limit will be taken as the proper amount.gratz claughton,cir.the bigelow principle thus applies to situations in which the amount of damages,although not specifically ascertainable because of misconduct by the defendant,falls within a certain range.it provides the plaintiff with the benefit of a more liberalized standard of proof and prevents the defendant from profit ing by his wrongdoing at the expense of his victim.bigelow,at.
in this case,the district court reduced its initial damage award because it concluded that it had applied the bigelow principle twice.although raishevich takes issue with this conclusion,we find that the district court did not err in reducing the award to correct its previous double counting.while the district court did not discuss the bigelow principle in its initial opinion,it is clear that it applied bigelow principles in determining raishevich peak publication rate of two prints per year.raishevich provided little to no evidence indicating the uniqueness of his work,his exploitation of the market demand for cannabis photography or the market value of one of his transparencies raishevich i,d at.moreover,the district court found that,during a period,raishevich published no more than ten prints.see id.at.for some of these publications,raishevich received no compensation or the compensation he allegedly received was deemed questionable by the district court.see id.at.the district court also noted that in the period immediately preceding the seizure,raishevich failed to publish at all.see id.at.thus,it is clear from the initial opinion that the district court selection of a rate of two uses per year was a choice to use the upper limit and therefore to apply the bigelow principle.that principle thus directly contributed to the damage calculation.the district court applied bigelow again in doubling the resulting figure to.
raishevich points to no precedent requiring a district court to factor the bigelow principle in each point of its analysis to do so would be to multiply the bigelow factor exponentially.our precedent suggests the opposite bigelow provides only that the factfinder is given some latitude in making a reasonable assessment of the damages,but it does not authorize the assessment of an additional penalty beyond permitting the plaintiff a more liberalized standard of proof.although the bigelow principle should be applied,it should not be applied twice.here,recognizing that raishevich evidence was weak,the district court gave him the benefit of the doubt,but initially did so twice.therefore,the district court correctly reduced its damage award in raishevich ii because it had previously applied bigelow twice.
ii.denial of attorneys fees 
our review of the denial of an award of attorneys fees is highly deferential to the district court and we reverse only for an abuse of discretion.alderman pan am world airways,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while abuse of discretion is one of the most deferential standards of review,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if its conclusions are based on an erroneous determination of law,or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.matthew bender west publ g,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
title,section of the united states code authorizes district courts to award reasonable attorneys fees to prevailing parties in proceedings in vindication of civil rights.see b.although a district court typically has wide discretion in choosing whether to deny attorneys fees,we have indicated that this discretion is narrowed by a presumption that successful civil rights litigants should ordinarily recover attorneys fees unless special circumstances would render an award unjust.kerr quinn,cir.as we explained in kerr,the function of an award of attorney fees is to encourage the bringing of meritorious civil rights claims which might otherwise be abandoned because of the financial imperatives surrounding the hiring of competent counsel.id.we recognized,however,that in cases in which the merits are strong and a probable damage award is high,local counsel would be easily obtained due to the prospect of a significant contingency fee,and thus an award of attorneys fees would not further the statutory purpose.see id.accordingly,we established a test for courts to apply when considering whether special circumstances make it appropriate to deny attorneys fees.a court must make an initial determination whether the plaintiff claim was so strong on the merits and so likely to result in a substantial judgment that counsel in similar cases could be easily and readily retained.id.to evaluate this prong,a court,analyzing the posture of the case at the time counsel is sought,must determine whether attorneys who generally take such cases on a contingent basis would readily appreciate the value of the case and agree to pursue it.id.at.
after the court determines that the plaintiff case satisfies this first requirement for denial of fees,it then may use its discretion to deny fees if,in light of all of the circumstances and the size of recovery,an award of such fees might work an injustice.id.we emphasized that this decision will turn on such factors as the award of punitive damages,the amount of the compensatory award,the degree and measurability of the harm to the plaintiff,and the public interest in the particular claim see id.
prevailing party 
before we reach the question whether the district court correctly applied the kerr test,we must address whether raishevich is a prevailing party.b.to so qualify,a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim.farrar,at.a plaintiff who achieves relief as a result of a settlement may be considered a prevailing party if the relief obtained was of the same general type as the relief sought.lyte sara lee,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude,as the district court did,that because raishevich sought monetary compensation for the value of his destroyed transparencies and because foster is legally obligated to compensate him,raishevich qualifies as a prevailing party.raishevich qualifies despite the fact that he received a lesser amount than he sought,because a judgment for damages in any amount modifies the defendant behavior for the plaintiff benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.farrar,at.holding that a party who wins nominal damages may be considered a prevailing party see also ruggiero krzeminski,cir holding that a party who achieves only partial success may be considered a prevailing party.at minimum,therefore,raishevich has established his eligibility for a fee award.see fletcher,cir a plaintiff who has prevail ed in the litigation has established only his eligibility for,not his entitlement to,an award of fees.quoting farrar,at.alteration in original.it remains to be determined whether the district court exceeded its allowable discretion in concluding that raishevich is not entitled to an award.
likelihood of attracting similar counsel 
the district court found that by the time raishevich obtained his current counsel,the facts in his case were so favorable that other counsel could easily have been obtained raishevich challenges this conclusion,arguing that the facts at the time he brought his complaint were not nearly as favorable as the district court indicated.raishevich current counsel did not file this complaint but was
