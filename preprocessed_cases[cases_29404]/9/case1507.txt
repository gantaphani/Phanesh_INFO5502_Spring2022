opinion of the court 
plaintiff alan macfarlan appeal requires us to review the application of judicial estoppel to his complaint.the district court judge denied macfarlan relief as to all counts of his complaint.primary among the court rulings was the grant of summary judgment to macfarlan former employer,ivy hill snf,llc ivy hill based upon judicial estoppel.we will affirm.
macfarlan notice of appeal states that he was appealing only from the final judgment and order entered on may,denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration of the district court granting summary judgment to defendant.that motion pertained only to his count claim under the family and medical leave act fmla.macfarlan also seeks our relief based upon other acts which refer to his disability and which were the subject of counts of his amended complaint.the main challenge that macfarlan makes,however,is to the district court application of judicial estoppel.we first dispose of two aspects of his appeal which have come to our attention.ivy hill raised no objection to either the form of order entered by the district court or to the limited nature of macfarlan notice of appeal.
a.the district court order 
on july,the district court granted summary judgment to ivy hill on counts of macfarlan amended complaint and on his fmla retaliation claim,which was part of count.ivy hill thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration as to macfarlan remaining count fmla claim.
in its november,order granting ivy hill motion for reconsideration and entering summary judgment for ivy hill,the district court,among other rulings,granted the defendant,ivy hill,summary judgment on macfarlan remaining claim based on judicial estoppel,and therefore denied relief to macfarlan on his entire count fmla claim.in the same order,the district court then ruled that count i of plaintiff amended complaint is dismissed.
when summary judgment is granted to the prevailing party,it is inappropriate and erroneous to dismiss the very complaint that gave rise to the summary judgment order.while no substantial right of macfarlan was affected by the form of the district court order,nonetheless good practice dictates that the complaint on which judgment is entered can not and should not be dismissed.accordingly,macfarlan not having been prejudiced by the form of the district court order,we now disregard the district court order of dismissal and review only the summary judgment disposition,which is the gravamen of macfarlan appeal.
b.the notice of appeal 
macfarlan filed a notice of appeal only from the final judgment and order entered on may,denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration of the district court order granting summary judgment to defendant.in normal course,we would confine our review to the one issue appealed,reconsideration of the district court order that granted summary judgment to ivy hill for alleged violation of the fmla.however,while ivy hill,as noted,did not object to our consideration of the other counts in macfarlan amended complaint,and indeed,addressed them in its brief,we sua sponte have the obligation of considering and confining an appellant to the issue which he has chosen to appeal.see elfman motors,chrysler,when an appeal is taken from a specified judgment only or from a part of a specified judgment,the court of appeals acquires thereby no jurisdiction to review other judgments or portions thereof not so specified or otherwise fairly to be inferred from the notice as intended to be presented for review on the appeal.
however,we are informed by our precedent in murray commercial union insurance,cir,that in circumstances comparable to macfarlan,we will review the arguments of an appellant pertaining to issues not designated in the notice of appeal.in murray,we held that where the parties addressed multiple issues presented to the district court,but which were not designated in the notice of appeal,we could nevertheless review the issues.accordingly,macfarlan notice of appeal,which referred only to an appeal from the district court judgment denying his motion for reconsideration,does not preclude us from addressing macfarlan other claims which were included in his amended complaint.
beginning in,appellant alan macfarlan worked as a maintenance director at green acres rehab and nursing center green acres.on january,macfarlan had a stroke,and on january,entered on leave under the fmla,which allows eligible employees,of which macfarlan was one,to take up to twelve weeks of leave due to a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.a.
at the time that macfarlan entered on leave,green acres human resources director prepared a fmla request form,which macfarlan signed.that form noted that macfarlan fmla leave began on january,and that april,was his a nticipated date of return from leave 
beginning in february,macfarlan received short term disability benefits from his insurer,unum life insurance company of america.on april,green acres was purchased by appellee ivy hill snf,llc and renamed ivy hill rehabilitation and nursing care.on april,macfarlan doctor cleared him to return to work starting on may,but with the conditions that he not work more than four hours per day and that he not lift or otherwise move loads in excess of twenty pounds.the administrator of ivy hill notified macfarlan that work was not available,at which time,april,macfarlan doctor cleared him to work,but did not change the lifting restriction.
on or about april,ivy hill terminated macfarlan employment and notified him of that fact,at the same time informing him that he would not be hired back with any lifting restrictions.from the time of his termination until july,when he was ultimately cleared to work without any restrictions,macfarlan received disability benefits from unum,his insurer.macfarlan was told that once his lifting restrictions had ended,he could reapply for employment with ivy hill,which he ultimately did in august at that time,macfarlan also stopped receiving disability benefits.
on may,macfarlan filed a complaint against ivy hill.macfarlan thereafter amended his complaint on june,and drafted a further amendment to which ivy hill consented on november.in his amended complaint,macfarlan raised four counts against ivy hill in the district court a claim for violation of the fmla and a retaliation claim for exercising his fmla rights a claim for violation of the rehabilitation act a claim for violation of the americans with disabilities act ada and a claim for violation of the pennsylvania human relations act phra.
on july,the district court granted summary judgment for ivy hill on all claims except macfarlan claim for violation of the fmla.following a motion by ivy hill for reconsideration,the district court granted summary judgment for ivy hill on the remaining cause of action under the fmla on judicial estoppel grounds.macfarlan filed a motion for reconsideration of that order,which was denied on may.macfarlan timely appealed to this court.
the district court had jurisdiction of macfarlan suit pursuant to and a.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment.jacobs constructors,nps energy,cir.we therefore must undertake the same inquiry as the district court and determine whether the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions on file,and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.a material fact is one which might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.we must also view the evidence in the light most favorable to macfarlan the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.andreoli gates,cir.
macfarlan principal contention is that the district court erroneously invoked the doctrine of judicial estoppel against him when it granted summary judgment to ivy hill on macfarlan fmla claim.macfarlan claimed in the district court that ivy violated a,which makes it unlawful for any employer to interfer
