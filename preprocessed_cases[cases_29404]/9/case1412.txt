bring this interlocutory appeal from the february,opinion and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,judge,denying defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and their motion for summary judgment.plaintiff complaint alleges that defendants violated his liberty interests and procedural due process rights conferred by and protected by the due process clause.defendants argued below that plaintiff failed to state a cause of action,and that they are entitled to qualified immunity since no reasonable official could have known that the acts alleged by plaintiff constituted violations of clearly established rights.on appeal,defendants once again assert that plaintiff has failed to state a claim and that they are entitled to qualified immunity.for the reasons set forth below,we reject defendants arguments and affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
rene tellier was an inmate at the metropolitan correctional center mcc from november,until april,when he was transferred to the federal correction institution at otisville,new york.prior to his transfer to mcc,which occurred following his arraignment on federal racketeering charges,tellier was incarcerated at attica state prison,where he was serving a sentence of two to six years for commercial burglary.mcc is a federal facility and defendants are all federally employed prison officials who are,or were,working at mcc while tellier was confined there 
it is undisputed that upon tellier arrival at mcc,he was placed in a special housing unit shu because he was considered an escape risk.the exact amount of time tellier spent in shu is a matter of minor dispute.both parties below,as well as the district court,calculated the time at days,but on appeal the time period cited by both parties indicates a confinement of days.tellier alleges that he was neither initially informed of the reason for his placement in shu,nor was he subsequently permitted to be heard regarding his continued confinement there.
because this is an appeal from the denial of a summary judgment motion,we must take the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see bedoya coughlin,cir.according to tellier,conditions in the shu differ markedly from those in the general population.inmates in the shu are confined to their cells for hours per day as opposed to six to seven hours per day,and they also have less access to the telephone,showers,recreation,the law library and certain educational and rehabilitative programs than do inmates in the general population.further,unlike inmates in the general population,tellier was handcuffed whenever he was removed from his cell and was allowed no privacy while using the toilet.
tellier filed a pro se complaint in this action on april,seeking compensatory and other damages totaling per day from each defendant for his or her respective role in tellier continued confinement in the shu.tellier maintains that under section,he was entitled to receive an administrative detention order within hours of his placement in shu,which he never received.section b provides 
b administrative detention order detailing reasons for placement.the warden shall prepare an administrative detention order detailing the reasons for placing an inmate in administrative detention,with a copy given to the inmate,provided institutional security is not compromised thereby.staff shall deliver this order to the inmate within hours of the inmate placement in administrative detention,unless this delivery is precluded by exceptional circumstances.an order is not necessary for an inmate placed in administrative detention when this placement is a direct result of the inmate holdover status.
b.tellier also alleges that,pursuant to section c,defendants were required to conduct periodic hearings before a segregation review official sro to evaluate his continued confinement in the shu,but that defendants never conducted these hearings.section c provides 
c review of inmates housed in administrative detention.except as otherwise provided in paragraphs c and c of this section,the segregation review official will review the status of inmates housed in administrative detention.the sro shall conduct a record review within three work days of the inmate placement in administrative detention and shall hold a hearing and formally review the status of each inmate who spends seven continuous days in administrative detention,and thereafter shall review these cases on the record in the inmate absence each week and shall hold a hearing and review these cases formally at least every days.the inmate appears before the sro at the hearing unless the inmate waives the right to appear.a waiver may be in writing,signed by the inmate,or if the inmate refuses to sign a waiver,it shall be shown by a memorandum signed by staff and witnessed by a second staff member indicating the inmate refusal to appear at the hearing.staff shall conduct a psychiatric or psychological assessment,including a personal interview,when administrative detention continues beyond days.the assessment,submitted to the sro in a written report,shall address the inmate adjustment to surroundings and the threat the inmate poses to self,staff and other inmates.staff shall conduct a similar psychiatric or psychological assessment and report at subsequent intervals should detention continue for this extended period.administrative detention is to be used only for short periods of time except where an inmate needs protection see,or where there are exceptional circumstances,ordinarily tied to security or complex investigative concerns.an inmate may be kept in administrative detention for longer term protection only if the need for such protection is documented by the sro.provided institutional security is not compromised,the inmate shall receive at each formal review a written copy of the sro decision and the basis for this finding.the sro shall release an inmate from administrative detention when reasons for placement cease to exist.
c.tellier maintains that he never received an administrative detention order or any of the periodic hearings required by section c.
tellier complaint states that he learned of the required hearings specified in section sometime in,and he asked defendant gibson why he had not received such a hearing.according to tellier,gibson responded that hearings regarding tellier status in the shu had been conducted informally and outside tellier presence.
tellier alleges that sometime after this conversation,defendants slipped two special housing review forms under his cell door.tellier claims that these forms falsely documented hearings in march and april of before the sro concerning his confinement in the shu.
tellier further contends that on may,defendants brought him before the sro.while he was in the office,the sro made a brief telephone call and then marked continue in special housing on his form.the sro never told him why he was in shu and denied him the opportunity to present evidence or be heard.tellier alleges that this procedure occurred several times over the following months.he also alleges that at no time was there a psychiatric or psychological assessment conducted by defendants as required in section c.
tellier complaint also contains allegations that he informed each defendant personally of what he considered to be ongoing violations of his statutory rights under section and his constitutional rights under the due process clause.tellier maintains that each of these defendants personally refused to provide hearings and ignored his due process rights.
on november,defendants filed an answer to tellier complaint.defendants answer denied the allegations made in tellier complaint,and it asserted numerous defenses,including failure to state a claim,lack of personal involvement by the defendants,and qualified immunity.on july,defendants filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment pursuant to rules b,b and of the federal rules of civil procedure.along with this motion,defendants submitted affidavits attesting to their efforts to comply with section and further stating their beliefs that their conduct did not violate any clearly established constitutional right.defendants motion was referred to magistrate judge leonard bernikow for a report and recommendation pursuant to b b.
on august,magistrate judge bernikow issued his report and recommendation.magistrate judge bernikow construed tellier complaint as one under bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d,based on violations of and his procedural due process rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment magistrate judge bernikow concluded that defendants motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss should be denied,except with regard to sharon fields,who magistrate judge bernikow found was not personally implicated by tellier complaint.magistrate judge bernikow based this recommendation on his conclusion that section creates a protectable liberty interest under the supreme court decisions in hewitt helms,d,and sandin conner,d defendants had not submitted any evidence that section requirements were met,and there was an issue of fact as to whether some of tellier shu review forms had been falsified and defendants had not adequately established that they were entitled to qualified immunity.
tellier stated in a september,letter to the court that he had no objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation and by order dated october,judge wood granted summary judgment with respect to sharon fields.in this same order,judge wood also granted tellier motion for leave to amend his complaint and therefore dismissed defendants motion for summary judgment as moot.on november,tellier wrote to the court requesting that he be allowed to withdraw his request for leave to file a proposed amended complaint and that the magistrate judge original report and recommendation be reinstated.the district court granted this motion and defendants submitted their objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation on december.
defendants raised four primary objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation the magistrate judge improperly relied on state law cases in determining whether section created a protectable liberty interest the supreme court decision in sandin required that defendants motion to dismiss be granted because the confinement in shu was not atypical and significant tellier received all the process he was due and the magistrate judge improperly rejected defendants qualified immunity defense because tellier failed to allege a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.by opinion and order filed february,judge wood adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and denied defendants motion for summary judgment.see tellier scott,d.
in ruling on defendants objections,the district court determined that this court had not expressly ruled on whether gives rise to a liberty interest on the part of federal prisoners.id.at.the court then noted that this court has repeatedly held that state prisoners have a liberty interest in remaining free from administrative confinement where prison regulations specify certain conditions that must be met to permit a prisoner placement in such confinement.id.citing soto walker,cir lowrance achtyl,cir russell coughlin,cir gittens lefevre,cir.although noting that other courts had ruled that section does not create a liberty interest,see id.citing cases,the district court ruled that these decisions were inapposite because they relied on reasoning that was at odds with the supreme court precedent and because they all involved relatively short periods of confinement.see id.at.the district court therefore concluded that defendants had not provided adequate grounds for holding as a matter of law that does not create a protected liberty interest in remaining free from administrative confinement.id.at.
the district court also rejected the defendants challenge under sandin.after finding that tellier had alleged a protectable liberty interest,the court noted that sandin atypical and significant hardship analysis involved a factual inquiry that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment.id.at.
finally,the district court rejected defendants qualified immunity defense.the district court reiterated its conclusion that in this circuit it was clearly established at the time the events in question occurred that regulations like create a liberty interest in remaining free of administrative segregation.id.at.the court also adopted the reasoning of the magistrate judge,who found that there were unresolved material facts regarding whether defendants had complied with federal regulations and had afforded tellier due process in placing and maintaining him in shu.see id.specifically,the court concluded that at the present stage of the litigation there were issues of fact as to the circumstances surrounding defendants actions that precluded a legal determination of whether their actions were reasonable.see id.at.
on appeal,defendants again argue that tellier has failed to state a claim under section or the due process clause that would afford him recovery.defendants also contend that regardless of whether tellier has stated a claim,they are protected by qualified immunity since an objectively reasonable officer acting at the time of the events in question could not have known that he or she was violating a plaintiff clearly established rights.we address both of these arguments in turn.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,both parties raise arguments concerning the nature and extent of our jurisdiction in this case.as a general rule,a district court order denying a party motion for summary judgment is an interlocutory order,and,as such,is not immediately appealable.see natale town of ridgefield,cir citing.there is an exception to this rule,however,where a defendant motion for summary judgment asserts a defense of qualified immunity.see id.citing bolden alston,cir.this exception is only applicable if the district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity turns on an issue of law.mitchell forsyth,d see also salim proulx,cir genas new york dep t of correctional,cir.
as we noted in salim,the supreme court jurisprudence in the wake of mitchell has put further gloss on what issues constitute an issue of law.salim,at.the supreme court decisions in johnson jones,d,and behrens pelletier,d,establish that the issue of whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to support a finding that particular conduct occurred is not immediately appealable.behrens,at.however,the defendant assertion that he or she is entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of stipulated facts,or on the facts as stated by the plaintiff,presents a purely legal question that we have jurisdiction to review.see salim,at see also jemmott coughlin,cir.in other words,what we may not do,after johnson and behrens,is entertain an interlocutory appeal in which a defendant contends that the district court committed an error of law in ruling that the plaintiff evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue on the facts relevant to the defendant immunity defense.salim,at.
here,defendants maintain that we have jurisdiction to review the denial of their motion for summary judgment because they raise a strictly legal claim.specifically,defendants assert that they are entitled to qualified immunity because,at the time of the alleged violation,their actions as alleged by plaintiff violated no clearly established law.defendants also insist that we must concomitantly address whether plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right.
we agree with defendants that we have jurisdiction to review both of these issues,as questions of law,despite the interlocutory nature of the proceedings.in siegert gilley,the supreme court granted certiorari,d,in order to clarify the analytical structure under which a claim of qualified immunity should be addressed.it held that the indispensable threshold inquiry is whether the plaintiff asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all.siegert gilley,d.according to siegert,that decision is a necessary concomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is clearly established.id.at.the supreme court recognized that the two inquiries combined are determinative of whether qualified immunity exists.
in subsequent cases in which the court found that qualified immunity did exist because the right was not clearly established,the court consistently addressed the constitutional issue first.see conn gabbert,d see also wilson layne,d.the supreme court explained that even if qualified immunity does exist,there must still be some decision about the state of constitutional law.see sacramento lewis,d.hence,a fortiori,where a court concludes that qualified immunity does not exist because a right was clearly established,at the time of the alleged acts,it is necessary for the court to first articulate that right.
although we recently relied solely on the lack of clearly established law to dismiss an action on qualified immunity grounds,we did not do so without scrupulously examining the circumstances of the case,in light of the supreme court guidance.see horne coughlin,cir,adhered to on reh g,as amended,cert.denied,d.we found that in some situations where the lack of clearly established law would supply a sufficient ground for decision,avoiding the constitutional question was the better approach.horne,at.
moreover,we noted that where the challenged conduct is particularly egregious,or where it is likely that the constitutional question would escape review over a lengthy period,or where deciding the constitutional issue plays a role in supporting the action taken by the court,avoidance would contravene the supreme court guidance in siegert and its progeny.horne,at.horne supports the need to address the constitutional question when a court finds that qualified immunity does not exist because the right asserted is clearly established.in that instance,and in this case the constitutional inquiry is inextricably bound to the resolution of whether qualified immunity exists.we also note that the challenged conduct here is particularly egregious.accordingly,we find that it is proper for us to reach the merits of the constitutional question in this case.
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision denying a government official motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,taking as true the factual allegations of the party,and drawing all inferences from the underlying facts in appellee favor.natale town of ridgefield,cir quoting mclaughlin,cir.
defendants claims of qualified immunity 
whether plaintiff alleges violation of a constitutionally protected section create a protectable liberty interest 
in order to determine whether tellier has stated a claim for procedural due process violations we must determine whether the plaintiff had a protected liberty interest in not being confined and,if so,whether the deprivation of that liberty interest occurred without due process of law.sealey giltner,cir quoting bedoya,at.as we have recognized previously,after the supreme court decision in sandin,our determination of whether the plaintiff had a protected liberty interest in not being confined also requires a analysis.id.citing frazier coughlin,cir per curiam as a result of sandin,a prisoner has a liberty interest only if the deprivation is atypical and significant and the state has created the liberty interest by statute or regulation.id.at.
first,we examine whether the alleged deprivation was atypical and significant.we have previously held that whether a plaintiff confinement satisfies the atypical and significant hardship requirement involves factual determinations.see miller,at.here,tellier has alleged a confinement of days under conditions that differ markedly from those in the general population,and we can not conclude as a matter of law that this confinement was not atypical and significant.see wright coughlin,cir vacating and remanding grant of summary judgment where district court failed to consider length and conditions of segregated confinement.thus,defendants can not support their motion to dismiss on this issue.
second,we must examine whether the state has created a liberty interest by statute or regulation.see sealey,at.in conducting this examination,we have held that sandin abandoned the framework established in hewitt for analyzing whether a prisoner who is subjected to a disciplinary confinement had been deprived of a liberty interest.frazier,at citing sandin,at.sandin,however,rejected only the portion of hewitt stating that the use of explicitly mandatory language,in connection with the establishment of specified substantive predicates to limit discretion,forces a conclusion that the state has created a liberty interest.kentucky of corrections thompson,d quoting hewitt,at.emphasis added.thus,we have construed sandin to mean that a state may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the due process clause,sandin,at.emphasis added.furthermore,we have recognized that nothing in the sandin decision indicates that the court intended to create a per se blanket rule that disciplinary confinement may never implicate a liberty interest.miller selsky,cir.
we note that there is some debate among courts as to whether section creates a protectable liberty interest.compare,crowder true,cir per curiam we hold that does not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest,moore ham,wl,at cir,unpublished decision plaintiff assertion that grants him a liberty interest in remaining in general prison population is not supported by the law of this jurisdiction,and awalt whalen,sections and do not create a liberty interest in release from detention which a hearing would protect,with,muhammad carlson,cir stating in dicta,prior to sandin,that section is couched in unmistakably mandatory language,and intimating that it would therefore give rise to a protectable liberty interest,and maclean secor,sections and are sufficient to confer a liberty interest here.
after conducting the hewitt sandin analysis with respect to section,we conclude that section creates a liberty interest.under hewitt,courts considering the existence of an alleged liberty interest must ascertain whether statutes or regulations require,in language of an unmistakably mandatory character,that a prisoner not suffer a particular deprivation absent specified predicates.welch bartlett,cir quoting hewitt,at.we find that section contains such mandatory language and therefore creates a protectable liberty interest in not being confined.
in reviewing the text of section,we find its text replete with words such as shall,unless,and only.although the mere use of these words is neither dispositive nor talismanic,it supports plaintiff argument that the bureau of prisons intended to guide the decision making power of prison officials by requiring that certain prerequisites be met and certain procedures be followed whenever a prisoner was subject to segregated housing.this conclusion is most strongly supported by the last sentence of section c,which instructs that t he sro shall release an inmate from administrative detention when reasons for placement cease to exist.c emphasis added.
defendants argue that section does not create a protectable liberty interest because the procedural protections outlined in the section are not designed to determine whether the prisoner meets any of the standards for placement in administrative detention as set forth in section a.appellants reply br.at.rather,defendants argue that the procedure is designed to monitor the condition and adjustment of the prisoner in administrative detention.id.
defendants contend that the mandatory language used in section might indeed require certain hearings and reviews,but that these hearings and reviews concern the mental and physical condition of the inmate,not the decision to place or keep him in detention.appellants reply br.at.they argue that these hearings are such that they can not reach a result that requires a prisoner be returned to the population,and therefore that plaintiff has no liberty interest in receiving such hearings.
in fine,defendants argue that the warden decision regarding a prisoner placement in shu is discretionary.defendants further argue that the discretion that the warden has in electing to place a prisoner in administrative detention affords him or her the discretion to continue a prisoner segregation.appellants br.at.as such,under the court decisions in olim wakinekona,d,and wolff mcdonnell,d,the prisoner would have no liberty interest in the hearings and reviews described in section because the warden always has the discretion to have a prisoner housed in a segregated unit.olim,at.if the decisionmaker is not required to base its decisions on objective and defined criteria,but instead can deny the requested relief for any constitutionally permissible reason or for no reason at all,the state has not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.citation omitted quoting connecticut bd.of pardons dumschat,d.
we agree with defendants that the warden initial decision to place a prisoner in shu is,in applicable cases,an entirely discretionary decision.because the regulation at issue clearly indicates that the warden decision to place a prisoner in shu is discretionary as long as certain predicates are satisfied,see a,a prisoner has no protected liberty interest that is violated when the warden removes him or her from the general population 
we can not,however,take the leap urged upon us by defendants.whatever discretion the warden might have in placing a prisoner in shu,the discretion surrounding this decision is not boundless and continuing.while subsection a of section may be read to afford the warden discretion in placing a prisoner in shu,subsection c clearly provides for certain hearings and reviews that constrain the warden discretion in maintaining a prisoner in shu and further commands that t he sro shall release an inmate from administrative detention when reasons for placement cease to exist.c.
we also reject defendants argument that the procedures in section are not linked to the duration of a prisoner term in shu,or defendants related contention that section does not contain mandatory language related to placement or continued confinement.see appellants br.at.section explicitly states that a dministrative detention is to be used only for short periods of time or where there are exceptional circumstances,ordinarily tied to security or complex investigative concerns.c.while it is undisputed that plaintiff placement in shu was occasioned by security concerns after he allegedly attempted escape on two occasions,and thus that his case may be one of those in which longer periods in shu is permitted,the next sentence of the regulation is designed to limit even longer stays.the regulation provides that a n inmate may be kept in administrative detention for longer term protection only if the need for such protection is documented by the sro.c.
in context,we read this directive,alongside section required personal interviews,written reports,and psychiatric or psychological assessments,to mean that section procedures are designed to ensure that a prisoner is kept in shu for no longer than is necessary.we therefore can not accept defendants reading of the regulation as contemplating simply the monitor ing of an inmate such monitoring would amount to a needless exercise were it not designed to provide officials with information to evaluate whether continued segregation was warranted.section c mandates that the sro release a prisoner from segregated housing when the reasons for confinement cease to exist we fail to see how this directive is infused with even a modicum of discretion.
defendants also argue that tellier is mistaken in relying on certain provisions in section as preconditions for confinement,appellants br.at citing appellee br.at,because such a focus is mistakenly premised on hewitt approach to analyzing liberty interests later abandoned by sandin.we disagree with defendants articulation of the effect of sandin on cases involving prisoners and prison regulations.defendants argue that sandin rejected the portion of hewitt that emphasized examination of regulations for mandatory language and substantive predicates,sandin,at,in order to determine whether a regulation created a protected liberty interest.as we have stated in previous cases,we do not read sandin to have so radically undone the tenets of hewitt.see sealey,at noting that even after sandin,courts must determine whether the state has created a liberty interest by statute or regulation.while the supreme court noted that sandin represented an abandonment of hewitt methodology,it also carefully noted that it was not overruling hewitt and declared that the court was returning to the principles set out in wolff and meachum fano.see sandin,at.
in returning to the approach used in wolff and meachum,the supreme court shifted the emphasis of the inquiry from the strict language of the statute to an analysis of the right safeguarded by the statute.read together,sandin,wolff,and meachum,all support the proposition that a statute or regulation which involves right s,wolff,at,creates a protectable liberty interest when an official failure to adhere to the statute results in an atypical,significant deprivation,sandin,at,of real substance,wolff,at,and not simply ephemeral and insubstantial violations.meachum,at.
in this case,we find that section contains mandatory language that gives rise to a right,and since we agree with the district court that sandin requires a factual determination regarding the nature of tellier confinement,defendants motion to dismiss was properly denied at this point in the litigation.see miller,at stating that district courts must examine the circumstances of a confinement to determine whether that confinement affected a liberty interest.
whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established 
defendants also contend that regardless of whether section creates a liberty interest,they are entitled to qualified immunity.under the discretionary function immunity,officials are immune from suits for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.even in cases where such rights are clearly established,qualified immunity protects a government official if it was objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his acts did not violate those rights.russell coughlin,cir quoting robison via,cir.
because qualified immunity is an affirmative defense,however,the defendants bear the burden of showing that the challenged act was objectively reasonable in light of the law existing at that time.varrone bilotti,cir citing harlow,at.furthermore,qualified immunity does not act as a shield for individuals who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d see also catanzaro weiden,cir.we therefore must examine whether defendants have met their required burden of demonstrating the nonexistence of a clearly established right or that it was reasonable,as a matter of law,for defendants to take the actions that plaintiff alleges they took.
to determine whether tellier liberty interest was clearly established,we must look to the state of the law as it existed between and,when the events in question allegedly occurred.see anderson,at.for a right to be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,it is sufficient if decisions of the supreme court or of the appropriate circuit have defined the contours of the right with reasonable specificity.russell,at citing francis coughlin,cir see also anderson,at.furthermore,a law is considered clearly established so long as this circuit decisions clearly foreshadow a particular ruling on the issue.varrone,at quoting shabazz coughlin,cir.thus,the absence of a decision by this court or the supreme court directly addressing the right at issue will not preclude a finding that the law was clearly established,shabazz,at,at the time of the alleged violation.
applying these principles to the regulation at issue here,section,we conclude that tellier procedural due process rights in defendants adhering to the regulatio
