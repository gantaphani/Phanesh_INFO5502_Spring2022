factual background 
we review the facts in the light most agreeable to plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,mulero rodr√≠guez ponte,cir,and limit our discussion to those facts relevant on appeal.
national is a public utility company that sells and distributes natural gas to residential,commercial,and industrial customers.as part of its business,national maintains a large underground gas distribution system,which from time to time leaks.these leaks pose a significant public safety hazard,and the massachusetts department of public utilities requires national to dispatch a trained employee to any reported leak within sixty minutes.
since december,espinal has worked as a customer meter service technician cmst at national.he is currently a senior technician at the company beverly,massachusetts location beverly yard.as a cmst,espinal is responsible for investigating reported gas leaks while,during his regularly scheduled hours additionally,one out of every four weeks,espinal is.while,espinal must respond to gas leak pages from midnight to and is the only beverly yard employee scheduled to do so during these hours.

the events giving rise to espinal discrimination claims began on july,when a dispatcher mistakenly paged espinal while he was not.espinal suspected that another cmst had gone unpunished for failing to answer a gas leak page,and asked his union to obtain the order details,dispatch records for that night.
the union requested the order details from national on july,to investigate the potential subject of a grievance,and received them on august.on december,after reviewing the records,the union informed national that a missed page had gone unpunished,and national initiated a full investigation 
national did not complete its investigation until october,approximately ten months after receiving the email from the union.espinal alleges that this delay was caused by national discriminatory purposes,while the company submits it was attributable to scheduling conflicts,illnesses,and other exigencies,including a union rule requiring a showing of good cause for any disciplinary action.on the basis of the records and information collected,national determined that daniel racki a white cmst had missed the july page.on november,racki received a suspension.
on september,espinal filed a charge of discrimination alleging disparate treatment with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad.at a subsequent union meeting in november,held off national premises and after company hours,espinal learned of his mcad filing and of racki suspension,and they gave plaintiff a rough night.espinal alleges that his,most of whom are white,called him a rat and a spic and accused him of outing racki.following the meeting,national supervisors met with espinal to discuss these events.espinal refused to disclose the names of his harassers and,upon further questioning,walked out of the meeting entirely.

disparate treatment 
in cases,plaintiffs bear the ultimate burden of proving that they were the victims of intentional discrimination.udo tomes,cir citing mary honor ctr.hicks.where,as here,a plaintiff is unable to offer direct proof of their employers discriminatory animus we allocate the burden of producing evidence according to the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green.id.
we recently set out the mcdonnell douglas framework at length in cham station operators,cir,and need not do so again here.we bypass whether espinal established a prima facie case of discrimination.additionally,the parties do not dispute that national furnished a facially legitimate,justification for disciplining espinal namely,his failure to respond to the september page.accordingly,we proceed directly to espinal burden at the third stage of mcdonnell douglas.
to avoid summary judgment at the third stage in the mcdonnell douglas framework,the plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence to support two findings that the employer articulated reason for the disciplinary action is a pretext,and that the true reason is discriminatory.udo,at citing smith stratus computer,cir see also straughn delta air lines,cir.while these findings are distinct,the same evidence may be used to demonstrate both.however,taken together,this evidence must be sufficient to overcome the ultimate burden of persuading the court that plaintiff has been the victim of intentional discrimination.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,see also kosereis rhode island,cir.
