karpova travels to iraq 
in early the project hoped to bring attention to the fact that the united states allegedly had bombed civilian infrastructure in iraq during the gulf war.the method the project chose to get public attention was to send to these sites to act as human shields.the presence of civilians at the sites,it was hoped,would publicize the threat to them were the united states to begin a bombing campaign,and perhaps deter the united states from acting.plaintiff karpova joined this group and sent a letter to supporters indicating her plans to travel to iraq in february as a member of the project.she requested supporters to send small donations to help finance her travel expenses.on february,she arrived in iraq and remained there until march.karpova did not obtain a license that might have authorized her,despite the economic sanctions,to engage in transactions involving iraq.while there,plaintiff acted as a preemptive human shield.although karpova left the country before the united states bombing campaign actually began,appellant was near an oil refinery while in iraq.karpova also went on guided tours in basra and baghdad,visited hospitals and schools,and spent time looking,listening,talking,and writing.her writing took the form of four letters sent back to america that were printed in installments by the jersey journal.the foreign assets control office learned of karpova unauthorized trip from press accounts.
agency response 
on march,the foreign assets control office sent a letter to plaintiff requiring that she provide the department of the treasury with a detailed written report concerning her trip to iraq,so that it could ascertain whether she had violated the iraqi sanctions regulations.this requirement to furnish information specifically required karpova to provide the dates of her travel to iraq,reason for her trip,and a detailed itemization of all transactions in which she engaged in connection with her trip.plaintiff responded on april,with a lengthy letter,which included the dates and various reasons for her trip,but failed to provide a detailed itemization of all transactions.instead,she simply asserted that all of her transactions were taken care of by an organization called the peace,friendship,and solidarity organization,and thus that she was not required to spend any money during her days in iraq.
plaintiff did not provide any proof to support her statements despite the agency request that she provide a copy of any receipts or records associated with her expenditures in iraq.the agency replied on june,by sending karpova a prepenalty notice stating she had violated the iraqi sanctions regulations by exporting her services to iraq and engaging in unauthorized transactions while there.the prepenalty notice cited the following specific violations attempting to collect funds for travel expenses within iraq,departing jordan for iraq and arriving in iraq,providing ministerial services,serving as a freelance journalist,providing services to the government of iraq by shielding iraqi government infrastructure from possible united states military action,and engaging in transactions,including the purchase of food.the prepenalty notice proposed a penalty of,and it gave karpova an opportunity to submit a written response.the prepenalty notice requested that karpova explain why the penalty should not be issued or why,if issued,it should be reduced.
karpova answered this request on august,with a letter from her lawyer arguing that she had not provided services to any agency of the iraqi government.the letter contended that the regulatory scheme under the iraqi sanctions regulations violated karpova due process rights and exceeded the authority of the executive branch,and that the penalty violated karpova first and fifth amendment rights.she did not dispute that she had engaged in transactions related to travel in iraq,but she incorporated by reference her previous letter as something for the foreign assets control office to consider in determining the appropriate penalty.
on march,the agency sent karpova a penalty notice.the penalty notice ruled that she had violated the iraqi sanctions regulations by engaging in prohibited transactions relating to iraq,as detailed in the prepenalty notice.it explained that karpova response had not presented any new facts or explanations to refute the foreign assets control office charges that karpova violated the regulations.the fine was reduced from to in light of the fact that plaintiff had provided a written response to the prepenalty notice and because it was her first offense.
