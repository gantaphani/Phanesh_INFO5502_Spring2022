plaintiffs,a group of practicing muslims who are or were inmates at the westchester county jail,sued the westchester county department of corrections the county and three of its employees collectively,defendants for their refusal to provide halal meat to muslim inmates,allegedly in violation of the first,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.prior to the initiation of plaintiffs suits,defendants served halal meat to muslim inmates only twice a year by contrast,they provided kosher meat to jewish inmates four to five times a week.although defendants initially rebuffed plaintiffs demand that muslim inmates be given halal or kosher meat with the same frequency as jewish inmates,they ultimately agreed to do so in exchange for the dismissal of the lawsuits.the parties memorialized this agreement in an order of settlement,release and stipulation of discontinuance the order of settlement,which the district court berman,judge entered on march.subsequently,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees.
defendants appealed from the award of attorneys fees,claiming that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties under buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,and hence were not entitled to attorneys fees,and that,alternatively,the district court abused its discretion in determining the amount of fees to be awarded.plaintiffs,claiming that the district court erred in applying the fee cap of the prison litigation reform act plra,d,in this case,because the order of settlement expressly allowed plaintiffs to move for attorneys fees and fee cap does not apply to suits brought by prisoners who are released subsequent to the filing of a suit.we reject all three of these claims,and affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety.we also remand the matter to the district court to consider plaintiffs request for fees accrued in connection with this appeal.
background 
a.the plaintiffs allegations 
plaintiffs alleged that for over twenty years,the county violated the constitutional rights of muslim inmates by serving them meat that was haram in violation of their beliefs as opposed to halal which is consistent with their beliefs.while the county ostensibly provided a muslim diet tray,it often included haram meat and was only occasionally consistent with muslim dietary practices.as the county supervisor of food services swore in an affidavit,the county food vendor did not serve halal meat in any of the jail facilities,although muslim inmates did receive halal meat on two muslim holidays during the year.by contrast,the county accommodated jewish inmates religious beliefs by serving them kosher meat approximately four or five times a week.while the kosher meat prepared regularly for jewish inmates was halal and thus would have satisfied the muslim inmates restrictions,the county refused to include it on the muslim diet tray.
these practices persisted despite years of protests and grievances by muslim inmates and by the jail muslim chaplain.in response to these complaints,plaintiffs alleged,the county systematic practice was either to refuse an inmate request to pursue the grievance process,to issue the same stock response,or to refuse to change in denying inmate grievances,the county stated plainly that halal is not provided in this facility at this time.
making these allegations,plaintiff henry perez filed a complaint pro se against the county on september,and sought injunctive and monetary relief pursuant to.he alleged that the county conduct violated his first amendment right to free exercise of religion,his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,and his fourteenth amendment right to due process and equal protection.subsequently,twelve other pro se inmates filed nearly identical complaints by order dated november,the district court consolidated all actions filed prior to that date.
after filing their complaints,ten of the plaintiffs retained richard cohen,then of the firm akabas cohen,as pro bono counsel.after akabas cohen dissolved,cohen joined fox rothschild fox,and thereafter,each of the ten retained fox as substitute pro bono counsel.
b.the defendants initial responses to the lawsuits 
in february,cohen met with representatives of the defendants,who offered to change the muslim diet only to the extent of removing meat altogether and providing substitutes such as peanut butter.on september,the county moved,inter alia,to dismiss plaintiffs complaints.in their motion papers,defendants asserted that 
plaintiffs claims against county defendants for relief pursuant to for the denial of halal meat kosher food has sic been repeatedly rejected and simply does not amount to a violation of a constitutional right.plaintiffs have been provided with a halal diet that is consistent with their nutritional needs and religious beliefs moreover,plaintiffs equal protection claim clearly fails as county defendants provide both muslim and jewish inmates with nutritionally adequate meals that conform to their respective faith requirements 
the county also argued that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies and failed to demonstrate any facts that amounted to a constitutional violation,and that defendants were in any event entitled to qualified immunity.plaintiffs opposed the motion and for a preliminary injunction directing the county to provide either halal or kosher meat to muslim inmates with the same frequency as kosher meat was served to jewish inmates,and to refrain from putting haram meat on the muslim tray.in response to the preliminary injunction motion,the county argued that it had attempted to satisfy the concerns of plaintiffs by serving them a vegetarian diet and providing plaintiffs with kosher meals would be a significant financial burden on the county since kosher meals were more expensive than regular meals.
on april,the district court granted in part and denied in part the county motion to dismiss,and denied plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction without prejudice.perez westchester county dep t of,civ,wl,dist.lexis.specifically,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs eighth amendment claims,but denied the county motion as to the first and fourteenth amendment claims.in reaching this decision,the district court commented on the strength of plaintiffs claims,noting,for example,that the heart of the matter is plaintiffs seemingly unrefuted allegation that defendants refuse to offer muslim inmates the same kosher meat provided to jewish prisoners,and that plaintiffs were relatively easily able to surmount defendant motion to dismiss the equal protection claims.
as for the preliminary injunction,the district court found that plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury and might succeed on the merits because they may be able to show that there is disparate treatment among muslim and jewish inmates.but the district court found that disputed issues of fact existed regarding the alleged financial burden that serving halal or kosher meat to muslim inmates would place on the county.because preliminary injunctions should not be decided on the basis of affidavits when disputed issues of fact exist,the district court found that an evidentiary hearing was required.it therefore dismissed the preliminary injunction motion without prejudice,explicitly allowing the plaintiffs to reinstate their application if and when plaintiffs request a hearing on the injunction the merits.
settlement negotiations and the settlement agreement 
in its april order,the district court also directed the parties to appear at a conference with principals or authority before the court ten days later.at the conference,judge berman actively urged settlement,and made it clear that he felt the law was on plaintiffs side.when the county offered to provide halal meat to muslim inmates once a week and not provide any money in damages an offer plaintiffs counsel cohen analogized to allowing rosa parks to sit at the front of the bus on mondays only,judge berman opined that,from a settlement perspective,it did sound like much of a settlement to propose once a week for inmates to have kosher meals when jewish inmates receive kosher meals or times a week.the county commented that it obvious that plaintiffs are not going to accept any form of settlement unless we give them halal meat the same number of times that the jewish inmates get kosher meat,to which judge berman responded,remind me again why that should be the case judge berman extensively probed the county arguments that providing halal meat as often as it provided kosher meat would be either a cost problem or a security threat,warning that the county estimated expense of a year did sound as if it supported a good faith argument and making it clear that the county security argument seemed no more plausible.at the close of the conference,judge berman set an unusually short time frame for discovery and a trial date just five months away.he explained 
i am actually going to give you a little less time because the issues are very simple and i think the basic issues are known t his could be more obvious and could be more simple as to what is going on here and the question is whether these muslim inmates are entitled to be treated like the jewish inmates.it really that simple.i am not saying i know the answer to that question and even if i come up with an answer somebody may think it wrong.but that is the whole story here.
so,frankly,i think we have been wasting a lot of time already because i would have thought this was such an obvious case to be resolved 
judge berman conducted another settlement conference on july,at which the defendants proposed that instead of offering halal meat once a week,they would serve halal meat with the same frequency as kosher meat to the jewish inmates.judge berman commented that that where the law would bring you,but that another story,and ordered cohen to check with the ten plaintiffs who were no longer incarcerated to see if they would accept this relief or wanted to pursue money damages after the county expressed opposition to entering a consent decree,judge berman acknowledged that even the phrase consent decree is pejorative in some contexts,and discussed other ways to memorialize the agreement and guarantee to the plaintiffs that the county would comply with the settlement.
on march,the parties entered a settlement,release,and stipulation of discontinuance,which recited the terms of the agreement.pursuant to the agreement,the county agreed to provide all present and future muslim inmates of the westchester county jail who request a halal diet with halal meat with the same frequency as kosher meat is served to jewish inmates requesting the kosher diet.the county made this change in contemplation of settling the lawsuit and in consideration of plaintiffs discontinuing their actions.the settlement did not constitute an admission of liability.while the agreement expressly indicated that it was not a consent decree,the dismissal of the lawsuits only took effect u pon the court approval and entry of this stipulation and order.as for attorneys fees,the settlement agreement provided that plaintiffs expressly reserved the right to file for attorneys fees and that the county had the right to oppose such a motion.
the district court reviewed and revised the settlement agreement with the parties present.judge berman made three changes to the document that the parties had presented to the court first,he amended the caption of the document to reflect that it was an order of settlement.second,where the settlement agreement provided that plaintiffs retained the right to bring an action if the county failed to comply with the settlement and that plaintiffs are permitted to request referral of those claims to judge richard berman,he added that t his court retains discretion to accept any such case s as may be related.third,he instructed the clerk to close the case,and the settlement.
d.the district court judgment on attorneys fees 
following the settlement agreement,plaintiffs counsel,cohen,filed an application for attorneys fees pursuant to b in the amount of.cohen first argued that plaintiffs were prevailing parties because the settlement materially altered the legal relationship between the parties and the settlement had sufficient judicial imprimatur to warrant attorneys fees under b.second,he argued that the plra fee cap should not apply,both because the order of settlement allowed the plaintiffs to move for attorneys fees outside the cap,and because the cap does not apply to former prisoners who are no longer incarcerated.third,he argued that the fees applied for were reasonable,particularly in light of the fact that counsel was not seeking approximately in fees for legal services performed before cohen joined fox,costs,and fees for filing the fee application fees on fees.
defendants contested each of these arguments.first,they asserted that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because the county change of conduct was voluntary and the legal relationship between the parties was not altered,and that there was insufficient judicial imprimatur because the district court did not retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement,the settlement agreement was not a consent decree,and the district court had closed the case.next,assuming that plaintiffs were entitled to fees,the county argued that the plra fee cap should apply,as it covers all lawsuits that are filed by a prisoner,not just those that are completed while the plaintiffs are still incarcerated.lastly,the county argued that the hours that fox rothschild claimed were excessive and unreasonable and that many of the fees sought were redundant,duplicative,or otherwise unwarranted.
on july,the district court awarded fox fees in the amount of.the court held that plaintiffs were prevailing parties because the order of settlement materially altered the parties legal relationship and there was ample evidence of judicial imprimatur as the court denied the motion to dismiss,held several settlement conferences,participated in an effort to resolve contested issues,and then reviewed,revised,and the settlement.the district court found that the language of the plra cap,which refers to any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,d,limited fox fees because the plaintiffs were prisoners at the time of filing.then,after reviewing the fee application,the court held that the number of hours billed was reasonable.based on the fee cap,the district court reduced the requested hourly rates to per hour for attorneys and per hour for paralegals,and awarded fox.
defendants timely appealed,reasserting the arguments they made in their opposition to plaintiffs fee application.plaintiffs,arguing that the district court erred in applying the plra fee cap.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
whether plaintiffs are prevailing parties under buckhannon is a question of law that we review de novo.see,coal.of erie county fed.transit,cir.similarly,we review the district court interpretation of the plra fee cap provision de novo.see,united states santos,cir.the district court calculation of reasonable attorneys fees,on the other hand,will stand unless we find it to be an abuse of discretion.see,cruz local union of int l of workers,cir.
plaintiffs are prevailing parties under buckhannon 
the first issue before us is defendants argument that plaintiffs are not prevailing parties under b.i n order to be considered a prevailing party,a plaintiff must not only achieve some material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,but that change must also be judicially sanctioned.roberson giuliani,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also buckhannon,at.that is,plaintiffs are only eligible for attorneys fees if they achieve some material alteration of the legal relationship between them and their adversaries,and that change bears a judicial imprimatur.roberson,at.we find both prongs satisfied in view of the course of the litigation below.
material alteration of the legal relationship 
defendants first argument,that it began serving halal meat voluntarily and that the legal relationship between the parties was unaltered,requires little discussion.at several points during the litigation,defendants acknowledged that they did not serve halal meat to muslim inmates as often as they served kosher meat to jewish inmates and did not want to do so.indeed,their first settlement offer proposed that they serve halal meat once a week,and the county lawyer criticized plaintiffs apparent position that they would not accept any form of settlement unless the county give s them halal meat the same number of times that the jewish inmates get kosher meat.as the order of settlement explicitly states,the county only changed its conduct in contemplation of settling the lawsuits.there is thus no merit to the county contention that it changed its practices on its own and independent of the lawsuit.
more importantly,the county is now legally incapable of acting as it did before the entry of the order.the order of settlement specifically directs,inter alia,that the county shall continue to provide halal meat to muslim inmates who request a halal diet as often as it provides kosher meat to jewish inmates who request a kosher diet,and the county actions are now governed by a procedure that is an express condition of the dismissal of the lawsuits.assuming the unlikely,that defendants constitutional arguments were correct and the county was free to serve halal meat to muslim inmates less often than it served kosher meat to jewish inmates,it can not now do so without violating a court order.see kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d noting that where an order of dismissal incorporat es the terms of a settlement agreement,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order.whether the county initial decision to serve halal meat at the appropriate frequency was voluntary or not is thus inconsequential,as it can no longer freely reverse that decision.
judicial imprimatur 
defendants second contention is also unpersuasive.under buckhannon,defendants argue,only three outcomes have the requisite judicial imprimatur a judgment on the merits,a consent decree,or a judicially enforceable settlement agreement.settlements that do not explicitly provide for the retention of jurisdiction,like the one here,fall into none of these three categories,the argument continues,and therefore plaintiffs are not prevailing parties.but nothing in buckhannon or its sequelae limits judicial imprimatur to these three narrow categories,hence defendants major premise is incorrect.
the judicial imprimatur test grows out of buckhannon,in which the supreme court considered and rejected the catalyst theory that was,at the time,the law of this court and of the majority of circuits for gauging whether the prevailing parties requirement was met.see,marbley bane,cir.under the catalyst theory,a plaintiff prevailed for the purpose of provisions whenever her lawsuit had sufficient merit to withstand a motion to dismiss and brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.buckhannon,at.the supreme court held that this interpretation was inconsistent with the definition of prevailing parties when used as a term of art.id.at.instead,the court held,plaintiffs must receive some relief on the merits to be termed prevailing parties,as,for example,when they win a judgment on the merits or obtain settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in a footnote,the court added that p rivate settlements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.and federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.id.at.
although the supreme court specifically mentioned merits decisions and consent decrees,it did not suggest that one of these two conditions was necessary for a party to prevail.indeed,it referred to them as examples of sufficient outcomes.id.at.accordingly,we held in roberson that judicial action other than a judgment on the merits or a consent decree can support an award of attorneys fees,so long as such action carries with it sufficient judicial imprimatur.roberson,at.we then went on to consider the status under buckhannon of a dismissal order that did not incorporate the terms of a settlement agreement but did provide that the district court would retain jurisdiction for enforcement purposes.id.at.in examining this question,we looked to kokkonen,in which the supreme court held that a federal district court could not exercise jurisdiction over the enforcement of a settlement agreement where its order of dismissal neither incorporated the terms of the settlement agreement nor included a provision retaining jurisdiction.but the court stated quite clearly that a district court could exercise jurisdiction in the two scenarios.as the court wrote 
we have recognized inherent authority to appoint counsel to investigate and prosecute violation of a court order.but the only order here was that the suit be dismissed,a disposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement.the situation would be quite different if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.in that event,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.
kokkonen,at.internal citations omitted 
roberson dealt with the first hypothetical situation discussed in kokkonen an order of dismissal retaining jurisdiction over a settlement agreement,but not otherwise referencing its terms.we noted that buckhannon had cited this portion of kokkonen approvingly,and had reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement could exist where the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.buckhannon,at.see roberson,at.we went on to state that 
v iewed in the light of kokkonen,the district court retention of jurisdiction in this case is not significantly different from a consent decree and entails a level of judicial sanction sufficient to support an award of attorney fees.first,despite the district court statements that it had not specifically reviewed or approved the terms of the settlement agreement,the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.under kokkonen,when the district court retained jurisdiction,it necessarily made compliance with the terms of the agreement a part of its order so that a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order.further,because the court has the general responsibility to ensure that its orders are fair and lawful,it retains some responsibility over the terms of a settlement agreement as the parties obligation to comply with the agreement was made a part of its order.
id.at citation omitted.we held that,as the fourth circuit had previously also concluded,a court responsibility to ensure that its orders are fair and lawful stamps an agreement that is made part of an order with judicial imprimatur.id.at quoting smyth rivero,cir.such ongoing inherent authority made orders of dismissal in which the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce the underlying settlement agreement indistinguishable from consent decrees for the purposes of buckhannon.as a result,we concluded that the roberson plaintiffs were entitled to seek fees.id.at.
we have never squarely considered the second kokkonen scenario,that of an order of dismissal that explicitly incorporates the terms of a settlement,as does the order of settlement before us today.but the logic of roberson suggests that such orders must satisfy buckhannon.at the end of a footnote in torres walker,cir,however,we stated in dicta that buckhannon requires not only the physical incorporation of the settlement in a district court order but also some evidence that a district court intended to place its judicial imprimatur on the settlement.id.at emphasis added.whatever the significance of this remark,it is plain that,even under the torres footnote,there is ample evidence
