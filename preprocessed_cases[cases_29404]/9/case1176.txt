martin zelnik zelnik appeals from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,in favor of,fashion institute of technology,state university of new york fit,and the president of fit,joyce brown brown.zelnik brought this action to remedy alleged deprivations of the right of free speech,the right of free association,and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.the alleged deprivations were pleaded in claims made pursuant to the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and article i,sections and of the new york state constitution.a claim of defamation also was alleged,pursuant to new york state law,but was later voluntarily withdrawn by zelnik.following for summary judgment,the district court granted the motion of the and dismissed the complaint.the district court determined that zelnik could not establish that he had suffered an adverse employment action,an element of his prima facie case,as he was unable to demonstrate the loss of a benefit resulting from fit retaliatory failure to afford him professor emeritus status.the district court also found that no reasonable could have determined that the conduct of brown constituted harassment of the type that would have deterred a reasonable person from exercising his free speech rights.the district court dismissal of zelnik first amendment claim for failure to demonstrate retaliation by adverse employment action is the only ruling challenged on appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
zelnik is a retired faculty member of the fashion institute of technology fit.fit,located in new york city,is a public institution of higher learning in the state university of new york suny system.fit is located in a single block on west street between seventh and eighth avenues in manhattan.brown has been fit president since june of.
zelnik was a member of the fit faculty from through december of,holding the title of professor in the interior design department at the time of his retirement.during zelnik thirty years of service at fit,he made major contributions to the interior design department and the school and served in many leadership positions.zelnik occasionally has taught classes at the school as an adjunct professor since his retirement.
zelnik is also a owner of a building located at west street between seventh and eighth avenues.this building is situated on the same block as the fit buildings.zelnik and his joint business partner of years,julius panero panero,operate their architecture and interior design practice,panzel development associates panzel,there.zelnik and panero purchased the property for approximately some years ago.zelnik estimated the property to be worth approximately million in october of.
zelnik opposition to the streetscape project 
sometime in february of,zelnik,as a property owner,received a letter from a law firm representing fit,informing him that fit intended to permanently close a portion of street between seventh and eighth avenues as part of its streetscape project streetscape or the project.this project involved designs to create a environment for fit on the closed portion of street.streetscape originally was proposed in in response to a traffic accident that resulted in an injury to a student.as originally conceived,streetscape called for turning all or a substantial portion of west street into a pedestrian area mall,which would be closed to all.the original plans called for the remainder of west street to be left open for traffic,with the navigable portion of west street terminating in a and turnaround for vehicles directly outside the fit building in which the president office is located.the plans,however,never were actualized.
the design of the streetscape project was substantially similar to the original design,but the turnaround was to be placed near zelnik property at west street.although zelnik generally was in favor of the streetscape project,he and other members of the community formed an informal organization called the street block association the association to discuss fit streetscape plans and propose alternatives.
zelnik activity on behalf of the association included,inter alia,various efforts in opposition to the project.for example,after attending a july meeting with representatives from fit and other interested parties regarding streetscape,zelnik prepared and distributed a memorandum to community members outlining his concerns about various aspects of the proposed project.in that letter,zelnik raised his concern that the portion of the street remaining open for automobile traffic,culminating in a or turnaround,presented a danger to pedestrians.given as an example was the exposure of pedestrians to danger from large trucks maneuvering through the turnaround.
also in july of,zelnik wrote a letter to a new york city commissioner regarding the association opposition to streetscape.in september,zelnik wrote a letter to fit on behalf of the association,asking for additional information.in march of,zelnik business partner,panero,spoke before two community boards on behalf of himself and panzel and described the streetscape project as a disaster waiting to happen.
in june of zelnik wrote a letter to a new york state assemblyman,explaining the potential safety problems with the streetscape design and traffic flow.zelnik stated in that letter that the project would create a condition that would ultimately result in the loss of life and limb and will cause serious bodily damage to students,staff,faculty,residents and tenants of the block.
in october of,panzel,the association,and other individual petitioners collectively,the petitioners commenced an article proceeding,pursuant to the new york state civil practice law and rules,in the supreme court of the state of new york,county of new york,against the dormitory authority of the state of new york dasny and the department of transportation dot to block the execution of the project.the petitioners sought i to annul and vacate the relevant approvals granted and the environmental quality findings made by dasny and dot ii to declare the state environmental quality review negative declaration issued by dasny to be in violation of the state environmental quality review act and part iii to declare the city environmental quality review negative declaration issued by dot to be in violation of city environmental and quality review,and mayoral executive order of iv to annul and vacate,or prohibit,certain dot designations of the relevant streets and v costs and other and further relief as is just and proper.the article proceeding was eventually dismissed by the court but reinstated by the new york state appellate division,first department.the petitioners subsequently failed to pursue this litigation.
in february of zelnik gave an interview to a reporter with the village voice,a new york city weekly news publication,which was a part of a published article discussing the traffic nightmare for private businesses and residents at the block western end and fit small assault on the quality of everyday by politically powerful turns complacent new yorkers into outraged citizen warriors ready to descend on city hall.in march of,zelnik wrote a letter to the editor of the daily newspaper,newsday.in that letter,zelnik described the project as a crisis that will also end up being a potential killer.
ii.professor zelnik nomination for the status of professor emeritus 
in june of,the interior design department the department nominated zelnik for emeritus status.according to fit,emeritus status is an exceptional honor signifying excellence and one that is rarely granted.indeed,it appears that emeritus status at fit has been conferred only once in the past decade.president brown noted that emeritus status has no remuneration but brings with it only a continued association with the institution and the value that such status would confer.fit views professors with emeritus status as representative s of the college.zelnik asserts that emeritus status brings with it tangible benefits,as well as prestige,status,and respect within fit and the wider academic and professional communities.fit takes the position that emeritus status carries with it no real benefit beyond the honorific title.
zelnik claims that all faculty members in the past who i have met the requisite criteria for emeritus status and ii have either requested emeritus status,or have been nominated for emeritus status,have ultimately received emeritus status in the past twenty years,every retired full professor who met the threshold criteria for a conferment of emeritus status,and who had been nominated by his department for emeritus status,had ultimately received such status by the board of trustees.
the criteria and procedures for obtaining emeritus status were established by resolutions of the board of trustees of fit and are published in the fit faculty handbook.currently at fit,and during the time that the underlying events of this action took place,in order to satisfy the criteria to have emeritus status conferred a faculty member i must have held the rank of full professor at the time of retirement ii must have been a member of the faculty of the college for a minimum of years or a prime mover in the introduction,organization,and development of a department or an area of study within a department in the college which has been continued for a minimum of ten years and iii must have gained recognition in the college for the quality of service to fit above and beyond the requirements of the positions held.emphasis in original.neither the faculty handbook nor any other fit publication describes any specific benefits attached to professor emeritus status.
the procedures for the conferral of emeritus status,according to the board of trustees resolution dated october,are as follows.first,the retired full professor must be nominated by the department or divisional dean.next,the vice president of academic affairs must receive the nomination and recommendation from the division dean.third,the president of fit must receive the nomination and recommendation from the vice president of academic affairs.finally,the president of fit must recommend the nomination to the fit board of trustees,who then may approve the nomination.
by memorandum dated february,following zelnik retirement,professor joan melnick of the fit interior design department proposed that the department nominate zelnik for emeritus status.the department faculty unanimously voted in favor of the proposal on may.on june,frank memoli,chair of the interior design department,by memorandum,notified the fit board of trustees,brown,and dario cortes,vice president for academic affairs of fit,of the nomination and requested their concurrence and approval in the granting of the distinction.
approximately six months after brown was notified of the recommendation,nicholas politis politis,a faculty member in the department,contacted brown assistant to inquire as to the status of the nomination.politis was informed that the nomination was still on brown desk.in february,politis again inquired about the status of zelnik nomination,and politis was told that,although it was still on brown desk,it was at the bottom of the pile.in april,after a third inquiry,politis was explicitly told that the delay in reviewing appellant nomination was due to zelnik opposition to the streetscape project.
the department sent a memorandum,dated december,to brown inquiring about fit failure to respond to,or act on,zelnik nomination for emeritus status.in that memorandum,the department stated that it had been informed by brown office that the nomination was put on hold and that i t has been suggested by some that the reason for the delay is the fact that professor zelnik was among those in the community that voiced their opposition to the proposed streetscape plan,as designed.
on january,brown responded by memorandum to the faculty members of the department,stating that she had been in receipt of the december,memorandum that e meritus status is an honor,not a right that a faculty member does not achieve it automatically upon the completion of a list of stated requirements that the fact that the department voted to nominate zelnik does not require fit to endorse the nomination uncritically and that the procedures to be followed in evaluating a nomination once made have not been followed making your request to brown at the very least premature.brown then stated in that memorandum that the threshold criteria for emeritus consideration were set forth in the faculty handbook part iii,section and that i t is only on completion of those requirements that the faculty member is entitled to request nomination for the honor of the emeritus title.
while brown stated in her memorandum of january,that the failure to recommend zelnik for emeritus status was not due to his voiced opposition to streetscape and that she welcome d the opinion of every member of the fit community on every project that the college takes on,brown also stated 
professor zelnik did not simply join members of the community in opposing the streetscape plan because of fears that it posed a threat to the safety and welfare of the community rather,professor zelnik owns property at that end of street,and his interest in opposing the plan was personal,involving access to his building.professor zelnik confirmed that fact when he continued his efforts to prevent streetscape,unabated,even after the college responded to his complaints and those of his fellow property owners by enhancing the scenic aspects of that end of the street,as they had demanded,and by moving the turnaround farther east to facilitate access to their property.our concessions did nothing to stanch professor zelnik efforts to prevent streetscape.
furthermore,professor zelnik has chosen to advance those personal interests in a manner that is nothing less than dishonorable.he has falsely impugned the college motives,intentions,and reputation in a very public way,and has joined the chorus of accusers charging the c ollege with irresponsible behavior and of deliberately endangering the welfare of the elderly,the young,and the infirm in order to selfishly take real estate away from the community in pursuit of an elitist agenda 
thus,even if professor zelnik had met the threshold requirements for consideration,and even if you had obtained the necessary administrative recommendations,i could not in good conscience recommend that the college honor professor zelnik at this time.there is nothing that would require the object of professor zelnik slanderous pay honor to the individual maligning it,and i would not recommend that it do so.
brown concluded her memorandum,however,by stating that she might consider recommending zelnik nomination in the future once litigation between zelnik and fit had terminated.
on november,the department again nominated zelnik for emeritus status.this nomination followed the procedures established by the fit board of trustees and included a recommendation to the dean of the art and design division.brown,on march,responded by a memorandum to takashyi kamiya,the chair of the interior design department,in which she recognized that the nomination follow ed the procedures and criteria established by the faculty handbook and the board of trustees in that the department requested recommendations from the division dean and the vice president for academic affairs.brown explained,however,that she had considered the nomination anew and found nothing in it that would persuade her,at that time,to recommend the elevation of professor zelnik to emeritus status to fit board of trustees.brown once again stated that zelnik dishonored fit in his personal behavior in the course of his opposition to our proposed streetscape plan.brown noted in her memorandum of march that while the dean of arts and design had recommended the designation of zelnik as professor emeritus,the vice president of academic affairs had not made the same recommendation.fit does not raise this procedural omission as part of its argument on appeal.to this date,zelnik has not yet been granted the status of professor emeritus by fit.
iii.proceedings in the district court 
zelnik filed his complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on october,alleging,pursuant to,violations of his first amendment and new york state constitutional rights.following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.in a decision read from the bench on september,the district court dismissed zelnik complaint in its entirety.the district court,citing galabya new york city bd.of,cir,determined that zelnik could not prove one of the prima facie elements of a first amendment retaliation claim,to wit,an adverse employment action.according to the court,zelnik failed to demonstrate that denial of emeritus status was a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.specifically,the court found that zelnik had failed to demonstrate that he suffered a demotion or other detriment in his current terms of fit employment,as the status of professor emeritus was simply an honorific title,which carried no additional benefits.the district court,citing phillips bowen,cir,also found that zelnik failed to establish a sufficient pattern of repeated and severe incidents of workplace harassment that,taken as a whole,would probably deter an average person from the exercise of their first amendment rights.
judgment was entered on september.notice of appeal was filed on september.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

ii.definition of adverse employment action 
as this court has recently reaffirmed,
w here the plaintiff is a public employee alleging that he suffered an adverse employment action as retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights,a plaintiff must initially show that 
the speech at issue was made as a citizen on matters of public concern rather than as an employee on matters of personal interest,he or she suffered an adverse employment action,and the speech was at least a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action 
morrison johnson,cir per curiam selected alterations in morrison see also cobb pozzi,cir.for purposes of the instant appeal,have concede d that zelnik speech related to a matter of public concern and that brown decision not to grant emeritus status was linked to his speech.apparently,they also concede that zelnik is an employee,despite his status as a retiree.moreover,it is uncontested that zelnik exercised his right of speech as a private citizen and not as part of his official duties.garcetti ceballos,d holding that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.
accordingly,the only issue here is whether zelnik is able to demonstrate that he suffered an adverse employment action.the gravamen of zelnik argument as presented to this court is that the term adverse employment action has a different meaning in free speech retaliation cases than in title vii and other discrimination cases and that the district court applied the incorrect standard for measuring his adverse employment action claims.zelnik also argues that the district court erred in finding that the status of professor emeritus does not confer any tangible benefits and that fit and its officials did not engage in conduct that would have deterred a reasonable similarly situated individual from exercising his or her first amendment rights.
galabya,the case upon which the district court relied,involved a claim of discrimination brought pursuant to the age discrimination in employment act of,stat.codified at et adea.in that case,we determined that a n adverse employment action within the meaning of the relevant legal standards is generally characterized as a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.galabya,at internal quotation marks omitted.it may include termination of employment,a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices unique to a particular situation.id.at.because zelnik could not demonstrate any material change in the terms and conditions of his employment,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.
the standard applied by the district court,however,is a more demanding standard than the one we have applied to first amendment retaliation claims.in the context of a first amendment retaliation claim,we have held that o nly retaliatory conduct that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her constitutional rights constitutes an adverse action.washington county of rockland.cir quoting dawes walker,cir alteration in washington see also hoyt andreucci,cir.in this context,a dverse employment actions include discharge,refusal to hire,refusal to promote,demotion,reduction in pay,and reprimand.morris lindau,cir.this list of retaliatory conduct is certainly not exhaustive,however,and lesser actions may also be considered adverse employment actions.id.adverse employment actions may include negative evaluation letters,express accusations of lying,assignment of lunchroom duty,reduction of class preparation periods,failure to process teacher insurance forms,transfer from library to classroom teaching as an alleged demotion,and assignment to classroom on fifth floor which aggravated teacher physical disabilities.id.citing bernheim litt,cir.
while our cases thus have recognized a number of employment actions that we have characterized as adverse,we are guided by the general rule that whether an undesirable employment action qualifies as being adverse is a heavily,contextual determination.hoyt,at a plaintiff can not support such a determination unless he can show that an alleged act of retaliation is more than de minimis.see davidson chestnut,cir collecting cases.indeed,i t would trivialize the first amendment to hold that harassment for exercising the right of free speech was always actionable no matter how unlikely to deter a person of ordinary firmness from that exercise bart telford,cir.
zelnik quotes a passage in rutan republican party of illinois,d,for the proposition that the first amendment protects public employees from even an act of retaliation as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party for a public employee when intended to punish her for exercising her free speech rights,id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,but the quoted language is dicta and should not be read literally,see pierce.dep t of criminal justice,institutional,cir we choose not to read the supreme court dicta literally rather,we apply the main analysis of rutan to retaliation claims and require more than a trivial act to establish constitutional harm.davidson,at characterizing the birthday party passage as dicta.the supreme court quoted the birthday party passage from the opinion of the seventh circuit court of appeals in that case,ru
