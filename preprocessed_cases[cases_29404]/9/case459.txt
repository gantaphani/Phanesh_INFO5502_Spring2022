this case raises the issue,new to our circuit,of whether of a close corporation may be employees for purposes of the requirement for determining whether a corporation is a covered employer under certain federal laws.the supreme court has instructed on this issue in a series of decisions which determine the outcome of this appeal from entry of summary judgment for the defendants.see clackamas gastroenterology,wells,d walters metro.educ,d nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.
ltt card services,ltt is a corporation which sells cards for cellular phones.lenda de jesús worked for ltt in and.de jesús worked in ltt accounting department,and her last position with the company was as a collection officer.while de jesús was employed at ltt,jorge pagán was president of the company,and ibrahim baker was vice president.defendants allege that ltt is a close corporation,and that pagán and baker are directors and major shareholders of ltt.
in december,de jesús brought suit against ltt and several individuals collectively ltt,alleging that after she announced she was pregnant in april,she was subjected to harassment and a hostile work environment,which led to her constructive discharge in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et the americans with disabilities act of ada,et and puerto rican law,including laws ann.tit,et and laws ann.tit,et.de jesús apparently had received a notice of right to sue from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.
ltt moved to dismiss de jesús title vii claim on the ground that plaintiff had not met her burden of showing that the company satisfied the definition of employer,as it did not have fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.id.b.the ada likewise defines employer as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has or more employees for each working day in each of or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.a.ltt filed no memorandum of law providing any legal analysis with its motion to dismiss it instead filed a sworn statement from carlos ruben,an accountant for ltt,that there were not or more employees for each working day during or more calendar weeks in either or.
in response to ltt motion to dismiss,de jesús filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure f,asking that she be allowed an opportunity to conduct discovery in the case or,in the alternative,be allowed to conduct limited discovery as to the issue.
ltt opposed de jesús request for discovery and submitted uncertified payroll records for and in support of its argument that no additional discovery was necessary.notably,the records listed both pagán and baker,the purported,as employees for every week of and.
on august,the district court initially denied ltt motion to dismiss the title vii and ada claims de jesús ltt card services,no.civ,wl,at.recognizing a split then extant among the circuit courts,the district court characterized the requirement as an issue of failure to state a claim,under rule b,rather than an issue of subject matter jurisdiction,under rule b.id.at.the district court was correct.the supreme court has since decided that the requirement is not jurisdictional,but an element of plaintiff claim for relief.arbaugh y h,d.
the district court also correctly held that for purposes of determining whether ltt was a covered employer,the focus must be on,the calendar year in which the alleged discrimination occurred,the preceding calendar year.see int l,cir see also b.the court gave leave to ltt to renew its motion to dismiss the title vii and ada claims by filing certified copies of the payrolls for and.de jesús,wl,at.the court stated that in the event ltt motion was reinstated,de jesús would have a period to conduct limited discovery on the issue.id.
thereafter,on october,ltt submitted uncertified records concerning its and payrolls,along with a second motion to dismiss.the documents submitted appear to be spreadsheets rather than certified copies of the payrolls.the motion relied on serapion martinez,cir,and devine stone,leyton gershman,cir,for the proposition that,that manage and own the business must be excluded from the payroll,since they should be considered proprietors,not employees,under title vii.
the motion also explained that two names on the previously submitted records for and should have been excluded.that was because jorge pagán and ibrahim baker were both shareholders and directors of and as such should be considered proprietors and not employees.one can easily infer that pagán and baker were not listed on the newly submitted,uncertified records for and because of their alleged status.had they been counted as employees,it appears that ltt would have had at least employees for the requisite number of weeks in and.plaintiff failed to file any opposition to ltt second motion to dismiss.
on april,the district court dismissed de jesús title vii and ada claims with prejudice de jesús ltt card services,no.civ,wl,at.it is clear that,without formally doing so,the court treated ltt second motion to dismiss as a rule motion for summary judgment.the court had before it what were purported to be payroll records,and it had given de jesús an opportunity for discovery after she filed her motion under rule f.there was no prejudice to any party from this treatment.
in granting summary judgment to ltt on the title vii and ada claims,the district court properly took ltt submitted uncontested facts as admitted,since de jesús filed no opposition.see janssen ortho llc,cir.
perhaps because of the lack of developed briefing the district court order was unaccompanied by a memorandum and consisted only of two paragraphs,which stated the court conclusions but not its reasons.the court cited no cases on the question of whether may be considered employees for determining whether a corporation is a covered employer.de jesús,wl,at.we assume that the court decision was based on the spartan arguments accompanying ltt second motion to dismiss that this case is controlled by serapion and devine,and that of corporations are excluded as a matter of law from being counted as employees under title vii.
on may,de jesús,represented by new counsel,filed a motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment under rule b.plaintiff stated in the motion that previous counsel had been experiencing depression and failed to discuss with her the defendants motion to dismiss she also noted that former counsel failed to perform any discovery and failed to file any objection to defendants exhibits.de jesús also objected that the and records submitted by ltt were not certified payrolls as required by the district court august,order,and that it was improper for ltt to omit pagán and baker from the and records.further,de jesús argued for the first time,on reconsideration,that ltt impermissibly excluded an additional six employees from its submitted documents for the years in question,supported only by her statement that the six were employees.
the district court did not rule on de jesús motion for reconsideration.this may have been due to plaintiff filing her notice of appeal only six days after the filing of the motion to set aside judgment.in any event,de jesús timely appealed from the entry of summary judgment against her on the title vii and ada claims 
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo,and we take all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.stonkus city of brockton sch.dep t,cir.even though de jesús failed to oppose ltt motion,the uncontested facts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that defendants are entitled to summary judgment,at quoting,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also calderone united states,cir stating that a rule movant who does not bear the burden of proof must show that the opponent can not sustain his burden at trial.
this appeal raises two issues.the first is how to treat of close corporations in determining who is an employee for meeting the definition of employer under title vii and the ada the second is whether,on the record before it,the district court correctly concluded on summary judgment that ltt did not have or more employees for each working day in or more calendar weeks in or because on the undisputed facts pagán and baker could not be employees.
whether an individual is an employee for purposes of title vii or the ada is a matter of federal law.see walters,at.rodal anesthesia group of onondaga,cir serapion,at.however,neither title vii nor the ada defines who is an employee beyond the circular provision that an employee is an individual employed by an employer.f.indeed,the supreme court has noted that employee does not have some intrinsically plain meaning.robinson shell oil,d holding that term employees as used in the provision of title vii includes former employees.
the supreme court has addressed the definition of employer in the federal laws in several cases.in walters,the court addressed the question of whether,for purposes of title vii requirement,the defendant had all employees with whom it maintained an employment relationship on a given working day,regardless of whether the employee received compensation on that day.at.
walters establishes the broader framework applicable here.under walters,the question will frequently,but not necessarily,be addressed in two parts application of the payroll method,followed by application of traditional agency law principles for defining employer and employee,if the individual is on the payroll.id.at.of course,one could skip to the second test if it were dispositive.
thus,our starting point,as the parties presented the issue,is whether the two individuals in question were on ltt payroll.the inferences,which must be drawn in plaintiff favor,are that pagán and baker were on the payroll for weeks in both and,just as they were in and,but were excluded from ltt later submission of uncertified records for and based on a legal argument that can not be employees.there is a further reasonable inference in plaintiff favor that if pagán and baker were on the payroll for weeks in and,they were,paid workers of ltt.
this brings us to the second test.as walters recognized,the mere fact that an individual is on the payroll is not necessarily dispositive of his or her status as an employee.citing darden,at,walters stressed that it is the existence of an employment relationship,not appearance on the payroll,which is critical,because an individual may appear on the payroll but nevertheless not be an employee under traditional principles of agency law.at.the courts of appeals differed,however,on what was the appropriate common law test.see,devine,at hyland new haven radiology,cir eeoc dowd dowd,cir.
in the supreme court decided clackamas,resolving the circuit split and determining the test applicable here.the issue was how to determine who was an employee for purposes of the requirement under the ada when were involved.at.the case turned on whether four physicians actively engaged in medical practice as shareholders and directors of a professional corporation should be counted as employees.id.the court noted that congress had balanced the competing interests of employees and small businesses in setting the definition of covered employers.id.at.t he congressional decision to limit the coverage of the ada to firms with or more employees has its own justification that must be,easing entry into the market and preserving the competitive position of smaller firms.id.at.
notably,the court rejected the approach,implicit in ltt position that the issue is simply whether the individuals in question are like partners in a partnership.id.at.such an approach,the court held,avoids the pertinent question of whether of a professional corporation are employees within the meaning of the statute.id.
rather,the court adopted a test taken from eeoc,compliance manual hereinafter eeoc compliance manual,for determining whether a is an employee.clackamas,at.the six factors in the eeoc compliance manual are designed to address whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization,or whether the individual is subject to the organization control.id.at.quoting eeoc compliance manual.if the individual is subject to the organization control,he is an employee,even if he is a partner,officer,director,or major shareholder.see eeoc,compliance manual a d,at hereinafter eeoc compliance manual.the six factors are as follows 
whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual work,
whether and,if so,to what extent the organization supervises the individual work,
whether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization,
whether and,if so,to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization,
whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee,as expressed in written agreements or contracts,
whether the individual shares in the profits,losses,and liabilities of the organization.
clackamas,at.quoting eeoc compliance manual internal quotation marks omitted.
the court made clear that these six factors are not exhaustive.id.at.the court went on to explain the application of the factors 
as the eeoc standard reflects,an employer is the person,or group of persons,who owns and manages the enterprise.the employer can hire and fire employees,can assign tasks to employees and supervise their performance,and can decide how the profits and losses of the business are to be distributed.the mere fact that a person has a particular as partner,director,or vice not necessarily be used to determine whether he or she is an employee or a proprietor.nor should the mere existence of a document styled employment agreement lead inexorably to the conclusion that either party is an employee.rather,as was true in applying rules to the issue confronted in darden,the answer to whether a is an employee depends on all of the incidents of the relationship with no one factor being decisive.
id.at.omission in original citations omitted quoting darden,at.quoting nlrb united ins.of,d citing eeoc compliance manual.
under clackamas it is also clear that managers or supervisors may not be determined to be merely on the basis that they have managerial or supervisory authority.see smith castaways family diner,cir.management authority can be delegated by the corporation,but such authority does not necessarily entail a right to control.see id.at underscoring the distinction between a right versus a privilege of participating in the governance of a business.
we hold that the clackamas approach applies here.although clackamas does not directly decide the question,we hold that it applies to close corporations as well as to professional corporations.that is because the eeoc compliance manual does not restrict itself to professional corporations indeed,it explicitly covers major shareholders.eeoc compliance manual a d,at.we also hold that the clackamas test applies to title vii as well as ada claims.without expressly holding that this test has application beyond the ada,the court noted that the eeoc guidelines are intended to apply across title vii,the ada,and the age discrimination in employment act of,et.clackamas,at.
we turn to the question of application of clackamas to the record in this case.ltt chose as its sole battleground its application of the payroll method.under walters,as we have said,application of the payroll method alone does not warrant entry of summary judgment where the evidence is merely that the pertinent individuals being counted are on the payroll,and there is a dispute about whether pertinent individuals are employees.at.the defendants must also meet their burden under the clackamas test.
ltt merely alleged that pagán and baker are directors and shareholders of ltt,but provided no evidence.even if one were to accept that the spreadsheets submitted were accurate payrolls because de jesús did not initially oppose this assertion entry of summary judgment for defendants was not proper.that is because defendants failed to offer evidence pertaining to the six factors described in clackamas.see becton dickinson caribe,cir noting that motions for summary judgment
