vincent higgins appeals from the dismissal of his federal civil rights claim that howard beyer,the assistant commissioner of the new jersey department of corrections,and employees of the adult diagnostic and treatment center adtc employees violated a by seizing money derived from a veteran disability benefits check from his inmate account to pay a state fine,and that he was deprived of his constitutional right to due process because his request for a predeprivation hearing was ignored.he also seeks reversal of the dismissal of his claim,on the ground of mootness,that prison employees retaliated against him for exercising constitutionally protected rights.
we reverse because we conclude that higgins pro se complaint,when liberally construed,stated sufficient facts to state a cause of action for a violation of a federal right under a,and a deprivation of his fourteenth amendment right to notice and hearing prior to the deprivation of his property interest in the proceeds of his veteran benefits.we also hold that the district court erred in dismissing his claim that the prison officials retaliated against him for asserting his rights under the due process clause.
higgins alleged the following facts in his complaint.higgins served in the united states army from to.while in the army,higgins injured his left hand,leaving him partially disabled.this partial disability qualified higgins to receive disability benefits from the veteran administration va for the remainder of his life.
in,higgins pled guilty to the crime of first degree aggravated sexual assault in the superior court of new jersey.the court sentenced higgins to a term of imprisonment to be served at the adtc in avenel,new jersey.the court also imposed a victims of crime compensation board vccb fine in the amount of,pursuant to section of the new jersey statutes annotated.west.section expressly requires a new jersey superior court to order the department of corrections to collect a vccb fine from the personal account of an inmate if the assessment was not paid at the time of sentencing at the time of sentencing,higgins had not yet received any disability benefits from the.
on april,higgins was transferred from the monmouth county correctional center facility to the adtc.on or about april,he received a notification from the va that his claim for benefits for partial disability had been approved.he was advised that he would receive a check for benefits due from january,to march.
on may,a united states treasury department check in the amount of,made out to higgins as the payee,arrived at the adtc.on the same date,higgins was notified during mail call by an adtc employee that the check had arrived.he was not handed the check nor did he authorize any prison employee to deposit it in his inmate account.the standard procedure at the adtc when a check is received is to request the inmate to sign a form acknowledging receipt of the check and then endorse it for deposit only.the adtc employees did not follow this procedure.
later that day,higgins wrote four business remits,which instructed prison employees to forward money in the amounts of,and two for apiece to various persons.a business remit is the term used at the adtc for an inmate authorization that money be deducted from his account.
on may,higgins asked the social worker assigned to his wing to find out what had happened to his check.the social worker informed higgins that adtc employees intended to use part of the proceeds of the va disability benefits check to pay the outstanding vccb fine ordered by the new jersey superior court.on the same date,higgins filed a written complaint addressed to adtc superintendent william plantier in which higgins stated that a va disability benefits check is not attachable pursuant to.
on june,adtc assistant superintendent grace rogers sent a letter to higgins in which she stated that higgins va disability benefits check had been received and would be deposited in his inmate account.on june,higgins received written confirmation that his check had been deposited in his inmate account.on june,linda cook,an adtc social worker,notified higgins that none of the checks that he had authorized would be sent out until he signed a business remit authorizing the withdrawal of to pay the vccb fine.higgins refused on the ground that a va disability benefits check is not attachable pursuant to.he also stated that under the terms of his plea bargain,he was only required to pay an assessment of and that he had filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the imposition of a vccb fine in the amount of.cook informed higgins that only a portion of the checks he had authorized would be sent out so that there would be sufficient funds in his inmate account to satisfy the vccb fine.
on june,daniel barrajas,adtc assistant mail supervisor,asked higgins to endorse the va disability benefits check.higgins refused.on the same date,higgins wrote to superintendent plantier requesting a written explanation of the disposition of his va disability benefits check.higgins also stated that if he did not receive a written explanation by june,he would file an action in the united states district court.superintendent plantier did not reply.sometime thereafter,adtc employees deducted from higgins inmate account to pay the vccb fine ordered by the new jersey superior court.
higgins filed this action on august.prior to filing an answer,the adtc employees moved to dismiss the complaint on october,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,asserting that higgins had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.higgins filed his opposition to the rule b motion on november.
while the motion to dismiss was pending,higgins filed a pro se pleading styled as a notice of motion in support of to consolidate these arguments with the above docket case order of.in this motion,higgins alleged that adtc employees brought false charges against him,resulting in his confinement in administrative segregation for days and the denial of his access to the courts,in retaliation for the filing of this action for damages for the deprivation of his rights pursuant to a and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
on june,without the benefit of oral argument,the district court granted the adtc employees motion to dismiss this action,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.in a footnote to its memorandum opinion,the district court stated in light of this court granting of the motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint as to the fourteen individual defendants,the motion of pro se plaintiff vincent higgins for a preliminary injunction shall be denied as moot.the court did not explain how higgins discrete claim that adtc employees retaliated against him for asserting his right to access to the courts was rendered moot by his alleged failure to state a claim for the deprivation of his property in violation of a and his constitutional right to a predeprivation hearing.
higgins has timely appealed the district court final judgment in this action.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
higgins contends that the district court erred in ruling that he failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that the adtc employees violated.he argues that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim under either for depriving him of money derived from a va disability benefits check in violation of a,or for denying him his constitutional right to a predeprivation hearing to challenge the threat to remove funds derived from his va disability benefits check from his inmate account.
our review of the dismissal of an action pursuant to rule b is plenary.nami fauver,cir.this court has described the nature of our review as follows 
we must determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the pleadings,the plaintiffs may be entitled to relief,and we must accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.the complaint will be deemed to have alleged sufficient facts if it adequately put the defendants on notice of the essential elements of the plaintiffs cause of action.since this is a action,the plaintiffs are entitled to relief if their complaint sufficiently alleges deprivation of any right secured by the constitution.in considering a rule b motion,we do not inquire whether the plaintiffs will ultimately prevail,only whether they are entitled to offer evidence to support their claims.thus,the district court order granting the defendants motion to dismiss will be affirmed only if it appears that the plaintiffs could prove no set of facts that would entitle them to relief.
id.citations omitted.moreover,as higgins filed his complaint pro se,we must liberally construe his pleadings,and we will apply the applicable law,irrespective of whether a pro se litigant has mentioned it by name.holley dep t of veteran affairs,cir.
section authorizes a person to file a private cause of action against state actors for a deprivation of rights protected by a federal statute or the united states constitution.section provides in pertinent part 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suite in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
it is undisputed that the adtc employees were state actors who deprived higgins of funds derived from his va disability benefits check without his consent under color of a state court order issued pursuant to.a.
we must first consider whether higgins alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate a violation of a.section a provides in relevant part 
payments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the secretary shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law,and such payments made to,or on account of,a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation,shall be exempt from the claim of creditors,and shall not be liable to attachment,levy,or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever,either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.the preceding sentence shall not apply to claims of the united states arising under such laws nor shall the exemption therein contained as to taxation extend to any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments 
in order to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege a violation of a federal right,and not merely a violation of federal law.pharmacists ass houstoun,cir en banc quotation omitted.this court recently explained that a plaintiff alleging a violation of a federal statute may not proceed under unless the statute creates enforceable rights,privileges,or immunities within the meaning of and congress has not foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.id.quotations omitted.
to create a right enforceable under,the federal statute at issue must meet three conditions 
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
blessing freestone,d citations omitted.once all three conditions are met,a rebuttable presumption arises that the right is enforceable under.id.at.pharmacists ass n,at.this presumption may be rebutted by showing that congress expressly or impliedly foreclosed an action under.pharmacists ass n,at.
congress may impliedly foreclose a remedy under by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.blessing,at.section a contains neither express language nor a comprehensive enforcement scheme that demonstrates that congress intended to foreclose a remedy under for a violation of a.we are persuaded that a provides a federal right that is enforceable under.
the purpose of the prohibition against the attachment,levy,or seizure of a veteran disability benefits in a is to prevent the deprivation and depletion of the means of subsistence of veterans dependent upon these benefits as the main source of their income.rose rose,d quotation omitted.even though higgins,because he is a prisoner,does not presently need or rely upon his disability benefits for subsistence,his right nonetheless to receive those benefits free from attachment,levy,or seizure is expressly set forth in clear,mandatory language in the statute.section a also precludes anyone from using any legal or equitable process to attach,levy,or seize these benefits.thus,a satisfies the conditions set forth in blessing freestone for creating a federal right enforceable under.
our holding that a violation of a veteran rights under a is enforceable against state prison officials pursuant to is supported by the ninth circuit decision in nelson heiss,cir.in nelson,the court held that future veteran benefits are exempt from a hold placed on an inmate account where the inmate consented to and the prison officials authorized the hold to cover purchases of copies and dental appliances when there were insufficient funds to cover the overdrafts.id.at.the ninth circuit held that the holds placed on the veteran inmate account by the prison officials violated a because a veteran benefits are exempt from assignment,attachment,levy,or seizure.id.in nelson,the state actors were attempting to recoup funds advanced for the veteran medical needs.id.at.in rejecting the contention of the state actors that they had a right to the funds after providing overdraft protection,the ninth circuit reasoned section a was designed to protect veteran benefits against their creditors so that the veterans themselves could spend those funds as they saw fit when they actually got them,and not before.id.at.
in response to the prison officials argument that congress could not have intended to prohibit the taking of a veteran disability benefits for his or her maintenance and care as allowed by a number of states,the ninth circuit observed but if congress wanted to create exceptions to or seizure,it knew how to do so.id.at.in nelson,the ninth circuit applied a,notwithstanding the fact that the prisoner had specifically consented to the future payment for the goods and services from his account when he received a va check that would cover his depleted inmate account.id.at.
in this matter,higgins did not consent to the taking of money from his inmate account.instead,he warned the adtc employees that the use of his disability benefits to satisfy the vccb fine violated a.thus,the matter before us presents a more compelling factual basis for applying a to protect money derived from higgins disability benefits from attachment,levy,or seizure than the circumstances before the ninth circuit in nelson.
the supreme court has not yet construed a to determine whether prison officials can attach or seize funds in an inmate account derived from a va disability benefits check.in bennett arkansas,d,the court was called upon to determine whether a state can attach social security benefits to help defray the cost of maintaining its prison system.id.at.the state of arkansas filed an action in state court seeking to attach bennett social security benefits to defray the cost of maintaining its prison system pursuant to the state prison inmate care and custody reimbursement act.et supp.id.the arkansas statute expressly authorized the seizure of federal social security benefits for this purpose.id.at.
in his opposition to the state action,bennett argued that the arkansas statute violated the supremacy clause because it was in conflict with a,which exempts social security benefits from legal process.id.at.section a provides in relevant part that none of the moneys paid or payable under the social security act shall be subject to execution,levy,attachment,g
