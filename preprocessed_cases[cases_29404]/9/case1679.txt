opinion of the court 
janet turner appeals from the district court december,order entering summary judgment against her on her claim under the americans with disabilities act ada,et.we will reverse the order granting summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
janet turner began working at hershey reading,pennsylvania plant in august.she worked in several production capacities and as a custodian.during her employment,turner was diagnosed with medical problems,including fused cervical discs,postlaminectomy pain syndrome,cervical radioculopathy,and thoracic outlet syndrome.these conditions compelled turner to undergo surgeries in,and.
when turner returned to work in following her back operation,hershey accommodated her new work restrictions,assigning her to a light duty position as a shaker table inspector on a york peppermint pattie line.the position involved sitting or standing on the side of the line,while repeatedly reaching,stretching,and twisting to maneuver and remove the and uncovered mint patties.
at the time of turner employment,the reading plant had six shaker table inspectors,assigned in pairs to one of three lines lines,and.line required the inspector to stand and repeatedly bend and twist to sort different size mint patties moving down the conveyor.the inspectors on lines and sat while sorting patties of the same size.work on lines and was considered easier than work on line.
before turner return to work,her treating physician,david allen,reviewed a videotape depicting the shaker table inspectors duties,and completed a form stating that turner could return to work as an inspector.allen cleared turner for light work that required no bending,stooping,or lifting of more than twenty pounds.two days after returning,however,she complained to her immediate supervisor,steve heimbach,that she was in pain and could not work.heimbach transferred turner from line to line,and then later allowed her to transfer to line turner believed was easierwhen another inspector went on medical leave.
in,hershey learned that the shaker table inspectors had suffered an increased incidence of repetitive stress injuries to their wrists and arms.although hershey plant management was especially concerned about line because it was the most demanding line,they noticed repetitive stress injuries to inspectors working on all three lines.from march to june,plant nurse suzanne werley,manufacturing department manager leslie goss,and mint department production supervisor robert ladd met and discussed ways to protect the inspectors from these repetitive stress injuries.they adopted nurse werley suggestion that hershey require its inspectors to rotate among all three lines daily.this rotation system would allow the inspectors to change positions hourly,to alternate between sitting and standing,and to use both their left and right arms,thus decreasing the likelihood of repetitive stress injury.
on july,ladd,werley,and kathy gibson,manager of employment,safety,and security,met with the six shaker table inspectors to discuss the implementation of the rotation system.turner objected to the rotation scheme and refused to work on line.turner immediately contacted her lawyer who wrote a letter requesting that plant management exempt her from the rotation system.the next day,turner revisited her physician.allen issued her a new form that was more restrictive than the form he issued in april,limiting her to activities that did not require any stretching,bending,twisting,or turning of the neck or lower back or lifting of greater than pounds.
on july,turner presented hershey with the new form and her lawyer letter.the next day,leslie goss,employee relations manager jeff johnson,steve heimbach,turner union representative sandra kurtz,and turner discussed whether,in light of turner new work restrictions,it was feasible to exempt her from the rotation system.hershey decided that turner inability to work on line prevented her from participating in the rotation system,which they viewed as necessary to prevent injuries to all inspectors.hershey did not allow turner to continue as a shaker table inspector.
hershey notified turner of her right under the union contract to go on disability,which turner applied for on august,and later received.in her application,turner stated that she was unable to return to work from and after july,and was unable to work in any position in the reading plant.allen confirmed this in letters he sent to hershey in august and september.
at hershey suggestion,turner and her doctor completed an application for disability coverage.where the form indicated that she should describe the injury she incurred,turner wrote that it was an ongoing situation.app.at.where the form asked her how her injury impeded her ability to do her occupational duties,she responded b ecause of pain.id.allen stated that turner was unable to do her regular job description.app.at.she was awarded benefits.later that year,the social security administration determined that she was disabled from and after july,and awarded her total disability benefits.
turner last day of work at hershey was july.because she was deemed a disabled employee,her union contract provided her with employee benefits for the next months until july.on april,turner filed a claim of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,which found no cause for discrimination and issued a right to sue letter.on july,turner filed this lawsuit,alleging that she was not completely disabled and could have performed her job if hershey had accommodated her by exempting her from the rotation system.following the close of discovery,hershey filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.
congress enacted the ada in in an effort to prevent otherwise qualified individuals from being discriminated against in employment based on disability.see.the ada provides that n o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.the act defines a qualified individual with a disability as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that individual holds or desires.id.an employer discriminates against a qualified individual when it does not mak e reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer.id.b a.reasonable accommodation means measures such as job restructuring,or modified work schedules,reassignment to a vacant position,acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.id.
we must first decide whether the district court grant of summary judgment should be upheld on the rationale that turner is bound by her prior submissions to the social security administration and should be judicially estopped from arguing now that she can work.if estoppel applies,turner claim will be foreclosed and our analysis of the district court rulings under the ada is unnecessary.hershey argues that turner made statements in support of her application for social security disability insurance ssdi and disability benefits that should be held to estop her from asserting that she is a qualified individual under the ada.we disagree.because these statements did not state categorically that turner could not work at all or take into account turner entitlement to reasonable accommodation,we see no inconsistency between these statements and her current claim.see,skerski time warner cable,cir ada claimant must show she can perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation.
with respect to her application for disability benefits,hershey argues that when turner wrote b ecause of pain in response to the question how does your injury or sickness impede your ability to do your occupational duties she made a statement which should be understood to estop her current claim that she can perform the essential functions of a shaker table inspector with reasonable accommodation.app.at.however,that turner pain impedes her ability to perform certain occupational functions is hardly a statement of total disability.further,it does not address the question of whether she would continue to have pain if she were granted the accommodation that she has requested,namely to be exempted from work on line.neither does turner response address the severity of the pain experienced and whether such pain would make her incapable of performing the essential functions of the shaker table inspector position.therefore,because this statement neither is a categorical statement of total inability to perform her job function nor takes into account turner entitlement to reasonable accommodation,we do not find that it judicially estops turner from asserting her ada claim.
hershey also points to two statements made by david allen,turner physician,in support of her disability application.allen described turner restrictions as v ery light duty,no lifting over,no repetitive use of arms.id.at.allen also states,p atient unable to do her regular job description.id.with respect to the light duty restrictions that allen placed on turner,whether these restrictions would prevent turner from performing the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation is a factual question for the jury.as to allen statement that turner is unable to do her regular job description,we note that turner has conceded that she is not able to do her regular job description.this is precisely why she is requesting an accommodation.
with respect to her ssdi application,hershey argues that three statements made by turner should be read as conclusive as to her inability to perform the shaker table inspector position.first,in response to the question,how do your illnesses,injuries or conditions limit your ability to work turner wrote,i have chronic pain,my hands,arms and shoulders are weak and painful,i can not walk far and can not sit for prolonged periods.i can not bend or stretch or lift more than lbs,i also can not stoop or kneel.app.at.second,when asked for additional information,turner wrote 
i have been told that i need replacement surgery for my left knee.i am unable to stand or walk for any extended periods.
my doctor has informed me that my performing additional work will cause additional disk spaces to become damaged.
my spinal fusions do not allow me to bend or stretch.
id.at.third,hershey points to turner response to the question when did you become unable to work because of your illnesses,injuries or conditions turner responded.id.at.
we will examine each of these statements in turn to see if they should be given estoppel effect.first,we look at turner statement that chronic pain,weakness in her arms and shoulders,and her inability to walk far,sit for prolonged periods,bend,stretch,lift more than ten pounds,stoop or kneel are conditions which impede her ability to work.while these conditions indisputably impede turner ability to work,we can not say that they foreclose the possibility that she could perform the essential functions of the shaker table inspector position with reasonable accommodation.certainly,the record does not reflect that the essential functions of her position require walking long distances,stooping,kneeling,or lifting heavy objects.to the extent that the position does require sitting for long periods,bending,and stretching,we see no reason why some reasonable accommodation could not be made.
second,we turn to turner statement that m y doctor has informed me that my performing additional work will cause additional disk spaces to become damaged.id.at.this is not a statement that turner is unable to perform her duties,but,rather,a statement about her concerns regarding her health if she performs additional duties.in addition,this statement must be read in light of cleveland policy management systems,d,in which the supreme court held that statements in support of an ssdi application do not take into account of the concept of reasonable accommodation under the ada and,therefore,do not necessarily estop a claim under the ada that one is capable of performing the essential functions of one position with reasonable accommodation.thus,we must read turner statement as saying,in effect,my doctor has informed me that my performing additional work without reasonable accommodation will cause additional disk spaces to become damaged.this reading is consistent both with the court analysis in cleveland and with turner claim for relief.turner has not argued that she can perform the job at each of the three shaker table inspector lines.she has consistently maintained that she can not perform the more rigorous duties of line.thus,her statement that continuing to work in a position that requires her to rotate to line harms her health is not inconsistent with the idea and can not be read to estop her from she can perform the essential functions of her job on lines and without this harm to her health.
finally,we turn to turner response of to the ssdi application question regarding when she became unable to work.as discussed in cleveland,this statement of inability to work must be read as lacking the qualifier of reasonable accommodation,which did not apply for purposes of her ssdi application,but does apply for purposes of her ada claim.thus,in her ssdi application,turner was saying,in effect,i am unable to work without reasonable accommodation.this statement is not inconsistent with her ada claim,in which she is saying,in effect,i am able to work with reasonable accommodation.see cleveland,at.
thus,having considered turner various statements in her disability application and her application for social security disability benefits,we find that her claim under the ada is not estopped by any admissions made in these applications.
we turn now to the merits issue presented by the appeal before us,namely,whether the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of hershey on turner claims because the rotation policy at issue was an essential function of turner job.a disabled employee may establish a prima facie case under the ada if she shows that she can perform the essential function of the job with reasonable accommodation and that the employer refused to make such an accommodation.skerski time warner cable,cir.
as the district court observed,the central issue in this case is hershey requirement that turner participate in its shaker table rotation scheme.in granting hershey motion for summary judgment,the district court found that the scheme by which hershey required its shaker table inspectors to rotate between lines,and was an essential function of the job.app.at.because she could not perform this essential function required of a shaker table inspector,the district court reasoned that turner was not a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada.the district court also reasoned that turner could not maintain a claim for reasonable accommodation,because any exemption from the rotation system would create a danger of increased injuries for turner and the other shaker table inspectors and,therefore,would be unreasonable 
in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we exercise plenary review.petruzzi iga supermarkets,cir.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to turner,we must determine whether there was a genuine issue of material fact and,if not,whether hershey was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.anderson liberty lobby,d 
in order to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada,turner must establish that she has a disability,is a qualified individual,and has suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability.buskirk apollo metals,cir gaul lucent techs,cir.here,hershey does not contest that turner has a disability.hershey does contend that turner did not suffer an adverse employment action as a re
