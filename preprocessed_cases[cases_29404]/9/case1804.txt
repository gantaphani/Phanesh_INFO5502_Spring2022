opinion of the court 
we are presented with the question of when a federal official is entitled to qualified immunity in a civil action for damages.because we conclude that the district court erred in denying defendant the protection of qualified immunity,we will reverse.
this litigation centers around an investigation into drug trafficking activities in the dominican republic.are agents of the pennsylvania attorney general office who were involved in the drug investigation.in,plaintiffs filed a bivens suit against michael stiles stiles,then united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the complaint alleged that stiles violated plaintiffs first amendment rights and fifth amendment due process rights,and violated the provisions of.plaintiffs also filed a civil rights action against members of the pennsylvania attorney general office pag defendants,including pennsylvania attorney general michael fisher fisher,alleging violations of and.the original complaint is long,prolix,and somewhat difficult to discern.however,the various causes of action were grounded in factual assertions that defendants intentionally impeded plaintiffs criminal investigation and caused adverse employment conditions for plaintiffs because defendants wished to protect the dominican drug organization.this appeal only involves the allegations against stiles.
stiles moved to dismiss the complaint for with federal rule of civil procedure.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion to dismiss be granted.the district court adopted the magistrate recommendations and dismissed the case against stiles,noting that stiles was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity.the case against the pag defendants was also dismissed because it failed to state viable claims and because the suit was barred by the amendment to the united states constitution.
in an unpublished opinion,a panel of this court reversed.see mclaughlin watson,mclaughlin i.the panel held that plaintiffs were entitled to amend their complaint to state a first amendment cause of action against the pag defendants and an administrative cause of action against stiles.id.at.the panel explained that while plaintiffs complaint was not a model of clarity,the complaint suggested that stiles used his influence as a united states attorney to obtain adverse personnel actions against plaintiffs.id.at.the panel further explained 
as we made clear in carter city of philadelphia,cir,prosecutorial immunity is restricted to distinguished from.administrative decisions,including those regarding the employment or supervision of personnel outside the prosecutor office,are not subject to absolute prosecutorial immunity.because attorney stiles was not clearly entitled to prosecutorial immunity from all of the claims against him,the analysis for whether the agents state a cause of action against stiles should proceed along the same lines as for the pag defendants.
pursuant to the panel suggestion in mclaughlin i,plaintiffs amended their complaint,which now included three counts in count i,plaintiffs alleged that defendants both pag and stiles impaired plaintiffs terms and conditions of employment via adverse administrative personnel action.according to count i,plaintiffs rights were violated because stiles and the pag defendants 
impaired where plaintiffs could work,how much they were required to travel to the point of extreme hardship causing serious and painful medical consequences,loss of promotional opportunities,and subsequent wages,shift differentials and overtime and career damaging evaluation reports.
app.at.according to the amended complaint,these actions breached plaintiffs federally guaranteed rights to be free of irrational and injuries sic administrative actions for the proper performance of their duties 
count ii of the amended complaint alleged that defendants deprived plaintiffs of their right to substantive due process by subjecting them to unfair treatment in their public employment.count ii further alleged that defendants acted against plaintiffs solely because of their successful efforts to investigate the dominican criminal wrongdoing.id.at.
count iii of the amended complaint alleged that defendants violated plaintiffs first amendment rights by preventing plaintiffs from responding to negative comments about plaintiffs contained in certain press releases.according to the amended complaint the pag defendants are still unlawfully enforcing today their order to plaintiffs not to respond to the press in any form,or answer any charges in any forums.app.at.
stiles moved to dismiss the amended complaint based on qualified immunity or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the summary judgment part of the motion argued that there was no issue of fact as to whether stiles acted administratively against plaintiffs.in a memorandum opinion dated july,the district court denied stiles motion to dismiss with the following language 
defendant contends he is entitled to qualified immunity.i find it premature to determine this issue in defendant favor.there is a first amendment claim asserted against defendant.that is a clearly established constitutional right,which,if interfered with by defendant use of influence with plaintiffs employer,would nullify the availability of qualified immunity.
the motion for summary judgment was denied because the district court concluded that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether actions taken by defendant caused adverse employment decisions to be made concerning the plaintiffs stiles now appeals again to this court,solely on the qualified immunity issue.
we have jurisdiction over the appeal under see johnson jones,d mitchell forsyth,d.we review a motion to dismiss based on the defense of qualified immunity de novo as it involves a pure question of law.acierno cloutier,cir citing burns county of cambria,cir.
the contours of the doctrine of qualified immunity are and its underlying rationale has been clearly pronounced.as the supreme court explained,permitting damages suits against government officials can entail substantial social costs,including the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.anderson creighton,d.courts have accommodated this concern by generally providing government officials performing discretionary functions with a qualified immunity,shielding them from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.see malley briggs,d.
one of the purposes of qualified immunity is to spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability,but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn out lawsuit.siegert gilley,d.doctrinally speaking,qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.mitchell forsyth,d emphasis in original see siegert,at.at.as the supreme court has explained,qualified immunity affords protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley,at.at.the rule supports the need to protect officials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.in re city of philadelphia,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d citations omitted.
in order to defeat an assertion of qualified immunity,a plaintiff must allege that the official violated a clearly established right.anderson,at.at.a plaintiff does not fulfill this requirement simply by alleging the defendant violated some constitutional provision.rather,the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense.anderson,at.at emphasis added.as this court explained,clearly established rights are those with contours sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.a plaintiff need not show that
