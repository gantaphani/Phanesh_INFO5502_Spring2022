onondaga county sheriff department department deputies steven cox,thomas bingham,edward kalin,michael mccarty,and robert scott feldman appeal from judge mordue granting of summary judgment dismissing their complaint.that complaint asserted retaliation for their complaints of racial harassment to the equal opportunity employment commission eeoc,in violation of title vii.
we hold that the department initiation and conduct of an investigation into i the white appellants claims of racial harassment alleged to have been generated by an african american officer,and ii a complaint against appellants for filing false reports with the eeoc of such harassment,were not adverse employment actions.we also hold that threats by the department to charge appellants with making a false report to the eeoc established a prima facie case of illegal retaliation but that the department has shown a purpose,and appellants have presented no evidence of pretext.
background 
on review of a grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint,we view the record in the light most favorable to appellants.gallo prudential resid,cir.
the present dispute began when appellants cox,mccarty,feldman,and bingham,as well as a lieutenant,jim raus,shaved their heads to demonstrate solidarity with appellant kalin,a cancer patient who lost his hair as a result of chemotherapy treatments.all were employed as officers in the onondaga county sheriff department.on august,appellants and raus filed what is known as a blue form complaint,initiating an internal departmental procedure,alleging racial harassment.a blue form complaint usually results only in an informal investigation and not in a full investigation by the department internal investigation arm,the professional standards unit psu.
in the blue form complaint,the deputies and lieutenant stated that they had been the victims of rumors,based on their shaved heads,that they were skinheads members of a group.the complaint alleged that rumors and the talk in the custody division was then that the deputies and lieutenant raus were members of a skin head organization.
it also stated that this vicious labeling of the deputies and lieutenant was apparently started by a n african american deputy,who work ed with them in the transport unit.specifically,the blue form complaint alleged that an african american deputy,willis,had approached cox and questioned him about why his head was shaven.it further alleged that shortly thereafter,other,unnamed african american deputies approached cox,feldman,and mccarty and questioned them about their shaved heads.none of the inquiries,whether by willis or by the unnamed deputies,was alleged to have been accusatory or confrontational.finally,the complaint alleged the complainants belief that the rumors had made the workplace racially hostile and unsafe and in addition,put their families,wives and children in danger.it appears from developments described infra that while department employees had asked about why appellants heads were shaved and perhaps mentioned the existence of the rumors,the accusatory harassment was by inmates.
the department assistant chief wasilewski instructed former captain woloszyn to investigate the complainants allegations.woloszyn investigation concluded with a report dated october,that found no evidence of harassment.according to woloszyn report,certain deputies had inquired,but not in a hostile way,why the deputies had shaved their heads.according to woloszyn report,none of the appellants had heard department members directly accuse them of being skinheads.rather,they had heard only from others that such comments had been made.however,after being interviewed by woloszyn,lieutenant raus withdrew as a complainant because he was not approached by anyone and did not feel harassed but was misled by cox into believing that harassing conduct had occurred.
the woloszyn report settled little.the subsequent psu investigation,discussed infra,revealed that while woloszyn conclusions about the lack of testimony about accusatory behavior was correct so far as it went,he may not have actually interviewed appellants mccarty or bingham,or several other deputies,whom he claimed to have interviewed.nevertheless,with the assistance of president deputy dan mathews and a union attorney,the five appellants filed individual racial harassment complaints with the eeoc between september and october.
appellants eeoc complaints,which were under oath,differed materially from their blue form complaint.instead of alleging,as they did in the blue form complaint,a encounter in which willis simply asked cox why his head was shaven,cox and mccarty stated to the eeoc that an unnamed african american deputy had accused them of being skinheads in a face to face confrontation.on this record,the reference to an african american deputy has to be understood to be willis.willis is the only african american deputy mentioned by name in the blue form complaint,which strongly implies all but expressly states that willis is the source of the allegedly harassing rumors.the psu investigation,described infra,collected testimony that willis was believed by all to be the source.the complaint in the present matter named willis as a defendant and directly alleged that the hostile environment was fanned by the actions of defendant willis.on this record,the reference to an unnamed african american deputy would have been understood,then and now,to mean willis.finally,statements by cox,mccarty and feldman indicated prior,hostile,but unrelated,encounters with willis.nothing in appellants brief claims that anyone but willis was believed to be the source of the alleged harassment.
feldman and bingham also complained that they had heard from other deputies that they had been referred to as skinheads and called racist by african american deputies.kalin complaint stated that he had been confronted with the existence of rumors that he was a skinhead.every appellant complained that the department had acted upon similar complaints of harassment by african american deputies but failed to act upon theirs.
on october,the department filed a response with the eeoc,signed by assistant chief wasilewski.the response stated that wasilewski could find no merit to the harassment alleged in either the blue form or the eeoc complaint filed by appellants.it also stated that the employer has made every effort to determine if any harassment has occurred in this incident.in furtherance of that end,i have submitted this entire package to the onondaga county sheriff office professional standards unit,our internal investigation arm,for their review,recommendation,and interdiction.the submission to the psu was pursuant to a written onondaga policy that harassment complaints were to be investigated by the psu at the department chief direction.
on december,the eeoc dismissed all appellants complaints and issued a notice to appellants of their right to sue within days.however,appellants never pursued the harassment claim further.
the psu continued with its investigation.when it commenced,it had before it i the original blue form complaint ii the individual eeoc complaints iii lieutenant raus written withdrawal of his blue form complaint iv the october,report of captain woloszyn and v the october,statement to the eeoc.also before the psu was a misconduct allegation by assistant chief wasilewski that he forwarded to the psu on november.he alleged that cox,mccarty,feldman,bingham,kalin,and lieutenant raus violated departmental regulations by filing false reports this allegation was presumably based on the inconsistent factual claims asserted in the blue form complaint and eeoc filings.wasilewski misconduct complaint also accused woloszyn of false statements,presumably for claiming interviews in his report.
the psu thus had before it a variety of issues i whether appellants had been racially harassed because of rumors started by willis that they were skinheads ii whether appellants complaints of racial harassment generated by willis were knowingly false and iii whether woloszyn had made a false report regarding his investigation into i.
the issues were yet more complicated.the misconduct complaint in ii,if upheld,would support an inference that several white officers had engaged in a coordinated effort to harass willis,who had earlier prevailed in a title vii lawsuit against the department alleging a hostile work environment and retaliation.see willis onondaga county sheriff department,cv gts ghl,dkt.the existence of racial tension in the department at pertinent times is evident from the record,as is the belief of appellants that their grievances were treated less sympathetically than those of african american officers,particularly willis.
in that context,sergeant smith began the psu investigation.smith interviewed the appellants individually,in the presence of a union representative.none of them,including mccarty and cox,claimed to have been called a skinhead to their face by another deputy.appellants,and most of the other officers in the department who were interviewed,reported the existence,even persistent existence,of rumors that appellants were skinheads.however,none had heard any officer make such an allegation,albeit several officers made inquiries as to why appellants had shaved their heads.some officers also testified to the existence of rumors that willis had started the rumors.in his interview with sergeant smith,which took place about two weeks after appellants interviews,willis flatly denied that he had said anything to suggest the deputies were skinheads and stated that the whole affair put undue stress on him in his work.
during the individual interviews of appellants,each was informed that disciplinary action against them was being considered based on the falsity of the eeoc filings.in addition to being questioned on how the skinhead rumors had started and the inconsistencies in some of their allegations,appellants were each questioned about the woloszyn investigation.
two reports resulted from the psu investigation.the first,dated january,summarized former captain woloszyn failure to thoroughly investigate the original blue form complaint as well as his submission of a false and misleading report to assistant chief wasilewski in violation of sections and of the department policies and procedures.see note,supra.
the second,dated january,summarized the circumstances found to involve a violation of department policies and procedures in the filing of a false eeoc report by cox and mccarty.this was based on cox and mccarty conceded lack of knowledge of harassment or confrontational behavior by willis,even though each alleged a confrontation with willis in the eeoc complaint.
however,sheriff walsh,the head of the department,decided not to take any official action against cox and mccarty.former captain woloszyn was demoted.between appellants interviews and sheriff walsh decision not to pursue charges against them,cox and matthews,the union president,unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a copy of the psu report upon the conclusion of the investigation.
on february,appellants filed a second round of eeoc complaints,this time alleging that the psu investigation and threats of false reports charges were illegal retaliation for their harassment complaints.the eeoc found evidence of retaliation,finding the department decision to investigate and consider disciplinary action against appellants for making false allegations in an eeoc complaint to have been discriminatory.it noted that such actions might have had a chilling effect upon the willingness of individuals to speak out against employment discrimination or to participate in the eeoc administrative process or other employment discrimination proceedings.
appellants were issued notices of their right to sue and timely filed the present action on april.they alleged,in pertinent part,that they were victims of a hostile work environment and unlawful retaliation by the various appellees in violation of title vii and exec.law.appellants also alleged violations of,and the fourteenth amendment and article,section,of the new york state constitution.judge mccurn dismissed the claims asserted under and the title vii hostile work environment claims sua sponte.cox onondaga cnty.sheriff dep cv npm,pist.lexis.the remaining claims were later dismissed on a grant of summary judgment by judge mordue,who held that there was no evidence of a requisite adverse employment action.cox onondaga cnty.sheriff dep t,cv nam,dist.lexis.
appellants have appealed the dismissal only of the retaliation claim.they also claim that judge mordue should have recused himself because of a prior relationship with sheriff walsh.
discussion 
we review an appeal from a grant of summary judgment de novo.see,terry ashcroft,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.we may,however,affirm on any ground with support in the record.mcelwee county of orange,cir.
in order to show a prima facie case of retaliation in response to a motion for summary judgment,a plaintiff must submit sufficient admissible evidence to allow a trier of fact to find i conduct by the plaintiff that is protected activity under title vii ii of which the employer was aware iii followed by an adverse employment action of a nature that would deter a reasonable employee from making or supporting a discrimination claim iv that was causally connected to the protected activity.kessler westchester cnty.dep t of soc,cir 
once an employee establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to put forth evidence of a rationale.see holt kmi continental,cir.once the employer has done so,the employee may prevail by demonstrating that the stated rationale is mere pretext.jute hamilton sundstrand,cir.the employee at all times bears the burden of persuasion to show a retaliatory motive.cosgrove sears,roebuck,cir.the district court held that appellants had failed to establish a prima facie case because they had suffered no adverse employment action.
appellants argue that several aspects of the psu investigation amount to the requisite adverse employment actions i the investigation was conducted by the psu instead of within the department in contrast to other investigations of allegations of harassment or hostile work environment that were handled internally ii the psu interview of deputy willis was less confrontational than their own iii the psu interviews were more preoccupied with the failings of captain woloszyn investigation and the authorship of appellants paperwork and filings than with the substance of their allegations and iv appellants request for a copy of the psu report was denied on the grounds that disciplinary action was pending.we deal separately,infra,with the portion of appellants retaliation claim resulting from the fact that they were informed during the investigation that they could be brought up on criminal and administrative charges based on their false complaint to the eeoc.
as noted,adverse employment actions are those that well might dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,d internal quotations and citations omitted.however,c ontext matters,and so the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.id.at.
a the psu investigation 
an employer investigation of an eeoc complaint alleging racial harassment without more that is,without additional particularized facts evidencing a retaliatory intent and resulting in,or amounting to,adverse job consequences for the complainant can not sustain a valid retaliation complaint.
while the relevant statutory provisions do not require an employer investigation,as was the case in malik carrier,cir federal law required investigation into workplace sexual harassment failure to do so was basis for employer liability,they clearly contemplate that employers facing charges before the eeoc will fully inform themselves of all relevant circumstances.after a complaint has been filed,in writing under oath or affirmation,the commission must give notice to the employer within days.b.then the commission investigates.after the eeoc has determined that there is reasonable ca
