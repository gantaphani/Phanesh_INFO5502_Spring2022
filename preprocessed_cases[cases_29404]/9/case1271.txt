background 
petrosino employment at bell atlantic 
from september until february,lisa petrosino was employed by bell atlantic as an installation and repairs i r technician at its edgewater garage on staten island,new york.for the last seven years of her employment,she was the only female i r technician at the edgewater garage.petrosino work consisted of installing and repairing residential and commercial telephone systems,cables,and support systems on staten island,both within buildings and on telephone poles.each morning,petrosino and her would meet at the garage with their supervisors for approximately half an hour,during which time they received the day assignments.occasional interaction with and supervisors would also occur throughout the day.
a.the hostile work environment 
petrosino asserts that throughout her employment at bell atlantic edgewater garage,she was subjected to a work environment hostile to women.the hostility took two forms persistent sexually offensive remarks and sexual graffiti that conveyed a low regard for women,and specific comments or actions toward petrosino that made plain that this negative view of women extended to her and to her work performance.
the general work atmosphere 
petrosino has adduced evidence demonstrating that the work environment at the edgewater garage was more reminiscent of a locker room than a place of business profanity was commonplace,and crude humor was routine.but the focus of petrosino complaint is not on this conduct but on the sexually demeaning conversations that were also an accepted part of the daily work environment.although male often insulted each other in these exchanges,the substance of their remarks always conveyed a profound disrespect for women further,when working outdoors,petrosino would constantly confront crude sexual graffiti scrawled by inside terminal boxes.among the images depicted were headless women with their legs in the air,women legs wide open,men with their penises out,and men having sex with animals.a further theme of the graffiti was that bell atlantic employees male and female performed sex acts on supervisors to advance their careers.
comments directed toward petrosino 
petrosino made plain that she was not exempted from the generally low view of women communicated by the sexually offensive garage banter and graffiti.a few months after she began working at bell atlantic,at a december christmas party,petrosino was physically attacked from behind in a parking lot by charles degenhardt,who groped and kissed her.when petrosino shouted for help,other employees pulled degenhardt away,but for months thereafter,the incident was a big joke at the garage and the subject of graffiti.petrosino,july,hereinafter petrosino dep.iii,at in the ensuing years,frequent disparaging remarks were made with reference to petrosino ass,her tits,her menstrual cycle,her weight,and her eating habits,and at least one drawing depicted her performing a sex act on a supervisor.further,the disparagement was not limited to private exchanges,but extended to supervisors comments relating to her job performance.
for example,petrosino direct supervisor from to,robert sharib,punctuated his conversations with her with hostile comments,referring to petrosino as a damn woman,petrosino,hereinafter petrosino dep.i,at,telling her to calm her big tits down,petrosino aff,and dismissing her job concerns as attributable to her menstrual cycle,see id.he accused me several times of being on the rag whenever i had a dispute with him.on one occasion,sharib humiliated petrosino by taking a doctor note that she had brought to work,enlarging it to poster size,and displaying it in the office.
petrosino also points to remarks by tom archdecon,her manager throughout her employment at bell atlantic.in discussions with petrosino about her work,archdecon not only told her that as an individual,she was too to belong in her work assignment,he cast this observation all the time in terms,stating that women as a group were too simple,too sensitive,and too damn to work at the garage.petrosino dep.i,at.over the years,several managers told petrosino that she would never be permitted to assume managerial responsibilities as long as archdecon was an i r supervisor.see infra at.
archdecon gender hostility toward petrosino was echoed by frank mangiero,petrosino direct supervisor from to.on many occasions,he called her a damn woman and told her that if she could not handle working in i r,maybe women ca handle it.petrosino dep.ii,at.in front of petrosino male,he also linked her work deportment to her menstrual cycle,telling her do give me a hard time just because you on the rag.petrosino dep.iii,at.mangiero repeatedly cited petrosino for minor job infractions,such as using a company vehicle to get coffee for another supervisor and playing her truck radio too loudly,without similarly reporting male employees.he made her repeat tasks unnecessarily.on one occasion,he refused petrosino request to use a bucket truck to perform an assignment safely,only to allow a male worker to use the truck when the task was reassigned to him.
petrosino complaints of harassment 
petrosino asserts that throughout her employment she complained informally and formally about the environment at the edgewater garage.for example,she repeatedly told and supervisors that she found the constant sexual banter at the garage offensive and demeaning,but no steps were ever taken to address the problem.to the contrary,offending workers ridiculed her concerns by offering sarcastic apologies,only to persist thereafter in their vulgar exchanges.
in,petrosino filed a labor grievance charging robert sharib with harassment although she prevailed,she asserts no actual discipline was imposed.instead,sharib and petrosino were sent to a seminar to help them work out their differences.when petrosino attempted to use the opportunity to voice her concerns,sharib told her just keep your mouth shut and do what i tell you.petrosino dep.i,at.petrosino complained about this comment to a senior manager,who offered to transfer her to brooklyn,and assured her she would have no further problems.soon after petrosino declined the transfer offer,sharib scolded her for going over his head and warned her never to do that again.he then relieved her of responsibilities that would have prepared her for a future management position 
sometime in or,a female administrative manager asked petrosino why she no longer worked overtime.petrosino explained that she avoided overtime to stay away from her,mangiero,who harrasse d her and bother ed her.petrosino dep.iii,at.petrosino asserts that no one at bell atlantic pursued the matter.some months later,in may,petrosino called bell atlantic ethics hotline to complain formally that mangiero harassed her because she was the only female in his group.petrosino request to discuss her concerns with a female counselor were rebuffed,and no one from bell atlantic ever followed up on this complaint 
b.the failure to promote petrosino 
in addition to being subjected to a environment,petrosino asserts that she was denied promotion opportunities at the edgewater garage because she was a woman.
the promotion practice at the edgewater garage 
the record reveals that a relatively complex but informal system of promotion operated at the edgewater garage.in addition to official supervisory positions,manager,manager,there were two types of acting manager positions temporary acting managers who filled in for supervisors who were out of the office for a few days or weeks and permanent acting managers who supervised a team of workers on a basis but who were not yet official managers usually because of budgetary and bureaucratic delays.selection as an official manager was generally contingent on having performed successfully as a permanent acting manager for the same position.further,permanent acting managers were usually selected from persons who had previously served as temporary acting managers.
until,bell atlantic maintained no formal system for listing available official or acting manager positions.workers would express their interest in a position to a supervisor who would then present their names to a promotions committee.in,bell atlantic instituted the departmental interview system to formalize the promotion process.under this system,job openings were posted where all employees could see them,and employees could apply directly rather than through their supervisors for a listed position by submitting a formal written application form and undergoing an interview.according to petrosino,this system was never fully implemented at the edgewater garage.indeed,she and some of her profess never to have heard of the system.moreover,one i r supervisor conceded that he never used the system in making promotions,and another acknowledged that,despite the system,managers continued grooming favored candidates for particular promotions.
petrosino requests for promotion 
as already noted,in,petrosino was performing job responsibilities that might have assisted her in receiving a future managerial promotion.she was relieved of those responsibilities by her,robert sharib,after she charged him with harassment.
sometime in or,petrosino expressed an interest in a managerial promotion to her charles degenhardt the same individual involved in the december assault.soon thereafter,degenhardt asked petrosino if she would be interested in serving as a temporary acting supervisor when he was out,and petrosino enthusiastically agreed.the following morning,when petrosino arrived for work at the usual time,degenhardt informed her that she had just missed the training class for acting supervisors.petrosino asserts that she was never told about such a training class,much less one scheduled outside normal work hours.when the scenario repeated itself the next day,petrosino concluded that degenhardt was playing a joke at her expense,that he never intended her to serve as acting supervisor,and that he was simply ridiculing her managerial aspirations.
on various occasions in,and,petrosino repeated her interest in becoming a manager to supervisors joseph,frank mangiero,william deleon,and michael russo.each told her that she should forget that idea as long as tom archdecon was an i r supervisor,petrosino dep.i,at joe said tom archdecon will never let you act.petrosino dep.ii,at frank mangiero,will deleon told me as long as tom archdecon is around,i did stand a chance mike russo also told me the same thing,that as long as tom is around,i do stand a chance.
when,in the summer of,it was rumored that archdecon was leaving i r,petrosino approached russo,then her supervisor,and reiterated her interest in an acting manager assignment.russo agreed to sponsor her,and by october,petrosino was serving short stints as a temporary acting manager,substituting as an administrative foreman for cathy hopkins,and as a field foreman for her supervisor deleon 
constructive discharge 
a few months later,on february,petrosino resigned from bell atlantic.she submits that she was constructively discharged because events in the preceding month had rendered her work situation intolerable.
in january,petrosino spoke with russo about a canvas seeking technicians to transfer to the cable maintenance cx m department and asked him about the likelihood of her receiving a permanent acting supervisor promotion anytime in the near future in i russo told her that he did not anticipate any such openings because the i r managers were all relatively young.he suggested she might do better in cx m because the managers in that department were older.when petrosino asked deleon his views,he told her that she should go to cx m because she would not receive a promotion while archdecon was in i petrosino asserts that she volunteered for a transfer,relying on these supervisors advice,and was accepted.
around the same time,petrosino also spoke with a cx m supervisor about her interest in a managerial promotion.the supervisor told her that a number of people in cx m were already serving as acting managers and being groomed for future permanent positions.thus,petrosino would likely have to work in the department for at least one year before being considered for a managerial assignment.he did,however,report the possibility that a new gang might be created at cx 
meanwhile,petrosino discovered that for the remainder of her time in i asserts the formal transfer process could have taken several did not intend to assign her as his temporary acting manager.he explained that it would be unfair to those remaining in i r to have someone who was leaving the department serve in this capacity.accordingly,he began to train mike martine as temporary acting foreman.martine had also volunteered for a cx m transfer,but,unlike petrosino,he was not yet formally scheduled for reassignment 
petrosino concluded that her situation was untenable because she was scheduled to transfer to cx m,she was no longer eligible for temporary acting manager assignments at i r but she was unlikely to be considered for promotion at cx m for more than a year.confronting this dilemma,she made no inquiry as to whether she could decline the cx m transfer,remain in i r,and continue to receive temporary supervisor assignments in that department.instead,she simply resigned from bell atlantic.
ii.procedural history 
after filing a complaint with the eeoc on april,charging bell atlantic with employment discrimination and receiving a right to sue letter,petrosino filed this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on july.
a.the district court award of summary judgment to bell atlantic 
on august,bell atlantic moved for summary judgment.in a memorandum and order dated march,the district court granted the motion.it concluded that petrosino had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of severe or pervasive harassment based on gender to support a hostile work environment claim.petrosino bell atlantic,wl,at.the district court further concluded that petrosino failure to identify a specific managerial position for which she applied and was rejected necessarily precluded her from pursuing a discriminatory promotion claim.see id.at.finally,the district court concluded that petrosino could not succeed on a constructive discharge claim because she had failed to adduce evidence from which a jury could conclude that bell atlantic had intentionally rendered her work conditions intolerable.see id.at.
b.the denial of the motions pursuant to.and b 
petrosino moved pursuant to.b to be relieved from the award of summary judgment based on newly discovered evidence that bell atlantic failed to disclose in response to a discovery demand.she requested sanctions pursuant to.based on the alleged misconduct in discovery.we briefly outline the facts pertinent to these motions.
during discovery,petrosino served interrogatories on bell atlantic,requesting,inter alia,information regarding other sexual harassment suits or complaints.see interrogatory has any employee of bell atlantic ever filed a complaint or lawsuit alleging that bell atlantic discriminated in new york city based on sex.bell atlantic response,received january,did not disclose the existence of a new york state suit filed by tisi,a bell atlantic employee,who,since may,had worked on staten island in petrosino former department.tisi complaint also charges bell atlantic with sexual harassment in maintaining a work environment.
the district court denied petrosino rule b motion concluding that the new evidence was neither admissible nor likely to have produced a different result.it also denied sanctions finding that the information fell outside the general temporal limits of the discovery requests.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court award of summary judgment de novo,see mack otis elevator,cir,cert.denied,d,resolving all factual ambiguities and crediting all inferences,including those relating to credibility,in favor of petrosino,see brown henderson,cir.we will affirm the award only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and if bell atlantic is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
ii.statute of limitations 
an aggrieved employee wishing to bring a title vii claim in district court must file an administrative complaint with the eeoc within days of the alleged discriminatory act.see elmenayer abf freight,cir citing e.petrosino filed her discrimination charge with the eeoc on april,thus,the limitations period in her case began days earlier,on june.
when,as in this case,a plaintiff allegations of discrimination extend beyond the limitations period,the nature of the claim determines what consideration will be given to the earlier conduct.for example,in the case of a hostile work environment claim,the statute of limitations requires that only one sexually harassing act demonstrating the challenged work environment occur within days of filing once that is shown,a court and jury may consider the entire time period of the hostile environment in determining liability.passenger morgan,d.because petrosino does point to some allegedly actions occurring after june,the district court correctly found her hostile work environment claim timely and properly considered earlier events dating back to in support of this claim.we will do the same.
other title vii claims,such as those for termination or failure to promote,are based on discrete acts,each giving rise to a separate cause of action.id.at.the law is clear that termination and promotion claims may not be based on discrete acts falling outside the limitations period.id.no timeliness concerns arise with respect to petrosino termination claim because it is based on a single event,her alleged constructive discharge on february,which falls well within the limitations period.with respect to her claim of persistent promotion denials throughout her bell atlantic employment,however,petrosino can sue only for denials occurring after june.nevertheless,evidence of earlier promotion denials may constitute relevant background evidence in support of a timely claim,and we will consider it as such.id.at.accord bonner guccione,cir citing united air lines,evans,d.
iii.the claims of gender discrimination 
title vii of the civil rights act of states it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual sex.a the purpose of this provision is to prevent disparate treatment of men and women in employment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d internal quotation marks omitted.petrosino asserts that she was the victim of three forms of sex discrimination she was subjected to a hostile work environment amounting to sexual harassment,she was denied promotion opportunities,and she was constructively discharged.we examine each of these claims in turn.
hostile work environment 
in meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,the supreme court made plain that title vii prohibition of sex discrimination extends to sexual harassment.at.s exual harassment includes conduct that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual work performance or creating an intimidating,hostile,or offensive working environment.fitzgerald henderson,cir quoting a.to prevail on a claim of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment,a plaintiff must establish two elements that the workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his or her work environment,and that a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer.mack otis elevator,at quoting richardson state dep t of corr,cir.
petrosino work environment 
the first element of a hostile work environment claim has both an objective and subjective component the misconduct must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive.terry ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,bell atlantic does not contest that petrosino subjectively experienced her work environment as hostile.thus,we focus on whether petrosino work environment could objectively be deemed hostile to women.
the district court concluded that no jury could reasonably find petrosino work environment objectively hostile to women.in so ruling,it decided,first,that evidence of incessant sexually offensive exchanges at the daily assignment meeting and omnipresent sexual graffiti in the terminal boxes could not support petrosino claim,because this conduct,while undeniably boorish and offensive,was not motivated by hostility toward petrosino because of her sex.petrosino bell atlantic,wl,at.rather,it applied equally to all employees,male and female.second,the district court concluded that the remaining alleged incidents of harassment,even when viewed as a whole,were insufficiently severe or pervasive to establish a sexually discriminatory hostile work environment.see id.at.we disagree.
common exposure of male and female employees to sexually offensive comments and graffiti 
title vii prohibits discriminat ion because of sex.oncale sundowner offshore,d emphasis in original.thus,a work environment which is equally harsh for both men and women can not support a claim for sex discrimination.brennan metropolitan opera ass n,cir accord brown henderson,at.the mere fact that men and women are both exposed to the same offensive circumstances on the job site,however,does not mean that,as a matter of law,their work conditions are necessarily equally harsh.the objective hostility of a work environment depends on the totality of the circumstances.see harris forklift,d terry ashcroft,at.further,the perspective from which the evidence must be assessed is that of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances including the social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target.oncale sundowner offshore,at internal quotation marks omitted.
there is some ambiguity in our case law as to whether,in a case such as this,a reasonable person in the plaintiff position must be a woman or a person drawn from the public at large.compare torres pisano,cir assessing challenged conduct from perspective of a reasonable woman,with richardson state dep t of corr,at rejecting view that reasonable person is limited to members of the plaintiff protected class in fact,we need not choose between these two options because we conclude that the evidence in this case,viewed in the light most favorable to petrosino,would permit a jury to conclude that a reasonable person,regardless of gender,would consider the sexually offensive comments and graffiti here at issue more offensive to women than to men and,therefore,discriminatory based on sex.
the comments and graphics that permeated petrosino work environment may have sexually ridiculed both men and women,but there is an important,though not surprising,distinction.the conduct at issue sexually ridiculed some men,but it also frequently touted the sexual exploits of others.in short,the insults were directed at certain men,not men as a group.by contrast,the depiction of women in the offensive jokes and graphics was uniformly sexually demeaning and communicated the message that women as a group were available for sexual exploitation by men.such workplace disparagement of women,repeated day after day over the course of several years without supervisory intervention,stands as a serious impediment to any woman efforts to deal professionally with her male colleagues.
the fact that much of this offensive material was not directed specifically at,her male would likely have traded sexual insults every morning and defaced terminal boxes with sexual graffiti regardless of petrosino presence in the i r not,as a matter of law,preclude a jury from finding that the conduct subjected petrosino to a hostile work environment based on her sex.indeed,the fourth circuit,sitting en banc,recently reached this same conclusion in a case involving a work environment strikingly similar to that alleged by petrosino an production shop except for the female plaintiff suffused with and sexist talk and conduct.ocheltree scollon,cir en banc,cert.denied,d and,d.the employer contended that the offensive conduct could not be deemed discriminatory based on sex because it could have been heard or seen by anyone present in the shop and was equally offensive to some of the men.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court disagreed,concluding that a jury could find m uch of the conduct particularly offensive to women and intended to provoke plaintiff reaction as a woman.id.judge michael,the author of the en banc decision,had convincingly made this same point in his earlier panel dissent by employing a powerful hypothetical 
suppose,for example,that an plaintiff brings a race discrimination claim alleging a hostile work environment due to his coworkers daily use of the meanest racial slur against.suppose further that the workplace had previously been all white and that the pattern of racial slurs was the same both before and after the plaintiff arrival.the majority reasoning suggests that if the employer could show that none of the racial slurs were directed at the plaintiff and that he would have been exposed to exactly the same language if he had been white,the harassment in this example could not be because of race.yet i find it difficult to believe that any court would fail to find harassment in these facts.if the right to be free from a racially hostile work environment means anything at all,surely it includes the right to be free from a workplace permeated by racial slurs.
ocheltree scollon,cir michael,dissenting in part and concurring in the judgment in part,rev en banc.we note that this analysis parallels that of judge newman who,writing separately in brennan metropolitan opera association,observed that d isplays of photos of blacks being lynched or of nude women in sexually provocative poses would not be insulated from title vii claims simply because the photos were observable by all office employees,white and black,male and female.at newman,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the majority in brennan found it unnecessary to reach this issue to resolve that particular case,see id.at,but we now adopt judge newman reasoning and that of the fourth circuit in rejecting bell atlantic argument that the common exposure of male and female workers to sexually offensive material necessarily precludes a woman from relying on such evidence to establish a hostile work environment based on sex.see also robinson jacksonville shipyards,holding that sexually provocative pictures of nude and partially nude women,which were put up before any female employees joined the workplace,had a disproportionately demeaning impact on female employees and,as such,convey ed the message that women do not belong.
in sum,although all bell atlantic employees at the edgewater garage were routinely exposed to sexually offensive language and graphics,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find this conduct more demeaning of women than men and,therefore,the evidence should not have been excluded from an assessment of the totality of circumstances in considering bell atlantic motion for summary judgment.
b.the severity and pervasiveness of the challenged conduct 
in reviewing the totality of the evidence adduced by petrosino in support of her hostile work environment claim,we are mindful that title vii does not establish a general civility code for the american workplace.oncale sundowner offshore,at.simple teasing,offhand comments,or isolated incidents of offensive conduct unless extremely serious will not support a claim of discriminatory harassment.see holtz rockefeller,cir.to defeat bell atlantic motion for summary judgment,petrosino must adduce evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment.harris forklift,at.quoting meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,at.accord cruz coach stores,cir.
as we have already observed,a reasonable jury could conclude that the persistent sexually offensive remarks at the edgewater garage and the graffiti at outdoor work sites were particularly insulting to women because these actions cast women in a demeaning role as objects of ridicule and subjects for sexual exploitation.it is within this context that the remaining evidence of sexual harassment must be considered.in this light,petrosino sexual assault by a drunken within a few months of joining the i r department might well be viewed by a reasonable jury not simply as an isolated incident but as a tangible extension of the pervasive demeaning talk to petrosino personally.the assault communicated to petrosino that she was perceived,at least by one,not as a professional colleague,but as one more woman available for sexual exploitation.the fact that for some time thereafter petrosino male treated the assault as a subject for office jokes and graffiti only reinforced this perception similarly,the men sarcastic apologies when petrosino attempted to limit their sexually offensive exchanges supports an inference that they were deliberately attempting to provoke her reaction as a woman.ocheltree scollon,at.further,the link the drew between their perceptions of petrosino professional defects and her anatomy,especially their vulgar references to her breasts and menstrual cycle,likewise communicated that her gender would always stand as a bar to full acceptance within the workplace.indeed,petrosino work concerns were routinely dismissed in terms she,like all women,was simply too and sensitive to work successfully in i 
we thus conclude that bell atlantic can not demonstrate from the totality of this evidence that,as a matter of law,no reasonable jury could conclude that the atmosphere at the edgewater garage was insufficiently severe and pervasive to support petrosino claim of harassment and,therefore,discrimination,based on sex.to the extent the district court concluded otherwise,we reverse.
bell atlantic liability for the hostile work environment 
because the district court concluded that bell atlantic was entitled to summary judgment on the first element of a hostile work environment claim,it did not reach the second element whether any harassing conduct can fairly be imputed to the employer for purposes of assessing liability.see mack otis elevator,at.bell atlantic submits that,on the record before this court,this question of vicarious liability can be resolved in its favor as a matter of law,thereby providing an alternative ground for affirming the district court award of summary judgment.in the exercise of our discretion and in the interests of judicial economy,we address this issue,see booking general star mgmt,cir recognizing appellate court discretion to consider issues raised in the district court but not resolved there,and conclude that disputed issues of fact preclude a summary award in favor of bell atlantic on the second as well as the first element of a hostile work environment claim.
the supreme court has ruled that employers are not automatically liable for sexual harassment perpetrated by their employees.see burlington,ellerth,d faragher city of boca raton,d.where an employee is the victim of sexual harassment,including harassment in the form of a hostile work environment,by,an employer vicarious liability depends on the plaintiff showing that the employer knew or reasonably should have known about the harassment but failed to take appropriate remedial action.see faragher city of boca raton,at accord whidbee garzarelli food specialties,cir.where the harassment is attributed to a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee,a court looks first to whether the supervisor behavior culminate d in a tangible employment action against the employee,burlington,ellerth,at.if it did,the employer will,ipso facto,be vicariously liable,mack otis elevator,at.in the absence of such tangible action,an employer will still be liable for a hostile work environment created by its supervisors unless it successfully establishes as an affirmative defense that a it exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,and b the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.burlington,ellerth,at.accord faragher city of boca raton,at.mack otis elevator,at.
in this case,petrosino asserts that bell atlantic is automatically vicariously liable for the work environment created by its employees and supervisors because that conduct culminated in two tangible adverse employment actions her failure to receive managerial promotions and her constructive discharge.see pennsylvania state police suders,d holding that constructive discharge may qualify as a tangible employment action depriving employer of right to assert affirmative defense when a supervisor official act precipitates the constructive discharge mormol costco wholesale,cir observing that a tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits quoting burlington,ellerth,at.because we affirm the district court award of summary judgment to bell atlantic on petrosino promotion and discharge claims,see infra part iii b c,a question arises as to whether she can persist in her assertion of automatic vicarious liability on the surviving hostile work environment claim.mindful that the parties have not had an opportunity to brief this point,we do not attempt to resolve it now.the parties may,however,pursue the matter on remand in the district court.
even if we assume that bell atlantic can not be held automatically liable but can assert an affirmative defense to liability,we nevertheless conclude that the assertion of that defense presents disputed questions of material fact that necessarily preclude an award of summary judgment with regard to petrosino surviving hostile work environment claim.specifically,to support the reasonable care element of the affirmative defense,bell atlantic relies on its documented corporate policy against sexual harassment,including its establishment of an ethics hotline,which allows employees to report incidents of harassment.certainly,o ne way for employers to demonstrate that they exercised reasonable care is to show that they had an policy in place,but that fact alone is not necessarily dispositive.mack otis elevator,at.in this case,petrosino does not dispute the existence of bell atlantic complaint hotline,but she does challenge its effectiveness in promptly correcting reported sexual harassment.she asserts that when she telephoned the hotline in may to complain of gender discrimination by her supervisor mangiero,her request to discuss her concerns with a female counselor was refused.thereafter,no one investigated her complaint or took any remedial action.bell atlantic disputes this account and produces documentary evidence suggesting that petrosino failed to return calls.it further asserts that petrosino unreasonably failed to pursue her claim or her other charges of sexual harassment with further calls to the hotline.bell atlantic argument is not without appeal,but on review of a motion for summary judgment,we can not ourselves resolve the parties factual disagreement.we are obliged to view the evidence in the light most favorable to petrosino,which means that we must assume that a factfinder will credit her version of events and conclude that bell atlantic failed adequately to investigate and promptly to correct her formal and informal reports of sexual harassment.with that assumption in mind,we can not conclude as a matter of law that bell atlantic has so conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of its policy or the unreasonableness of petrosino actions to be absolved from liability for any environment created by its employees and supervisors at the edgewater garage.
accordingly,we reverse the award of summary judgment to bell atlantic on petrosino claim of sexual harassment in the form of a hostile work environment and remand this portion of the case for trial.
failure to promote 
petrosino complains that throughout her employment with bell atlantic she was also unfairly denied promotion based on her sex.as we have already explained,because promotion denials are viewed as discrete acts of discrimination,petrosino may only sue for events occurring after june.petrosino unsuccessful attempts to secure promotion before that date may only be considered as relevant background to the extent petrosino establishes timely claims.
to establish a prima facie case of a discriminatory failure to promote,a title vii plaintiff must ordinarily demonstrate that she is a member of a protected class she applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants she was rejected for the position and the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants having the plaintiff qualifications.brown coach stores,cir quoting mcdonnell douglas green,d.in awarding summary judgment to bell atlantic,the district court concluded that petrosino had failed to satisfy the second element of a prima facie case she did not identify any position within the limitations period for which she had filed a formal application and was rejected.petrosino bell atlantic,wl,at.on appeal,petrosino challenges this conclusion,submitting that,under the informal promotion process in effect at the edgewater garage,she adequately applied for management positions by telling her managers that she wanted to be a manager.appellant br.at.
petrosino argument is foreclosed by our decision in brown coach stores,at,which emphasizes that the second element of a prima facie case can not be established merely with evidence that a plaintiff generally requested promotion consideration.a specific application is required to ensure that,at the very least,the plaintiff employee alleges a particular adverse employment action,an instance of alleged discrimination,by the employer.id.further,the requirement ensures that the fact finder is not left to speculate as to the qualifications of the competing candidates,the damages to be derived from the salary of unknown jobs,the availability of alternative positions,the plaintiff willingness to serve in them,in other locales or on other shifts.the requirement also protects employers from the unfair burden of having to keep track of all employees who have generally expressed an interest in promotion and to consider each of them for any opening for which they are qualified but did not specifically apply.id.certainly,the rule is not inflexible.the law recognizes that the facts of a particular case may sometimes make a specific application a quixotic requirement.id.but the exception is narrow and does not pertain simply because an employee asserts that an aura of discrimination in the workplace somehow discouraged her from filing a formal application.id.rather,to be excused from the specific application requirement,an employee must demonstrate that the vacancy at issue was not posted,and the employee either had a no knowledge of the vacancy before it was filled or b attempted to apply for it through informal procedures endorsed by the employer.see id.at.
as already noted,the managerial jobs available to petrosino fit into three categories official manager,permanent acting manager,and temporary acting manager.there is considerable factual dispute between the parties about how bell atlantic employees learned of managerial vacancies and how supervisors filled these positions,even after implementation of the company departmental interview system.because we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to petrosino,we assume that many employees,petrosino included,could not reasonably have known about all available positions through the company posting policy that employees often applied for jobs,at least in the first instance,by speaking informally with supervisors and that bell atlantic managers often groomed favored candidates for specific managerial positions.while these facts may satisfy the first prong of the specific application exception,they do not satisfy the second because they do not excuse petrosino failure to apply,at least informally,for the specific management positions that she knew were vacant in her department.see id.
focusing first on official manager positions,petrosino notes that three employees who had served as permanent acting managers william deleon,richard mancino,and louis lugiero were named official managers for these same positions in early.precisely because these positions had been held for some time by persons serving in an acting manager capacity,petrosino can not claim that she was unaware of the corresponding official manager vacancies the only thing she did not know was exactly when bell atlantic would make an official appointment.thus,posting failures may have excused her from filing a timely formal application for these official manager vacancies,but that would not excuse her from informally applying for the positions by telling her supervisors that she wished to be considered for these three official manager openings when bell atlantic decided to fill them.not only has petrosino failed to adduce any evidence of informal applications for these specific official positions,the evidence she has produced indicates that her informal discussions with supervisors about promotions during the limitations period all pertained to acting manager appointments 
q you asked mike russo,you told him you wanted a permanent management position as soon as possible,correct 
a no.i wanted to act.i did say permanent.i wanted an acting position.i wanted to act.that was my request.
a i was shooting low.i wanted to act.i was did ask for a management position.i asked to act.
petrosino dep,at.thus,we conclude that petrosino can not,as a matter of law,pursue a discrimination claim for failure to promote her within the limitations period to an official manager position.
to the extent the evidence viewed most favorably to petrosino indicates that she informally applied for acting manager positions within the i r department,we note that she produces no evidence of any permanent acting manager vacancies in i r within the limitations period.rather,the appointment of official managers in appears to have eliminated the need for corresponding permanent acting managers.thus,petrosino can not raise a timely failure to promote claim as to any permanent acting manager position.
insofar as petrosino sought temporary acting manager assignments,the record indicates that russo acted favorably on her request.petrosino was assigned as a temporary acting manager in both administrative and field positions.the crux of her complaint is that she was denied further temporary acting manager assignments in i r after she was selected for transfer to cx m.there are sharp disagreements between the parties as to the circumstances relevant to this decision and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom.even if we assume that these will all be resolved in petrosino favor,however,she could not claim that the failure to assign her temporary acting manager responsibilities constituted a denial of promotion.although the record suggests that temporary acting manager assignments were an important first step for a bell atlantic technician who wished to receive a managerial promotion,the assignments themselves did not materially alter the technician job status.a temporary acting manager received no additional pay or benefits he or she simply substituted for brief periods when employees who actually held specific managerial positions were on leave or vacation.to the extent petrosino claims that serving as a temporary acting manager for a supervisor enhanced an employee chances of succeeding that supervisor as either a permanent acting or official manager,petrosino knew that her transfer to cx m would reduce her chances of succeeding an i r manager.thus,she can not claim that the inability to serve as a temporary acting manager in i r while she awaited transfer compromised any reasonable succession expectations.
like the fifth circuit,we conclude that an assignment to substitute for an absent supervisor generally can not fairly be labeled a promotion.see zaffuto city of hammond,cir rejecting promotion claim by employee denied opportunity to serve as acting shift lieutenant for vacationing supervisor,amended,cir per curiam.such assignments are plainly distinguishable from acting appointments that fill actual vacancies,which courts recognize as employment actions that can support discriminatory promotion claims.see,singletary dist.of columbia,wardwell sch.bd.of palm beach county,cir per curiam.this is not to dismiss as irrelevant evidence of possible discrimination in temporary managerial assignments.such conduct,even if does not involve an employment action that could fairly be deemed a promotion,may nevertheless constitute further evidence of a work environment.thus,our ruling on petrosino promotion claim does not preclude her from offering proof if otherwise admissible of her unsuccessful efforts to secure managerial positions throughout her employment at bell atlantic in support of her hostile work environment claim.
for the reasons stated,however,we conclude that petrosino has failed,as a matter of law,to state a claim for discriminatory failure to promote and,accordingly,we affirm this part of the district court summary judgment award.
constructive discharge 
petrosino final title vii claim is for constructive discharge.as this court has several times observed,a n employee is constructively discharged when his employer,rather than discharging him directly,intentionally creates a work atmosphere so intolerable that he is forced to quit involuntarily.terry ashcroft,at and cases cited therein.case law generally focuses on two parts of this standard the employer intentional conduct and the intolerable level of the work conditions.
focusing first on the intent requirement,we recognize that in some constructive discharge cases,plaintiffs have been able to establish that employers acted with the specific intent to prompt employees resignations.see,kirsch fleet street,cir upholding jury finding of constructive discharge where evidence indicated that employer nodded affirmatively when plaintiff suggested that the company was trying to force her to leave lopez thomas,cir holding constructive discharge supported by evidence that supervisor told employer he would be fired at the end of a probationary period no matter what he did to improve his allegedly deficient performance,prompting some district courts in this circuit to conclude that specific intent is necessary to a constructive discharge claim.see ternullo reno,d.certainly,where such evidence exists,the mens rea requirement is easily established.nevertheless,this court has not ex
