the recitation of the factual background of this appeal upon which we are about to embark paints at least one employee of the defendant otis elevator company otis in decidedly unflattering colors.we therefore emphasize at the outset that at this stage of the proceedings we are required to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and much of the evidence the plaintiff presents is her own testimony.as a result,the account that follows may or may not reflect the facts as they are,or as they may be found at trial.see holtz rockefeller,cir.
background 
the plaintiff yasharay mack,an woman,worked as an elevator mechanic helper for otis from july through may.mack was assigned to work assisting six mechanics at the metropolitan life building,an office building with sixty elevators located at park avenue in new york city park.
the collective bargaining agreement cba between otis and local international union of elevator constructors local or the union governing the employment of mack and her at park provides that one mechanic is designated mechanic in charge whenever there are five or more otis employees on one job,as there were at park.cba at.james connolly was the mechanic in charge at the site.under the terms of the cba,the mechanic in charge has the right to assign and schedule work,direct the work force,assure the quality and efficiency of the assignment,and to enforce the safety practices and procedures.id.according to connolly deposition testimony,he assigned work to the other mechanics and helpers,including mack,as he was supposed to under the cba.connolly supervisor,phil gallina,maintained an office at park but was seldom there.
according to mack deposition testimony,on her first day on the job at park,connolly said to her,i was curious to know what you look like and i have to say you are quite an attractive young lady.mack dep.at.connolly then introduced her to another mechanic saying,tell me she is not the most attractive helper you ever had.she is sticking with me.id.connolly continued to comment on mack appearance,telling her repeatedly,for example,that she had a fantastic ass,id.at,luscious lips,id.at,and beautiful eyes,id.at.
connolly regularly changed out of his uniform in front of mack at the end of his shift,stripping down to his underwear and adjusting himself before changing into his street clothes.he also boasted to mack about his sexual exploits.on one occasion,in front of all the other mechanics,connolly grabbed mack by the waist,pulled her onto his lap,tried to kiss her and touched her buttocks.connolly explicitly questioned mack place in the elevator business as a woman and an african american.he told her that spics and niggers did not belong in the business,id.at,and that he did not know why women are on this job anyway,id.at.connolly,in his deposition testimony,disputed most of mack allegations,although he admitted to changing into his street clothes in front of her.
mack further testified at her deposition that in november,she repeatedly complained to gallina about connolly behavior,and asked gallina to transfer her to a different department so that she would not have to work with connolly.mack told gallina that she was plagued with a lot of sexist issues with connolly,id.at,and that connolly was always making rude and sexist comments to her,id.at.mack also stated that she complained to craig reiff,a union shop steward,in april or may of,and similarly requested that reiff transfer her to a different location.
mack further testified that she repeatedly complained of connolly conduct to the other mechanics on her team,who,she says,often witnessed and sometimes participated in her mistreatment.indeed,during their depositions,richard morrison admitted telling mack to come on,bitch,morrison dep.at,and gerard lombardo admitted telling mack that she was attractive and smelled good,lombardo dep.at.lombardo further stated that he witnessed connolly frequently commenting on mack appearance.stephen hook witnessed the lap incident,although he said that mack was laughing when it occurred.
at the time of these events,otis had a comprehensive policy in place that prohibited racial discrimination and sexual harassment in both its quid pro quo and hostile work environment manifestations.the policy provided several avenues of complaint for employees who thought themselves aggrieved,including an telephone number that an employee could use to report the sort of incidents alleged here.the policy also instructed aggrieved employees to inform their supervisor,unless is the alleged harasser.otis elevator.policy on harassment in the workplace.mack concedes that she was aware of the policy.she testified,however,that she did not take advantage of all the avenues provided because she did not want to be considered a rat.mack dep.at.she also testified that she knew that connolly had a reputation to get away with things and i was too new in the field to start trouble.id.
according to mack,as part of his responsibilities in assigning and overseeing daily tasks,connolly also assigned overtime work the defendants counter that this was merely a clerical responsibility.compare defendants rule statement of facts,with plaintiff rule counterstatement of facts.mack testified that t owards the end when things got bad with connolly he gave me very little overtime.that what he did when he was angry with people.mack dep.at.on may,according to mack,connolly,dressed only in his underwear,threatened mack if you do like the way i talking to you,if you do like the way i am,you can go complain to phil gallina,you can complain to local president john green i do give a shit.i get away with everything.i always have and i always will you nobody if you do like the way i treat you,you can get the fuck out.id.at.mack replied,i not going to quit my job because you an idiot.id.at.
shortly thereafter,mack father contacted a union representative and complained about his daughter treatment.a meeting was arranged for union representative tony orriga,otis representative paul barrett,mack and her father.at the meeting,mack described connolly conduct,and orriga and barrett promised an investigation and offered to transfer mack to their rockefeller center location.mack never returned to work.
on october,mack brought suit against otis in the united states district court for the southern district of new york under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et,new york state human rights law,exec.law et,and new york city human rights law,admin.code et,alleging that otis had subjected her to a hostile work environment,had constructively discharged her,and had unlawfully retaliated against her.mack also brought suit against the union alleging constructive discharge retaliation and failure to represent.the defendants made a motion in the district court for summary judgment,which was granted in its entirety.mack otis elevator,wl,dist.lexis mack.

discussion 
hostile work environment claim 
the district court concluded,inter alia,that mack had not evinced evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that mack was harassed by an otis supervisor,and that otis could not,therefore,be held vicariously liable on that basis for the harassment that created a hostile work environment for mack.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree.
title vii is violated w hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris forklift,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to survive a motion for summary judgment,a plaintiff claiming he or she was the victim of an unlawful hostile work environment must elicit evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his or her work environment,and that a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer.richardson new york state dep t of corr,cir citation and internal punctuation omitted.the district court bypassed the first issue,granting summary judgment for otis on this claim based on its resolution of the second issue the court concluded that mack had provided an insufficient basis to hold otis liable for the allegedly discriminatory conduct.
hostile work environment 
the district court assumed without deciding that mack workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her work environment.mack,wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting van zant klm royal dutch airlines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we think it clear from the evidence described above construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff that the record taken as a whole could lead a rational trier of fact to find,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d,that mack workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult,sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.her claim thus survives the defendants motion for summary judgment on this issue.the dispositive question with respect to the hostile work environment claim on otis motion to dismiss,to which we now turn,is therefore whether a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to otis.van zant,at.
imputing liability to otis 
determining whether connolly was mack supervisor.the starting point for analyzing employer vicarious liability in a title vii hostile work environment action is to determine whether the person who allegedly created that environment is properly characterized as having been the plaintiff supervisor.according to burlington industries,ellerth,d,and faragher city of boca raton,d,which together provide the bedrock upon which the current law of vicarious liability in title vii hostile work environment cases is built,it is only when a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee has engaged in the complained of conduct,that the employer may be subject to vicarious liability.ellerth,at.faragher,at.employers are not,by contrast,vicariously liable for hostile work environment created by a mere of the victim.
vicarious liability for supervisor harassment draws on,but is not exclusively derived from,principles of agency.ellerth begins its discussion of vicarious liability under title vii with an examination of those principles as set forth in the restatement second of agency the restatement.the ellerth court acknowledged that harassment by one employee of another is not ordinarily an act within the harasser scope of employment and that the employer is therefore not ordinarily vicariously liable for the creation of a hostile work environment on that basis.ellerth,at.but under section of the restatement,an employer may be held liable for the actions of an employee even when they are outside the scope of employment.such liability may arise,for example,if the employee was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.restatement,d.see ellerth,at.
the court noted,though,that in a sense and to an extent,all workplace harassers are aided in their misbehavior by the agency relationship with their employer,because p roximity and regular contact may afford a captive pool of potential victims.id.at.it does not follow,however,that employers are vicariously liable for all workplace harassment.s omething more than the employment relation itself must be established before the employer will be saddled with liability for the employee misbehavior.id.
ellerth went on to discuss two different situations in which the employer and misbehaving employee have something more than the employment relation sufficient to give rise to vicarious liability.one such class of cases is that in which,in the course of creating or maintaining a hostile work environment,a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the subordinate,because 
w hen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision,there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation the supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.
for these reasons among others,a tangible employment action taken by the supervisor becomes for title vii purposes the act of the employer.whatever the exact contours of the aided in the agency relation standard,its requirements will always be met when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate.
id.at.see also jin metro.life ins,cir quoting ellerth,at.
the court therefore held that if behavior illegal under title vii culminates in a supervisor tangible employment action,the employer will,ipso facto,be vicariously liable for it.a tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at.the tangible employment action is the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates.id.at.it is the use of the economic power of the employer exercised by the employee to whom that power has been delegated that renders the employer liable.see id.and it seems unlikely that an employment action with economic dimensions taken by one employee with respect to another would entirely escape the knowledge of the employer managers.
there is a second class of cases where the agency relationship between employer and supervisor facilitates the creation of a hostile work environment,ellerth,at.faragher,at,albeit in a less obvious way,ellerth,at.in cases in which supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action,the employer may also be held vicariously liable for the supervisor harassing behavior,but such liability is not established simply by establishing that the misbehaving employee is the victim supervisor the risk of imposing automatic liability in these situations is high,faragher,at.
to fashion a rule of vicarious liability to apply to such cases,the court looked not only to agency principles,but also to other considerations of title vii,ellerth,at,especially title vii basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees,id.at.faragher,at.the court concluded that where a tangible employment action is not involved 
the employer is nonetheless subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate authority over the employee.but in such cases a defending
