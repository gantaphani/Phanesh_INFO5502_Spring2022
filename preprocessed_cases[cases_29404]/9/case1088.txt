disabled high school student john cave john,and his parents,appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york spatt,denying their motion for a preliminary injunction under the americans with disabilities act of ada,et,section of the rehabilitation act of section,and.the injunction sought would have restrained from denying john,entry to his high school and all school facilities while accompanied by his service dog,simba.the judge,in a thorough opinion,denied appellants motion because they had failed to establish a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their federal and state law claims.see cave meadow union free sch,d.we hold that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellants federal claims because,before filing their suit,appellants failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et,and its implementing state legislation.we also hold that in the absence of jurisdiction over the federal claims,the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over appellants state law causes of action was improper.we therefore direct the district court to dismiss without prejudice appellants complaint in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
john,is a student enrolled in the tresper clarke high school in the east meadow union free school district.to minimize the impact of john,disability in the educational setting,the school authorities,in collaboration with his mother,developed an individual education program iep designed to meet his specific needs and enable him to be a fully mainstreamed student.john,has had an iep designed for him since the age of three.cave,d at.under his current iep,john,is provided with a wide range of special education and support services,including a sign language interpreter for all academic subjects,individual sessions with a teacher of the,a classroom note taker,a microphone system that allows him to hear sounds more clearly,a device when videos are shown in class and preferential classroom seating.id.at.
in december,john,parents asked the high school authorities to allow him to bring his newly acquired service dog,simba,to school with him every day.despite the variety of accommodations supplied by the school for john,disability,his parents urged that simba presence was necessary,as simba would alert john,to emergency bells,to people calling his name,or to sounds of car engines in the street,and would generally enhance his socialization skills.id.at.more important,his parents claim that simba is for john,an independent life tool,which,like his cochlear implants,is supposed to increase his independence and limit the effects of the hearing impairment.id.at.
the school officials denied the caves request on the ground that the presence of the dog would prove disruptive to john,education,since his class schedule and his overall education program would have to be modified to avoid the exposure of allergic students and teachers to the dog.the school district section team met in december to consider the problem.appellants did not attend that meeting,at which the section team determined that john,enjoyed full access to the district special education programs and facilities and that he currently did not need a service dog at school,because he was functioning satisfactorily under the approved iep.thereafter,the section team convened a meeting of the school district committee on special education cse.appellants did attend that meeting.however,the cse affirmed the findings of the section team.although appellants were informed about the availability of administrative review of the school district decisions,they did not use this process.id.at.
instead,after a series of confrontations with school officials,appellants filed this lawsuit in february against the high school and the school district,in addition to district officials and high school employees in their official and individual capacities,alleging violations of the ada,section and,as well as several new york statutes the new york state human rights law,the new york civil rights law and the new york education law.in their complaint,appellants not only asked for preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining the school officials from barring john,access to the school and its facilities when accompanied by simba,but also sought in compensatory and punitive damages,along with court expenses and attorneys fees.
thereafter,the district court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.the judge denied the motion because the caves had not established a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying action due to their failure to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the idea,a failure fatal to their federal causes of action.id.at.
after the district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction,defendants moved,on march,to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.also on march,the caves appealed from denial of the preliminary injunction and thereafter moved in this court to certify all questions of state law to the new york court of appeals.that motion has been referred to this panel for a decision simultaneous with our disposition of the appeal.
ii.analysis 
federal.the idea exhaustion requirement 
in this court,appellants assert various infringements by appellees of john,rights under the ada,section and.they essentially allege federal question jurisdiction under,which provides that district courts have original jurisdiction over claims that arise under the constitution or the laws of the united states.appellants right to judicial relief does depend ultimately on the construction of these federal statutes,but appellees first argument requires us to consider whether we are barred from considering them at all at this time if the idea applies see br.of appellees at.the district court carefully summarized the statutory framework and we see little purpose in reiterating its analysis.cave,d at.we highlight here only some essential points.
the idea central mandate is to provide disabled students with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment suitable for their needs.heldman ex rel.sobol,cir.under the educational scheme of the idea previously known as the education of the handicapped act,parents of students with disabling conditions are guaranteed both an opportunity for meaningful input into all decisions affecting their child education and the right to seek review of any decisions they think inappropriate.honig doe,d.parents are specifically entitled to request a due process hearing in order to present complaints as to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education.b a see also id.f a,g and h delineating procedural safeguards to be accorded to parties filing a complaint and their right to seek review through local and state administrative avenues.new york has opted for a administrative system for review of ieps.first,an impartial hearing officer is selected from a list of certified officers and appointed by the local board of education or the competent state agency to conduct the initial hearing and issue a written decision.that decision can then be appealed to a state review officer of the new york education department.heldman,at citing educ.law.
only after exhaustion of these procedures has an aggrieved party the right to file a suit in a federal or state court.i a.the parties do not dispute this requirement.failure to exhaust the administrative remedies deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.polera bd.of educ.of newburgh enlarged city sch.cir citing hope cortines,cir.the purpose of the exhaustion rule is to channel disputes related to the education of disabled children into an administrative process that could apply administrators expertise in the area and promptly resolve grievances.id.at see also heldman,at pointing out that exhaustion permits an agency to bring its expertise to bear on a problem as well as to correct its own mistakes.
importantly,complainants must overcome this significant procedural hurdle not only when they wish to file a suit under the idea itself,but also whenever they assert claims for relief available under the idea,regardless of the statutory basis of their complaint.the idea explicitly provides 
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the americans with disabilities act of et,title v of the rehabilitation act of et,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter,the procedures under subsections f and g of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.
l emphasis added.
since appellants do not contest that they have failed to exhaust the idea administrative remedies,the question we must answer is simply whether they were required to do so before filing this lawsuit.
is the idea exhaustion requirement applicable in this case 
the applicability of the idea exhaustion requirement to federal claims presented under statutes other than the idea is not a matter of first impression in this court.in hope,we affirmed a district court dismissal of a dyslexic student disability and race discrimination claims under the ada for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,due to the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative review procedures available under the idea.hope,at.the district court in hope had held that the plaintiffs request for injunctive relief against the school for its refusal to provide appropriate educational services was in essence an indirect challenge to the adequacy of the student iep and as such,a textbook example of the types of cases justifying administrative exhaustion.hope cortines.
in,as in the present case,plaintiffs were seeking injunctive relief,as well as punitive and compensatory held that a visually impaired student claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act were subject to the exhaustion rule,because the equitable relief sought was available under the idea.polera,at.in that case,we squarely examined the availability of monetary damages under the idea and,although we found that a damages remedy is fundamentally inconsistent with the idea goals and is thus unavailable under that statute,we concluded that a prayer for damages does not enable a plaintiff to sidestep the exhaustion requirement of the idea,id.at.we emphasized that the theory behind the grievance may activate the idea process,even if the plaintiff wants a form of relief that the idea does not supply.id.quoting charlie bd.of educ.of skokie sch,cir.
both our holding in polera and the district court careful opinion in hope are apposite.appellants in their complaint seek damages and injunctive relief,along with attorneys fees and court costs.the latter two items are indeed available under the idea.see i b.by contrast,compensatory and punitive damages,as we explained in polera,are not available under the idea.polera,at.nevertheless,in polera we held that a disabled student who claims deficiencies in her educational program may not bypass the idea administrative exhaustion rule merely by claiming monetary damages.id.at.we thus decline to excuse appellants from the exhaustion requirement merely because in their suit they seek,inter alia,pecuniary damages,a remedy unavailable under the idea.
whether the permanent and temporary injunctive relief sought by appellants is available under the idea poses a more puzzling question.appellants disclaim any challenge to the educational sufficiency of john,iep.they strongly argue that their claim is not one of violation of the idea mandate for the provision of a free appropriate public education to each disabled student,but a claim of unlawful discrimination.simba role is to be an independent life tool for john,used to limit the effects of his disability,to allow him to continue to be more and more independent as he continues to grow and head toward a life as a productive adult in a hearing society.cave,d at quoting nancy cave testimony before the district court.in other words,they urge us to treat john,not as a student who is being deprived of an appropriate public education,but as a person who is being denied access to a public facility by reason of his disability and his need for a service dog.see br.of appellants at.
this is a slightly different scenario than the situations in either polera or hope.although in both cases plaintiffs federal claims were also premised on statutes other than the idea,plaintiffs were essentially alleging that they were not provided services tailored to meet their special needs due to deficiencies in their iep.polera,at hope.at.in this case,however,appellants have explicitly renounced any challenge to the educational adequacy of john,current iep.they request only that simba be allowed to accompany john,while on the school premises as a matter of john,absolute right of entry into and use of a public facility.this case requires us to refine further our definition of types of relief available under the idea.
we are not convinced that appellants claims are materially distinguishable from claims that could fall within the ambit of the idea.the high school principal and the school district director of special education testified before the district court that john,class schedule under his existing iep would have to be changed to accommodate the concerns of allergic students and teachers and to diminish the distractions that simba presence would engender.cave,d at.school authorities would also have to make certain practical arrangements to maintain the smooth functioning of the school and to ensure both that simba was receiving proper care and that john,continued to receive necessary and appropriate educational and support services.id.it is hard to imagine,for example,how john,could still attend the physical education class while at the same time attending to the dog needs or how he could bring simba to a class where another student with a certified allergic reaction to dogs would be present.id.at.these issues implicate john,iep and would be best dealt with through the administrative process.the local and state education agencies are uniquely well suited to review the content and implementation of ieps and to determine what changes,if any,are needed.polera,at.
we thus agree with the district court here that at least in part,the plaintiffs are challenging the adequacy of john,iep because it does not include a service dog.cave,d at.the relief appellants seek,namely permission to bring the service dog to school,is in substance a modification of john,iep and is available under the idea.id.at.we also concur with the district court finding that e ducation,as used within the idea,encompasses more than simply academics.id.at.we note in that regard that one of the goals of the idea is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education,employment,and independent living.d a emphasis added.a request for a service dog to be permitted to escort a disabled student at school as an independent life tool is hence not entirely beyond the bounds of the idea educational scheme 
finally,we reject appellants argument that their discrimination claim is not subject to the exhaustion rule.the language of section l of the idea is sufficiently broad and encompasses complaints asserted under any federal statute,as long as they seek relief available under the idea.in hope,we affirmed the dismissal of all of plaintiffs claims,including their cause of action,for want of subject matter jurisdiction due to.hope,at see also hope.at holding that the idea exhaustion requirement applies to claims asserted under.in tirozzi,cir,we found that the idea exhaustion requ
