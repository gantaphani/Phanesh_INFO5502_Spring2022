jason tremblay,age sixteen at the time of the underlying events in this case,and his father,richard tremblay,sued the town of conway,new hampshire,its police department,and captain william mcclellan.the suit asserted violations of jason constitutional rights and pendent state law claims arising out of his temporary detention under new hampshire protective custody statutes.
that detention occurred when jason and a friend were picked up by officer mcclellan during the early morning hours of september,while walking along a major road just after smelling of alcohol the police had been called earlier that saturday night to break up a nearby underage drinking party.jason and his friend were taken to the police station,and,a short time later,jason was brought home.he then took a family car without permission,picked up two friends,and drove to maine.the trip ended tragically at approximately,jason,driving at a high speed,lost control of the car and crashed into a tree.jason spine was injured,paralyzing him and leaving him permanently disabled.
the suit claimed that the police,by having picked up jason and then releasing him,were responsible for jason injuries.the defendants moved for summary judgment on various grounds.they argued,inter alia,that officer mcclellan was protected by qualified immunity,that there were no constitutional violations or tortious acts,and that there was no basis to hold the town liable.the magistrate judge,sitting by consent,granted summary judgment for the defendants on several state law claims,but denied it as to the federal civil rights claims and the state law claims of negligence and false imprisonment.officer mcclellan appeals the magistrate judge denial of summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense.we reverse and direct entry of judgment in favor of officer mcclellan.
on summary judgment,we review the testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.
officer mcclellan gave the following account in his deposition.at around on the evening of september,officer mcclellan and several other policemen broke up a party in conway at which numerous underage individuals were consuming alcohol.they detained so many teenagers that a school bus was needed to transport them to the police station.while the officers were in the process of rounding up the partygoers,several juveniles ran away,crossing through a nearby river.the police were,as a result,looking for teenagers with wet clothes who had been at the party.
mcclellan was returning to the police station after taking home a juvenile girl who had been detained at the party when he spotted two other minors walking along east main street in conway,which is route,a federal highway.these teenagers,who turned out to be jason tremblay and dale bell,were approximately three miles away from the site of the earlier party.officer mcclellan had previously arrested dale three different times,twice for the possession of alcohol.when mcclellan slowed down his police car to get a closer look,he observed that dale was wearing pants that were wet halfway up his calf.his shoes were also wet.suspecting that these two teenagers were among those who had run through the river after the earlier party,officer mcclellan stopped his car to speak with them.as he approached them,he detected an odor of alcohol amongst them and noticed that dale eyes were and glassy.he asked the boys whether they had attended the party and whether they had drunk any alcohol that evening.
officer mcclellan said that both teenagers denied either going to the party or drinking alcohol that night.mcclellan believed that dale was lying,but was not sure about jason,who showed no outward signs of intoxication and whose pants did not appear wet.he told both minors to get into the backseat of the police car.he then called in to the police station and reported that he had picked up two boys and that one is.the evidence was that this was a code for either drinking or intoxication neither dale nor jason had any alcohol on him at the time.
when asked what danger to the boys justified picking them up,mcclellan stated late at night,walking along the side of the road having consumed alcohol,they could get hit by a car.lots of things happen at nighttime.
it is what officer mcclellan knew at the time of the detention that is important for the detention claim.we describe the later events because they are relevant to the negligent release claims and for their corroborative effect on his testimony as to both claims.as officer mcclellan began to drive away with jason and dale,two other teenagers,michael palughi and an unidentified girl,approached the police car on bicycles.they claimed that they had spent the evening with jason and dale and that the four of them had neither been to the party nor consumed alcohol that night.given the evidence of alcohol consumption,officer mcclellan believed that they were trying to cover for their friends dale and jason,and he continued toward the police station.during the ride dale was belligerent and kept insisting that the two of them had not been drinking that evening and that officer mcclellan should have also arrested michael and the girl.
officer mcclellan arrived at the police station with the two boys at.he entered their two names in the juvenile detention log with the notation pc,for protective custody and again asked the two whether they had been drinking alcohol that evening.jason continued to deny having consumed any alcohol.officer mcclellan then asked another officer,who was walking through the booking room,whether she could smell any alcohol on either of the minors.that officer said that she did smell alcohol on dale.she also said that she did not smell any alcohol on jason,but that the whole room smelled of alcohol.at this point,officer mcclellan determined that he did not have sufficient evidence that jason had been drinking to keep him,although the officer still smelled alcohol on them.
jason had told officer mcclellan that his parents were not at home and that he wanted to go home with dale.jason also said he did not know how to reach them.officer mcclellan called dale mother to come pick up her son.he also told her,either over the phone or at the station,that he had taken jason into custody because he suspected that jason had been drinking.he asked if she would take jason as well,but she declined to take responsibility for jason.her testimony confirms this.on jason suggestion,officer mcclellan also contacted the mother of michael palughi,at whose house jason had planned to spend the night.but after hearing the circumstances under which jason was at the police station,she too refused to take custody of him.her testimony confirms this.having been unable to locate an adult who would take jason,officer mcclellan drove jason home at and extracted a promise from him that he would stay home until he heard from his parents.
all of the material elements of officer mcclellan account are consistent with the deposition testimony of the others involved.jason testified that he and dale had indeed drunk kahlua that evening,accounting for the odor that officer mcclellan reported.jason confirmed that he and dale had been walking along east maine street at around when officer mcclellan stopped them and that the bottoms of dale pants had been wet.according to jason,the first thing that officer mcclellan said as he approached the boys was that i can smell alcohol on you all the way over here.like officer mcclellan,jason reported that a third officer at the police station determined that dale smelled of alcohol and jason did not.and jason admitted that when officer mcclellan asked him where his parents were,he told him that they were in maine somewhere and lied in stating that he did not know how to reach them.in addition,jason reported that officer mcclellan asked both dale mother and michael mother if they would take responsibility for him.
officer mcclellan testimony was also consistent,in all material respects,with the deposition testimony of dale bell.dale testified that he drank most of a bottle of kahlua that night,and that jason also drank a swig of kahlua.dale also confirmed that offi
