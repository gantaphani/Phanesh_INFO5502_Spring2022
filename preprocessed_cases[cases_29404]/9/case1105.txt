andie zapata sues the city of new york and a corrections officer under,alleging that he was assaulted at the rikers island correctional facility by one officer moran.he appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant,insofar as it dismissed zapata claim against officer moran for failure to effect timely service under federal rule of civil procedure m without granting a discretionary extension.zapata argues that this was an abuse of discretion notwithstanding his failure to show good cause because the denial of an extension rendered zapata claims 
we join several other circuits and hold that district courts may exercise their discretion to grant extensions under rule m absent a showing of good cause under certain circumstances but here,we decline to vacate for abuse of discretion because zapata not only failed to show good cause but advanced no colorable excuse whatsoever for his neglect.
background 
on june,according to the complaint officer moran assaulted zapata in the inmate holding pen at the anna kross center on rikers island,resulting in serious bodily injury.on september,zapata filed an administrative claim with the city complaining that he had been assaulted by moran at the amkc clinic waiting area.
more than two years later on may,zapata filed a complaint in the district court,naming the city and officer moran as defendants in a suit under and state common law the complaint alleged that it was the policy,custom and practice of the city to inadequately supervise,train and discipline their officers zapata served the city with a summons and complaint on june.on june,coincidentally,the day the three year statute of limitations for zapata claims would have run had the complaint not been filed the city sought a enlargement of the time in which to file an answer.in its letter to the court,the city noted that officer moran had not yet been served.the city filed its answer on august,again,the city stated that,to its knowledge,officer moran had not yet been properly served.at an initial conference on september,zapata counsel asked the city for officer moran work location.on september,zapata counsel forwarded a copy of the summons and complaint by express mail to a process server who served officer moran at riker island the location of the incident.federal rule of civil procedure m provides that actions are subject to dismissal without prejudice unless service is made within days.zapata service on officer moran was therefore effected four days beyond the service period,and days after the expiration of the original limitations period 
the city moved to dismiss the complaint on november,on the grounds that all of zapata allegations against the city either failed to state a claim or were,and that zapata claims against officer moran were subject to dismissal for lack of timely service and should be dismissed with prejudice as because the statute of limitations had run since the filing of the complaint.on november,zapata responded to the city motion to dismiss and for an extension,nunc pro tunc,of the time in which to serve officer moran.zapata claimed that he was unaware of officer moran first name,badge number or work location when he filed the complaint.the city reply memorandum attached zapata september administrative claim form,which lists officer moran badge number and work location.in a memorandum in further support of the,zapata counsel explained that she did not know of the existence of the claim form until she received the city reply,and she argued that the city should have included a copy of the claim form in its initial disclosures.
zapata memoranda in opposition to the motion to dismiss and in further support of the argued that the service period should be extended either for good cause or in light of the harsh application of the statute of limitations.according to zapata memoranda,the amendments to rule allowed district courts to grant extensions even in the absence of good cause.
by memorandum opinion on january,the court dismissed zapata claims against the city a decision which zapata does not challenge on appeal and dismissed zapata claims against moran as and declined to grant zapata an extension of the service period 
proof of service confirms this service,four days beyond the day period provided in rule.the statute of limitations for the constitutional tort sued on expired on june.service of process on moran made within days would have related back to the filing of the lawsuit on may,and would have been timely.prejudice is assumed in the case of individuals sued after the statute of limitations has run.such cases differ from those situations cited by plaintiff where the claim itself is not,but service is late under rule the case is dismissed as to defendant moran as timebarred.
zapata city of new york,civ,slip op.at.zapata to extend the service period nunc pro tunc,which the district court described as a c for an extension of time to serve papers in opposition to the motion to dismiss,was deemed moot in light of the resolution of the motion to dismiss.id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
federal rule of civil procedure m governs both the dismissal of actions for untimely service of process and extensions of the time in which service may be effected.we review for an abuse of discretion a district court rule m dismissal for failure to serve process.see thompson maldonado,cir.
under rule m,
i f service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within days after the filing of the complaint,the court shall dismiss the action without prejudice or direct that service be effected within a specified time provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure,the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.
prior to,the substance of this rule appeared in the former rule j,which provided that if service was not made within days,and the serving party can not show good cause why such service was not made within that period,the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice.the advisory committee notes to the amendment disclosed the purpose of the amendment 
the new subdivision explicitly provides that the court shall allow additional time if there is good cause for the plaintiff failure to effect service in the prescribed days,and authorizes the court to relieve a plaintiff of the consequences of an application of this subdivision even if there is no good cause shown relief may be justified,for example,if the applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action,or if the defendant is evading service or conceals a defect in attempted service.
before the amendments,we generally did not approve an extension absent a showing of good cause,even when a statute of limitations would bar the action and effectively convert the dismissal without prejudice under rule m into a dismissal with prejudice.see,mcgregor united states,cir frasca united states,cir.but since,those of our sister circuits that have considered the issue have heeded the advisory committee and held that district courts have the discretion to grant extensions of the service period even where there is no good cause shown and this is consistent with a passing comment from the supreme court on the issue.see,henderson united states,d i n amendments to the rules,courts have been accorded discretion to enlarge the period even if there is no good cause shown.quoting.m comm.notes horenkamp van winkle,cir panaras liquid carbonic,cir espinoza united states,cir petrucelli bohringer and ratzinger,gmbh,cir.
while we have not decided the question,our opinion in connecticut expressed skepticism about granting extension without good cause we rejected as unsupported by any authority of this court the contention that plaintiff was not required to show good cause in order to be given an extension of time to make proper service,cir.this observation was linked to the factual context of that case,who was neither a pro se litigant nor incarcerated,made no showing whatever as to any effort on her part to effect personal service and she also made no effort to show
