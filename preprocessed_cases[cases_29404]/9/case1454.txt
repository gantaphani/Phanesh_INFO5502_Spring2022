janet batchelor,individually and on behalf of her son,ryan batchelor ryan collectively appellants filed suit against the rose tree media school district district,and six individual district individual appellees collectively appellees,asserting their entitlement to the statutory protections of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,the rehabilitation act,a section,and the americans with disabilities act ada.the district court dismissed appellants federal claims pursuant to.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because appellants intentionally failed to exhaust the administrative remedies under the idea.this appeal followed.
on appeal,appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that their federal claims are subject to the idea exhaustion requirement.alternatively,they argue that their claims are exempt from exhaustion.for the reasons provided below,we determine that appellants federal claims indeed fall within the ambit of the idea and require exhaustion,and further,that no exception to the idea exhaustion requirement applies under the facts presented.we will therefore affirm the district court dismissal of appellants federal claims pursuant to.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
factual background 
because we are reviewing the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b,it is appropriate to draw the facts from the allegations contained in the complaint,and to accept them as true.see taliaferro darby twp.zoning,cir.
ryan freshman and sophomore years 
in december,during his freshman year at penncrest high school,ryan was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,which is designated as a disability within the meaning of section.compl.the district developed and implemented a written plan plan for ryan,pursuant to which the district placed ryan in an achievement center for support and provided ryan with counseling and tutoring these services continued throughout ryan freshman year however,in october,batchelor learned that ryan guidance counselor had failed to schedule ryan for placement in the achievement center for his sophomore year.more important,ryan teachers did not receive a copy of his plan.id.at.despite ryan subsequent assignment to the achievement center,in december and again in march,ryan guidance counselor reported to batchelor that ryan was failing his classes.id.at.
on march,batchelor met with vice principal harrison to discuss ryan struggles,and informed him that the district was not providing ryan with the support services required by the plan.id.at.appellants allege that harrison was hostile and offensive during the meeting,and,at its conclusion,batchelor informed harrison she would be contacting an attorney.id.
the next month,in april,batchelor and her attorney met with district representatives to discuss the district failure to implement ryan plan.id.at.after this meeting,the district assigned ryan to a resource room,provided tutoring,and,in an effort to better identify the nature of ryan learning disability,administered additional testing and evaluations.id.at.following testing,which evidenced that ryan had an additional math disability,an individualized education plan iep meeting was held with the district and batchelor,and subsequently,the district developed an iep for ryan id.at.
as a result of the april meeting,the district offered appellants a settlement whereby batchelor would waive all claims under the idea,section,and the ada,and the district would provide compensatory education services to ryan.id.at.specifically,the settlement agreement the settlement agreement required the district to establish a fund for compensatory education consisting of one hundred sixty hours of tutoring defs.mem.of law in opp to pls.mot.for a tro and imposition of a prelim.inj.ex,ryan batchelor,et rose tree media school district,et,case cv cdj,ecf.the settlement agreement became effective at the beginning of ryan junior year,on september.compl.
ryan junior year 
the district failed to reimburse batchelor for the costs of private tutoring incurred between january and april,despite its obligations to do so under the settlement agreement.consequently,batchelor filed a breach of contract action,which resulted in the district partially reimbursing her for the tutoring costs.nevertheless,the district refused to reimburse batchelor for the cost of tutoring services incurred thereafter.id.at.
appellants allege that,in addition to failing to implement the settlement agreement,during ryan junior year the district engaged in retaliatory acts against them.id.at.for example,appellants allege that,in an act of retaliation,the district changed ryan math tutor from a teacher he had worked well with to a tutor who was sarcastic,impatient,and mean,causing ryan to feel badly about himself.id.at.in another example of retaliation,appellants allege that the district assigned ryan to a teacher whom they knew ryan considered to be a bully.indeed,on ryan first day of class,he was wrongly disciplined and humiliated.id.at.
ryan senior year 
due to the district failure to implement the terms of the settlement agreement and ryan iep,as well as the continuing acts of bullying and retaliation ryan and batchelor suffered,ryan withdrew from penncrest for his senior year and enrolled in twenty first century cyber charter school.id.at.in another act of alleged retaliation,the district refused to allow ryan to participate in penncrest choir and dance teams during his senior year even though he remained a district resident.id.at.
appellants allege that,collectively,the district retaliatory actions were severely detrimental to ryan educational achievement and health.
procedural history 
on october,appellants filed the initial complaint,and on march,filed the complaint at issue here.in the complaint,appellants make three federal claims to provide a free appropriate public education fape in violation of the idea,count ii,appellants district retaliation in violation of section of the rehabilitation act,a count iii,appellants district and retaliation in violation of the ada,count iv,appellants district individual appellees appellants seek compensatory damages,statutory damages,reasonable attorney fees,and such other further relief as this court deems just and appropriate.compl.

iii.analysis 
a.the idea statutory scheme 
the purpose of the idea is to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs d a.under the idea,a state is eligible for federal funding if it complies with several requirements,all aimed at protecting the rights of students with disabilities and their parents.the main requirement is that states make available a fape to children with disabilities.id.a states must comply with detailed procedures for identifying,evaluating,and making placements for students with disabilities,as well as procedures for developing ieps.they must also implement specified procedural safeguards to ensure children with disabilities and their parents are provided with due process.these safeguards,known collectively as the idea administrative process,provide parents with an avenue to file a complaint and to participate in an impartial due process hearing with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the ir child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child id.b a see also id.f a parents who have filed a complaint shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing.the idea administrative process is conducted in compliance with state procedures.f a 
following completion of the idea administrative process,exhaustion,the idea affords a ny party aggrieved by the findings and decisions made during or pursuant to the impartial due process hearing an opportunity for judicial review.i a komninos upper saddle river bd.of,f d,cir.in the normal case,exhausting the idea administrative process is required in order for the statute to grant subject matter jurisdiction to the district court.komninos,at i t is clear from the language of the act that congress intended plaintiffs to complete the administrative process before resorting to federal court.see also i a.after examining the administrative record and hearing additional evidence at the request of either party,the reviewing court is authorized to grant such relief as it determines is appropriate based on the preponderance of the evidence.i c i iii.these remedies include,inter alia,attorneys fees,reimbursement for a private educational placement,and compensatory education.chambers sch.dist.of phila.bd.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
exhaustion of the idea administrative process is also required in actions where the plaintiff seeks relief that can be obtained under the idea.congress provided an express r ule of construction in section l,which states 
n othing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the americans with disabilities act of,title v of the rehabilitation act of,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter,the idea administrative process shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.
l.this provision bars plaintiffs from circumventing the idea exhaustion requirement by taking claims that could have been brought under idea and repackaging them as claims under some other statute,section,section of the rehabilitation act,or the ada.jeremy mount lebanon sch,cir finding plaintiffs properly exhausted ada and section act claims by participating in an idea due process hearing.thus,determining if the idea administrative process must be exhausted before bringing claims in federal court turns on whether the parties could have asserted the claims under the idea.intertwined with this inquiry is whether the claim could have been remedied by the idea administrative process.this means that,absent the application of any exceptions,all of appellants claims made pursuant to the idea require exhaustion,as do any claims asserted under section and the ada,if they seek relief that is available under the idea as set forth below,all of appellants claims require exhaustion of the idea administrative process,and thus,the district court did not err in dismissing them.appellants failure to exhaust administrative remedies forestalled the district court from properly asserting subject matter jurisdiction over the federal claims.
applicability of the idea exhaustion requirement 
at the outset,we reject appellants argument that this action is exempt from the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to the idea because t he issues presented are not educational issues r ather they are issues of civil rights resulting from defendants retaliatory conduct.appellants br.to review,count ii asserts to provide a fape in violation of the idea.compl.count iii asserts retaliation in violation of section.id.at.last,count iv asserts retaliation in violation of the ada.id.at.we address each of these claims in turn.
count ii of the complaint squarely falls within those claims subject to the idea exhaustion requirement.see i.indeed,count ii asserts a claim against the district under the stricture of the idea itself.compl.moreover,appellants assert that as a result of the district failure to provide ryan with a fape and to implement ryan iep,as is required under the idea,ryan has suffered and continues to suffer great harm to his level of educational achievement and personal well being.id.at.it is plain that count ii falls within the ambit of i and requires exhaustion appellants claim that the idea has been violated,they allege educational harms,and the idea statutory scheme is able to provide an appropriate remedy.
it is less clear however,if exhaustion is required for counts iii iv of the complaint,which allege retaliation in violation of section of the rehabilitation act and the ada.compl.we must decide,as a matter of first impression,whether a claim that a school district retaliated against a child the child parents for enforcing the child rights under the idea could be brought under,and remedied by,the idea.appellants urge that it can not we disagree.appellants retaliation claims are related to the provision of fape under.b and,as such,must be exhausted.
the question at hand requires statutory interpretation in the first instance.our goal when interpreting a statute is to effectuate congress intent.because we presume that congress intent is most clearly expressed in the text of the statute,we begin our analysis with an examination of the plain language of the relevant provision.hagans comm r of soc,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the idea affords parents of a disabled child the opportunity to present a complaint with respect to any matter relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child b a emphasis added.
focusing on the claims asserted here,it is plain that appellants retaliation claims palpably relate to the district provision of a fape to ryan.specifically,appellants contend that the district retaliated against batchelor and ryan for their advocacy with respect to ryan legally protected rights.compl.they allege that the district,inter alia,bullied,intimidated,and further harassed batchelor at meetings regarding ryan progress id.at,failed to timely reimburse batchelor for the cost of private tutors id,replaced a tutor with whom ryan worked well,with another,presumably less effective tutor id.at,refused to implement the terms of ryan iep id.at,placed ryan in a class taught by doyle,a teacher ryan identified as being a bully id.at,and refused to permit ryan to participate in extracurricular activities during his senior year while enrolled in a charter school.id.at.among other injuries,appellants allege the district conduct deprived ryan of a fape and caused great harm to his level of educational achievement and personal well being.id.at.in accord with two of our sister circuits who require idea exhaustion of retaliation claims,we conclude that appellants retaliation claims asserted under section of the rehabilitation act and ada relate unmistakably to the provision of a fape to ryan,and are thus subject to the idea exhaustion requirement.rose yeaw,cir finding that retaliation claims relate unmistakably to the evaluation and educational placement of a student,and to the provision of a free appropriate education see also dekalb cnty.sch,cir r etaliation claims clearly relate to the disabled student evaluation and education,and,therefore,are subject to the idea exhaustion requirement.
in dekalb county school district,the eleventh circuit found claims of retaliation to be related to the disabled student evaluation and education,so as to require idea exhaustion,where the s chool d istrict harassed the student parents at iep meetings,wrote them intimidating letters in response to their educational demands,and subjected the student to needless and intrusive testing.at.similarly,the first circuit held in rose yeaw,that a claim of a school district retaliation against a student in response to the parents efforts to enforce his educational rights relate s unmistakably to the evaluation and educational placement of the student,and to the provision of a free appropriate education at.
we are satisfied that the plain language of the idea required exhaustion here,as there is a logical path to be drawn from the appellants claims of retaliation to the district failure to provide,and batchelor effort to obtain for,ryan a free appropriate public education.b a see also park n fly,dollar park fly,t he ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.
besides the mandates of statutory interpretation,there is a strong policy reason requiring exhaustion of remedies available under the idea.komninos,at.exhaustion serves the purpose of developing the record for review on appeal,state operated sch.dist.of city of newark,cir discussing the importance of in idea cases,encouraging parents and the local school district to work together to formulate an iep for a child education,komninos,at,and allowing the education agencies to apply their expertise and correct their own errors.mckart united states,explaining the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies,and noting its application to specific cases requires an understanding of the statute purpose and of the particular administrative scheme involved see also polera bd.of educ.of the newburgh enlarged city sch,cir the idea exhaustion requirement was intended to channel disputes related to the education of disabled children into an administrative process that could apply administrators expertise in the area and promptly resolve grievances.indeed we have previously recognized that 
t he advantages of awaiting completion of the administrative hearings are particularly weighty in disabilities education act cases.that process offers an opportunity for state and local agencies to exercise discretion and expertise in fields in which they have substantial experience.these proceedings thus carry out congressional intent and provide a means to develop a complete factual record.smith robinson,congress made express efforts to place primary responsibility for fulfilling the needs of handicapped children on local and state education agencies.the administrative hearings generally will produce facts and opinions relevant to the very same issues presented to the court by plaintiffs.
komninos,at.these policy concerns weigh heavily in favor of requiring exhaustion,even where the complaint contains claims of retaliation.considering the parties failure to provide even the most basic of documentation in support of their positions,ryan plan and iep,exhaustion will be particularly helpful in developing a factual record.
given the plain language and structure of the idea,in addition to the purpose of the idea exhaustion requirement and the policy concerns supporting it,we now hold that retaliation claims related to the enforcement of rights under the idea must be exhausted before a court may assert subject matter jurisdiction 
exceptions to the idea exhaustion requirement 
appellants argue that even if the court finds that their claims fall within the scope of the idea exhaustion requirement,those claims are exempt because they seek only monetary damages,which are unavailable under the idea appellants br.the implementation exception applies id.at the futility exception applies.id.at.these arguments all fail.
monetary damages not available under the idea 
appellants argue that their claims are exempt from the idea exhaustion requirement because the remedies they seek are unavailable under the idea.appellants br.while such an exception does exist generally,komninos,at,it is inapplicable in the instant case.
appellants seek compensatory and punitive damages,which,as they correctly point out,are not available under the idea and can not be awarded in the context of a due process hearing.appellant br.citing chambers,at.this is not dispositive,however,for several reasons.
first,appellants do not exclusively seek compensatory and punitive damages.indeed,despite appellants assertion on appeal that t he only remedy sought is the payment of monetary damages appellants br,the complaint requests,in addition to compensatory damages and punitive damages,statutory damages,reasonable attorney fees,and such other further relief as this court deems just and appropriate.compl.thus,it is untenable for appellants to maintain that all of the remedies they seek are unavailable under the idea.
second,in reviewing appellants claims,the district court is not constrained in the relief it is authorized to grant by the remedies sought in the appellants complaint.on the contrary,the nature of appellants claims and the governing law determine the relief,regardless of appellants demands.see.c every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled,even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.applying this to f,the theory behind the grievance may activate the idea process,even if the plaintiff wants a form of relief that the idea does not supply.charlie bd.of educ.of skokie sch.dist,cir.
in charlie board of education of skokie school district,plaintiff sued for monetary damages under the ada,section,and state tort law.id.although plaintiff did not bring claims directly under the idea,the seventh circuit still required exhaustion of the idea administrative process.id.at.the court emphasized that parents can not ignore remedies available under the idea and insist on those of their own devising under the idea,educational professionals are supposed to have at least the first crack at formulating a plan to overcome the consequences of educational shortfalls.id.at.under similar circumstances,the second circuit came to the same result.see polera,at,requiring exhaustion of the idea administrative process even though plaintiffs did not bring an idea claim and only sought monetary damages.the second and seventh circuits reasoning for requiring exhaustion of the idea administrative process applies with even more force in the instant case,as appellants asserted claims directly under the idea.
rather than being constrained by the remedies sought in the appellants complaint,the idea authorizes the district court to grant appellants such relief as it determines is appropriate.i c iii.see also jersey city pub,cir en banc as we noted in collingwood borough board of education,
a ppropriate remedies under the idea are determined on a basis.in each case,a court will evaluate the specific type of relief that is appropriate to ensure that a student is fully compensated for a school district past violations of his or her rights under the idea and develop an appropriate equitable award.
cir quoting ferren sch.dist.of,cir.thus,despite their plea to the contrary,the remedies that appellants seek do not dictate the applicability of the idea to their claims.
third,even though a monetary award is not available to appellants during the idea administrative process as compensatory and punitive damages such an award may nevertheless be granted as reimbursement for certain expenses incurred.indeed,congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case.sch.comm.of burlington,at.for instance,if parents have paid for a disabled child education because the public schools were failing to provide a fape,the reimbursement of such expenses constitutes appropriate relief under the idea.forest grove sch,at sch.comm.of burlington,at lester gilhool,cir.this reasoning applies with equal force with respect to reimbursement for inadequate tutoring services.see,at compensatory education can take the form of summer school and tutoring.accord adams state of oregon,cir parents are entitled to reimbursement for appropriate private tutoring.
appellants argument that their action does not present any issue within the scope of b is further undermined by their claims that as a result of the district bad behavior,which included its failure to provide ryan with a fape,ryan has suffered great harm to his educational achievement compl.it is clear that b oth the genesis and the manifestations of the problem s are educational charlie,at.the idea offers comprehensive educational solutions to directly address educational harms,and,in addition,provides reimbursement for certain financial losses that occur as a result of the educational harms.see ferren,at compensatory education bucks cnty.dep t of mental retardation,at financial reimbursement.thus,the district court correctly concluded that despite being unable to award compensatory damages,if appellants had prevailed at the due process hearing,the special education hearing officer would have been able to provide them with appropriate relief 
holding that appellants must exhaust the idea administrative process before seeking judicial relief ensures that the purpose of the idea remains intact.in response to a school district alleged bad behavior,the educational harms suffered by children with disabilities will be addressed first and foremost during the idea administrative process.once these educational deficiencies have been addressed,victims may seek further remedy in court pursuant to statutory schemes allowing for compensatory and punitive damages,such as section and the ada provide.
implementation exception to the idea exhaustion requirement 
appellants also argue that their claims are exempt from the idea exhaustion requirement because an implementation exception applies.appellants br.according to appellants,the exception applies where the parties challenge only the implementation of a student iep and not its adequacy or content.id.at.
there is no binding appellate precedent requiring this court to recognize the implementation exception.instead,appellants urge us to consider two cases from the ninth and second circuits,as well as six district court cases from pennsylvania.id.at see also appellant reply.these cases are inapposite.
the ninth circuit held in porter board of trustees of manhattan beach unified school district,cir,that since the parents exhausted the idea administrative process and obtained an order for a compensatory education program for their child,they were not required to again exhaust the idea administrative process or to comply with the state complaint resolution before they could sue in federal court for failure to implement the program.id.the facts of porter are materially different from the case at hand,as appellants here have not invoked the idea administrative process in the past.moreover,although the parties entered into the binding settlement agreement,as a threshold matter that is not a final decision issued by a hearing officer that they can argue the district failed to implement.see i a a decision made in a due process hearing shall be final id.i any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section emphasis added.
in dicta,the second circuit has also acknowledged an implementation exception where the only issue presented is that a school failed to implement services that were specified or otherwise clearly stated in an iep.polera,at ultimately,however,the polera court declined from applying the exception because implementation of the iep was not the only issue presented.id.at.to the contrary,the ieps at issue did not clearly state the obligations of the school,and instead,their terms required the court interpretation.id as an initial matter,looking at the record before us,it is impossible to adopt this exception as the parties have not appended a copy of ryan iep.therefore,we do not know if appellants claims encompass both a failure to provide services and a significant underlying failure to specify what services were to be provided.id.however,even if appellants had provided ryan iep,we would not have occasion to adopt this exception because the implementation of the iep is not the sole issue in dispute.rather,unlike the plaintiffs in polera,appellants here make substantive claims under the idea for failure to provide a fape,in addition to claims for retaliation.in accord,it would be inappropriate to apply an implementation exception in the case at bar 
futility exception to the idea exhaustion requirement 
lastly,appellants attempt to save their claims from dismissal by arguing that the futility exception to the idea exhaustion requirement applies.appellants br.their theory is that because batchelor had to sue the district not once but twice to enforce previous awards of compensatory education services,it is clear that a third resort to the idea administrate procedures to obtain further compensatory education would have been an exercise in futility.id.
the district alleged past failure to implement ryan section plan and iep is an insufficient basis to excuse the exhaustion requirement.appellees br.that said,appellants position does have traction in case law.see komninos,at matula,cir,abrogated on other grounds by jersey city pub,at overruling matula insofar as it held that money damages are available in a action based on an idea violation.
in matula,we employed the futility exception to excuse exhaustion,but notably,in that case,plaintiffs had previously participated in hearings in front of an administrative law judge to resolve the student classification and placement,and,in addition,the factual record was fully developed.at.under those circumstances,we determined that an action seeking compensation for the alleged idea violations is ripe for judicial resolution.id.also,in komninos,we recognized that the idea legislative history advises that exhaustion is not necessary when an emergency situation exists,the failure to take immediate action will adversely affect a child mental or physical health.at quoting,at.
district courts in this circuit have followed suit,implementing the futility exception where the plaintiff had previously exhausted administrative remedies,and where the factual record was sufficiently developed.the district courts have also expanded this rule to situations where the plaintiff sought remedies unavailable under the idea,and where the court was not presented with educational issues to be resolved.see derrick red lion area sch,d,further exhaustion would be futile where plaintiffs previously exhausted the administrative process adam scranton sch,cv,dist.lexis,at,same james sch.dist.of,d,exhaustion would be futile where there had been extensive administrative vicky northeastern educ.intermediate unit,d,exhaustion would be futile where plaintiffs sought damages for physical abuse and where no other educational issues needed resolution.
the instant case does not present any of the circumstances warranting the application of the futility exception appellants have not previously utilized the idea administrative process,the factual record is not developed and evidentiary issues are not resolved,the only remaining issue is not a measure of damages,and the idea administrative process is in fact able to provide a suitable remedy for the harms alleged we therefore decline to excuse the exhaustion requirement under the futility exception here 
iv.conclusion 
appellants have not exhausted the idea administrative process and fail to demonstrate that an exception applies.accordingly,we hold that the district court was correct in dismissing the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.for these reasons,we
