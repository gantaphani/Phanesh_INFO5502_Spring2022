on rehearing en banc 
reya boyer liberto,the african american plaintiff in these civil rights proceedings,alleges that within a single period in september,while working as a cocktail waitress at the clarion resort fontainebleau hotel in ocean city,maryland the clarion,she was twice called a porch monkey and threatened with the loss of her job by a caucasian restaurant manager.soon after reporting to at the hotel that she had been racially harassed,liberto was fired by the clarion owner,leonard berger.this action against the fontainebleau corporation and berger ensued,with liberto asserting claims of hostile work environment and retaliation,under both title vii of the civil rights act of and.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants,see boyer liberto fontainebleau,cv,ecf,and a panel of this court affirmed,see boyer liberto fontainebleau,cir.the panel decision was vacated,however,by our grant of rehearing en banc.
as explained below,we now vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings on liberto claims.in so doing,we underscore the supreme court pronouncement in faragher city of boca raton,d,that an isolated incident of harassment,if extremely serious,can create a hostile work environment.we also recognize that an employee is protected from retaliation when she reports an isolated incident of harassment that is physically threatening or humiliating,even if a hostile work environment is not engendered by that incident alone.finally,we specify that,to the extent today decision is in conflict with jordan alternative resources,cir,jordan is hereby overruled.
the record in this matter reflects that on august,liberto began working at the clarion,an oceanfront hotel containing guest rooms,several restaurants and bars,a nightclub,and a conference center with meeting and banquet facilities during the seven weeks she was employed with the clarion food and beverage department,liberto worked in assorted roles,including restaurant hostess,restaurant and banquet server,bartender,and cocktail waitress.according to liberto,the clarion assigned her that variety of jobs so that she could learn all positions within the food and beverage department as part of her training.
on the night of september,liberto was working as a cocktail waitress in the clarion nightclub.one of her customers ordered a hula hula,a drink that is to prepare.the bartender in the adjacent main bar refused to fill the order,explaining to liberto that other nightclub patrons would see the hula hula and want that drink,too.in an effort to please her customer and after consulting immediate supervisor jamie avery,liberto went beyond the main bar to the pub bar,where she found a bartender willing to make a hula hula.once the drink was prepared,liberto wanted to avoid a confrontation with the bartender in the main bar,so she chose a new path back to the nightclub that took her through the restaurant kitchen.liberto carried the hula hula briskly through the kitchen and across the nightclub to her customer table.she then went to a server station,which was located in the nightclub several feet from the kitchen doors,to print a guest check.
at that point,liberto was confronted by trudi clubb,a white food and beverage manager at the clarion.unbeknownst to liberto,clubb had been yelling at liberto as she passed through the kitchen carrying the hula hula.liberto soon learned that clubb was livid because she believed that liberto had heard but ignored her.as liberto worked at the server station,clubb came through the kitchen doors,loudly screaming,hey,girl that ca hear.clubb,still shouting,quickly approached liberto,who turned her face away from clubb in an effort to remain calm a move that made clubb even more furious.clubb then came so close to liberto that liberto could feel clubb breath on her face as clubb stood at liberto side.indeed,continuing to yell at liberto,clubb sprayed liberto face with saliva.clubb message was that liberto should have neither walked through the kitchen nor ignored clubb,and liberto repeatedly indicated that she understood and agreed.
clubb shouting nonetheless persisted,even as liberto left the server station to tend to nightclub customers.clubb was now loudly berating liberto for walking away from her,at first following liberto into the nightclub and then moving back to the server station.upon liberto subsequent return to that area,clubb finally proceeded to exit the nightclub into the kitchen.as she did so,clubb threatened liberto in words that included,i going to get you and i going to make you sorry.clubb then concluded her threat by turning to look at liberto and calling her either a damn porch monkey or a dang porch monkey.see id.at.
upon arriving for a dinner shift the following day,september,liberto went to the clarion management office to report clubb conduct to food and beverage director richard heubeck.liberto had just begun talking to heubeck when she was interrupted by clubb,who came into the office and said to liberto,i need to speak to you,little girl.liberto responded that she was meeting with heubeck,but clubb retorted,i more important,prompting liberto to follow clubb out of the office.id.at.clubb and liberto sat at a nearby table,and clubb reprimanded liberto,in a raised and angry voice,for passing through the kitchen the prior night.as the two women then rose from the table and pushed in their chairs,clubb threatened,i gon na get you.i gon na go to hotel owner berger.id.at.her voice still loud and angry though somewhat lower than before,clubb capped the threat by looking directly at liberto and again calling her a porch monkey.id.at.
on september,liberto arranged to speak with human resources director nancy berghauer by telephone the following day.during the september phone call,liberto complained that she had been racially harassed by clubb.from handwritten notes,berghauer prepared a typewritten summary of her discussion with liberto,which included liberto allegation that clubb called her a porch monkey on september.berghauer provided the summary on september to berger and general manager mark elman,and elman met with liberto on september to further discuss her complaint.meanwhile,although clubb denied ever using the term porch monkey,heubeck issued her a written notice on september advising that,as a member of our food beverage management team,clubb is expected to conduct herself as such and needs to be cautious the language or phrases she uses can not be perceived as racist or derogatory.
according to berger,liberto racial harassment complaint of september,prompted him to go to heubeck that day and ask for the first time ever about liberto performance.in berger account,heubeck gave a negative evaluation of liberto and attributed her variety of job assignments to failure in every role she tried thus,after further consulting elman and berghauer between september and,berger made the decision to fire liberto immediately.at the beginning of her scheduled shift on september,liberto was notified that she was being discharged.
whether clubb had been empowered by the clarion to fire liberto or take other tangible employment actions against her is unclear on this record.from liberto perspective during her short time as a clarion employee,clubb was just berger friend and she was just there to say hello and greet people as a glorified hostess.liberto did not know that clubb held a manager title and did not consider clubb to be her manager.see id.at liberto deposition testimony that she reported to avery and heubeck,and that avery told liberto not to go to clubb because clubb did not have the power to do voids or make decisions.nevertheless,clubb conveyed to liberto and liberto got the message that clubb was in a position to have liberto terminated.before she had finished just her second week of work at the clarion,liberto felt extremely singled out by clubb and perceived that my position was being threatened by her.see id.at discussing an august,twitter message from liberto to a saying that clubb is after me like a starving wol f on a bone.clubb repeatedly told liberto what my place was and always made it clear that berger would listen to anything she said and would believe me.id.at.clubb conduct led liberto to understand that clubb did have power that i did not have.id.at.consistent with that perception,elman informed liberto during their september,meeting that clubb was liberto boss.see id.at september email to heubeck and berghauer from elman recounting what he told liberto.
on january,after exhausting her administrative remedies with the federal government equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc,liberto filed her complaint in the district of maryland.the complaint asserted four claims one claim each of hostile work environment and retaliation pursuant to title vii against solely the fontainebleau corporation,trading as the clarion resort fontainebleau hotel and one claim each of hostile work environment and retaliation under against both the fontainebleau corporation and berger.
following discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.contesting the validity of the hostile work environment claims,the defendants focused on just one of the four elements of such a claim,contending that there had been no showing that clubb conduct was severe or pervasive enough to alter liberto conditions of employment and produce an abusive work environment.see okoli city of,cir to demonstrate a racially hostile work environment,a plaintiff must show that there is unwelcome conduct that is based on the plaintiff race which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiff conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment and which is imputable to the employer.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also spriggs diamond auto glass,cir explaining that the elements of a hostile work environment claim are the same under either or title vii.
with respect to the retaliation claims,the defendants argued that liberto could not establish that she undertook a protected activity by making her racial harassment complaint to the clarion.see eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must prove three elements that she engaged in a protected activity that her employer took an adverse employment action against her and that there was a causal link between the two events.see also honor booz allen hamilton,cir recognizing that elements of prima facie and title vii retaliation claims are identical.the defendants elaborated that liberto complaint was not a protected opposition activity because she could not reasonably have believed that clubb conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to engender a prohibited hostile work environment.see navy,at explaining that an opposition activity,such as making an internal complaint,is protected where an employee opposes either employment actions actually unlawful under title vii or employment actions she reasonably believes to be unlawful.
in seeking summary judgment,the defendants substantially relied on our precedent in jordan alternative resources,cir.there,the african american plaintiff alleged that,while watching a news report on a workplace television about the capture of the infamous snipers in,a exclaimed in his presence,they should put those two black monkeys in a cage with a bunch of black apes and let the apes f uc k them.see jordan,at.the plaintiff,jordan,reported the comment to his supervisors and was fired within a month of his complaint.id.at.jordan then filed suit against his employers,alleging,inter alia,retaliatory discharge in contravention of title vii and.id.the district court dismissed jordan complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and jordan appealed to our court,which affirmed by a split panel decision.
addressing the title vii retaliation claim,the opinion of the panel majority related that,under title vii,i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.jordan,at quoting a.the majority continued that,r eading the language generously to give effect to its purpose,however,we have also held that opposition activity is protected when it responds to an employment practice that the employee reasonably believes is unlawful.id.citing navy,at.
the jordan majority observed that the employment practices that may be the subject of protected opposition activity include discrimination under a in the form of maintaining a racially hostile work environment,a workplace permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.jordan,at quoting harris forklift,d.the majority further recognized that c ourts determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by looking at all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.id.quoting faragher city of boca raton,d.as the majority explained,simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.id.quoting faragher,at.the majority also noted that hostile work environments generally result only after an accumulation of discrete instances of harassment.id.citing passenger morgan,d hostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts.their very nature involves repeated conduct such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.
to assess the merits of jordan title vii retaliation claim,the panel majority clarified,the question reduces to whether jordan complained about an actual hostile work environment or,if there was not one,whether jordan could reasonably have believed there was one.jordan,at.the majority first concluded that no hostile work environment actually existed,in that the black monkeys comment though unacceptably crude and racist was an isolated response directed at the snipers rather than any fellow employee.id.at.the majority underscored that the comment was a singular and isolated exclamation that did not and could not have altered the terms and conditions of jordan employment,and that jordan did not describe a workplace permeated by racism,by threats of violence,by improper interference with work,or by conduct resulting in psychological harm.id.at.
turning to the issue of jordan reasonable belief,the panel majority concluded that no objectively reasonable person could have believed that jordan workplace was in the grips of a hostile work environment.jordan,at.but the majority also acknowledged that,pursuant to navy federal,jordan could rely on a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was taking shape.see id.at navy federal holds that an employee seeking protection from retaliation must have an objectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances that a title vii violation has happened or is in progress.see also navy,at concluding that plaintiff reasonably believed she was opposing unlawful retaliation by disrupting plan that had been set in motion by employer to terminate another employee for her u nder a as construed by navy federal,we can not simply assume,without more,that the opposed conduct will continue or will be repeated unabated rather,the employee must have an objectively reasonable belief that a violation is actually occurring based on circumstances that the employee observes and reasonably believes.jordan,at emphasis omitted.from there,the majority determined that jordan could not establish a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was in progress,in that no allegation in the complaint suggests that a plan was in motion to create such an environment,let alone that such an environment was even likely to occur.id.at.accordingly,the majority opinion affirmed the dismissal of jordan title vii retaliation claim,as well as his retaliation claim.
the jordan dissent agreed with the panel majority that,to gain protection for his opposition activity,an employee may rely on a reasonable belief that title vii is in the process of being violated by the conduct being opposed.see jordan,at king,dissenting citing navy,at.the dissent disputed the majority view,however,that navy federal requires an employee opposing a potential hostile work environment to prove that a plan was in motion to create such an environment.that is,the dissent distinguished the discrete action opposed by the navy federal plaintiff the imminent retaliatory discharge of another employee from the conduct opposed in jordan conduct that,if repeated,could amount to a hostile work environment.
the jordan dissent concluded that,b y opposing racially charged conduct that he reasonably believes could be part and parcel of a hostile work environment,a reporting employee has opposed the impermissible whole,even absent an independent basis for believing the conduct might be repeated.jordan,at.indeed,the dissent emphasized,we require employees to report such incidents in order to prevent hostile work environments from coming into being.id.referring to employer affirmative defense,see faragher,at burlington ellerth,d,imposing duty on employee to avoid harm by reporting harassment to employer.the dissent further highlighted precedent observing that an employee generalized fear of retaliation does not excuse a failure to report harassing conduct,because title vii expressly prohibits any retaliation against employees for reporting harassment.id.at alterations in original quoting barrett applied radiant energy,cir.and,the dissent stressed the supreme court edict that i nterpreting the antiretaliation provision to provide broad protection from retaliation helps assure the cooperation upon which accomplishment of title vii primary objective preventing harm depends.id.at alteration in original quoting burlington santa fe ry.white,d.
at bottom,the jordan dissent recognized that the black monkeys comment made by jordan is the stuff of which a racially hostile work environment is made,and thus that it was entirely reasonable for jordan to believe that,in reporting the comment to his employers,he was opposing a racially hostile work environment.jordan,at.the dissent lamented that,because of the panel majority opinion to the contrary,employees in this circuit who experience racially harassing conduct are faced with a catch.id.as the dissent explained those employees quandary,t hey may report such conduct to their employer at their peril as jordan did,or they may remain quiet and work in a racially hostile and degrading work environment,with no legal recourse beyond resignation.id.but see jordan,at the majority retort that jordan dilemma,that the law is inconsistent by both encouraging and discouraging early reporting,is presented too abstractly.the strong policy of removing and preventing workplace discrimination can and does coexist with navy federal objective reasonableness standard.the opinion of the jordan majority thereafter withstood a petition for rehearing en banc,which was denied on a vote of the judges then in active service.see jordan alternative res,cir.
here,by its decision of april,the district court relied on jordan and awarded summary judgment to the defendants,adopting their contentions that clubb conduct was not so severe or pervasive as to create a hostile work environment or to instill a reasonable belief in liberto,such as would protect her from retaliation,that she had been unlawfully harassed.see boyer liberto fontainebleau,cv,ecf in rejecting liberto hostile work environment claims,the district court determined that t he two incidents of use of a racial epithet,assuming they occurred as liberto testified,simply do not comprise either pervasive or severe conduct,however unacceptable they are.id.at.the court explained that it had compare d the evidence in this case to that in three others and conclude d the conduct at issue here does not rise to the level of conduct found to be severe or pervasive in those fourth circuit cases.id.citing anderson,cir anderson was subjected,on a daily basis,to verbal assaults of the most vulgar and humiliating sort.conner schrader bridgeport int l,cir conner experienced regular,profound humiliation because of her gender,unlike the male machine operators.amirmokri balt.gas,cir amirmokri testified that for six months abused him almost daily,calling him names like the local terrorist,a camel jockey and the emir of waldorf.the district court then invoked jordan for the proposition that an isolated racist comment is a far cry from an environment of crude and racist conditions so severe or pervasive that they alter the conditions of plaintiff employment.id.third alteration in original quoting jordan,at.in concomitantly rejecting liberto retaliation claims,the court again looked to jordan and ruled that no objectively reasonable person could have believed that the plaintiff work environment was,or was soon going to be,infected by severe or pervasive racist,threatening,or humiliating harassment.id.at alteration in original quoting jordan,at.
liberto timely noted her appeal,and the matter was reviewed by a panel of this court.see boyer liberto fontainebleau,cir.the panel decision was unanimous that the defendants were properly awarded summary judgment on liberto hostile work environment claims,in that clubb use of the term porch monkey twice in a period of two days in discussions about a single incident,was not,as a matter of law,so severe or pervasive as to change the terms and conditions of liberto employment.id.at.the panel observed that liberto had not pointed to any fourth circuit case,nor could she,finding the presence of a hostile work environment based on a single incident.id.at comparing jordan with anderson,conner,and amirmokri.
the panel was split,however,with respect to liberto retaliation claims.the opinion of the panel majority validated the district court summary judgment award on those claims,explaining that,if no objectively reasonable juror could have found the presence of a hostile work environment,as we today hold,it stands to reason that liberto also could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment existed.boyer liberto,at emphasis omitted.although the panel majority allowed that an employee opposition may be protected before the hostile environment has fully taken form,the majority faulted liberto for failing to present any indicators that the situation at the clarion would have ripened into a hostile work environment.id.in that regard,the majority equated liberto case with jordan.see id.just as in jordan,we conclude here that while in the abstract,continued repetition of racial comments of the kind clubb made might have led to a hostile work environment,no allegation in the record suggests that a plan was in motion to create such an environment,let alone that such an environment was even likely to occur.alterations in original quoting jordan,at see also id.at shedd,concurring based on this court decision in jordan,i agree with judge niemeyer that summary judgment should be affirmed on the retaliation claim.
the dissent distinguished the facts in this case from those in jordan and concluded that,p articularly in light of these significant differences,liberto could have reasonably believed that clubb conduct was actionable.boyer liberto,at traxler,concurring in part and dissenting in part pointing out that jordan made a single comment not directed at jordan or another employee,while clubb called liberto herself the very same name in the very same threatening context on two consecutive days.in any event,the dissent also questioned whether jordan was correctly decided.see id.i share in the sentiment judge king expressed so well in his dissent in jordan that our very narrow interpretation of what constitutes a reasonable belief in this context has placed employees who experience racially discriminatory conduct in a classic catch situation.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
following issuance of the panel decision,liberto sought rehearing en banc,and a majority of our judges in regular active service voted to grant liberto petition.accordingly,the panel decision was vacated,and today our en banc court assesses anew the propriety of the district court summary judgment award to the defendants.see cir.c.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see laber harvey,cir en banc.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
we begin by addressing liberto hostile work environment claims an endeavor that leads us to outline pertinent legal principles,including some of those already identified above.title vii renders it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.an employer contravenes a by,inter alia,requiring an african american employee to work in a racially hostile environment.see meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d.a hostile environment exists w hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris forklift,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,to prevail on a title vii claim that a workplace is racially hostile,a plaintiff must show that there is unwelcome conduct that is based on the plaintiff race which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the plaintiff conditions of employment and to create an abusive work environment and which is imputable to the employer.okoli city of,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.the same test applies to a hostile work environment claim asserted under.see spriggs diamond auto glass,cir see also a providing that a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens jones donnelley sons,d recognizing that hostile work environment claims may be brought under.
element three of a hostile work environment claim requires a showing that the environment would reasonably be perceived,and is perceived,as hostile or abusive the plaintiff may,but is not required to,establish that the environment is psychologically injurious.see harris,at.whether the environment is objectively hostile or abusive is judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position.oncale sundowner offshore,d.that determination is made by looking at all the circumstances,which may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris,at.it is not,and by its nature can not be,a mathematically precise test.id.at.
to be sure,viable hostile work environment claims often involve repeated conduct.see passenger morgan,d.that is because,in direct contrast to discrete acts,a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.id.at.for example,mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate title vii.harris,at alteration in original quoting meritor,at.the same goes for simple teasing and offhand comments.see faragher city of boca raton,d.importantly,however,an isolated incident of harassment can amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment,if that incident is extremely serious.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in measuring the severity of harassing conduct,the status of the harasser may be a significant factor,a supervisor use of a racial epithet impacts the work environment far more severely than use by.rodgers.life ins,cir.simply put,a supervisor power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character.burlington,ellerth,d.
the status of the harasser also is relevant to element four of a hostile work environment claim,which necessitates proof that the harassment is imputable to the employer.on the one hand,i f the harassing employee is the victim,the employer is liable only if it was negligent in controlling working conditions.vance ball state,d see also ocheltree scollon,cir en banc t he employer may be liable in negligence if it knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take effective action to stop it.on the other hand,where the harasser is the victim supervisor,different rules apply the employer is strictly liable for the supervisor harassing behavior if it culminates in a tangible employment action,but otherwise may escape liability by establishing,as an affirmative defense,that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any harassing behavior and that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the employer provided.vance.at citing faragher,at ellerth,at.the defense,in essence,imposes a duty on the victim to report her supervisor harassing behavior to the employer.see barrett applied radiant energy,cir discussing employee reporting requirement under faragher and ellerth.relatedly,a plaintiff seeking to impute liability to her employer for harassment by a may not be able to establish the employer negligence if she did not report the harassment.see vance.at recognizing that evidence relevant to negligence inquiry would include evidence that employer failed to respond to complaints id.at ginsburg,dissenting an employee may have a reputation as a harasser among those in his vicinity,but if no complaint makes its way up to management,the employer will escape liability under a negligence standard.
for purposes of the employer vicarious liability,the harasser qualifies as a supervisor,rather than a,if he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.vance.at majority opinion.an employee so empowered is able to effect a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at quoting ellerth,at.as such,a supervisor has the authority to inflict direct economic injury.id.at.
to be considered a supervisor,the employee need not have the final say as to the tangible employment action instead,the employee decision may be subject to approval by higher management.vance.at citing ellerth,at.the vance court determined that one of the harassers in faragher possessed the power to make employment decisions having direct economic consequences for his victims based on the following no one had been hired without his recommendation he initiated firing and suspending personnel his performance evaluations translated into salary increases and he made recommendations regarding promotions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,the court observed that,even if an employer concentrates all authority in a few individuals,it likely will not isolate itself from heightened liability under faragher and ellerth,in that those individuals likely will have to rely on the recommendations of others,and the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions to the employees on whose recommendations it relies.id.at citing ellerth,at.
in seeking summary judgment on liberto hostile work environment claims,the defendants sole contention was that there had been no showing that clubb conduct was severe or pervasive enough to alter liberto conditions of employment and produce an abusive work environment.liberto included that there was a genuine dispute as to whether the harassment she suffered on september and,was sufficiently severe.to resolve that issue today,we need not and,in any event,on this record can not determine whether clubb was actually liberto supervisor or simply her,a fact relevant to the separate question of the clarion vicarious liability.nevertheless,we are obliged to consider how clubb portrayed her authority and what liberto thus reasonably believed clubb power to be.see oncale,at t he objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position.
the defendants have suggested that,because liberto understood clubb to be a glorified hostess and not a restaurant manager,see,liberto could not have reasonably perceived that clubb conduct was severe enough to create a hostile work environment.that premise ignores evidence,however,that clubb repeatedly and effectively communicated to liberto prior to september,that clubb had berger ear and could have liberto fired.see,id.at liberto deposition testimony that clubb did have power that i did not have id.at i felt extremely singled out and that my position was being threatened and it was very clear.id.i was told what my place was and clubb always made it clear that berger would listen to anything she said and would believe me.
the defendants theory also fails to take into account clubb assertion of power in the course of her harassment of liberto.on september,clubb berated liberto job performance before threatening to get her and make her sorry,and then calling her a damn porch monkey or a dang porch monkey.see.the following day,clubb obstructed liberto attempted report of racial harassment to food and beverage director heubeck by telling liberto,i need to speak to you,little girl,and i more important than heubeck.id.at.immediately thereafter,clubb again reprimanded liberto,again threatened to get her and to go to berger,and again called her a porch monkey.id.at.finally,while speaking with liberto on september about her racial harassment complaint,general manager elman validated clubb assertion of authority by declaring clubb to be liberto boss.id.at.
properly considering that evidence,we must accept that liberto believed and reasonably so that clubb could make a discharge decision or recommendation that would be by berger.thus,in gauging the severity of clubb conduct,we deem clubb to have been liberto supervisor.vance.at,recognizing that,for purposes of employer vicarious liability,employee may qualify as supervisor if she can initiate tangible employment actions subject to approval by higher management or make recommendations on which employer relies.and we view clubb conduct as having the particular threatening character of harassment perpetrated by a supervisor against her subordinate.see ellerth,at.that perspective is especially appropriate here,where clubb employed racial epithets to cap explicit,angry threats that she was on the verge of utilizing her supervisory powers to terminate liberto employment.
we also grasp that the use of clubb chosen slur porch monkey is about as odious as the use of the word nigger.see spriggs,at.the latter epithet,of course,is pure anathema to african americans.id.similarly,describing an african american as a monkey,and thereby suggest ing that a human being physical appearance is essentially a caricature of a jungle beast,goes far beyond the merely unflattering it is degrading and humiliating in the extreme.see also,green franklin bank of minneapolis,cir recognizing that p rimate rhetoric has been used to intimidate african americans and that t he use of the term monkey and other similar words,including the variation porch monkey,has been part of actionable racial harassment claims across the country citing cases.as we and several of our sister courts of appeals have recognized,p erhaps no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as nigger by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.spriggs,at quoting rodgers,at accord ellis houston,cir ayissi etoh fannie mae,rivera rochester genesee reg l transp,cir mcginest gte serv,cir.
consequently,a reasonable jury could find that clubb two uses of the porch monkey epithet whether viewed as a single incident or as a pair of discrete instances of harassment were severe enough to engender a hostile work environment.adams austal,cir concluding that,although a caucasian supervisor carving of porch monkeys into the aluminum of a ship where he was working with the african american plaintiff was an isolated act,it was severe ayissi etoh,at acknowledging that,where a supervisor used a deeply offensive racial epithet nigger when yelling at ayissi etoh to get out of the office,that single incident might well have been sufficient to establish a hostile work environment id.at kavanaugh,concurring i n my view,being called the by a supervisor as ayissi etoh alleges happened to him suffices by itself to establish a racially hostile work environment.
in thus vacating the summary judgment award on liberto hostile work environment claims,we identify this as the type of case contemplated in faragher where the harassment,though perhaps isolated,can properly be deemed to be extremely serious.see faragher,at.we also acknowledge that this is a first for our court.we reject,however,any notion that our prior decisions,including jordan alternative resources,were meant to require more than a single incident of harassment in every viable hostile work environment case.specifically,we observe that the district court improperly analogized this matter involving a racial epithet directed at liberto by her supervisor to jordan concerning a racist remark that was made by a mere and not aimed at jordan or any other employee.see,cir.we further note that,in the cases unfavorably compared to this one by the district court,the harassment was so severe and pervasive that there were no close calls.see anderson,cir the evidence was unquestionably sufficient to submit anderson hostile environment claim to the jury.conner schrader bridgeport int l,cir t here is ample support for the jury finding of severe or pervasive conduct sufficient to constitute a hostile work environment.amirmokri balt.gas,cir a reasonable person could easily find this atmosphere to be hostile.liberto case may be different from anderson,conner,and amirmokri,but it is no less worthy of a jury trial 
turning to liberto retaliation claims,title vii proscribes discrimination against an employee because,in relevant part,she has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter.a.employees engage in protected oppositional activity when,inter alia,they complain to their superiors about suspected violations of title vii.bryant aiken reg l med.ctrs,cir.to establish a prima facie case of retaliation in contravention of title vii,a plaintiff must prove that she engaged in a protected activity,as well as that her employer took an adverse employment action against her,and that there was a causal link between the two events.eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir.a prima facie retaliation claim under has the same elements.see honor booz allen hamilton,cir see also cbocs,humphries,d confirming that encompasses retaliation claims 
in the context of element one of a retaliation claim,an employee is protected when she opposes not only employment actions actually unlawful under title vii but also employment actions she reasonably believes to be unlawful.navy,at.the title vii violation may be complete,or it may be in progress.see id.at see also jordan,at navy federal holds that an employee seeking protection from retaliation must have an objectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances that a title vii violation has happened or is in progress.peters jenney,cir concluding,in reliance on decisions under title vii,that to show protected activity,the plaintiff in a title vi retaliation case need only prove that he opposed an unlawful employment practice which he reasonably believed had occurred or was occurring alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,an employee is protected from retaliation when she opposes a hostile work environment that,although not fully formed,is in progress.
the panel majority in jordan ruled that,where an employee has complained to his employer of an isolated incident of harassment insufficient to create a hostile work environment,the employee can not have possessed a reasonable belief that a title vii violation was in progress,absent evidence that a plan was in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment was otherwise likely to occur.see at.we reject that aspect of jordan today,however,for several reasons.
first of all,the jordan standard imagines a fanciful world where bigots announce their intentions to repeatedly belittle racial minorities at the outset,and it ignores the possibility that a hostile work environment could evolve without some specific intention to alter the working conditions of african americans through racial harassment.see jordan,at king,dissenting.tellingly,intent to create a hostile work environment is not an element of a hostile environment claim.
the jordan standard also is at odds with the hope and expectation that employees will report harassment early,before harasser is her supervisor and no tangible employment action has been taken,the victim is compelled by the defense to make an internal complaint,to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.see faragher,at.similarly,the victim of a harassment is prudent to alert her employer in order to ensure that,if the harassment continues,she can establish the negligence necessary to impute liability.see vance.at.the reporting obligation is essential to accomplishing title vii primary objective,which is not to provide redress but to avoid harm.see faragher,at.thus,we have recognized that the victim is commanded to report the misconduct,not investigate,gather evidence,and then approach company officials.see matvia bald head island mgmt,cir.further,we have emphasized that an employee generalized fear of retaliation does not excuse a failure to report harassment,particularly where title vii expressly prohibits any retaliation against the reporting employee.see barrett,at.
but rather than encourage the early reporting vital to achieving title vii goal of avoiding harm,the jordan standard deters harassment victims from speaking up by depriving them of their statutory entitlement to protection from retaliation.such a lack of protection is no inconsequential matter,for fear of retaliation is the leading reason why people stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about bias and discrimination.see crawford metro.gov t of nashville davidson,d internal quotation marks omitted.quelling that fear,the crawford court extended protection to an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative,but in answering questions during an employer internal investigation.see id.at.to do otherwise,the court explained,would create a real dilemma for any knowledgeable employee.id.at.namely,i f the employee reported discrimination in response to the enquiries,the employer might well be free to penalize her for speaking up.but if she kept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a title vii claim,the employer might well escape liability by invoking the defense.id.the court concluded that n othing in the statute text or our precedent supports this catch.id.of course,the same can be,and has been,said about the jordan standard.see jordan,at king,dissenting as a result of today decision,employees in this circuit who experience racially harassing conduct are faced with a catch.
put succinctly,the jordan standard is incompatible with crawford,as well as other supreme court decisions directing that title vii antiretaliation provision be interpreted to provide broad protection from retaliation.see burlington santa fe ry.white,d see also,thompson am.stainless,lp,d.as the burlington northern court explained,title vii must be read to provide broader protection for victims of retaliation than for even victims of,or discrimination,because effective enforcement could only be expected if employees felt free to approach officials with their grievances.see at internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,we need look no further than jordan itself to comprehend that the jordan standard is unsuited to its purpose.in jordan presence,his made a comment that,in a single breath,equated african americans with black monkeys and black apes,and implied a savage,bestial sexual predilection acutely insulting to members of the african american community.see jordan,at king,dissenting.jordan then did exactly what title vii hopes and expects he reported the comment to his employers in an effort to avert any further racial harassment.because of his internal complaint,however,jordan was fired.in light of the text and purpose of title vii,as well as controlling supreme court and fourth circuit decisions,jordan surely merited protection from retaliation.that is,
w ithout question,the comment made by jordan coworker is the stuff of which a racially hostile work environment is made.on the allegations here,it was entirely reasonable for jordan to believe that,in reporting the racially charged black monkeys comment to his employers,he was opposing a racially hostile work environment.
id.at citations omitted.but,by devising and applying the jordan standard,we denied jordan any legal recourse for his retaliatory discharge.in these circumstances,the jordan standard plainly can not endure.
the question,then,becomes this what is the proper standard for determining whether an employee who reports an isolated incident of harassment has a reasonable belief that she is opposing a hostile work environment in progress we conclude that,when assessing the reasonableness of an employee belief that a hostile environment is occurring based on an isolated incident,the focus should be on the severity of the harassment.clark cnty.sch.dist.breeden,d looking to severity of single incident in evaluating reasonableness of employee belief that incident created actionable hostile environment.that assessment thus involves factors used to judge whether a workplace is sufficiently hostile or abusive for purposes of a hostile environment claim specifically,whether the discriminatory conduct is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance.see harris,at.of course,a single offensive utterance,simple teasing or an offhand comment,see faragher,at generally will not create a hostile environment without significant repetition or an escalation in the harassment severity.see ayissi etoh,at kavanaugh,concurring the more severe the harassment,the less pervasive it needs to be,and vice versa.internal quotation marks omitted.but an isolated incident that is physically threatening or humiliating will be closer even if not equal to the type of conduct actionable on its own because it is extremely serious.see faragher,at.
accordingly,as relevant here,an employee will have a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment is occurring based on an isolated incident if that harassment is physically threatening or humiliating.this standard is consistent not only with clark county,but also with other supreme court precedent,including crawford and burlington northern.that is so because it protects an employee like jordan who promptly speaks up to attack the racist cancer in his workplace,rather than remain ing silent and thereby allowing discriminatory conduct to continue unchallenged,while forfeiting any judicial remedy he might have.see jordan,at king,dissenting.
in sum,under the standard that we adopt today with guidance from the supreme court,an employee is protected from retaliation for opposing an isolated incident of harassment when she reasonably believes that a hostile work environment is in progress,with no requirement for additional evidence that a plan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is likely to occur.the employee will have a reasonable belief that a hostile environment is occurring if the isolated incident is physically threatening or humiliating 
because the defendants contested liberto retaliation claims on the lone ground that she did not engage in a protected activity,our analysis is limited to whether a jury could find that liberto reasonably believed there was a hostile work environment in progress when she reported clubb use of the porch monkey slur.applying the standard that we adopt today,the answer plainly is yes.as we recognized in analyzing liberto hostile work environment claims,porch monkey is a racial epithet that is not just humiliating,but degrading and humiliating in the extreme.see spriggs,at.indeed,we determined that a reasonable jury could find that clubb two uses of porch monkey were serious enough to engender a hostile environment.we must further conclude,therefore,in the context of the retaliation claims,that liberto has made the lesser showing that the harassment was sufficiently severe to render reasonable her belief that a hostile environment was occurring.accordingly,we vacate the summary judgment award on liberto retaliation claims,in addition to her hostile work environment claims.we also underscore that,on remand,a jury would be entitled to simultaneously reject the hostile work environment claims on the ground that clubb conduct was not sufficiently serious to amount to a hostile environment,but award relief on the retaliation claims by finding that clubb conduct was severe enough to give liberto a reasonable belief that a hostile environment,although not fully formed,was in progress.
our good dissenting colleague has a different view of the controlling law,the relevant facts,and even what our en banc majority does and does not say.see post at niemeyer,dissenting.with respect to the hostile work environment claims,there is disagreement over what the supreme court meant by this sentence from faragher 
a recurring point in our hostile environment opinions is that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.
see at internal quotation marks omitted.we read that sentence to pronounce that an isolated incident of harassment,if extremely serious,can create a hostile environment.but,clinging to faragher use of isolated incidents in the plural,the dissent posits that only multiple,extremely serious isolated incidents may produce a hostile work environment.post at.
clearly,it is the dissent interpretation of faragher not ours that is untenable.to illustrate,the dissent elsewhere observes that a hostile environment claim must be based on the cumulative effect of individual acts,post at quoting morgan,at,and that,to be actionable under title vii,conduct must be so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,id.at alteration in original emphasis added quoting meritor,at.strikingly,the dissent does not and surely can not explain what differentiates isolated incidents that must be extremely serious,from individual acts that may be severe or pervasive.the dissent also quotes from morgan that a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own,id.at quoting morgan,at,without acknowledging the obvious import of morgan use of may not rather than can not.and,the dissent itself allows that a single,isolated incident of physical violence may be actionable,id.at,without even attempting to reconcile that proposition with its reading of faragher.
relatedly,the dissent criticizes us for fail ing to note that the portions of faragher to which we cite were part of the supreme court much lengthier discussion and substantively different message describing the type of conduct that would not violate title vii.post at.in pursuing its position,the dissent simply ignores faragher use of unless extremely serious to designate an exception to those isolated incidents that are not unlawful on their own.
meanwhile,the dissent repeatedly invokes faragher observation,mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not sufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to violate title vii.see faragher,at internal quotation marks omitted.but the dissent overemphasizes the first part of that sentence,at one point quoting the entire sentence while underscoring only m ere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet,see post at,and at another point actually omitting the phrase which engenders offensive feelings in an employee,see id.at.of course,the phrase which engenders offensive feelings in an employee is a critical qualifier,signifying a mere offensive utterance rather than a more egregious slur that is physically threatening or humiliating.see faragher,at explaining that the circumstances relevant to determining whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive include whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance quoting harris,at.
in any event,the dissent consistently minimizes the seriousness of clubb two uses of the porch monkey slur by deeming them to be merely offensive as a matter of law.to do so,the dissent invents a test under which harassment can not rise to the level of humiliating unless it is publicly humiliating,and points out that it appears that no one heard clubb direct the epithet at liberto on either occasion.see post at.the dissent also flouts our mandate to view the facts in the light most favorable to liberto,and insists that,as a fact,liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a,not her supervisor.id.at.regardless of what else liberto perceived about clubb status,however,there is ample evidence in the record showing that liberto reasonably believed that clubb possessed the one supervisory power that mattered the power to follow through on her threats to have berger liberto discharge 
as for the retaliation claims,the dissent accuses our en banc majority of gratuitously proceed ing to adopt an unprecedented standard that is much broader than necessary to resolve liberto claim s.post at.the dissent accusation rests on the false premise that we hold as a matter of law that a hostile work environment existed.in reality,we simply conclude that a reasonable jury could find for liberto with respect to her hostile environment claims.because it is possible that liberto will instead come up short at trial on those claims,our retaliation analysis is essential.indeed,we have emphasized that a jury may find that clubb conduct was insufficiently serious to engender a hostile environment,but severe enough to protect liberto from retaliation by rendering reasonable her belief that such an environment was underway.
unfortunately,there are further instances of the dissent inaccurate portrayal of today decision.for example,although we observe herein that our standard protects an employee like jordan from retaliation,the dissent asserts that we nowhere indicate that the plaintiff in jordan had a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was taking shape at the time he reported his racist comment to his supervisors.see post at.so,for the sake of clarity though too late to benefit jordan himself,we state in plain terms that a jury applying our standard could have found that jordan reasonably believed he was opposing a hostile environment in progress.that is because the black monkeys comment uttered to jordan like the porch monkey slurs aimed at liberto could readily be deemed physically threatening or humiliating.
we are entirely unswayed by the dissent warning that our standard will generate widespread litigation over the many offensive workplace comments made everyday that employees find to be humiliating.see post at.our standard is implicated solely when an employee suffers retaliation for engaging in an oppositional activity,and can be satisfied only by showing the objective reasonableness of the employee belief that an isolated incident of harassment was physically threatening or humiliating.we also reject the dissent prediction that our standard will surely generate many new questions and much over which harassing conduct qualifies as sufficiently severe.see id.at.judges and juries have been identifying what is humiliating,as well as what is physically threatening or merely offensive,since at least,when the supreme court explained in harris how to determine whether a workplace is objectively hostile or abusive for purposes of a hostile environment claim.see at 
finally,we are perplexed and dismayed by the dissent assertions that,on the one hand,liberto had every right to be offended by clubb use of a racial epithet and acted reasonably and responsibly in reporting the incident,see post at,and that,on the other hand,liberto spoke up too soon and thereby deprived herself of protection from retaliation.as the dissent would have it,although reporting clubb slur was a sensible thing to do,liberto should have waited for additional harassment to occur but not so much harassment that the clarion could avoid vicarious liability because of a lack of timely notice.concomitantly,the dissent contends that our decision manifests a fundamental distrust of employers,assuming that,once a humiliating epithet is uttered,the development of a hostile work environment is a fait accompli in other words,that employers are powerless or unwilling to prevent a descent into pervasive hostility.id.at.
contrary to the dissent,we seek to promote the hope and expectation ingrained in our civil rights laws and the supreme court decisions interpreting them that employees will report harassment early,so that their employers can stop it before it rises to the level of a hostile environment.employers are powerless in that regard only if they are unaware that harassment is occurring.but employees will understandably be wary of reporting abuse for fear of retribution.under today decision,employees who reasonably perceive an incident to be physically threatening or humiliating do not have to wait for further harassment before they can seek help from their employers without exposing themselves to retaliation.
pursuant to the foregoing,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.
vacated and remanded 
the remarks alleged in this title vii action are ones that americans of every race and all walks of life would find so wounding that the word offensive does not begin to describe them.it is incidents such as these,small as they may appear,that prevent our larger society from becoming the place of welcome it needs to be.
the good done by the civil rights laws has been enormous and one aim of those laws,as i understand it,is to make the workplace an environment where americans of every race,religion,sex,or national origin would actually want to work.and.
to say that a good workplace environment is poisoned by the kind of remarks alleged here is an understatement.who would wish to get up and come to work each morning fearful of encountering this sort of slur during the course of the working day 
there is a countervailing danger at play in these cases,however,namely that we not imbue the workplace with such stringent hostile work environment requirements that employers become speech police,that employees are estranged from one another,and that companies become private sector analogues of the surveillance state.
where and how to strike the balance in this case i would decline to hold the employer vicariously liable on the merits of the hostile work environment claim,but i would allow boyer liberto retaliation claim to proceed.in fact,were the truth of her complaint ascertained by the employer,the retaliation should have taken the form of clubb dismissal and not boyer liberto.
as to the merits of the hostile work environment claim,i would affirm the judgment of the district court on the grounds that any other result would stretch the notion of vicarious employer liability past the breaking point.there may be an understandable temptation to land hard on this employer,but there are dangers down the road.holding employers liable for remarks made by one of their employees where the majority points to no prior notice to the employer and no prior employer awareness of clubb racist tendencies is all too.to be sure,an employer is directly liable for a unlawful harassment if the employer was negligent with respect to the offensive behavior.vance ball state,d.but while the majority tries to make it appear as though some other evidence of employer malfeasance may be somewhere in the offing,see op.at,its opinion is wholly focused on the two incidents and remarks at issue and intent on directing a trial where the element of imputed employer liability has not been placed genuinely in dispute.
whatever hazy ground clubb may occupy between and supervisor,the hazards of imposing employer liability for remarks made by workers in workforces that might number in the hundreds or even thousands pushes imputed liability well beyond the more cabined circumstances of physical injury and actual adverse employment actions such as failures to promote or discharge.burlington santa fe ry.white,d.in this case,there were roughly people in the hotel food and beverage department alone.
having liability hinge upon utterances,of which companies have no prior awareness and which no victim has yet reported to them,poses more than the threat of liability.because liability hinges on unanticipated utterances,it will tend to drive employers as a protective measure into the role of censors of all speech that even conceivably could give offense.faragher city of boca raton,d rejecting employer liability for the sporadic use of abusive language,jokes,and occasional teasing citation and quotation marks omitted.we may assuredly expect the arrival of workplace speech codes,which,if not already present,will not be long in coming.oncale sundowner offshore,d noting that title vii was not meant to be a general civility code for the american workplace.such a heavy employer hand is a high price to pay for the majority holding,and it is one that is not congruent with supreme court rulings or consistent with our freedoms.
as to the title vii retaliation claim,an employee must show that her belief that a hostile work environment exists or is coming into existence is objectively reasonable.see clark cnty.sch.dist.breeden,d per curiam applying the objective standard eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir.
under the circumstances presented here,liberto belief that a hostile work environment existed or was coming into existence was objectively reasonable.the words alleged to have been spoken by clubb were abhorrent.moreover,clubb uttered the epithet on separate occasions and directed it personally at liberto.and the entire course of conduct surrounding the offensive remarks was abusive.this conduct on the part of clubb was enough to bring boyer liberto under the protection of the provision of title vii when she reported it.an employee is not an expert in hostile work environment law.any reasonable person must feel free to report this sort of vilification without being subject to retaliatory actions.an employee must feel safe and secure in bringing an incident of this nature to the attention of management.
any decent management,moreover,would seemingly wish to know of such an occurrence under its roof.employers must have complaint procedures for employees to utilize at an early harassing environments intensify and spread.see faragher city of boca raton,d burlington,ellerth,d.employers are due adequate notice so that they may head off both the hostile work environment and any resultant liability.employees benefit when an emergent hostile work environment is nipped in the bud.
but here,too,there is a balance to be struck.the annual number of title vii retaliation charges filed with the eeoc has nearly doubled since the late.of.sw.med.ctr.nassar,d.perhaps american employers have become twice as likely to retaliate against employees since,but i doubt it.one cause of the dramatic increase of retaliation claims may very well be a sub voce chipping away at the objectively reasonable belief standard.see id.at suggesting that lessening the causation standard for retaliation claims could also contribute to the filing of frivolous claims.the majority approach may very well raise the costs,both financial and reputational,on an employer where there is no true objectively reasonable belief in the existence of a hostile workplace.id.at.
the dangers of allowing the objective standard to slip,however,go far beyond the financial and reputational costs to companies.two severe,if subtle,side effects warrant discussion the trammeling of free speech and the construction of workplace barriers between the races and sexes.
if courts lessen their insistence on an objectively reasonable belief in a hostile environment and permit the reporting of all manner of perceived slights to warrant title vii protection,we become party to the creation of the workplace as a zone where first amendment values have ceased to be observed.in the context of a hostile work environment claim,it is crucial to use an objectively reasonable person standard to ensure that courts and juries do not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace for actionable discrimination.oncale sundowner offshore,d.the same is true for retaliation claims.
people will and should discuss controversial matters at work.some of those subjects may well pertain to race and gender.disagreement on these and other matters may be heated and robust,but it should not on that account be reportable.people may also say offensive things in the workplace.distasteful,even offensive,speech is unfortunate but it is often a necessary side effect of the broader enduring values that the first amendment protects.cohen california,d.the premise of the first amendment is that we as a people not leap quickly to suppression,see texas johnson,d,which may well occur if reportage and punishment for mere speech is an omnipresent possibility.
the remarks alleged here reached the point of abusiveness accompanied by threatening and intimidating body language.clubb approached so closely that boyer liberto could feel her breath and the shouting caused clubb to spit on her face.
actions are one thing.the greater danger lies in predicating liability on remarks.not here,because clubb language,to say the very least,played no essential part in any exposition of ideas.chaplinksy new hampshire.but there will be many instances of uncomfortable workplace speech that can not on that basis be deemed actionably hostile.it has always been the case that t o justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced.whitney california.brandeis,concurring emphasis added.a central function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute.terminiello city of chicago.unless the evil is imminent,the remedy to be applied is more speech,not enforced silence.whitney,at brandeis,concurring.more speech means insensitive expression in the workplace should be countered and denounced as such.but the bedrock meaning of the first amendment will be lost if the expression of disfavored or objectionable positions on sensitive and volatile issues become subjects of reportage and sanction.if every becomes a potential informant,does this environment not in time come to resemble societies other than our own 
initiatives need not be at war with free speech.the values protected by the fourteenth amendment need not be inconsistent with those safeguarded by the first.good things happen when people,in this case company employees,talk things out among themselves.collective discourse and is a matter the first amendment holds dear.abrams united states.holmes,dissenting noting that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.i agree with the majority that early reporting is vital to achieving title vii goal of avoiding harm.op.at.but the majority nowhere acknowledges the dangers of.it drifts ever so casually toward draconian consequences for mere utterance and speech.such blindness to first amendment values bespeaks a lack of faith in lateral discussions which would no doubt lead nowhere in the case of clubb and plaintiff,but which may be far preferable to reporting in working out the misunderstandings that occur in every workplace.
workplaces in their own way are our town squares.john talking to kathy may prove in the end more fruitful than john running to a higher authority to have kathy condemned.an objective test,not a subjective standard geared to the most heightened sensibilities,best preserves the balance between free speech and law.the fact that some incidents,as here,are plainly beyond the pale does not mean we surrender hope in other instances of workers reaching humane understandings in discussions with themselves.turning someone in as a course of first resort or on insubstantial grounds may perpetuate resentment and bring the prospect of employee dialogue to a premature end.
the law of hostile environments is not anchored in any specific statutory provision.rather,it was derived from title vii general prohibition of discrimination,meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d,and kept in proper perspective,it helps prevent companies from becoming intolerable places for racial,ethnic,and other minorities to work.hostile environment doctrine has also been judicially developed almost in the manner of federal common law.it would be wrong not to infuse this development with one of the greatest of our enumerated constitutional values,that of freedom of speech.especially when the speech concerns current affairs or other public issues,courts must take notice.see snyder phelps,d.the framers believed that public discussion is a political duty.whitney,at brandeis,concurring.civic health requires that americans not be fearful of their freedoms,whether in public or private venues,and especially a freedom so precious as the exercise of speech.the majority unfortunately takes less than token recognition of this value.it does not herald for future courts the dangers of taking the american workplace down a more autocratic path.
the objects of civil rights laws are to eliminate discrimination,bring americans together,and break down barriers.this purpose remains crucial,as congress has repeatedly attested.and yet our schools are resegregating.our neighborhoods in all too many instances are very far apart.the workplace may be where racial interactions are most frequent,and it will be sad if law pushes this last remaining venue into the more separatist habits that elsewhere too frequently prevail.
title vii guards against this.title vii will be counterproductive,however,if it countenances workplaces on employee surveillance and reportage.such a system erects barriers rather than dismantles them.in an ideal world,the races and sexes would interact spontaneously,in natural and creative ways.there would be no single correct way to behave around,no single correct thing to say to,a worker of another race or gender.we are people human beings with commonalities far more profound than superficial differences.
the majority surely agrees.yet by focusing on sick bigots who belittle racial minorities,op.at quoting jordan alt.res,cir king,dissenting,the majority sells the more generous potential of most americans short.
title vii must not contribute an added element of inhibition when we communicate with those of another sex or race.and yet i fear that is precisely what will happen if the objectively reasonable standard is diluted in favor of retaliation protection for any report,however marginal,trivial,or unsubstantiated.the supreme court has made clear that title vii prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace.oncale,at.but where every ambiguous or unintentionally insensitive remark is going to be reported upstairs,employees naturally will seek to cluster with those who look,act,and think like themselves.instead of an interactive community in which individual attributes can be recognized,understood,celebrated,and embraced,the result will be a more fractious and working environment where noxious stereotypes persist.keeping interracial distance and maintaining interracial silence will become the safest course,the easiest way to avoid a blot on one record that comes even with a erroneous report.this road is in no one interest,certainly not ours as a nation or as individuals in the simple search for friends.we must not become others to ourselves.
the search for balance is important in law,lest the aims of one of america greatest acts be compromised by a needlessly censored and suspicious workplace.i believe the majority is right in allowing plaintiff retaliation claim to proceed,but wrong in not affirming the district court on the merits of the title vii claim.more than that,i regret that my friends in the majority did not do more to recognize that this is an equation with two sides,an area with more than one dimension.the harmony of balance is nowhere to be found.
the majority holds that an employee use of the term porch monkey twice in a hour period,when talking to a fellow employee about a single workplace incident,transformed the workplace into a racially hostile environment and thereby effected a discriminatory change in the terms and conditions of the offended employee employment,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,to.it holds further that the offended employee could therefore have had a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was in progress,ante,at emphasis added,such that her opposition to the incident justified her retaliation claim against her employer.it reaches these unprecedented conclusions by relying on selected and distilled snippets from faragher city of boca raton,d,which,according to the majority,justify the conclusion that an isolated incident of harassment can amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment,if that incident is extremely serious,ante,at quoting faragher,at.
faragher,however,does not support the majority reading of it,and the majority conclusions are otherwise without precedent.first,in the very quotation relied on by the majority,the faragher court noted that isolated incidents using the plural might,if extremely serious,satisfy the severity requirement for racial harassment.at.to rationalize its holding,the majority thus reads the plural incidents in faragher to refer only to a single incident.
second,and more importantly,the majority fails to note that the portions of faragher to which it cites were part of the supreme court much lengthier discussion and substantively different message describing the type of conduct that would not violate title vii.in that discussion,the court drew on several opinions from the courts of appeals and noted,for instance,that the mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not sufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to violate title vii.faragher,at emphasis added quoting rogers eeoc,cir see also meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,same.the court also cited approvingly to a text on discrimination law which observed,in part,that a lack of racial sensitivity does not,alone,amount to actionable harassment.id.quoting barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law ed.finally,the court summarized some of its earlier rulings in the very paragraph relied on by the majority 
so,in harris forklift systems,d,we explained that in order to be actionable under the statute,a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive,one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive,and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.we directed courts to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by looking at all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.most recently,we explained that title vii does not prohibit genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex.a recurring point in these opinions is that simple teasing,comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.
id.at emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
without the abridged faragher snippets,which fail to capture that case larger message,the majority is left with virtually no support for its holdings and certainly none from the language of title vii or any supreme court decision construing it.indeed,the supreme court has steadfastly maintained that,to be actionable under title vii,conduct must be so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.meritor,at alteration in original quoting henson city of dundee,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and because hostile work environment claims by their very nature involve repeated conduct,the court has further the majority acknowledges,see ante,at that a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.passenger morgan,d.instead,such claims must be based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.id.
to be absolutely clear,this case does not present the question of whether an employee should be allowed to call a fellow employee a porch monkey.such a racially derogatory and highly offensive term does not belong in the workplace,and i condemn it.nor does this case present the question of whether an employee,justifiably offended by being called a porch monkey,should report such an incident to management.rather,the issues here are substantially narrower.
framed by principles of law,the first question in this case is whether a reasonable jury could find that an employee use of the term porch monkey twice in a hour period,when talking to a fellow employee about a single incident,could objectively be considered so severe as to transform the workplace into a racially hostile environment,thereby effecting a discriminatory change in the terms and conditions of her employment.and if we were to conclude that a reasonable jury would be unable to make such a finding on the summary judgment record in this case,then the next question would be whether a reasonable jury could find that the offended employee engaged in protected activity when she reported the conduct because she reasonably believed that her employer had committed or was in the process of committing an employment practice that was made unlawful by title vii.see a.
i respectfully submit that the pertinent law,when applied to the facts in the record,requires a negative response to both questions.i would therefore affirm the district court similar conclusions.
reya boyer liberto,an african american woman,began working at the clarion resort fontainebleau hotel the clarion in ocean city,maryland,on august.the clarion is a typical oceanfront hotel,with several restaurants,bars,a nightclub,and banquet facilities,and it typically employs about people in its food and beverage department.liberto started as a morning hostess in the hotel main restaurant,but she proceeded to work in many of the hotel other food and beverage positions,including serving,bartending,and working banquets.according to leonard berger,the clarion owner,liberto struggled in all of the positions to which she was assigned,and he terminated her employment on september,because she had failed at four jobs and t here were no more places for her.
during her employment,liberto interacted with trudi clubb,a white woman,who was a longtime employee at the clarion and a friend of berger.clubb worked as an evening restaurant manager,and she described her responsibilities in that role as getting things going for the early part of the day,seeing that the crew is and ready to present themselves to the customers,getting the tables ready,getting the buffet ready,overseeing all the items that need to be done,and generally helping out as needed.clubb directly reported to richard heubeck,the clarion food and beverage director,as well as mark elman,the hotel general manager.clubb did not participate in hiring decisions,and there is no indication in the record that she was authorized to fire,demote,or otherwise take tangible employment actions against other members of the clarion staff.
in any event,whatever the exact nature of clubb role at the clarion,liberto testified during her deposition that she never understood clubb to be a supervisor or even a manager.to be sure,liberto believed that clubb,who had worked at the clarion for close to years and had a longstanding relationship with berger,had power that she,a employee,did not have.but liberto stated that she reported to heubeck and to a manager named jamie avery,and she was adamant that she never thought of clubb as her manager.instead,her understanding of clubb was that she was basically a friend of berger that was there to greet people and just to be a smiling face in other words,that clubb was merely a glorified hostess.indeed,liberto stated that she was told by everyone that she should just humor clubb and that avery specifically told her not to go to clubb because clubb did not have the power to do voids or make decisions.she explained that,although she listened to clubb,she did so only to the extent that she had to be respectful and listen to everyone she work ed with.and while clubb would occasionally ask liberto or other employees to do tasks,liberto testified that it was not a regular routine for clubb to instruct other employees and that clubb did not correct her work.
liberto testified that,soon after she had started working at the clarion,she felt as though clubb had singled her out and had threatened to take advantage of her personal relationship with berger to make trouble for liberto.but the incident central to this action occurred more than a month after liberto had been hired.
late on the night of september,liberto was serving drinks when a customer ordered a hula hula,a cocktail that was particularly to make.when the bartender at the restaurant primary bar refused to make the drink,liberto walked around to the clarion pub bar to order the drink there.once the drink was ready,liberto passed through the kitchen on her way back to the dining room,even though that was a much longer route,so as to avoid the primary bartender who refused to make the hula hula.as she did so,clubb yelled out to liberto that she was not supposed to cut through the kitchen,but liberto did not hear clubb.clubb then approached liberto as she was preparing the customer check,yelling at liberto for ignoring her and calling liberto deaf.liberto said that the distance between the two was close enough that she could feel clubb breath and that spittle from clubb mouth was hitting her.liberto shook her head and said okay,but largely went about her work,which made clubb more agitated.as the episode concluded and clubb was walking away,clubb said that she was going to make liberto sorry and called liberto either a damn or dang,porch monkey.
at the beginning of her shift on september,liberto went to heubeck office to complain about clubb conduct.during the meeting,clubb came in and said to liberto,i need to speak to you,little girl.liberto told clubb that she was currently speaking with heubeck,but clubb responded that she was more important.liberto and clubb then sat down at a table outside heubeck office,and clubb scolded liberto for abandoning her station the previous night.as this meeting broke up,clubb said that she was going to go to berger and teach liberto a lesson.using a raised voice,clubb again called liberto a porch monkey.
a couple of days later,on september,liberto spoke by telephone with nancy berghauer,the clarion human resources director,regarding clubb.berghauer made typewritten notes of the conversation and forwarded them to berger and elman.the next day,september,elman met with liberto to discuss the situation and to ensure that berghauer notes were accurate.that same day,heubeck met with clubb to discuss the incident,and clubb denied liberto allegations.heubeck nonetheless issued clubb a written warning.
when,on september,berger learned about the conflict between clubb and liberto,he asked heubeck to update him on exactly what was going on,and he also asked about liberto job performance.heubeck reported that liberto had so far performed poorly in every job to which she had been assigned.the next afternoon,berger met with elman to review liberto work file and discovered that liberto had failed the clarion bartending test miserably.when berger indicated that he thought the clarion should terminate liberto employment,elman and berghauer indicated that doing so could create a situation because of liberto complaint.berger replied that there not going to be any good time to let her go.the situation will be there.after further consulting heubeck,berger made the final decision to terminate liberto employment,and liberto was notified of the decision on september.clubb was not involved in the decision,only learning of it a week later.berger acknowledged in his deposition that liberto complaint prompted him to take a look at her record,but he asserted that his decision to fire her had nothing to do with her complaint and was instead based solely on her poor performance.
liberto filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on september,alleging discrimination based on her race and retaliation based on her engagement in protected activity,in violation of title vii.the eeoc issued liberto a notice of right to sue,following which liberto commenced this action.
in her complaint,liberto asserted four claims for relief two counts of racial discrimination by virtue of a hostile work environment,in violation of title vii count i and count iii,and two counts of retaliation,also in violation of title vii count ii and count iv.liberto filed her title vii claims against only the fontainebleau corporation,trading as the clarion resort fontainebleau hotel,but named both the fontainebleau corporation and berger as defendants in her claims.
following discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.taking liberto deposition testimony as true,the district court held that the offensive conduct was too isolated to support liberto claims for discrimination and retaliation.accordingly,by order dated april,the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.this appeal followed.
in holding that the district court erred by entering summary judgment for the defendants on liberto hostile work environment claims,the majority extends title vii liability beyond the statute textual scope and beyond what the supreme court has recognized in construing the statute.
the governing principles are well established.title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.this provision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to employment decisions that have direct economic consequences,such as termination,demotion,and pay cuts.vance ball state,d.since,however,the supreme court has recognized that this provision not only covers terms and conditions in the narrow contractual sense,oncale sundowner offshore servs,d,but also forbids the practice of creating a working environment heavily charged with discrimination,meritor,at quoting rogers,at see also harris,at the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment in employment,which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment citation and some internal quotation marks omitted.but in order to ensure that a cause of action based on an alleged hostile work environment is justified by the statute text,the supreme court has emphasized time and time again that the underlying harassment must be so severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment.faragher,at alteration in original emphasis added quoting meritor,at see also,vance.at in hostile work environment cases,we have held,the plaintiff must show that the work environment was so pervaded by discrimination that the terms and conditions of employment were altered burlington,ellerth,d recognizing that only harassing conduct that is severe or pervasive can effect a constructive alteration in the terms or conditions of employment and thus become cognizable under title vii oncale,at emphasizing that title vii prohibition of harassment forbids only behavior so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the victim employment harris,at when the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this demanding standard thus requires more than conduct that is merely offensive.harris,at see also oncale,at noting that title vii will not become a general civility code for the american workplace so long as courts pay careful attention to the requirements of the statute.indeed,the supreme court has specifically recognized that the mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not affect the conditions of employment to a sufficiently significant degree to violate title vii.meritor,at emphasis added quoting rogers,at see also harris,at.similarly,the court has stressed that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.faragher,at citation and some internal quotation marks omitted.it should thus come as no surprise that the court has described the very nature of a hostile work environment claim as involv ing repeated conduct.morgan,at see also id.the unlawful employment practice at issue in a hostile work environment claim can not be said to occur on any particular day.it occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and,in direct contrast to discrete acts,a single act of harassment may not be actionable on its own.such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts.citation omitted.
finally,the court has emphasized that the impact of offensive workplace conduct on an employee work environment can not be measured in isolation.clark cnty.sch.dist.breeden,d per curiam.instead,courts must determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive to support a claim by looking at all the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.faragher,at quoting harris,at.
under these controlling principles,clubb alleged use of the term porch monkey twice in less than hours when talking about a single incident was,as a matter of law,not so severe or pervasive as to produce a racially hostile work environment that changed the terms and conditions of liberto employment.
there is no suggestion by the majority that the alleged harassment was sufficiently pervasive to qualify nor could there be.as such,this case falls outside the heartland of hostile work environment claims,the very nature of which involves repeated conduct.morgan,at.instead,the only question at this juncture is whether a jury that believed liberto description of events could find that clubb conduct was so severe that it altered the terms and conditions of liberto employment by creating a work atmosphere that was objectively racially hostile.the answer is plainly no.to be sure,the term porch monkey is an odious racial epithet,and any reasonable person in liberto position would of course be offended by its use.but the mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet,which offends an employee,does not affect the conditions of employment to a sufficiently significant degree to violate title vii.meritor,at quoting rogers,at see also harris,at.in short,liberto has not presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,at citation omitted quoting meritor,at.
the majority conclusion to the contrary rests on two distortions,one factual and one legal.first,the majority brazenly distorts the facts contained in the summary judgment record regarding liberto understanding of clubb role at the clarion.the majority begins by stating that the current record does not establish whether clubb was actually liberto supervisor or simply her.ante,at emphasis added.but nonetheless it then proceeds to deem clubb to have been liberto supervisor for the purpose of gauging the severity of clubb conduct,ante,at,on the theory that clubb portrayed herself as having the ability to get liberto fired by taking advantage of her friendship with berger.from this,the majority goes yet further and presumes that liberto must have believed that clubb was effectively her supervisor,thus lending a particularly threatening character to clubb conduct.ante,at quoting ellerth,at internal quotation marks omitted.
there are,however,two significant problems with the majority approach.first,it is highly doubtful that clubb,who may have wielded influence on the clarion owner as a result of a personal relationship but who lacked direct authority to take tangible employment actions or even to recommend formally that such actions be taken,would qualify as liberto supervisor.indeed,the supreme court recently clarified what makes an employee a supervisor in the context of hostile work environment claims,holding that the critical consideration is whether he or she is empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim.vance.at emphasis added.in so holding,the court explained that this definition would typically allow an employee supervisory status to be readily determined,generally by written documentation.id.at see also id.at the interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we adopt today is one that can be readily applied.the court indicated that employees can still qualify as supervisors even if their decisions are subject to approval by higher management.id.at.it similarly noted that if the individuals vested with decisionmaking power have a limited ability to exercise independent discretion when making decisions and must instead rely on the recommendations of other workers who actually interact with the affected employee then the employer may be held to have effectively delegated the power to take tangible employment actions to the employees on whose recommendations the individual formally vested with decisionmaking authority relies.id.at.but both of those situations are a far cry from an employee whose only influence comes from having the ear of the company owner because of their personal friendship.
moreover,even setting that issue aside,the majority assumption that liberto must have perceived clubb as her supervisor flies in the face of liberto own deposition testimony about her understanding of clubb place in the clarion hierarchy.when asked about her understanding of clubb role,liberto responded,my understanding of trud i clubb was that she was basically a friend of berger that was there to greet people and just to be a smiling face.she added,i was told by everyone,oh,just,you know,humor clubb t hat pretty much what everyone would say about her.when pressed,she was adamant that she did not understand clubb to be a manager 
is it true that you were told that clubb was the restaurant manager 
is it your is it your testimony that you did not know trud i clubb was the restaurant manager 
absolutely that is my testimony.
q.you never knew throughout your entire employment with the clarion that she was a manager 
never.i reported to jamie avery,and jamie,as a matter of fact,told me not to go to clubb because clubb did not have the power to do voids or make decisions.i had to report to jamie or richard heubeck.and at the time clubb did not hold any management cards or keys as jamie did.
emphasis added.and when asked whether she thought she had to listen to clubb,liberto response was just that she ha d to be respectful and listen to everyone she work ed with.
the majority conclusion that we should deem clubb to have been liberto supervisor for the purpose of gauging the severity of clubb conduct simply can not be reconciled with this testimony.to the contrary,liberto understanding of clubb as a glorified hostess who everyone humor ed substantially lessens the impact that clubb isolated statements could have had on liberto work environment.see ante,at a supervisor use of a racial epithet impacts the work environment far more severely than use by second alteration in original quoting rodgers.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition to relying on a blatant mischaracterization of liberto understanding of clubb role at the clarion,the majority conclusion that liberto hostile work environment claims should reach a jury also rests on a faulty interpretation of a handful of words from the supreme court.specifically,the majority places a great deal of emphasis on the court observation in faragher that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.at emphasis added citation and some internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the majority holding,distilled to its essence,rests entirely on its conclusion that this is the type of case contemplated in faragher where the harassment,though perhaps isolated,can properly be deemed to be extremely serious.ante,at.
but in faragher,the supreme court referred to incidents,at,not to a single incident.and five years later,the court in morgan confirmed that repeated conduct is the stuff of a hostile work environment.at emphasis added.moreover,while the faragher court did not elaborate on what it envisioned as the kind of extremely serious isolated incidents that may produce a hostile work environment,we know from meritor and harris that such incidents can not be the mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet.meritor,at quoting rogers,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the court has made clear,the making of such a statement in the workplace,although highly offensive,does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate title vii.harris,at.it is true that clubb alleged conduct was reprehensible.but it involved no physical assault or threat of physical harm.lex larson,employment discrimination b,at ed noting that a single incident of physical assault against a that is motivated by discriminatory animus can qualify as severe enough to constitute an alteration of the conditions of employment.moreover,even though the first encounter took place in a crowded dining room,it appears that no one heard clubb direct the epithet at liberto on either occasion,indicating that the was not publicly humiliating.and again,liberto thought that she was being upbraided by a,not her supervisor.taken together,these considerations show that,as a matter of law,clubb alleged conduct did not amount to the extremely serious isolated incidents that the faragher court envisioned as being capable of effecting a discriminatory change in the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.at.
the majority acknowledges that this case marks the first time that our court has concluded that a reasonable jury could find the presence of a hostile work environment based on what was,at most,two repeated statements relating to a single incident.see ante,at.what the majority does not acknowledge,however,is that today decision makes our court an outlier among the other courts of appeals.and instead of being straightforward about that fact,the majority attempts to bolster its conclusion with citations to the eleventh circuit decision in adams austal,cir,and the circuit decision in ayissi etoh fannie mae.see ante,at.but both cases involved conduct more pervasive more severe than that alleged by liberto here.
in adams,one of the plaintiffs alleged that his supervisor carved the slur porch monkeys into the aluminum of the ship on which they were working,and the eleventh circuit observed that that isolated act was severe.at.but the same plaintiff also alleged that he saw one coworker wear a shirt with a confederate flag that he regularly saw racist graffiti in the men restroom and that when he reported the racist graffiti,his supervisor responded by saying that it always been like that and if he did like it he could quit.id.at alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.it was based on the totality of these allegations that the eleventh circuit concluded that the harassment the plaintiff experienced was frequent and severe,such that a reasonable jury could find that his work environment was objectively hostile.id.at emphasis added.
similarly,the harassment in ayissi etoh was both more pervasive and more severe than the harassment at issue here.in that case,the plaintiff an african american senior financial modeler asked his company chief audit executive why he had not received a raise in conjunction with a recent promotion.at.in response,the executive told him,for a young black man smart like you,we are happy to have your expertise i think i already paying you a lot of money.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.several months later,the plaintiff was discussing his work responsibilities with the company vice president of internal audit when the meeting became heated and the vice president yelled at him,get out of my office nigger.id.although the plaintiff missed work and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder,he was forced to continue working with the vice president during the ensuing investigation.id.based on this evidence,the circuit held that the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial on his hostile work environment claim.these circumstances in ayissi etoh are readily distinguishable from those presented here.first,as the court in ayissi etoh noted,the hostile work environment was precipitated not by a single event,but rather by two independent statements made by two different company officials who were both indisputably supervisors of the plaintiff.id.at.those statements ultimately led to psychological problems and directly caused the plaintiff to miss work.id.at.second,the racist comments were made during conversations about the plaintiff pay and work assignments,thus increasing the statements ability to alter the conditions of the victim employment.harris,at.by contrast,in the case at hand,there was only one incident involving one alleged harasser the alleged harasser was perceived by the plaintiff to be a glorified hostess with no power to make decisions and although the alleged harasser denied making the offensive statement,the employer promptly issued her a written reprimand,warning her to be cautious that the language or phrases that she uses can not sic be perceived as racist or derogatory.
for the reasons given,clubb alleged use of the term porch monkey twice in less than hours when talking about a single incident was not,as a matter of law,sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a racially hostile work environment that altered the terms and conditions of liberto employment.i would therefore affirm the district court summary judgment on liberto title vii hostile work environment claim.
for the same reasons,i would also affirm the district court summary judgment on liberto hostile work environment claim under.see spriggs diamond auto glass,cir recognizing that hostile work environment claims under title vii and are governed by the same principles.
if,as the majority holds,clubb twice calling liberto a porch monkey in connection with a single workplace incident was a practice made unlawful by title vii,it would necessarily follow that liberto also stated a retaliation claim,for such a claim arises when an employee opposes any practice made an unlawful practice by title vii and therefore is subjected to an adverse employment action.see ante,at.the majority could have ended its retaliation claim analysis without saying more.but it did not.instead,it gratuitously proceeded to adopt an unprecedented standard for retaliation claims that is much broader than necessary to resolve liberto claim.in doing so,it also unnecessarily overruled part of our decision in jordan alternative resources,cir.
as to its new,broad standard for retaliation claims,the majority moves far beyond the scope of any statutory language or any supreme court precedent to conclude that,even when an employee opposes a single offensive incident,she has a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment is occurring whenever the incident is humiliating.ante,at see also ante,at.applying that standard,the majority concludes that because porch monkey is a racial epithet that is not just humiliating,but degrading and humiliating in the extreme,liberto was necessarily opposing a hostile work environment that was in progress when she brought the racial slurs to management attention.ante,at quoting spriggs,at.undoubtedly,this gratuitous and untenable holding will generate widespread litigation over the many offensive workplace comments made everyday that employees find to be humiliating.
turning to the statute,as we must,title vii antiretaliation provision makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because the employee has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.a.read most naturally,this provision provides protection from retaliation to an employee who has opposed an employment practice that is actually unlawful under title vii,including her employer maintenance of a racially hostile work environment.and reading a language generously to give effect to its purpose,we have held that an employee also engages in protected activity when she opposes an employment practice that she reasonably believes to be unlawful,see eeoc navy fed.credit union,cir,although the supreme court has not yet gone so far.specifically,in breeden,at,the court declined to rule on the propriety of the ninth circuit interpretation of a as protect ing employee oppos ition not just to practices that are actually made unlawful by title vii,but also to practices that the employee could reasonably believe were unlawful,because even assuming that its interpretation is correct,no one could reasonably believe that the incident at issue violated title vii.finally,we have gone one step further,recognizing that an employee is protected from retaliation if,at the time of her complaint,she had an objectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances that a title vii violation has happened or is in progress.jordan,at emphasis added.
under the jordan standard,when an employee complaint relates to another employee harassing conduct,we do not require the harassment to have already risen to the level actionable under title vii in order for her opposition activity to be protected from retaliation.but when the offending conduct has not risen to the level of a practice made unlawful by title vii,we also recognized that it would be inappropriate to simply assume,without more,that the opposed conduct would continue or would be repeated unabated.jordan,at.instead,we held that in this incipient stage,a plaintiff must be able to point to evidence that reasonably supports the inference that the conduct being objected to was likely to recur at a level sufficient to create a hostile work environment.id.in other words,for an employee report of objectionable conduct that has not yet become unlawful under title vii to qualify as protected activity,the employee must,at the very least,have an objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment would result,based on circumstances that the employee observes and reasonably believes.id.
here,the majority adopts a standard far beyond that which we recognized in jordan and far beyond what any court of appeals has recognized.it holds that an employee single complaint about a single incident,regardless of whether the incident is actually unlawful under title vii or whether the employee reasonably believes that the incident is likely to recur,can be the basis for a legitimate retaliation claim,so long as the conduct is humiliating.see ante,at.this new standard will surely generate many new questions about which offensive workplace comments are objectively humiliating and lead to an expansion of litigation far beyond title vii design.
i would conclude in this case that the district court correctly entered summary judgment for the defendants on liberto retaliation claim because,as a matter of law,she did not oppose activity that title vii protects from retaliation when she reported clubb conduct to the clarion human resources director.in light of all the circumstances,clubb use of an offensive racial epithet twice in less than hours was insufficiently severe to give liberto an objectively reasonable belief that she was complaining about the presence of a racially hostile work environment,rather than simply about another employee inappropriate conduct.certainly,liberto could have reasonably concluded from clubb demeaning statement that clubb herself was a racist.but the fact that a single employee has revealed herself through an isolated incident to be bigoted does not translate into an objectively reasonable belief that the workplace itself has become abusive to employees because of their race.butler.dep t of,cir n ot every act by an employee in opposition to racial discrimination is protected.the opposition must be directed at an unlawful employment practice of an employer,not an act of discrimination by a private individual emphasis added quoting little united,carrier transicold,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,clubb statements were,as a matter of law,too isolated to give liberto an objectively reasonable belief that the offensive conduct was likely to ripen into a hostile work environment.liberto has not identified any evidence in the record suggesting that workplace racism was afoot prior to clubb statements,nor any evidence suggesting that she had reason to believe that her supervisors and would tolerate such conduct or permit it to recur.indeed,after liberto reported the incident,the clarion management promptly issued a written reprimand to clubb,warning her to be cautious about her language.
while liberto had every right to be offended by clubb use of a racial epithet and acted reasonably and responsibly in reporting the incident to clarion human resources director,she lacked a reasonable belief,as required by the language of title vii,that she was opposing her employer commission of a practice made unlawful by title vii.a.for that reason,i would conclude,as a matter of law,that she did not engage in protected activity and that the district court therefore properly entered summary judgment against her on her retaliation claims.
in addition to adopting a broad and unprecedented standard for evaluating retaliation claims under title vii,the majority also gratuitously reverses a portion of jordan in a manner by which judge king,the majority author,explicitly vindicates his dissent in jordan,notwithstanding his concession that this case presents distinguishing circumstances.
notably,the majority does not overturn all of jordan.it in no way suggests,for example,that the isolated incident at issue in that case was sufficiently severe to create a hostile work environment.indeed,by oberserv ing that the district court improperly analogized this matter to jordan,the majority instead confirms that a racist remark that was made by a mere and not aimed at the plaintiff or any other employee does not amount to a hostile work environment.ante,at.nor does the majority indicate that the plaintiff in jordan had a reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was taking shape at the time he reported his racist comment to his supervisors.rather,the only portion of jordan that the majority overrules is its already liberalizing rule that a plaintiff whose retaliation claim is based on an objectively reasonable belief that a hostile work environment was in progress,but not yet in existence,need only point to some evidence indicating that such an environment was likely to occur.jordan,at see ante,at.
the majority claims that this aspect
