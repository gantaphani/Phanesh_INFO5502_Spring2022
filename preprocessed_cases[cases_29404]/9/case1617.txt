opinion of the court 
this case requires us to define substantial burden under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,et seq,to determine whether the pennsylvania department of corrections doc restriction on inmates that they possess in their cells only ten books at a time substantially burdens inmate henry unseld washington religious exercise.we hold that it does.because the doc is unable to show that its policy is the least restrictive means to further its compelling governmental interest in the safety and health of prisoners and prison employees,we will reverse the district court order dismissing washington rluipa claim and remand with instructions to consider whether any factual issues remain when that claim is evaluated under the proper legal standard.
henry unseld washington is an inmate in the custody of the pennsylvania doc who has attempted to practice his religion while incarcerated.washington founded and has been a practitioner of the children of the sun church for over two decades.according to washington,the children of the sun church supports the development of whereby adherents to the religion stress that only through can afrikan people worldwide,be able to change the conditions of afrikan people in the diaspora and the motherland.to this end,washington church states that f or every afrikan eyes you open with his teachings you will gain rewards in the life everafter.one of the rituals requires a practitioner to read four different books per day this ritual is aimed at educating the adherent to doctrine,so that he is able to teach others more effectively.washington views this ritual as necessary to his church proselytization requirement,so that the books are in essence the religion itself.
the pennsylvania doc limits the amount of property any inmate may store in his cell.the doc policy states that limitations on the amount and variety of inmate property may be imposed for security,hygiene safety reasons.with respect to publications,each inmate is permitted to retain three newspapers,ten magazines,and ten books,unless additional books are approved by the facility education department.this provision applies to every prison in the pennsylvania doc the doc also permits storage space equal to four records center boxes.this space may be made up of the four records center boxes or one footlocker and two records center boxes.in cells that have either a or a free standing storage cabinet,the inmate is permitted to use that space and either two records center boxes or one footlocker.
the conflict in this case arises from the clash between washington interest in practicing what he claims is his religion and the prison interest in limiting,for security,hygiene,and safety reasons,the amount of inmate property that may be held in a cell.in july,washington was transferred from the state correctional institution sci at mahanoy to.in february,washington books,religious literature,and legal materials arrived at in thirteen boxes.in december,authorities at informed washington that he was in possession of property in his cell that exceeded the amount of property permitted.the excess property was removed from washington cell,although authorities permitted washington to choose which ten books to keep in his cell.authorities gave washington the option of mailing the books out of the prison or having the books destroyed by the doc because of a lack of adequate storage space for excess inmate property.the superintendent of wrote to washington personally,stating that washington could also donate the books to the prison library so he could still access them on an basis.the prison,though,had a policy limiting the number of trips an inmate could take to the library to one per week.library policy allowed inmates to check out four books per visit did not destroy the property,and shipped it to when washington was transferred there in december.
washington,proceeding pro se,sued several employees of pennsylvania doc pursuant to and the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of,or rluipa in december.his suit alleged that the policy violated his first amendment rights and the terms of rluipa.the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief and found that,because washington books had been mailed to his mother,they were not in danger of being destroyed.the district court subsequently granted the defendants motion to dismiss on all counts in may.the district court dismissed washington rluipa claim because he had not shown that is an institution receiving federal funds a prerequisite for a rluipa claim.in april,however,this court reversed and remanded the case with respect to the rluipa claim because washington could easily show that receives federal funds.see washington klem,precedential.in the same opinion,we affirmed the district court dismissal of all claims,and expressed no opinion as to the merits of the rluipa claim.on remand,in december the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and denied washington motion for summary judgment.the district court based its dismissal of washington rluipa claim on several factors.the district court found that the pennsylvania doc receives federal funds.it also found that washington beliefs are sincerely held,and noted that this point was not contested by the pennsylvania doc.however,the district court concluded that the doc policy did not impose a substantial burden on washington religious practice,the policy furthered a compelling governmental interest,and the policy used the least restrictive means to further this interest.this timely appeal followed 
a.a general note about rluipa 
congress passed rluipa to grant heightened protection to prisoners from burdens imposed by the government.rluipa also contains a provision not applicable in this case.the history of this law traces back to the supreme court decision in employment,of human resources of smith,d.the supreme court in smith held that the free exercise clause of the first amendment does not impede the enforcement of neutral and otherwise valid laws of general applicability that incidentally burden religious conduct.id.at.the court did state that the political branches could grant a higher degree of protection for religious exercise through legislative accommodation.id.at.taking the cue from smith,congress passed the religious freedom restoration act of rfra,stat,et.rfra prohibited the government from substantially burdening a person exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government could demonstrate that the application of the burden was in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and was the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.as applied to the states,rfra was struck down by the supreme court because it exceeded congress remedial powers under the fourteenth amendment.city of boerne flores,d.the dialogue between congress and the supreme court continued when congress enacted rluipa.the key difference between rfra and rluipa is that rluipa invokes its power to regulate under the spending and commerce clauses,and protects only regulation and prisoners.see cutter wilkinson,d.
rluipa also does not confer any privileged status on any particular religious sect,and singles out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment.id.at.in addition to not differentiating between bona fide faiths,rluipa does not permit a court to determine whether the belief or practice in question is compelled by,or central to,a system of religious belief.a cutter,at.navajo nation forest,cir.rluipa does permit inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner religious beliefs.cutter,at.
strict scrutiny under rluipa 
section of rluipa states that n o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government demonstrates that the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.a.if the plaintiff produces prima facie evidence to support a claim alleging a rluipa violation the government shall bear the burden of persuasion on any element of the claim,except that the plaintiff shall bear the burden of persuasion on whether the challenged practice or law substantially burdens the plaintiff exercise of religion.id.b.for the purposes of rluipa,government includes any official of a state,county,municipality,or other governmental entity created under the authority of a state,as well as any other person acting under color of state law.id.a.
substantial burden 
a bears the burden to show that a prison institution policy or official practice has substantially burdened the practice of that inmate religion.both the text of the statute and the legislative history provide support for how the statute should be interpreted with respect to what qualifies as a substantial burden.legislative history on this point has been cited by the supreme court approvingly in cutter.despite the limitations inherent in most legislative history as a tool for use in statutory interpretation,here that history as been cited by the supreme court approvingly in cutter.exxon mobil allapattah,d describing some of the criticisms of legislative history to interpret the meaning of a statute.
senators hatch and kennedy,two principal sponsors of rluipa,discussed the statute in a joint statement that appeared in the congressional record.the joint statement section on the definition of substantial burden states that 
t he act does not include a definition of the term substantial burden because it is not the intent of this act to create a new standard for the definition of substantial burden on religious exercise.instead,that term as used in the act should be interpreted by reference to supreme court jurisprudence.nothing in the act,including the requirement in section g that its terms be broadly construed,is intended to change that principle.the term substantial burden as used in this act is not intended to be given any broader interpretation than the supreme court articulation of the concept of substantial burden or religious exercise.
cong.rec,july,emphasis added.section of rluipa provides the act rules of construction.section g states that t his act shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise,to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this act and the constitution.g.the legislative history and the act rules of construction illustrate that substantial burden should be interpreted broadly,but in line with prior supreme court precedent.the supreme court has defined substantial burden in the free exercise clause context,and several courts of appeals have looked to this line of cases to interpret what the phrase means for rluipa purposes.see,lovelace lee,cir warsoldier woodford,cir adkins kaspar,cir.
this clear methodology runs into trouble,however,because supreme court precedent with respect to the definition of substantial burden in the free exercise clause context has not always been consistent.see,midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir discussing the various standards.further,transferring these definitions,which often arise in the denial of unemployment benefits,to a prison setting has not always been seamless because of the different factual scenarios presented by the institutional milieu.nonetheless,the supreme court has stated in its free exercise clause jurisprudence that a substantial burden exists when a follower is forced to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits,on the one hand,and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work,on the other hand.sherbert verner,d.in sherbert,the court addressed whether a seventh day adventist who was religiously precluded from working on saturdays could be denied unemployment compensation because she could not find work that would permit her to observe this precept of her religion.the court concluded that the government could not deny unemployment benefits,as such a practice essentially forced sherbert to choose between her religion and government benefits provided to others who do not have a similar religious belief.in a footnote,however,the supreme court seemed to imply that a substantial burden exists whenever a government action has the tendency to inhibit constitutionally protected activity.id.at.
the court in a later case purportedly followed sherbert,but restated the substantial burden definition.thomas review bd.of indiana employment security,d.the court stated 
where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith,or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief,thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,a burden upon religion exists.while the compulsion may be indirect,the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.
id.see also hobbie unemployment appeals comm of florida,d quoting thomas.the current status of this test is not entirely clear because of a later supreme court decision that contains some language which may be read to lower the hurdle for showing a substantial burden.see lyng northwest indian cemetery protective ass n,d.
in lyng,the supreme court found no substantial burden where the federal government planned to harvest timber and build a highway through part of a national forest used for religious purposes by members of three native american religions.the members claimed that the noise and pollution from the highway would diminish the sacredness of the area and interfere with the religious experience of the members using the area.id.at.the court rejected the position that incidental effects of government programs,which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs,require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions.id.at.the court made this statement in the context of rejecting the plaintiffs reading of,inter alia,sherbert and thomas.see adkins,at.the court did not declare that it was altering the holdings of sherbert or thomas.nor did the court hold that its conclusion must be read to mean that any incidental effect of a government program which may have some tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs satisfies the substantial burden standard.
the courts of appeals to have addressed the definition of substantial burden under rluipa have defined it in several ways.most of those courts have adopted some form of the formulation,but have often reworded their holdings.the result of this practice has been to create several definitions of substantial burden with minor variations whether or not these semantic differences in definition result in any meaningful differences in application is,for the most part,an open question in an effort to harmonize the substantial burden jurisprudence,we adopt a disjunctive test that couples the holdings of sherbert and thomas.for the purposes of rluipa,a substantial burden exists where a follower is forced to choose between following the precepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits otherwise generally available to other inmates versus abandoning one of the precepts of his religion in order to receive a benefit or the government puts substantial pressure on an adherent to substantially modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs 
this definition accords with g of rluipa and the statute legislative history in that it recognizes that congress intended to create a broad definition of substantial burden.we recognize that this definition is narrower than the dictum in footnote six of sherbert and the negative implication of lyng,but is still broad enough to accurately reflect the statute plain text and to effect its purpose.using an expansive definition of substantial burden derived from language not essential to the holdings of either sherbert or lyng poses at least two problems.first,the supreme court has not squarely adopted its dictum in footnote six of sherbert as a holding in a free exercise or rluipa case.second,there is reason to question whether lyng can be read to hold that any incidental effect of a government program which may have some tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs satisfies the substantial burden standard.such a reading fails to take into account that the discussion of substantial burden in lyng occurred while the court approvingly discussed sherbert and thomas.the any incidental tendency standard would also conflict with other statements in lyng where the court decided whether the government actions constituted a substantial burden.see lyng,at.no substantial burden even though we can assume that the threat to the efficacy of at least some religious practices is extremely grave id.at.however much we might wish that it were otherwise,government simply could not operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen religious needs and desires.
in interpreting the definition of substantial burden,we must keep in mind the plain text of the statute.adopting the negative implication of the supreme court holding in lyng would read substantial out of the statute.see civil liberties for urban believers,at stating,in the land use context,that a pplication of the substantial burden provision to a regulation inhibiting or constraining any religious exercise would render meaningless the word substantial.the straightforward test we adopt today,derived directly from supreme court precedent,respects the text and purpose of rluipa while seeking to clarify unnecessary confusion on this issue.
with this groundwork laid,we now apply this definition to the case before us.in our view,the pennsylvania doc limitation in a prisoner cell constitutes a substantial burden which impedes washington from exercising his professed religion.
washington argues that the limitation places a substantial burden on his religious exercise because it prevents him from reading four books per day and teaching others about the african people.washington religion requires a daily reading of four books.further,washington argues that his ability to teach others about the african people exists only to the extent that he himself has learned about the african people.
the pennsylvania doc contends that limiting the number of books that washington may keep in his cell at any one time does not significantly inhibit or constrain his conduct,or the expression,of his religious beliefs.this book limitation,it asserts,does not prohibit washington from adhering to his faith or deny him the opportunity to engage in activity fundamental to his religion.the pennsylvania doc also argues that its regulations do not render washington religious exercise effectively impracticable.
the district court took a similar stance when it held that the exercise of washington religion was not substantially burdened by the pennsylvania doc policy.notably,the definition of substantial burden used by the district court came from a eighth circuit case from,and at least one prong of the definition adopted in that case contained the central tenet requirement that has since been prohibited by the express terms of rluipa another prong required the religious activities to be fundamental to the person religion.the district court concluded that a palatable alternative exists for washington to practice his religion.specifically,washington still possessed some books that would impart knowledge about his religion and the district court found it hard to believe that washington does not possess significant knowledge of the beliefs and teachings of his religion to teach others in an oral tradition.the district court stated that its conclusion was not altered in any way by the fact that washington exchange of old books for new books must occur by having outsiders supply washington with books which he can exchange for others in his cell.
the position espoused by the pennsylvania doc and adopted by the district court is incorrect.the doc has,for whatever reason,elected not to challenge the sincerity of washington religious beliefs.the brief for the doc prison officials states that those officials do not dispute that washington beliefs are sincerely held religious beliefs and that the books are necessary to enable him to fulfill his religious missionary work.the district court has acknowledged this sincerity of belief and that books are necessary to enable him to fulfill his religious missionary work.the district court acknowledgment and the doc concession,coupled with the limitation,indicates why washington religious exercise has been substantially burdened.washington religion contains two interrelated four books per day about africa and african people,and then proselytizing about what he has read.the record amply supports the proposition that washington can not practice his religion in the absence of reading these books.washington is therefore correct in his assertion that his books and his religion are one and the same his religion is destroyed in the absence of his religious books.
the limitation substantially burdens the first component of washington religious exercise under the second part of our disjunctive test because it severely inhibits his ability to read four new books per day.before the end of three days,washington would run out of new books.in response,the pennsylvania doc makes two arguments.first,the doc states that the prison library is available for washington use and that he would be permitted to read books that are housed in the library.the fatal flaw in this argument is that,as we have mentioned,washington was permitted to visit the library only once a week and could take out just four books at a time.this policy precludes washington from reading books per week.thus,even if the pennsylvania doc is correct that washington could house his own books in the prison library this policy would still not permit him to read four books per day.second,the pennsylvania doc argues that there is no prohibition on washington trading those ten books for another ten books at any time.we find nothing in the record to show that washington could freely trade books that were located inside the prison.similarly,forcing washington,an indigent prisoner,to have outsiders continuously mail books to him severely inhibits his ability to read four new books per day.coupling washington sincerity of religious belief with the inseparability of the requirement from the exercise of his religion leads us to the conclusion that the pennsylvania doc limitation substantially burdens the practice of washington religion.
compelling governmental interest 
washington has satisfied his burden to show that the pennsylvania doc limitation substantially burdens his exercise of religion.b.accordingly,the burden shifts to the pennsylvania doc to show that the policy is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering this interest.a.
