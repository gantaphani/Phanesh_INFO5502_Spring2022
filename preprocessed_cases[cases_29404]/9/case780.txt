the plaintiff,rickey tolbert,is an african american former teacher at john marshall high school john marshall in the rochester city school district the school district.he appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york siragusa.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff claims of discrimination and hostile work environment under title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law et and.the district court also dismissed the plaintiff defamation claim.
on appeal,tolbert contends that he identified sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination,to show a hostile work environment,and to support a claim for defamation.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the judgment of the district court except with respect to the discrimination claims,as to which there are genuine disputes as to material facts that preclude summary judgment based on tolbert prima facie case of discrimination.
tolbert was a culinary arts teacher at john marshall from to.he was a,probationary teacher,who taught three culinary arts classes a day.
because he was a probationary teacher,tolbert classes were observed by john marshall administrators.the reviewing administrator would then write a formal teacher observation.the formal teacher observation form includes a space for written comments and also a summary of performance section that asks the evaluator to check one of five boxes.the available boxes are distinguished,proficient,meets professional standards,below professional standards,and unsatisfactory.
at the end of each school year,tolbert also received an annual evaluation by a john marshall administrator the annual evaluation form includes eighteen categories.the evaluator is asked to check one of five boxes for each category which are the same as those on the formal teacher observation form and provide written comments.the evaluator must also provide an overall summary rating,again by checking one of five boxes.
during his second year teaching,tolbert consistently received marks of proficient or meets professional standards on his evaluations.laurel avery detoy,an administrator at john marshall,conducted tolbert formal teacher observations and his annual evaluation for the school year.tolbert has no complaints about these reviews.
before the start of the school year,defendant richard smith was hired to replace joseph munno as the principal of john marshall.according to tolbert,this is when his employment situation started to sour.
tolbert alleges that he did not receive a budget to purchase supplies for his classes.the size of his classes also grew.in the two previous years,he had around sixteen to eighteen students per class.in the fall of,each of his classes had at least students despite a collective bargaining agreement provision limiting at least one of his classes to students.after tolbert complained,the john marshall administrators eventually reduced the number of students in his classes.
tolbert also claims that many individualized education plan students were placed in his classes,and he was not given the assistance of a paraprofessional.the defendants insist that due to budget cuts,a number of paraprofessional positions were eliminated.as a result,the special education administrator determined that tolbert would not be assigned a paraprofessional for the school year.the defendants also note that percent of the john marshall students had individualized education plans.
tolbert also experienced some problems with the cleanliness and the maintenance of the kitchen in his classroom known as the jurist room.in the fall of,the monroe county department of health and the new york state department of health identified various health code violations.as a result,principal smith closed the kitchen.the parties dispute the cause of these violations.tolbert insists that the janitorial staff did not clean the kitchen regularly,and the defendants contend that tolbert and his students fault.
but these problems were not new.in december,tolbert complained to school officials that the custodial staff was not cleaning the kitchen properly.and in march,the new york state department of health identified a number of health code violations in the kitchen.
tolbert also alleges that principal smith made racist remarks.in the fall of,tolbert volunteered to cook for a homecoming breakfast.when discussing what food would be served,tolbert alleges that principal smith asked him do you only know how to cook black,or can you cook american too ja.
in october,a student in tolbert class alleges that principal smith asked her if she was learning anything from tolbert.in january,during a conversation about reopening the kitchen,principal smith asked the same student how she expected to learn if all she was learning to cook was black food.ja.when asked to define black food,principal smith allegedly said that what he meant was american food.id.and another one of tolbert students alleges that in january or february of,principal smith told her that black kids ca learn in a cooking class because all they want to do is eat.ja.
at some point,principal smith and tolbert both inspected tolbert classroom.tolbert claims that he showed principal smith areas in the classroom that had not been cleaned by the janitorial staff,and principal smith remarked that the kids we get to this school are not from much better than this.ja.because of the demographics of the john marshall student body,tolbert interpreted this comment as a reference to the students race.and in the beginning of the school year,barbara postell,then a counselor at john marshall,asserts that principal smith when referring to john marshall students stated that my friends,they are not like us.ja.postell interpreted this as a comment about the students race.principal smith denies making any of these statements.
tolbert also claims that principal smith told him and his students that the monroe county department of health had closed the kitchen in tolbert classroom.that statement,according to tolbert,was incorrect principal smith had closed the kitchen.
tolbert received three formal teacher evaluations during the school year.in november,avery detoy observed one of tolbert classes and submitted a lengthy and negative evaluation.she rated his performance as unsatisfactory,the lowest of the five options.
in december,anthony bianchi observed one of tolbert classes and concluded that tolbert had met professional standards.in march,tolbert requested that someone other than avery detoy conduct his next evaluation,and principal smith assigned the review to jason muhammad.after observing an april,class,muhammad concluded that tolbert had met professional standards.
in march,the administrative team at john marshall sent a memorandum to the teaching staff.the memo discussed evaluations and identified which administrator would review each teacher.according to the memo,muhammad would conduct tolbert annual evaluation.but principal smith later reassigned the evaluation to avery detoy,the only administrator who had previously rated tolbert performance as unsatisfactory.tolbert claims that he received no notice of the reassignment.
tolbert annual evaluation was not positive.for twelve of the eighteen categories,avery detoy described tolbert teaching as below professional standards.for the remaining six categories,tolbert received marks of meets professional standards.the overall summary rating was below professional standards.the comment sections noted that tolbert had shown some growth,but expressed concern about his teaching strategy,professional development,and lack of involvement with his students parents.in the end,averydetoy recommended denying tolbert tenure.
principal smith agreed,but he recommended that tolbert receive a fourth year of probation.principal smith declared that he made this decision b ased on tolbert observations throughout,his final evaluation and my own bservations of his performance.ja.principal smith and avery detoy informed tolbert of the decision in april.
tolbert refused the offer.accordingly,a recommendation against granting tolbert tenure was forwarded to the rochester city school board.although the school board did not approve the denial of tenure,superintendent jean claude brizard made a final decision to deny tenure.superintendent brizard testified that his decision was based on principal smith recommendation and the reviews of tolbert from the last year and part before that.ja.
by a letter dated august,the school district informed tolbert that he would not receive tenure.the school district again offered tolbert a fourth year of probation,which he refused.
tolbert filed his original complaint in november.after an amendment,the complaint alleged a claim for racial discrimination arising under and a claim for defamation against principal smith.against the school district,the plaintiff alleged that he was subjected to discrimination and a hostile work environment because of his race,in violation of title vii and the nyshrl 
the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims,which the district court granted.the district court dismissed the discrimination claims because it found that tolbert had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he had not suffered an adverse employment action and had failed to raise an inference of discrimination.it dismissed the hostile work environment claims because it concluded that the alleged hostility was not a result of tolbert race and was not sufficiently severe.and the district court dismissed the defamation claim because the complaint failed to allege when or to whom the defamatory statements were made.
tolbert timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,velazco columbus citizens,cir per curiam,and may affirm on any basis that finds support in the record.mauro new england,cir per curiam.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see celotex catrett.in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate,we must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio.
this court has repeatedly expressed the need for caution about granting summary judgment to an employer in a discrimination case where,as here,the merits turn on a dispute as to the employer intent.holcomb iona,cir.at the same time,we have also made it clear that the salutary purposes of summary protracted and harassing no less to discrimination cases than to other areas of litigation.weinstock columbia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
tolbert alleged a racial discrimination claim against principal smith under,and a racial discrimination claim against the school district under title vii and the nyshrl.the title vii,and nyshrl discrimination claims are governed at the summary judgment stage by the analysis first established in mcdonnell douglas green.see brown city of syracuse,cir.although the claim is against principal smith and the title vii and nyshrl claims are against the school district,the analysis is the same the claims against both defendants turn on principal smith conduct 
under the mcdonnell douglas framework,tolbert bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing he belonged to a protected class he was qualified for the position he held he suffered an adverse employment action and that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.brown,at internal quotation marks omitted.the requirement is neither onerous nor intended to be rigid,mechanized or ritualistic.abdu brisson delta air lines,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
there is no disagreement that as an african american,tolbert is a member of a protected class.nor do the defendants question tolbert qualifications.the defendants,however,argue that tolbert did not suffer an adverse employment action and that there is no evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination.we disagree.
an employee suffers an adverse employment action if he endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.an adverse employment action is one which is more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.joseph leavitt,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.denying tolbert tenure and extending his probation was an adverse employment action.
in new york,teachers serve a probationary period.then it is usually up or out the teacher either receives tenure or is terminated.but,as here,school districts may extend the probationary term for one year and postpone the tenure decision.see borkowski valley cent.sch,cir.
this court has held or assumed that the denial of tenure is an adverse employment action under title vii and other employment statutes.see,donnelly greenburgh cent.sch.dist,cir family medical leave act retaliation leibowitz cornell,cir per curiam title vii and the age discrimination in employment act back hastings on hudson union free sch,cir zahorik cornell,cir title vii see also okruhlik of,cir title vii and.this makes sense.tenure is a material condition of employment because it provides job security.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,the consequences of an award of tenure are of great moment both to the employee and to the employer.
but the defendants insist that this case is different because tolbert was offered a fourth year of probationary employment.according to the defendants,tolbert employment situation would have been no worse had he accepted the offer.
the defendants ignore the fact that the offer of a fourth year of probation was intertwined with the denial of tenure.had the plaintiff received tenure,he could have been terminated only for cause.but had he remained a probationary teacher,he could have been terminated for any lawful reason.educ.therefore was the denial of a material improvement in the conditions of the plaintiff employment.
title vii prohibits discriminat ion against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,a,the nyshrl similarly prohibits employers from discriminat ing against such individual in compensation or in terms,conditions or privileges of employment,exec.law a,and provides that all persons shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens,a.refusing to award a contract or a material employment benefit for a discriminatory reason violates those statutes.see,zahorik,at tenure decisions are not exempt under title vii,and plaintiffs seeking to show that forbidden purposes lurk in a tenure decision have available methods of challenging such decisions.
indeed,were we to accept the defendants interpretation,then failure to promote any claims alleging the denial of an employment be.and that can not be the case.a benefit that is part and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled out in a discriminatory fashion,even if the employer would be free under the employment contract simply not to provide the benefit at all.hishon king spalding,
extending an employment relationship by one year by itself may not qualify as an adverse employment action.but when coupled with the denial of tenure,it is assuredly an adverse employment action.during the fourth year of probationary employment,a teacher can be fired at any time for any lawful reason.educ.law a.but if granted tenure,the teacher may be fired only for cause.id.a,a.the denial of tenure after three years,when a teacher was otherwise eligible for tenure,does not become any less an adverse action because the teacher is provided with another year of probationary employment.
of course,a school district may defer a decision on tenure and obtain another year experience with a teacher,provided that the decision is not made for an unlawful reason such as racial discrimination.but the denial of tenure after three years can not lawfully be based on a discriminatory reason,even if the teacher remains empl
