terminated employees of the municipality of santa isabel challenge the district court entry of summary judgment against them on their claims for deprivation of due process and political discrimination,brought under.after careful consideration of the record,we affirm.
factual background 
in the puerto rico general elections of november,enrique questell alvarado questell,a member of puerto rico new progressive party npp,was elected mayor of the municipality of santa isabel the municipality.he took office on january.in february,mayor questell appointed natalie rodríguez cardona rodríguez to be director of the city human resources department.
prior to mayor questell election,the popular democratic party pdp had been in power in santa isabel for eight consecutive years.the mayoral election was hotly contested,as mayor questell bested the incumbent,mayor,ngel snchez.the tension between the parties carried over into the transition process,culminating in mayor questell filing a writ of mandamus in a puerto rico court in december of to compel the outgoing mayor participation in the transition.
at the time of mayor questell election,the appellants were all employed by the municipality of santa isabel.of the appellants were employed in career positions,akin to civil service employment,while the remainder were temporary or transitory employees,or were employed under puerto rico law,which authorizes the commonwealth of puerto rico to fund municipal employee salaries in order to subsidize locally managed programs and ameliorate unemployment.see acevedo feliciano ruiz hernández,cir.
in january,mayor questell hired an independent accounting firm to evaluate the state of santa isabel budget.the firm produced a transition report in that evaluated the municipality financial status at the close of the fiscal year.that report indicated that of the municipality budget was consumed by payroll and benefits for municipal employees,leaving only of the budget for other expenditures.the report further indicated that the outgoing administration had spent more than the allocated of the municipality budget for the first half of the fiscal year,in violation of puerto rico law,and that,having underestimated expenses and overestimated revenue,the outgoing administration left the municipality with the functional equivalent of of that budget.according to audits performed by the puerto rico comptroller office,the municipality had accumulated a budgetary deficit of.the audits also showed that santa isabel had more municipal employees during the fiscal year than in any of the six previous fiscal years.
in response to the report,the defendants began terminating individual employees as early as march.in june,the contracts of numerous temporary employees expired and were not renewed.that same month,the santa isabel municipal legislature passed municipal ordinance ordinance,which approved a broad plan to lay off,transfer,or demote municipal employees in accordance with the needs of the municipality and the availability of municipal funds.ordinance mandated that the least efficient employees will be the first to be dismissed unless the municipality lacked valid information about employee performance.if such information was lacking,ordinance required employee terminations to be based exclusively on seniority.mayor questell signed ordinance into law on june,at which time it was posted on bulletin boards in every department of the municipality.
as of june,the municipality did not have a reliable system for evaluating the job performance of its career employees.the previous mayor had signed into law an ordinance to enact the implementation of an evaluation and motivation system for santa isabel municipal employees.according to a certification signed by mayor questell,however,the evaluation system had never been used.a municipal audit conducted in further confirms this fact.
on august,in conformance with the procedural requirements of ordinance,the municipality human resources department provided each career employee with a written calculation of his or her years of service based on a review of the employee personnel file the notice explicitly referenced ordinance,and it advised employees of their right to submit a request for corrections to the calculation.nineteen municipal employees,including six plaintiffs in this case,exercised this right.the human resources department produced an amended seniority list,copies of which were posted on bulletin boards at santa isabel city hall.
on september,mayor questell ordered rodríguez to perform an evaluation of the existing positions within the municipality and to submit her recommendation as to the number of positions that could be eliminated in order to alleviate the budgetary deficit.on september,rodríguez informed mayor questell by letter that job posts could be eliminated from within the municipality.the letter stated that this number was aggregated from information provided by the managers or directors of nine municipal departments when asked about the positions whose elimination would cause the less severe impact on the provision of municipal services.it did not identify the employees who occupied the positions that would be eliminated,but merely stated how many of each type of municipal job the department managers considered expendable.
on september,mayor questell ordered rodríguez to eliminate of the positions recommended.according to an affidavit signed by rodríguez,she did not have any personal involvement in deciding which jobs within the municipality would be eliminated.mayor questell did not review any personnel files or make any individualized determinations before issuing this order,nor did he discover the identities of the terminated employees until their termination letters had been prepared within each job type,mayor questell ordered that the dismissals were to be based strictly on seniority.
on october,the municipality approved a municipal ordinance that amended ordinance by allowing the municipality to consider other alternatives to employee terminations if financially viable.the next day,as rumors of imminent layoffs spread,a group of municipal employees politically affiliated with the pdp,including many of the plaintiffs in this case,gathered in front of santa isabel city hall to protest.several employees who remained inside city hall mocked and laughed at the protesters.
on the day of the protests,written termination notices were provided to the selected career employees of the municipality,including the plaintiffs.the notices advised that the terminations were to take effect in days.they also informed employees of their right to appeal the termination to the puerto rico appellate commission of the human resources system.nineteen career employees appealed their terminations through this process 
procedural history 
in june,the appellants,along with other plaintiffs,filed this civil rights suit in federal district court,pursuant to.the complaint alleged that the defendants had unconstitutionally terminated the plaintiffs on account of their political affiliation with the pdp,and had failed to provide those plaintiffs who had been career employees,including of the appellants here,with a hearing to which they were constitutionally entitled.the plaintiffs also brought supplemental state tort claims under articles and of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit,
in due course,the defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts against all plaintiffs.the district court granted that motion in part.in its opinion and order,the district court held that the due process claims of the plaintiffs who had been career employees were foiled by the doctrine the court characterized the defendants failure to provide those plaintiffs with a hearing as a random and unauthorized deprivation.it then reasoned that the plaintiffs claims could not succeed because they had failed to show that the available remedies were inadequate.the court also rejected the political discrimination claims of all but plaintiffs because they had not shown that mayor questell,who made the ultimate decision to terminate their employment,knew of their political affiliation.the court denied the motion with respect to the political discrimination claims of the plaintiffs whose political affiliation mayor questell admitted to knowing in his deposition 
this appeal followed.after the appeal was docketed,but before oral argument,five appellants requested the voluntary dismissal of their appeal,which we granted.
summary judgment is appropriate when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see also,leavitt corr.med,cir.a disputed fact is material only if its existence vel non has the potential to change the outcome of the suit.nolan,wl,at cir.at this stage,we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the.id.if a movant has averred that there is an absence of evidence to support the cause of action,the burden shifts to the to establish,through definite,competent evidence,an issue worthy of trial.meuser fed.express,cir quoting mesnick,cir internal quotation mark omitted.our review is de novo,and we may accordingly affirm the entry of summary judgment on any ground apparent from the record,méndez aponte bonilla,cir.
due process 
as noted,appellants held career positions with the municipality prior to their termination.under the laws of puerto rico,career employees have a property interest in maintaining their employment that is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.colón santiago rosario,cir.depending on context,employees often,but not always,may not be deprived of continued employment without notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard in advance of the termination.see generally cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.here,the parties all agree that the appellants were not afforded a hearing.
however,hearings are not always required.we have held that hearings are not required by due process where a bona fide government reorganization plan bases dismissals on factors unrelated to personal performance.whalen.trial,cir see also duffy sarault,cir.because such a plan is aimed at positions of employment rather than at individual employees,a hearing would be a futile exercise.whalen,at hartman city of providence,s ince there are no charges against the employee there would be no occasion for a hearing,and it would be idle to hold one.quoting kusza maximonis,internal quotation mark omitted.accordingly,w here a reorganization or other measure results in dismissal of an employee no hearing is due.duffy,at.
because the district court based its decision on the parratt hudson doctrine,neither party has argued that the nature of the reorganization plan in this case provided an alternative ground for concluding that no hearings were necessary.nevertheless,in arguing that the dismissals at issue were driven by the financial crisis in the municipality and not by political considerations,the appellees have set forth in the summary judgment record the facts necessary to support the reorganization exception,and the appellants have had a full opportunity to challenge them.given that our review on summary judgment is plenary,méndez aponte,at,that we can affirm on any basis apparent in the record,and that the applicability of the reorganization exception in this case is so plain,we choose to apply it.
there is no disputing that santa isabel was in a dire financial situation when mayor questell assumed office,with an accumulated budget deficit in excess of,or that the situation was attributable in large part to the size of the municipal workforce.nor is there any question that the layoff plan,in fact,alleviated that situation.according to an audit conducted in,the municipality accrued deficit decreased by nearly in the first two years under mayor questell administration.the audit also shows that,over that period,the total number of municipal employees decreased by roughly while the municipality payroll was cut almost in half.the need for,and the benefits from,ordinance are manifest.
of course,an incoming administration may not use a systematic reorganization to effectuate otherwise impermissible terminations.borges colón román abreu,cir.in this instance,the plaintiffs accompanying political discrimination claim makes clear that they view the layoff plan as a stratagem to oust employees hired by,and thus affiliated with,the outgoing pdp administration.we have encountered similar claims numerous times,often as a result of administration changes following elections in puerto rico.id.
however,there is no evidence of pretext here.the appellants emphasize various record evidence that is insufficient,both individually and cumulatively,to create a triable issue.for example,the appellants point to rodríguez deposition testimony,in which she stated that the municipality had approximately fifty more employees in june of than it did at the time of the layoffs in,and that she does not recall the municipality instituting a hiring freeze immediately following the layoffs.this evidence is incomplete and equivocal,at best.first,an absolute increase in the number of municipal employees over a period,with no distinction drawn between career employees,temporary or contract employees,or even commonwealthfunded employees under law,does not indicate that the layoffs in were needless or pretextual.moreover,as noted above,the comptroller auditing report from confirms that the absolute number of municipal employees decreased in each of the first two years under mayor questell.rodríguez comment does not,as the plaintiffs contend,demonstrate that in spite of the alleged financial crisis,the municipality continued to hire new employees throughout,and.
second,rodríguez explained in her deposition that she does not recall whether the municipality instituted a hiring freeze because the positions that were subject to ordinance were removed from the municipal budget entirely.in other words,the positions at issue no longer existed within the municipality,so there were no open positions to fill.thus,rodríguez failure to recall whether a hiring freeze was implemented is not probative of whether the municipality conducted any hiring in.the only record evidence that directly speaks to municipal hiring in is mayor questell unequivocal assertion in his deposition that,in,we were not hiring and there was a reduction in all departments,including mine in particularly sic.
likewise,the appellants suggest that the defendants use of a seniority ranking only for the positions selected for layoffs,instead of an seniority ranking,shows that certain defendants were targeted for layoffs and that seniority was not,in fact,the basis for the termination decisions.we disagree.in general,one would expect a bona fide administrative reorganization plan to focus on particular positions that would be eliminated.a layoff plan based exclusively on seniority,without regard to the jobs the terminated employees performed,would pose considerable challenges,including the possibility of added expense and inefficiency by requiring the municipality to more senior employees in new roles based on the needs of the public.moreover,because the appellants have failed to adduce evidence showing that mayor questell had knowledge of the identities or political affiliations of the workers in each position,the suggestion that particular positions were selected for elimination in order to target the appellants on the basis of their political affiliation is speculative and unsupported.see méndez aponte,at we ignore any conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.quoting del toro pacheco pereira,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the strongest evidence in favor of the plaintiffs claim of pretext is the admission by rodríguez that she did not employ any of the alternatives to termination identified in the amendment to ordinance once the administration had settled on a particular layoff plan even that evidence is insufficient,however.the amendment to ordinance required the defendants to consider alternatives to termination only if they viewed the use of such alternatives to be financially feasible.the record is devoid of eviden
