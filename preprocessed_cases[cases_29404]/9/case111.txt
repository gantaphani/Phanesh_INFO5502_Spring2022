this case requires us to revisit the rule b pleading threshold.it involves a plaintiff who reasonably believes that he was shot by a police officer but who thereafter was deprived of access to information that would have enabled him to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident.the district court determined that the allegations in the plaintiff amended complaint lacked the requisite plausibility and therefore dismissed the action.see guadalupe báez police officers a z,wl,at.after careful consideration,we reverse in part.
background 
we begin with the puerto rico police department prpd.the prpd has a tarnished history of civil rights violations.in,the united states department of justice doj commenced an investigation into whether the prpd had demonstrated a pattern and practice of conduct that deprived citizens of their constitutional rights.see.some three years later,the doj issued its report the report,which concluded that the prpd was broken in a number of critical and fundamental respects and that prpd officers had engage d in a pattern and practice of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.the report went on to identify many other systemic deficiencies,including inadequate officer training,faulty supervision,lax discipline,and chronic failures to investigate and remediate officer wrongdoing.
in december of,the doj with the goal of reaching an agreement for the prpd reform filed a section suit against the prpd in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.roughly seven months thereafter,the doj and the prpd reached a settlement.the district court continues to monitor the prpd compliance with the settlement agreement.
against this backdrop,we turn to the case at hand.in july of,raúl alberto guadalupe báez guadalupe was shot and badly wounded in the vicinity of san lorenzo,puerto rico,after one of several police vehicles closely approached him based on the proximity of the police vehicles,guadalupe plausibly alleged that he had been shot by a police officer.but the police seem to have stonewalled,and guadalupe was unable to ascertain either the identity of the shooter or other critical information about the circumstances surrounding the incident.for aught that appears,the shooting was entirely without justification.
puerto rico officials did launch a pair of investigations into the incident,one led by héctor orozco orozco of the prpd criminal investigation center in caguas and the other led by carlos rosa rosa of the special investigations bureau sib of the puerto rico department of justice.neither investigation resulted in guadalupe learning the identity of his shooter,and the probes were terminated without any charges being filed.
in july of ten days before the doj and the prpd reached their settlement guadalupe filed suit.when motions to dismiss were served,the district court ordered guadalupe either to amend his complaint or to show cause why his suit should not be jettisoned.in response,guadalupe filed an amended complaint seeking damages against named and unnamed members of the prpd,the san lorenzo municipal police,and the puerto rico department of justice see.the following parties were named as defendants 
unnamed police officers a z the john doe defendants,for various acts,including excessive force against guadalupe in violation of the fourth amendment 
héctor pesquera pesquera,superintendent of the prpd at the time of the shooting josé román abreu román,the mayor of the municipality of san lorenzo and of the san lorenzo municipal police at the time of the shooting guillermo somoza colombani somoza,secretary of justice and of the sib at the time of the shooting and luis sánchez betances sánchez,somoza successor as secretary of justice collectively,the supervisory defendants,for negligent training,entrustment,and supervision of the unnamed police officers 
howard delgado delgado,a prpd officer,orozco,and rosa,for obstructing justice and conspiring to deprive guadalupe of the right to seek legal redress.
guadalupe amended complaint relied on the report to show,among other things,a pattern and practice of use of excessive force caused by the adoption and use of inadequate policies and procedures,insufficient training,inadequate supervision,deficient complaint processes and ineffective disciplining.
the defendants renewed their motions to dismiss.while these motions were pending,the prpd,in august of,disclosed more documents to guadalupe.these belatedly produced documents indicated for the first time the identity of the shooter.approximately one month later and without guadalupe having made any further submission to the district court,the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.see guadalupe báez,wl,at.pertinently,the court concluded that guadalupe supervisory liability and conspiracy claims failed to satisfy the minimum requirements of rule b.see id.at.
guadalupe moved for reconsideration,see.e,citing the new information belatedly disclosed by the prpd.the district court summarily denied the motion,stating that guadalupe had failed to present this information to the court in a timely manner.
guadalupe now appeals both the dismissal of his complaint and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss under rule b.see medina velázquez hernández gregorat,cir sec tambone,cir en banc.in conducting this review,we accept the truth of all facts and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader favor.grajales ports,cir.we may supplement such facts and inferences with data points gleaned from documents incorporated by reference into the complaint,matters of public record,and facts susceptible to judicial notice.haley city of boston,cir.
it is axiomatic that a complaint must contain only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d see grajales,at.
we have choreographed a pavane for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint.see ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.at the start,an inquiring court first must separate wheat from chaff that is,the court must separate the complaint factual allegations which must be accepted as true from its conclusory legal allegations which need not be credited.morales cruz of,cir.then,the court must determine whether the facts,taken in their entirety,permit the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.quoting iqbal,at.it is with this progression in mind that we turn to guadalupe asseverational array.
supervisory liability.
guadalupe most loudly bruited claims sound in supervisory liability under.such a claim has two elements first,the plaintiff must show that one of the supervisor subordinates abridged the plaintiff constitutional rights.see pineda toomey,cir.second,the plaintiff must show that the supervisor action or inaction was affirmative ly link ed to that behavior in the sense that it could be characterized as supervisory encouragement,condonation,or acquiescence or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference.id.alterations in original quoting lipsett of,cir.
supervisory liability is sui generis.thus,a supervisor may not be held liable under section on the tort theory of respondeat superior,nor can a supervisor section liability rest solely on his position of authority.see ramírez lluveras rivera merced,cir.this does not mean,however,that for section liability to attach,a supervisor must directly engage in a subordinate unconstitutional behavior.see camilo robles hoyos,cir.even so,the supervisor liability must be premised on his own acts or omissions.see gutierrez rodriguez cartagena,cir figueroa aponte roque,cir.mere negligence will not suffice the supervisor conduct must evince reckless or callous indifference to the constitutional rights of others.febus rodríguez betancourt lebrón,cir.
if a plaintiff relies on a theory of deliberate indifference,a inquiry must be undertaken.see ramírez lluveras,at.in the course of that inquiry,the plaintiff must show that the officials had knowledge of facts,from which the official s can draw the inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.id.alteration in original quoting ruiz rosa rullán,cir.
d eliberate indifference alone does not equate with supervisory liability.figueroa torres toledo dávila,cir alteration in original quoting camilo robles,at.causation remains an essential element,and the causal link between a supervisor conduct and the constitutional violation must be solid.see ramírez lluveras,at.this causation requirement contemplates proof that the supervisor conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.hegarty somerset county,cir.that is a difficult standard to meet but far from an impossible one a plaintiff may,for example,prove causation by showing inaction in the face of a known history of widespread abuse sufficient to alert a supervisor to ongoing violations.maldonado denis castillo rodriguez,cir.i solated instances of unconstitutional activity will not suffice.id.
in addition,a supervisor must be on notice of the violation.see ramírez lluveras,at.such notice may be either actual or constructive.see feliciano hernández pereira castillo,cir.
before us,guadalupe argues that the district court erred in dismissing his supervisory liability claims both because it failed to give proper evidentiary weight to the report and because it imposed too demanding a pleading standard.we agree in part.
the amended complaint alleges that each of the supervisory defendants negligently confided and entrusted the unnamed police officers with the authority to discharge their apparent duties.and as to each,the amended complaint also alleges that 
he is responsible to guadalupe for his own actions and omissions,negligent entrustment and negligent supervision a behavior that could be characterized as supervisory encouragement,condonation or acquiescence or gross negligence,amounting to deliberate indifference and reckless disregard of guadalupe rights and guarantees under the law,and improperly his subordinates.
the complaint then alleges that every one of the supervisory defendants failed to take necessary investigatory or remedial action after the shooting.
certain other allegations,relevant only to pesquera,somoza,and sánchez,likewise bear on these supervisory liability claims.as to this group of defendants,the amended complaint further alleges that each member of the group adopted policies that preserved the pattern and practice of use of excessive force.
given this series of averments,guadalupe best case is against pesquera who became superintendent of the prpd after the report became public and held that office at the time of the shooting.the district court nonetheless dismissed the supervisory liability claim against pesquera,concluding that guadalupe allegations were insufficient to connect the dots and demonstrate that pesquera conduct was affirmatively linked to the harm that eventuated.guadalupe báez,wl,at.we think that the court set the bar too high viewed as part of the tableau constructed by the report,guadalupe has stated a supervisory liability claim against pesquera that is plausible on its face.
as superintendent,pesquera bore the ultimate responsibility for overseeing and directing all administrative,operational,training,and disciplinary aspects of the prpd.an appreciable amount of time elapsed between the issuance of the report and the shooting.guadalupe alleges,though,that pesquera continued or at least failed to ameliorate policies which cause the pattern and practice of use of excessive force.when this allegation is evaluated in conjunction with the rampant constitutional violations limned in the report and the parade of horribles allegedly visited upon guadalupe,a plausible inference exists that pesquera either condoned or at least acquiesced in the offending conduct conduct that is affirmatively linked to the harm guadalupe suffered.thus,pesquera may be subject to section liability as a supervisor for that harm.
any claim by pesquera that he was unaware of the substantial risk of the serious harm that befell guadalupe would constitute deliberate indifference to the reality of the dysfunction that pesquera inherited when he took over as superintendent of the prpd.see,ramírez lluveras,at maldonado denis,at.the short of it is that guadalupe supervisory liability claim against pesquera crosses the plausibility threshold because the doj has given him a leg up.indeed,it is through such reasoning that district courts in puerto rico have consistently given weight to the report and declined to dismiss analogous claims during the pleading phase.see,cabrera berrios pedrogo,d,molina vidal olivo,d,jorge police dep t of,wl,at.
we add that plausibility determinations can not be made in the abstract.here,all that guadalupe could reasonably know or be expected to ascertain at the time he filed suit was that an unidentified police officer had shot him for no apparent reason.but when combined with the report,that is enough to get guadalupe across the plausibility threshold such random and anonymous violence appears to be a predictable culmination of the systemic problems documented in the report.in this instance,then,the report plays a critical role in bridging the plausibility gap.
nor is there anything unfair about this result.the existence of the report put pesquera on luminously clear notice that he might become liable,in his supervisory capacity,should his acts and omissions contribute to the continuation of the pathologies described in the report.see starr baca,cir holding that a series of investigative reports documenting systemic deficiencies in a jail put the on notice of the risk of the harm that befell the plaintiff see also turkmen hasty,cir explaining that a report incorporated into a complaint may provide invaluable context and help orient a court analysis of the c omplaint.
to be sure,guadalupe claim against pesquera,as pleaded,is not a textbook model.he could have included more particulars about pesquera role and responsibilities as superintendent of the prpd and tied such details to the known circumstances of his shooting.but we have said before,and today reaffirm,that a high degree of factual specificity is not required at the pleading stage.rodríguez reyes molina rodríguez,cir.in our view,there is enough here though not by much to permit guadalupe to proceed to discovery.
there is one loose end.pesquera argues,in the alternative,that he is at least entitled to qualified immunity because the complaint does not adequately allege that he was on notice that his actions or inactions put the citizens lives at risk.we do not agree.
to determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage,we ask whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged violation.glik cunniffe,cir quoting maldonado fontanes,cir.a right is clearly established if the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant fair warning that his particular conduct was unconstitutional.maldonado,at.because the report put pesquera on clear notice of his potential liability,pesquera plainly can not satisfy one of the showings required for qualified immunity.
b.other supervisory defendants.
as to the other supervisory defendants román,somoza,and sánchez,the order of dismissal stands on a different footing.though guadalupe allegations against pesquera are considerably bolstered by the findings contained in the report,these findings do not help him against the other supervisory defendants.we explain briefly.
román was named in the suit as the head of the san lorenzo municipal police.yet,the report has no visible connection with the structure,training,oversight,or operations of the san lorenzo municipal police.equally as important,the amended complaint does not so much as attempt to forge a link between the report and any wrongdoing
