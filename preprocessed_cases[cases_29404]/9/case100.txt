this case involves a man,his dog,and a condominium association no pets rule.like so many cases,it turns chiefly on the standard of review.after delineating that standard a matter of first impression in this circuit,inspecting the record through that lens,and applying the applicable law,we deny the condominium association petition for judicial review of a final order of the secretary of the united states department of housing and urban development hud.we simultaneously grant the secretary for enforcement of his order.
i.the statutory scheme 
this case rests on a statutory foundation the fair housing act the act.as relevant here,the act proscribes discrimination in housing and matters based on a person disability see id.f.under the act,a cognizable disability is a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of a person major life activities,a record of having such an impairment,or being regarded as having such an impairment.id.h.
pertinently,the act outlaws discrimination in connection with the terms,conditions,or privileges of housing.see id.f.discrimination includes,among other things,the refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.id.f b.
ii.prior proceedings 
in,the castillo condominium association the association learned that carlo giménez bianco giménez,a condominium resident,was keeping a dog on the premises and warned him by letter that it would fine him unless he removed the dog from his unit.in response,giménez,an individual who suffers from anxiety and depression,promptly advised the board of directors,in writing,that he planned to keep his emotional support dog in his condominium unit and that he was entitled to do so under federal law.although giménez accompanied this letter with a note from his treating psychiatrist,the association did not relax its no pets bylaw.as a result of the conflict as the secretary found,giménez was eventually forced to vacate and sell the unit that had been his home for some years.
giménez lodged a complaint of disability discrimination with hud.following an investigation and an agency determination of reasonable cause,hud filed a charge of discrimination against the association see id.a b iv,g.the charge alleged that the association had unlawfully discriminated against giménez,a disabled person,by denying him a reasonable accommodation and thus making housing unavailable to him.see id.f,f,and f b.
a evidentiary hearing ensued before an administrative law judge alj.giménez,his treating psychiatrist pedro fernández,and his physician roberto unda gómez all testified that giménez suffered from a disability an anxiety disorder and chronic depression and that his symptoms were ameliorated by the presence of an emotional support dog.the association presented both lay and expert evidence in opposition.on july,the alj issued a recommended decision concluding that the association had not violated the act because giménez had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a mental impairment warranting a reasonable accommodation in the form of a companion animal.
under the regulatory regime,the alj recommended decision could be appealed to the secretary.see id.h.that happened here.on further review,the secretary set aside the alj recommended decision.the secretary explained that the alj had erred both in discounting giménez testimony about his lengthy history of anxiety and depression and in declining to credit the testimony of fernández and unda.in the end,the secretary found that giménez suffered from a cognizable disability,that the association knew or should have known that giménez had such a disability,that giménez had informed the association of his need for a reasonable accommodation in the form of an emotional support dog,that the association had improvidently denied the accommodation,and that the association had failed to engage in the required interactive process 
having found the association liable for discrimination,the secretary remanded the case to the alj for an initial determination of damages and civil penalties.see id.g a,b.in due course,the alj issued another recommended decision this decision proposed to award giménez in emotional distress damages and to assess a civil penalty against the association.the alj noted,inter alia,that since the association culpable acts and omissions apparently were fueled by ignorance of the law,those acts and omissions did not amount to willful,malicious conduct that demands a maximum penalty.additionally,the alj recommended ancillary relief,including fair housing training for the association officers and the implementation by the association of a reasonable accommodation policy.
this second recommended decision met the same fate as the first it inspired another petition for secretarial review.the secretary concluded that the alj had undervalued the emotional distress that giménez had experienced and,therefore,increased the proposed award of emotional distress damages to.similarly,the secretary concluded that the alj had underestimated the association blameworthiness for its egregious and intentional conduct.unlike the alj,the secretary counted the association ignorance of the law as an aggravating factor,not a mitigating factor,and upped the civil penalty to the maximum available penalty amount.finally,the secretary reworked and strengthened the alj proposals for ancillary relief.
displeased by virtually every aspect of the secretary final order,the association filed a timely petition for judicial review.see i.the secretary countered by for enforcement of his order.we consolidated these petitions for briefing and oral argument.
iii.standard of review 
under the administrative procedure act apa,a reviewing court may set aside a final agency order if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.in line with this statutory imperative,a reviewing court is bound by an agency factual findings as long as they are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.astralis condo.ass sec y of hud,cir.
substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting universal camera nlrb.of course,substantial evidence does not mean either uncontradicted evidence or overwhelming evidence.rather,this benchmark may be met even if the record arguably could justify a different conclusion.rodriguez pagan sec y of hhs,cir per curiam see also felisky bowen,cir the secretary findings are not subject to reversal merely because substantial evidence exists in the record to support a different conclusion.
this familiar standard has a twist,however,in cases in which the hearing officer and the ultimate decisionmaker have differing views of the material facts.this case is emblematic of such a situation though the alj was the initial decisionmaker and the one who actually saw and heard the witnesses,the secretary is the ultimate decisionmaker.as such,the secretary is empowered to affirm,modify or set aside,in whole or in part,the initial decision,or remand the initial decision for further proceedings.a see h,b.but common sense suggests that,in such circumstances,some weight should be given to the alj factual findings.
although this court has not had occasion to speak to the ramifications of such a paradigm,the case law elsewhere indicates that a more granular level of scrutiny should apply.we agree that such a nuanced approach is desirable and we adopt it.
we hold that where,as here,the secretary rejects the factual findings of an alj,a reviewing court must first make certain that the secretary has adequately articulated his reasons for overturning the alj findings.see aylett sec y of hud,cir.the court must then proceed to ask whether those articulated reasons derive adequate support from the administrative record.see id.at.although this heightened level of scrutiny does not alter the substantial evidence standard of review in any fundamental respect,it requires us to apply that standard with special rigor,particularly with regard to credibility determinations.see garcia sec y of labor,cir see also earle,nlrb,cir noting that a reviewing court examine s the secretary findings more critically when the secretary and alj disagree.it is with this nuanced standard of review in mind that we turn to the association asseverational array.
iv.discussion 
we divide our analysis into three segments.first,we confront the association claims that the secretary final order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.second,we explore the association assertion that the charging party complaint is barred by res judicata.third,we address the association plaint that the secretary final order is tainted by procedural error 
a.the merits.
this case is,and it would serve no useful purpose for us to chronicle every piece of evidence.for present purposes,it suffices to say that we have examined the record with care and have given especially exacting scrutiny to the issue of disability the principal issue on which the secretary and the alj diverged.
the secretary decision ultimately rests on his determination that the association violated the act.though the proof is conflicted at several points,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the secretary finding that the association refusal to allow giménez to keep an emotional support dog in his condominium unit as a reasonable accommodation for his disability was unlawful.that refusal made giménez home unavailable to him as a practical matter and,thus,violated the act.see f.so,too,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the secretary finding that the association failure to provide a reasonable accommodation constituted discrimination against giménez in the terms and conditions of housing due to his disability and,thus,violated yet another provision of the act.see id.f.we explain briefly.
to make out a prima facie case for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation,the charging party here,giménez had to show that he was a person with a disability,that the association knew or should have known that he was a person with a disability,that his emotional support dog was reasonable and necessary to afford him an equal opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling,and that the association nonetheless refused to provide a reasonable accommodation.see astralis condo.ass n,at.here,ample evidence demonstrates these four key showings.first,giménez own testimony,substantiated by the testimony of fernández and unda,warranted a finding that giménez,who suffered from anxiety and chronic depression,was a person with a disability within the purview of the act.second,the evidence is virtually incontrovertible that the association knew or at least had notice that giménez suffered from a disability.third,substantial evidence supports a finding that giménez told the association that he would need a reasonable accommodation an exception to the no pets bylaw so that he could keep a dog in his condominium unit in order to allow him an equal opportunity to use and enjoy his abode.fourth,the record makes manifest that the association informed giménez that he could not keep his dog in his unit.no more was exigible based on these supportable findings,the secretary acted well within the scope of his authority both in concluding that the association refusal to grant an accommodation made giménez home unavailable to him thus,compelling him to move out in order to keep his emotional support dog and in concluding that these actions constituted unlawful discrimination 
to be sure,the secretary reached these conclusions only after rejecting the alj central factual finding that giménez did not suffer from a disability.but the secretary did not reject that finding lightly.to the contrary,he gave specific and plausible reasons for declining to follow the alj reasons that find adequate purchase in the record.see aylett,at.
in setting aside the alj finding that giménez did not suffer from a disability,the secretary noted that the alj had discounted the testimony of giménez,his treating psychiatrist fernández,and his physician unda.the secretary concluded that the alj lacked any sound basis for the wholesale abrogation of this testimony.
to begin,the alj discounted giménez own testimony,apparently because he concluded that an individual can not supply key testimony verifying his own disability status.yet,our research suggests the opposite.see dep t of justice dep t of hous.urban,reasonable accommodations under the fair housing act,at may,see also olsen stark homes,cir explaining that individual testimony about his depression was competent to put his disability status in issue.
next,the secretary disagreed with the alj assessment of fernández testimony.fernández is a practicing psychiatrist who had treated giménez for years and who strongly confirmed the existence of the claimed disability.the alj seems to have given no weight to the doctor testimony for two primary reasons first,the alj cited the personal friendship between giménez and fernández and second,the alj was skeptical of the fact that fernández had not charged giménez for treatment.but the secretary gave cogent reasons for disagreeing with the alj assessment.as for the friendship between giménez and fernández,the secretary explained that hud and doj have made pellucid that verification of a person disability can come from any reliable third party who is in a position to know about the individual disability a category into which fernández surely fit.see dep t of justice dep t of hous.urban,reasonable accommodations under the fair housing act,at may.the secretary also explained that ignoring a doctor testimony simply because he treated a patient pro bono would lead to the nonsensical conclusion that a physician who does not charge for his services could never testify.carried to its logical extreme,the alj view might even mean that a person who receives all of his medical treatment for free could never establish a disability.in the end,it is the overall quality of the proffered testimony that determines its probative value.recognizing as much,the secretary warrantably found that fernández testimony was probative of giménez disability.
finally,the secretary credited the testimony of unda a witness whom the alj had disregarded altogether.unda testimony confirmed both giménez autobiographical account of his struggles with anxiety and depression and fernández diagnosis.that unda is not himself a psychiatrist does not,as the alj intimated,preclude reliance on his testimony about his patient mental state.see,sprague bowen,cir alvarado weinberger,cir per curiam.
based on his evaluation of the testimony,the secretary concluded that giménez had what amounted to a lifelong history of depression.each of the physicians had treated giménez for years,and each doctor opinion corroborated both giménez account of his mental impairment and the other doctor opinions.the secretary was well within his purview to credit this testimony fully and to make the ultimate determination that giménez was disabled,that is,that giménez suffered from a mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities.even under the heightened scrutiny demanded by the applicable standard of review,the secretary decision passes muster because the record,viewed critically,clearly supports his position.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.we hold both that the secretary adequately articulated his reasons for scrapping the alj no disability finding and that his conclusion that the association had violated the act is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole 
res judicata.
the association argues that,regardless of the merits,the charge against it ought to have been dismissed on the ground of res judicata.some additional background is helpful in order to put this argument in perspective.
prior to filing his complaint with hud,giménez protested the no pets bylaw to the puerto rico department of consumer affairs familiarly known by its spanish acronym,daco.tha
