rocket learning,an educational services provider based in puerto rico,appeals from a district court order dismissing with prejudice this civil rights action,filed pursuant to,against defendant jesús rivera sánchez,personally and in his official capacity as puerto rico secretary of education.
the suit alleges constitutional violations arising from a change to the certification and enrollment process for providers in the commonwealth supplemental educational services program,funded under federal law.the claim is essentially that this change unilaterally and arbitrarily disadvantaged the appellant,a certified provider,its competitors.the district court found that the amended complaint lacked sufficiently facts to support a plausible claim that the defendant had violated rocket learning equal protection,due process,or commercial free speech rights.we now affirm the district court decision on the alternative ground that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity as to all claims.
title i,part a of the elementary and secondary education act of,as amended by the no child left behind act of,makes available federal funding for state educational agencies to provide,inter alia,various academic opportunities to students from families.see no child left behind act of,stat,codified at.one of these opportunities,the supplemental educational services ses program,entitles eligible students to receive tutoring services at no cost from a private or public organization certified by the state and selected by the students guardians.e.the commonwealth of puerto rico has participated in the ses program since,as administered by the puerto rico department of education prde.
each academic year,the prde conducts a enrollment procedure to match eligible students with ses providers.first,in the certification process,prospective ses providers submit an annual certification or proposal,through a request for qualification rfq,which determines their eligibility to enroll students in the upcoming year.such proposals must comply with requirements enumerated in the rfq application and in the commonwealth ses procedures manual ses manual,and can not be amended after submission except as requested by the prde.
after certification,ses providers compete amongst themselves to attract eligible students and their guardians to sign up for their tutoring services during the process.as required by federal regulation,the prde initiates by compiling a roster of certified providers on its website for ses participants to evaluate.additionally,providers hold informational meetings,independently and through local schools,to describe the services that they will offer to students in the upcoming year.at the close of,guardians fill out a form ses to identify,in order of preference,the three ses providers with whom they would like their student to work.
finally,in the process,students are administered tests to assess their individual needs,which providers discuss with each student guardians.the guardians and a provider then submit a form ses to the prde,which memorializes their agreement as to that student needs and the services the provider will furnish to him or her.once the ses forms are approved,the prde executes a contract with the relevant provider and services ordinarily begin within two to four days.
this case concerns the commonwealth ses enrollment procedure for the academic year.as initially set forth by the prde,the entire process was to span no more than four months.it began on june,the deadline for submitting an rfq application,and ended on october,the date on which the prde would enter into an ses contract with the second provider identified on the form ses if the preferred provider had not begun administering tutoring services to the relevant student.
rocket learning submitted its certification proposal for the academic year on june.the ses manual in place at that time,the old manual,limited the kinds of prizes that providers could award to their students as gifts to medals,trophies,certificates,and educational materials,such as educational games,manipulative toys,books,and dictionaries,and prohibited the promotion of any gifts during the enrollment process.importantly,neither the old manual nor the rfq application required certification proposals to list specifically all electronic devices that would be used as part of a provider tutoring program 
the prde approved rocket learning certification proposal in august,and thereafter ses providers began promoting their services in anticipation of the process.despite the old manual restrictions,some ses providers sought to entice potential students during this period by offering electronic devices as gifts,making these providers more attractive.the ses providers organization to which most of the commonwealth ses providers belong,including the a letter to the prde informing it of these improper promotional activities and requesting that the agency enforce the old manual.
on september,defendant jesús rivera sánchez the secretary issued a superseding version of the ses manual,the new manual.the new manual required for the first time that all technological devices to be used in a provider teaching process be specified in its certification proposal.it also amended the old manual provision concerning gifts,first by explicitly stating that o ffering incentives during the enrollment process is strictly prohibited,and second by removing the sentence stating that the giving of a ny other article or gift not listed in the ses manual is strictly prohibited.notwithstanding these changes,the prde did not request that providers submit amended certification proposals consistent with the new manual.
the process took place between october and october.according to the complaint,approximately eight of the fifty participating ses providers disregarded the new manual prohibition on the promotion of electronic gifts.these organizations experienced considerable increases over their traditional enrollment numbers,while the remaining providers suffered corresponding enrollment decreases.following written protests and a demonstration at the prde headquarters,the secretary met on october,with some of the ses providers disadvantaged during this process.
the prde annulled the first period on november,and scheduled a second for december through december.on november,the prde circulated a questionnaire by email to a group of approximately ses providers to clarify the relationship between the electronic devices included or referred to in their respective original certification proposals and the provider instructional services.the prde technology and curriculum unit evaluated each organization answers to determine whether,for purposes of the ses manual,the technological devices in question constituted educational material that could be promoted during the enrollment process.rocket learning was not among the recipients of the november email,although its proposal did include as teaching materials the use of audiobooks,videos,and music requiring the use of electronic devices.
on december,two days before the start of the second period,the prde published a ad in a local newspaper notifying eligible students that they could retain any of the educational materials,including technological devices,that they used during the ses program.the prde also sent a december email instructing all certified providers that educational material specifically included in the provider certification proposal would not be considered an incentive or reward for purposes of compliance with the rules of the department of education,and therefore could be promoted and given away as gifts.
as a result of these various changes,only those providers that had received the november email were permitted to promote electronic devices during the december process.at the close of this process,rocket learning enrollment numbers had fallen by approximately fifty to sixty percent from the previous year.
within days,on december,rocket learning,along with four other ses providers collectively,plaintiffs,filed suit against the secretary,in his personal and official capacities,alleging that the prde had intentionally and arbitrarily favored a select number of certified providers during the ses enrollment process,depriving the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights to equal protection of the law,substantive and procedural due process,and commercial free speech.the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and monetary damages,pursuant to,and a declaratory judgment finding the secretary actions unconstitutional,pursuant to.
on the same day,the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,see.a,which was referred to a magistrate judge along with that part of the defendant motion to dismiss,filed on january,concerning the court subject matter jurisdiction.on february,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation advising the district court to deny both motions.in relevant part,the magistrate judge found that some of the plaintiffs,including rocket learning,had shown a likelihood of success on only their equal protection claim,but that a preliminary injunction was nonetheless inappropriate because the plaintiffs injuries arising from that claim were not irreparable.the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendations in full on march.
after the plaintiffs filed an amended on march,the defendant renewed his motion to dismiss under.b and b,arguing that the complaint failed to articulate a plausible claim for any of the alleged constitutional violations,declaratory and monetary relief against the secretary in his official capacity were barred by the eleventh amendment,and the secretary was entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffs individual capacity claims.the matter was again referred to the same magistrate judge.
on august,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation advising the district court to dismiss all except for the plaintiffs equal protection claim against the secretary in his personal capacity rocket learning,sánchez,civil fab,wl,at.after the parties filed their respective objections to the report and recommendation,the district court,on de novo review,issued an opinion and judgment on march,dismissing the complaint in its entirety.rocket learning,rivera sánchez,d.
contrary to the magistrate judge,the district court found that the plaintiffs failed to state an equal protection claim.specifically,the court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that they were similarly situated to the provider recipients of the november email that were allowed to promote electronic devices,id.at that there was no rational basis for the secretary actions,id.at and that the secretary possessed the requisite discriminatory intent to support an equal protection claim,id.at.additionally,because the plaintiffs failed to establish a viable equal protection claim,the district court found that the issue of qualified immunity was moot.id.at.this timely appeal followed.
rocket learning challenges only the district court dismissal of the three constitutional claims for money damages alleged as the basis for its action against the secretary in his personal capacity.we review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,accepting all facts as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.eldredge town of falmouth,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.
defendant asserts that the district court properly concluded that the complaint failed to allege any plausible constitutional violation.alternatively,the secretary argues that even if the complaint had done so,it was properly dismissed because he was entitled to qualified immunity.
in reviewing a rule b dismissal,we are not wedded to the district court rationale and may affirm on any basis made apparent from the record.cook gates,cir first alteration in original quoting mccloskey.mueller,cir see also uphoff figueroa alejandro,cir sutliffe epping sch,cir.we affirm on the ground that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity.see sanchez pereira castillo,cir beckles city of new york,app x,cir.
a.the doctrine of qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects a state official from liability for damages under where her conduct did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,see limone condon,cir.because the doctrine serves as an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.mitchell forsyth.accordingly,qualified immunity should be resolved at the earliest possible stage of litigation.maldonado fontanes,cir.
the procedure for assessing a plea of qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage is.see,feliciano hernández pereira castillo,cir eldredge,at.on the basis of the pleadings,we must decide whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged violation.maldonado,at quoting pearson callahan.
the clearly established inquiry,in turn,has two related aspects.one aspect focuses exclusively on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged violation.to overcome qualified immunity,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.alteration in original quoting anderson creigton.the other aspect considers the specific facts of the case at bar.the clearly established inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.brosseau haugen,quoting saucier katz,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,t he relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.maldonado,at first alteration in original emphasis added quoting brosseau,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in pearson callahan,the supreme court recognized that w hen qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage,the precise factual basis for the plaintiff claim or claims may be hard to identify.id.at.as such,federal courts have discretion to administer the components of the qualified immunity test in the order that they determine will best facilitate the fair and efficient disposition of each case.id.at.where the court can quickly and easily decide that there was no violation of clearly established law,it need not turn to the more difficult question of whether the relevant facts make out a constitutional question at all.id.at.
b.the equal protection claim 
rocket learning argues that the secretary violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by improperly favoring a select group of ses providers during the enrollment process specifically,the complaint asserts that,by way of the prde november and december emails,the secretary arbitrarily created two classes of otherwise similarly situated providers those permitted to promote and award electronic devices and those not so permitted.this classification,appellant contends,was wholly irrelevant to the purposes of the ses program and can not withstand even the lowest level of equal protection scrutiny 
the equal protection clause requires that all persons similarly situated be treated alike.city of cleburne cleburne living,see tapalian tusino,cir.accordingly,to establish a plausible equal protection claim,a plaintiff not relying on typically impermissible bases for classification,race,religion,must show that it was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated,that no rational basis exist ed for that difference in treatment,and that the different treatment was based on a malicious or bad faith intent to injure.buchanan maine,cir.
the district court concluded that rocket learning failed to state a plausible equal protection claim.we do not decide that question.rather,the appellant claim falters on the clearly established prong of the qualified immunity test.the record establishes that a reasonable official in the secretary position could have rationally concluded that his actions were consistent with the constitution.
at the time rocket learning submitted its ses proposal,the rfq application required providers to describe any teaching material s that they intended to use as part of their tutoring services,and the old manual,in turn,permitted these materials to be awarded as gifts.see supra note.on the secretary account,these rules promoted the prde legitimate interest in ensuring that guardians selected providers during based upon the merits of their educational services,rather than the quality of their giveaways.
when presented with allegations just weeks before the first process that some providers were violating these rules,the secretary set out to clarify the contours of the rules and to determine whether the allegations were true.the secretary invalidated the first round of and set up a second,creating time pressures on all,including himself,to conduct a new certification inquiry aimed at assessing which providers should be permitted to promote and award electronic devices as educational material s.
the secretary asserts that rocket learning was not among the recipients of the november email because it had not included the sorts of electronic devices in its certification proposal that warranted additional inquiry.although rocket learning proposal did indicate its intention to use music,videos,and audiobooks for some of its tutorial modules,it did not describe the types or quantities of technological devices that students would use to play these materials.for example,the defendant points out that since the use of one cd player is enough to provide music or to play the for a whole classroom,it would be unreasonable for the prde to assume that plaintiffs intended to give a cd player to each student.as such,the secretary did not view the plaintiffs as within the category intended to receive the email.
at first blush,the secretary explanation for his decision is not unreasonable.indeed,the district court concluded that the explanation was sufficient to establish that the plaintiffs had not shown themselves to be similarly situated to the recipients of the november email.rocket learning,d at.we agree that a reasonable official in the secretary position could think that the groups were not similarly situated.but even if we found that the groups were similarly situated,that would not,taken alone,defeat qualified immunity.
rocket learning was also required to show that,in misapplying the prohibitions in question,the secretary acted with a discriminatory purpose,which implies that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.pers.adm r of feeney.the appellant acknowledges that at this stage of the litigation,it has not uncovered the real motivation for the secretary purportedly irrational and discriminatory conduct.rocket learning,d at.instead,rocket learning asks the court to infer the existence of an improper motivation from the secretary rule changes and retroactive application of the new manual provisions.
the prde does not say that its administration of the ses enrollment process was ideal.however,these inadequacies existed against the backdrop of the exigent circumstances the secretary faced,the prde legitimate interest in enforcing the prohibitions in question,and the seemingly explanation that the secretary furnished for treating the appellant as he did.
this court has recognized that the faith standard should be scrupulously met,yerardi moody rest.lounge,bd.of selectmen of town of randolph,cir quoting leclair saunders,cir internal quotation mark omitted,and that cases satisfying this standard are infrequent,id.with this in mind,and in light of the idiosyncratic circumstances surrounding the ses enrollment process,we conclude that the appellant allegations were insufficient to show that the secretary actions violated clearly established law under the second prong of the qualified immunity test.
c.the procedural due process claim 
rocket learning also claims that the secretary violated the procedural component of the fourteenth amendment due process clause to establish a procedural due process violation,a plaintiff must show that it was deprived of a protected property interest,and the procedures attendant to that deprivation were constitutionally inadequate.see gonzález fuentes molina,cir marrero gutierrez molina,cir.
rocket learning asserts a property right,arising from its ses certification,to participate in a fair and process.the secretary is said to have deprived the appellant of this property interest without the process due by failing to provide the appellant with adequate notice of the changes regarding the prohibitions on promoting and awarding electronic devices or with an opportunity to challenge the allegedly discriminatory enforcement of these changes.see rocket learning,d at.
the district court rejected this claim,finding that,under puerto rico law,a bidder for a contract with the government does not acquire a property interest until the contract has been formalized.id.emphasis added.the district court relied on the supreme court of puerto rico decision in cancel municipio de san juan,offic.trans.there,an initially successful bidder for a government contract sought to enjoin the municipality of san juan from subsequently awarding that contract to another bidder.the court dismissed the case,holding that cancel had no claim to entitlement because an agency has the right to revoke the award of a contract at any time before the corresponding contract is entered into.id.at quoting cussiniano commonwealth.similarly,in the circumstances of this case,the prde would not enter into a contract with rocket learning until one or more students actually enrolled in its tutoring program,after the process was already completed.
rocket learning attempts to distinguish cancel,arguing that its ses certification is more akin to a license than a contract,and relying on a series of cases recognizing that a license may vest in its recipient a property interest in the rights granted therein.see,bell burson,gonzález droz gonzález colón,cir indus.safety equip.ass n,epa.this argument,not raised in the district court,see rocket learning,d at p laintiffs do not attempt to distinguish cancel from the situation before the court,is unpersuasive.
each of the cases cited involved a formally issued license or certification that unambiguously conferred some property interests to its owner.see,indus.safety,at there is no question that appellants possess cognizable property interests in their respirator certifications.additionally,in bell and gonzález droz,it was also clear that the state had deprived the plaintiff of the particular property interest at issue because the license had been revoked entirely.bell,at suspension of driver license gonzález droz,at suspension of medical license 
in contrast,rocket learning cites no authority treating ses certifications as licenses,let alone licenses conferring a property interest in a particular type of procedure.even if the appellant had done so,and had shown that the prde deprived it of this right there is nothing in the record to suggest that the process attendant to that deprivation fell short of any requirements announced under clearly established law.indeed,rocket learning offers no authority,either from the relevant case law or from the prde own publications concerning the ses program,announcing procedural guarantees in excess of those employed by the secretary 
since the property interest asserted here is dubious,and there has been no showing that the process attendant to its alleged deprivation was deficient,we conclude that the appellant allegations do not support a plausible due process claim as required under the first prong of the qualified immunity test.
d.the commercial speech claim 
we more quickly dispatch rocket learning remaining claim that the secretary violated its first amendment commercial
