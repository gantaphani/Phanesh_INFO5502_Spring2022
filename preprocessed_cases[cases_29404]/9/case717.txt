hee man chie,an,treated vickie lesley during her pregnancy in and.after lesley tested positive for hiv,chie ended up referring her to another hospital that,in his judgment,was better qualified to handle deliveries by patients.the baby was delivered there,safely and without hiv infection.
two years later,lesley sued chie for damages.the gist of her suit is that chie denied her treatment solely because she was,in violation of various disability discrimination laws.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of chie,from which lesley appeals.lesley chie,d.the case requires us to determine how far courts should defer to a doctor judgment as to the best course of treatment for a disabled patient in the context of discriminatory denial of treatment claims.we hold that the doctor judgment is to be given deference absent a showing by the plaintiff that the judgment lacked any reasonable medical basis.applying this standard to the case,we affirm.
the following facts are undisputed.
vickie lesley became pregnant in late.in december,she began seeing hee man chie for prenatal care.chie had been lesley gynecologist since.he had admitting privileges at leominster hospital,a community hospital in leominster,massachusetts,where lesley lived.
lesley advised chie of several preexisting medical conditions.she had diabetes insipidus,a seizure disorder,and a history of cervical dysplasia.she also suffered from manic depression,for which she took lithium.because lithium increases the risk of fetal heart abnormalities,chie ordered a fetal echocardiogram in early march.he also recommended,as he did routinely for his patients,that lesley be tested for human immunodeficiency virus hiv,the virus that causes aids.lesley tested positive for hiv.
while chie had treated patients with hiv in his gynecological practice,he had never delivered the baby of a woman with hiv.thus,before lesley appointment to discuss her test results,chie inquired about the proper treatment for pregnant women with hiv.
about a year earlier,in february,the national institutes of health nih had sponsored a clinical trial to administer the drug azt to pregnant women with hiv.the trial had three components.women took azt orally during pregnancy they then received it intravenously during labor and delivery and after birth,the newborn was given azt syrup.according to the results of the trial,the treatment reduced the risk of transmitting hiv to newborns from percent to percent.based on this success rate,the united states public health service published guidelines for administering azt during pregnancy in august.
in november,the massachusetts department of public health mdph mailed a clinical advisory to all obstetricians in the state.the clinical advisory reproduced the public health service guidelines for azt treatment,including a fixed dosage schedule for oral and intravenous administration.the advisory also urged doctors to discuss the treatment with their patients.in an amicus brief the mdph states it was the department of public health intent when it issued the clinical advisory that these established steps to prescribe and monitor azt be immediately implemented by any licensed obstetrician,including community obstetricians such as chie.the test for monitoring azt side effects is a complete blood count and liver function test.according to the mdph these two blood tests are regularly used by as part of prenatal care.chie in fact used the same tests to monitor the side effects of lesley medication.
at his deposition,chie said that he read the mdph clinical advisory when he received it in late.subsequently,after learning that lesley had tested positive for hiv,he called the leominster hospital pharmacy to determine whether azt was available for delivery,as the clinical advisory recommended.the advisory states consultation with the hospital pharmacist regarding zdv azt availability and drug preparations should be done prior to any projected need to avoid delay in initiating any part of this protocol.the pharmacy told chie that azt was not yet available,and that he would have to call leominster pharmaceutics therapy p t committee to get the drug approved.chie also called sheila noone,a nurse who coordinated the women and infants hiv program at worcester memorial hospital.the hiv program had been one of eight facilities nationwide to participate in the nih clinical trial of azt and served as a clinic for pregnant women with hiv,operating in conjunction with the university of massachusetts medical center,an academic teaching hospital.nurse noone discussed azt treatment with chie,and told him that he could either consult with her about lesley case,or enroll lesley in worcester memorial hiv program so that she could deliver her baby there.
on march,lesley and her husband met with chie.the doctor told them about the hiv program at worcester memorial and gave them nurse noone name and telephone number.chie told lesley he had no experience administering azt.lesley expressed confidence in his abilities and made a appointment for march.in the interim,she met with nurse noone and signed up for counseling and other support services offered by the hiv program,but planned to continue her prenatal care with chie and to deliver her baby at leominster.
before the appointment,chie contacted man,chairman of leominster p t committee,and asked for azt to be made available at the hospital pharmacy and for a protocol to be put in place for administering the drug intravenously at labor and delivery.such a protocol would have included notifying physicians that azt was available for use during pregnancy and delivery,and giving nurses training on the procedures for administering the drug.man assured chie that he would bring up approval of a protocol at the next p t committee meeting.
chie also spoke to other obstetricians at leominster,including the head of the department,schatz.none of the doctors with whom chie spoke had experience with hiv pregnancies or administering azt.schatz advised chie to consult with a perinatologist at worcester memorial about lesley,although he did not specifically recommend that she be transferred.chie also called lesley primary care doctor,fraser,explained the situation to him,and told fraser that,while he had not made up his mind,he probably would have to transfer lesley to worcester memorial,and in such case he would need fraser approval.around this same time,chie spoke further with nurse noone,who again offered either to serve as a consultant to chie in treating lesley or to help him arrange for a transfer.
on march,chie called the leominster pharmacy again to inquire whether azt had been made available.the pharmacy reported that it was still awaiting approval for the drug from the p t committee 
at lesley march appointment,chie told her he had decided to transfer her case to worcester memorial hiv program.chie march notes for lesley chart state discussed with patient azt program at umass.no azt program at l hosp.plan transfer patient to umhosp.chie said of his explanation to lesley 
i told her we do have azt program at leominster hospital i told her i talk to other obstetrician s,including schatz,and if anybody have experience but none of them has experience using the azt.i was looking for help.i have looked through all the books.i learn everything myself i have no experience using the azt,and i have no confidence of using the azt myself.but there a program in worcester,sheila noone,give us some report about how good the result after the trial of those azt medications.with that convincing result,sent her to the azt program.
in response,lesley told chie that she wanted to remain under his care and to give birth at leominster because it was her community hospital.lesley,herself a trained psychiatric nurse,said that all she needed for treatment was a prescription for oral azt,and an iv line for administering the drug during labor and delivery.she urged chie to consult with nurse noone at the hiv program and to get azt approved at leominster.chie refused to continue treating lesley.
lesley went to the hiv program at worcester memorial for her remaining prenatal visits.worcester memorial is located about minutes by car from leominster hospital and from lesley home.she delivered her baby there on july,five weeks before her due date.lesley acknowledges that she received satisfactory care from the hiv program.her baby tested negative for hiv at birth and in tests.
on march,lesley filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court against chie,stating that his decision to transfer her to the hiv program at worcester memorial rather than treat her himself violated her rights under of the rehabilitation act,the americans with disabilities act ada,and the massachusetts public accommodation statute.laws ch.chie removed the action to federal court on april.on june,the parties stipulated to dismissal of lesley ada claim.
in support of their for summary judgment on the remaining claims,both lesley and chie presented expert testimony.lesley expert,howard minkoff,served on the public health service task force that recommended azt therapy for pregnant women with hiv.in his sworn statement,minkoff said administering oral and intravenous azt during pregnancy and delivery was straightforward and did not require specialized knowledge beyond that possessed by a licensed practitioner of obstetrics.in minkoff opinion,t here is no medical basis for a licensed practitioner of obstetrics to refer an pregnant woman to a high risk clinic based on status alone.in its amicus brief,the mdph states its agreement with minkoff conclusions 
in support of chie,bruce cohen,a specialist in obstetrics,focused on lesley complex combination of psychiatric and medical problems.cohen said to have denied such a complicated and high risk patient as lesley the available quality care which the situation demanded would have been unethical.bonnie herr,a obstetrician,said that at the time chie transferred lesley,knowledge and experience in the management of pregnant patients among in the general medical community,outside of teaching centers was limited.howard heller,an associate physician at brigham women hospital,agreed that after publication of the mdph clinical advisory in november,it took several months for most hospitals and obstetricians to institute and implement azt treatment since it required a coordinated effort within each hospital and was not under the control of an individual obstetrician.because of the many components involved in azt treatment,and the lack of assurance that these components would be in place at leominster in time for lesley labor and delivery,it would have been medically inappropriate for chie to continue treating lesley,heller said.
on january,on from the parties,the district court granted summary judgment for chie.the court found that lesley had presented no evidence that chie decision to transfer lesley to worcester memorial hiv program was medically inappropriate under the totality of the circumstances.hence the court found that the doctor decision did not constitute discrimination solely on the basis of hiv status.

we dispose of some preliminaries.section of the rehabilitation act provides that 
no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance 
a.thus,to prevail on her claim,lesley must prove four elements.she must show that she is disabled that she sought services from a federally funded entity that she was otherwise qualified to receive those services and that she was denied those services solely by reason of her disability.
the parties do not dispute the first two elements.lesley status is a disability for purposes of the act.bragdon abbott,d.chie receipt of medicaid funds makes him a federally funded entity for purposes of the act.see lesley,d at.the parties do dispute the third element,whether lesley was otherwise qualified to receive the services she sought.but we do not address this issue as we resolve the case based on the fourth element.
the essential question is whether plaintiff evidence presents a triable issue as to whether she was denied treatment solely by reason of her disability.lesley characterizes chie decision to transfer her as a discriminatory act cloaked as an exercise of medical judgment.she argues that the testimony of her experts demonstrates that chie was perfectly competent to treat her,implying that the claimed medical basis for his decision was pretextual.in mirror fashion,chie characterizes lesley suit as an attack on his medical judgment,thinly veiled as a disability discrimination claim.he argues that the rehabilitation act was never intended to interfere with bona fide medical judgments as to how best to treat a patient with a disability.thus,this case requires us to explore the extent to which the rehabilitation act contemplates judicial scrutiny of alleged exercises of medical judgment 
we start with the obvious the rehabilitation act does not bar a doctor from referring a disabled patient elsewhere simply because the medical reasons for the referral are related to the patient disability.it would be nonsensical,and downright contrary to the purposes of the statute,to read the statute solely because of language to prohibit medical treatment that is appropriate solely because of a patient disability as congress made clear in the legislative history of the americans with disabilities act,the disability laws are not intended to prevent a physician from referring a disabled patient if the disability itself creates specialized complications for the patient health which the referring physician lacks the experience or knowledge to address,pt,at,reprinted in,see also katz city metal,cir section of the rehabilitation act is interpreted substantially identically to the ada.
what is not as clear,and what is at issue in this case,is the extent to which a court should defer to a physician claim that he lacks the experience,knowledge,or other prerequisites necessary to address the medical conditions that allegedly prompted his referral.two countervailing concerns bear on the question.
on the one hand,courts can not simply defer unquestioningly to a physician subjective judgment as to whether his referral was proper.physicians,of course,are just as capable as any other recipient of federal funds of discriminating against the disabled,and courts may not turn a blind eye to the possibility that a supposed exercise of medical judgment may mask discriminatory motives or stereotypes.see glanz vernick,a strict rule of deference would enable doctors to offer merely pretextual medical opinions to cover up discriminatory decisions.cook rhode island,cir employer subjective judgment that disabled plaintiff was not qualified for job insufficient to thwart liability.
on the other hand,courts should not probe so far into a doctor referral decision as to inquire whether it was the correct or best decision under the circumstances,or even whether it met the standard of care for the profession.lest questions of medical propriety be conflated with questions of disability discrimination,it must take more than a mere negligent referral to constitute a rehabilitation act violation.were the act construed otherwise,so as effectively to impose on physicians a special,duty of care,physicians would face potentially conflicting state and federal legal obligations.that is,to avoid state malpractice liability,a physician might wish to err on the side of caution by referring a patient with complications to a better qualified specialist or more advanced facility yet under the rehabilitation act,as hypothetically construed,the physician who did so would risk being found liable for discrimination.we can not believe that congress would have intended the act to so interfere with the relationship,especially when that relationship is thoroughly regulated by the states bowen am.hosp,d rehabilitation act does not envision federal superintendence of treatment decisions traditionally entrusted to state governance bryant madigan,cir the ada does not create a remedy for medical malpractice.
avoiding both a rule giving physicians complete deference and a rule requiring a inquiry into their diligence,we head for the middle ground and adopt the following standard.under the rehabilitation act,a patient may challenge her doctor decision to refer her elsewhere by showing the decision to be devoid of any reasonable medical support.this is not to say,however,that the rehabilitation act prohibits unreasonable medical decisions as such.rather,the point of considering a medical decision reasonableness in this context is to determine whether the decision was unreasonable in a way that reveals it to be discriminatory.in other words,a plaintiff showing of medical unreasonableness must be framed within some larger theory of disability discrimination.for example,a plaintiff may argue that her physician decision was so the sense of being arbitrary and to imply that it was pretext for some discriminatory motive,such as animus,fear,or apathetic attitudes.alexander choate,d see,howe hull,under ada,jury could find doctor diagnosis that plaintiff had extremely rare disorder requiring transfer was pretextual,where patient only had an allergic drug reaction,and doctor did not mention the rare disorder in requesting the transfer but only mentioned plaintiff.or,instead of arguing pretext,a plaintiff may argue that her physician decision was discriminatory on its face,because it rested on stereotypes of the disabled rather than an individualized inquiry into the patient hence was unreasonable in that sense.see,sumes andres,issuing summary judgment against doctor who refused to treat deaf patient on ground that all deaf people are high risk,without making any inquiry regarding her specific condition.
lesley does not come close to making either form of showing lesley argues that chie decision to transfer her was so lacking in any reasonable medical support as to suggest it was pretext for discrimination.but any claim that chie sought to hide some discriminatory motive is belied by the fact that chie had knowingly treated other patients in the past likewise,he continued to treat lesley for some time after learning she was.see johnson thompson,cir if others with the same handicap do not suffer the discrimination,then the discrimination does not result solely by reason of the handicap.nor can lesley plausibly claim that chie transferred her on the basis of stereotypes concerning her status.chie did not abruptly assume that delivering the baby of an patient was beyond his capability he came to that conclusion based upon a and individualized inquiry.cook,at quoting school board of nassau cty.arline,d.moreover,his decision was confirmed at the time by fraser,lesley primary care physician and managed care gatekeeper,who had to approve lesley transfer and the decision was also confirmed by nurse noone,who from the start suggested referral as a perfectly acceptable treatment option available to chie the combination of these.chie demonstrated willingness to treat patients he felt competent to treat,and the fact that his decision not to treat lesley was made pursuant to an individualized inquiry and was confirmed by independent,knowledgeable persons at the it impossible for lesley to succeed in showing that chie decision was discriminatory.
even putting aside chie demonstrated willingness to treat other patients,lesley insistence that chie proffered medical justification for transferring her was so unreasonable as to imply it was pretext does not find sufficient support in the evidence.lesley points to the mdph clinical advisory as evidence that the prevailing medical opinion at the time was that any licensed obstetrician was capable of administering azt.as proof of the same point,she invokes the testimony of her expert,minkoff,in whose opinion the administration of azt during pregnancy and delivery does not require any specialized knowledge beyond that of an ordinary obstetrician.
it is true that in bragdon abbott,supra,the supreme court accorded special weight and authority to the view of public health officials in determining whether a medical provider could permissibly refuse to treat an patient,where the provider feared for his health.see at.see also b nothing in the ada shall require an entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the accommodations of such entity where such individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.however,even in that context,the court emphasized that a provider deviation from the prevailing medical consensus is entitled to deference so long as it rests on a credible scientific basis,a standard substantially similar to the one adopted here.
but more importantly,we do not believe that the court remarks in bragdon carry over to the present context.at issue in bragdon was whether there existed a direct threat to the health of others.the direct threat defense may be claimed in all sorts of employers,educators,and so on.in bragdon,the court simply made clear that physicians have no special privilege to use the defense as an impenetrable shield.see at.p etitioner receives no special deference simply because he is a health care professional.by contrast,here what is at issue is not the health of others but the health of the patient herself.that is a matter uniquely entrusted to the care of her physician.in order to protect the professional autonomy of the physician in administering that care,it is necessary to defer to the physician reasoned judgment.a physician mere disagreement with prevailing medical opinion thus can not serve as grounds for an inference of discrimination.only where the physician judgment is entirely without any reasonable medical basis may such an inference be warranted 
lesley evidence of prevailing medical opinion does not suffice to show that chie decision lacked any reasonable medical basis.the evidence proffered merely goes toward proving that in,as a general matter,a licensed obstetrician would have been competent to administer azt to an patient.however,as bragdon itself demonstrates,statements of prevailing medical opinion should not be read so broadly as to sweep factors under the rug.see at.statement advising that certain precautions should reduce the risk of disease transmission in the dental environment did not rule out possibility that additional precautions sought by defendant could reduce risk further.while it may have been generally true at the time that a licensed obstetrician could administer azt to an patient,nothing said by the mdph or minkoff suggests that an obstetrician referral of such a patient would have been inherently unreasonable 
rather,reasonableness depends on the circumstances,and here a number of circumstances supported chie judgment to transfer lesley elsewhere.first,despite its endorsement by the mdph,intravenous administration of azt during delivery was still a recent development in obstetrics with which chie reasonably felt unfamiliar as nurse noone testified in deposition,things were changing pretty quickly back in those days it was that point,this was all very new second,chie had reason to worry that leominster hospital would not be adequately prepared and equipped to administer azt in time for lesley delivery as of march,the date of chie referral,when lesley was at weeks gestation and at significant risk for premature delivery,azt had yet to be made available to leominster pharmacy and a protocol for administering the drug had yet to be put in place.third,worcester memorial was close by and as one of eight clinics nationally to participate in the study on which the mdph clinical advisory was based,it obviously could be trusted to provide lesley a high level of care 
in these circumstances,even if chie decision stemmed from an overabundance of caution,by no means can the decision be thought to lack any reasonable medical basis.the decision was simply a reasoned medical judgment with which the patient disagreed.as to such disagreements,when they warrant litigation,state medical malpractice law,not the rehabilitation act,provides the appropriate law of resort.that lesle
