this is an interlocutory appeal from a preliminary injunction issued in favor of plaintiff iván díaz carrasquillo,who sued the governor of puerto rico and other officials for attempting to oust him from his job as the advocate for persons with disabilities in august.the defendants argue that díaz job was abolished by a legislative act.after review of the record and the relevant laws,we find that the injunction was improvidently granted and vacate the district court order 
background 
in,the puerto rico legislature passed law,creating the office of the ombudsman for persons with disabilities.the ombudsman was declared the director or first executive officer of the office.the governor appointed the ombudsman,set his salary,and could terminate him at will.law was amended by act of,noting that the ombudsman,while still appointed by the governor with the senate advice and consent,would serve a term so as not to be subject to the changes of public administration that occur as part of the electoral process every four years.
in june,the legislature passed reorganization plan,which subsequently was signed into law by governor fortuño.the plan repealed law and created an umbrella administration for advocate offices under which were four advocates offices disabilities,health,retirees and the elderly,and veterans.the disabilities advocate was appointed by the governor with senate advice and consent for a term,and could be removed only for malfeasance in office as determined by the governor after notice and hearing.
governor fortuño appointed díaz to the position of disabilities advocate on november,there is nothing in the record to suggest that díaz performance was unsatisfactory in any way.
defendant garcía was elected governor in november.in july,act was enacted into law this act which contained a lengthy preamble explaining why the reorganization plan was a failure repealed the reorganization plan.on the same day,act again established an office of the ombudsman for persons with disabilities of the commonwealth of puerto rico.the governor was given the power to appoint the ombudsman to a term,removable upon notice and hearing for negligence in office.

from the entry into force of this act,all documents,records,materials and equipment and the funds allocated to the office of ombudsman for persons with disabilities under reorganization plan shall be transferred to the office of the ombudsman of persons with disabilities of puerto rico,created under this act.similarly,any state or federal funds received by the office from the agencies which are used for the services offered by this office shall be reversed and shall be transferred to this office through the accounts in the department of treasury and the omb,as applicable.

on august,díaz was informed that,pursuant to acts and,an acting ombudsman for persons with disabilities had been appointed and that,pursuant to the same acts,his position advocate had been abolished.the letter from the governor referred to his position as former office of ombudsman.this suit followed.
ii.district court proceedings 
on august,díaz filed suit against governor garcía and others.he sought declaratory,monetary and injunctive relief based on three causes of action political discrimination in violation of lack of due process in terminating him from a job in which he held a property right and negligence under puerto rico article.at roughly the same time,díaz filed an urgent motion seeking temporary restraining order and injunction.after a series of orders,the district court dismissed the claims for monetary damages.on september,the district court granted the restraining order the court did not reach the issue of whether the legislature had abolished the plaintiff job,and thus never reached defendants central argument that the plaintiff was asking the court to interfere with the responsibility of the executive branch to execute validly enacted legislation.instead,citing humphrey ex r united states,and morrison olson,the district court framed the issue as a removal of a political appointee,and found that because díaz position was,he could only be terminated for cause and after a hearing.
the defense responding to the district court tack,but not abandoning its thesis that the position had been abolished relied principally on gómez negrón fernández,which held that the legislature has the virtually unfettered power to abolish a position with the holder of the old job not entitled to the new one.
in considering the request for an injunction,the district court was tasked with determining the movant likelihood of success on the merits whether and to what extent the movant would suffer irreparable harm if the request were rejected the balance of hardships between the parties and any effect that the injunction or its denial would have on the public interest.corporate,harnett,cir.despite expressing uncertainty as to the status of puerto rico law,the court ultimately found that díaz had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits by showing that in many ways his job functions are,mostly akin to the power of administrative law judges to enforce disability laws and penalize violators.the court found irrevocable harm in the fact that,in the absence of an injunction,the plaintiff would be removed from his job.in balancing hardships,the court ruled that the defendants showed no reason why keeping díaz in the job would be a hardship when compared to his removal.finally,the court observed that maintaining the status quo was in the public interest.it also certified to the puerto rico supreme court the question of whether to classify díaz job as or,explaining that it harbors serious reservations about the state of puerto rico law.
iii.analysis

here,we find that the district court ignored a material factor deserving significant weight indeed the central thesis of appellant argument.that is,the plaintiff position as advocate for persons with disabilities was abolished in when law explicitly repealed reorganization plan of and law created the office of ombudsman for persons with disabilities.as such,we further find that the court erred in finding that díaz had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits,the sine qua non of th e inquiry.new comm wireless,at.
díaz does not argue that the legislature lacked the power to abolish his advocate position.instead,he disputes the existence of that historical fact.specifically,he claims that the legislative history does not evince an in
