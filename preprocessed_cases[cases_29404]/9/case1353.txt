a jury in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue,awarded in emotional distress damages on the claim of georgiann alfano that during her employment as a corrections officer she experienced a hostile work environment amounting to unlawful sex discrimination under et seq title vii.alfano unlawful termination claim was dismissed and her disparate treatment claim was dismissed at the close of evidence.her employer,defendant new york state department of correctional services docs,timely moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing 
that the jury should not have been permitted to consider,for purposes of assessing the hostile work environment claim,certain incidents of alleged harassment that the district court,in earlier dismissing alfano disparate treatment claim,ruled were not motivated by animus 
that the remaining incidents of harassment,while concededly,were insufficiently numerous and significant as a matter of law to support a hostile work environment claim and 
that the evidence of emotional distress was too vague and conclusory to support the requisite finding of concrete harm that it consisted entirely of alfano own uncorroborated testimony and that it failed to link any emotional distress to the workplace conduct of which alfano had complained.
on docs motion,the district court decided that the incidents ruled immaterial to the disparate treatment claim were properly submitted for the jury consideration of the hostile work environment claim did not reach,therefore,the issue of whether the remaining incidents were alone sufficient to support the finding of a hostile work environment and ruled that the evidence of emotional distress was sufficient to support the award of damages.
docs now appeals the final judgment awarding alfano compensatory damages.alfano the dismissal of her claim that her employment termination constituted unlawful discrimination.
we conclude that the evidence at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to establish a hostile work environment under title vii.accordingly,we reverse the judgment without reaching the distinct issue of whether alfano adduced sufficient evidence of emotional distress.and we affirm the dismissal,as,of the claim that her termination from docs constituted unlawful sex discrimination.
background 
employment history 
docs hired alfano in this lawsuit concerns her employment from through mid as a sergeant at docs midstate correctional facility midstate,a medium security prison in marcy,new york,housing approximately male inmates.
twelve incidents,between december and february,were laid before the jury in connection with alfano claim that her work environment was permeated by hostility based on sex.
four of those incidents had an overtly sexual overtone that is,a jury could conclude that she was made the object of some embarrassment or humiliation aimed at her as a woman 
in the fall of,captain william fenton told alfano that she should not eat carrots,bananas,hot dogs or ice cream on the job because she did so in a seductive manner.fenton explained that he had been told by lieutenant michael brown about an witnessed by which alfano allegedly simulated oral sex with a carrot in the midstate dining area.
in december,alfano discovered in her workplace mailbox a carrot and two potatoes put there by someone who had the idea of arranging them to suggest male genitalia.her discovery was made in the presence of ten to fifteen fellow employees.alfano reported the incident to her watch commander on that occasion either brown or james deering.deering testified that he laughed at the incident.
on february,a spurious notice was posted in the visiting room and perhaps was handed to alfano,purporting to be signed by midstate superintendent,stating that c arrots will not be allowed in the visiting area due to alfano strong liking for them.if they are diced up,it will be okay.
in february,alfano found in her mailbox a cartoon depicting an officer under her supervision,anthony farda,making vulgar sexual remarks.alfano had previously been allegedly inappropriate physical contact with officer farda while on duty.
the remaining eight incidents cited by alfano are administrative and personnel decisions as to which she claims she was treated unfairly because she is a woman.it appears that these eight incidents are the ones that the district court ruled could not support the disparate treatment claim 
in december,brown caused to be placed in alfano personnel file a memorandum detailing alfano verbal abuse of brown,her superior officer.without challenging the substance of the incident recounted in the memo,alfano showed that in violation of docs policy brown failed to give alfano notice that this document was to be placed in her file.alfano discovered the memo in december,and it was promptly removed at her request.
brown gave alfano overall ratings of good on her annual performance evaluations in january and january,even though as the jury could find she deserved higher ratings.these two evaluations are counted as two incidents.alfano contested the january evaluation on the ground that brown had supervised her for only two months in.docs ordered that the evaluation be redone by all three of alfano supervisors including brown,but brown apparently redid it by himself in april the evaluation remained good,and alfano evidently did not appeal it though she submitted a letter indicating disagreement.alfano appealed the january evaluation,and her rating was changed to excellent.the january evaluation was not contested brown had rated alfano excellent.
in october,a person visiting an inmate made an obscene gesture at alfano.alfano reported this to brown,who issued a warning to the visitor.alfano had expected that brown would order the visitor removed forthwith,and contended at trial that allowing the visit to continue undermined her authority.
in december,alfano apparently left her post for three hours to do paperwork in an employee workroom.docs personnel practice is to deal with minor performance problems orally without a written memorandum in an informal counseling conducted by the supervisor,and to deal with more serious or repeated misconduct in a formal counseling that results in a memorandum that remains in the personnel file for at least a year.alfano preparation of paperwork in the employee workroom drew a formal counseling from brown.other officers had committed that offense though none was absent from post for as long as three hours,and they had been reprimanded for being in that room for that purpose,but according to alfano,she was the only one who was formally counseled for that offense.
in december,alfano angrily slapped papers onto deering desk in the presence of other officers,which precipitated an informal counseling by deering.alfano contended that the informal counseling was improperly done because deering invited a captain and a union representative to be present,and caused a memorandum of the event to placed in alfano personnel file.
in december,brown investigated alfano for inappropriate physical contact with a subordinate.in one incident,alfano exchanged a brief kiss with officer farda in the other,alfano having a bandaged finger asked farda to help her remove a dollar bill from her front pocket.the record as to what happened and when is a bit murky alfano contended at trial that the investigation was unwarranted because the contact was innocuous.
finally,alfano contended that brown made it difficult for her to resolve building maintenance problems the only incident cited was alfano recollection undated that she had been required once to fill out a formal request form in order to fix a ventilation problem,whereas she heard that male sergeants were permitted to handle maintenance issues more informally.
for reasons that ultimately are not relevant on appeal,alfano received a notice of discipline in may,was placed on administrative leave in july,was suspended without pay on august,and was later terminated.
procedural history 
on february,alfano filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the new york state division of human rights,charging docs and certain individual defendants with sex discrimination and sexual harassment.the eeoc issued a letter in august.alfano commenced this action on november.
the complaint alleged federal and state law claims against docs and against docs officials in their individual capacities.on october,the district court pooler,granted in part the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,dismissing all of the individual defendants from the federal title vii claims,and dismissing some claims altogether as by reason of alfano failure to exhaust administrative remedies.alfano costello.among the latter was alfano claim that her suspension without pay in august constituted unlawful sex discrimination that allegation was not in the eeoc complaint and the court ruled was not reasonably related to any of the allegations that were.id.at.alfano is limited to the dismissal of this claim.
alfano title vii claim alleged sex discrimination under two theories disparate treatment and hostile work environment.her trial evidence consisted of the twelve incidents set out above,as well as her testimony that the discrimination she suffered had caused her to suffer emotional distress.her testimony on emotional distress was of two kinds in describing each incident,she typically testified that she had been upset or embarrassed,or had wept in frustration or embarrassment second,she described more generally how her mental state and her life had been affected,she became a basket case,she lost her husband,her relationship with her son changed,she lost sleep,she gained pounds,she was driven to seek psychiatric care,and she was prescribed an.
at the conclusion of alfano,docs moved pursuant to.a for judgment as a matter of law on both the disparate treatment claim and the hostile work environment claim.the district court reserved decision.at the close of all the evidence,upon renewed motion,the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing the disparate treatment claim.in so doing,the court ruled that the incidents relied upon by alfano individually and in the aggregate did not amount to an adverse employment action as required to establish disparate treatment under title vii,and that even if alfano could demonstrate an adverse employment action,she had come nowhere near raising an inference of discriminatory motive as to each incident because she failed to show that similarly situated male employees received more favorable treatment in each situation of which she complains.
the parties subsequently stipulated to dismiss the state law claims in exchange for extending the relevant time period back to january thus,the sole claim to reach the jury was alfano title vii hostile work environment claim against docs.
over docs objection,the district court allowed the jury to consider all twelve of the incidents cited by alfano in assessing the hostile work environment claim,including those the court had ruled insufficient as a matter of law to support alfano disparate treatment claim.
the jury found in favor of alfano on the hostile work environment claim and awarded in compensatory damages for emotional distress.
docs moved for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative for a new trial,arguing inter alia that the evidence was insufficient as to both liability and damages.the motion was denied.docs timely appealed.alfano the earlier order dismissing her claim that the notice of discipline in may and her august suspension constituted sex discrimination.
discussion 
alfano pleaded both discrimination theories available under title vii disparate treatment or quid pro quo discrimination and hostile work environment.the district court dismissed the disparate treatment claim at the close of evidence a ruling not challenged on appeal on the ground that the eight personnel actions raise no inference that could support a recovery on that theory.on appeal,docs challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced to demonstrate a hostile work environment,chiefly on the theory that if the eight personnel actions could not support the inference of disparate treatment,they should have been excluded from the jury consideration of the hostile work environment claim.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support an inference that alfano suffered a hostile work environment but as a preliminary matter,we reject docs argument that evidence excluded as insufficient to support an inference of disparate treatment must necessarily be excluded from consideration of a hostile work environment claim.
governing legal principles 
a disparate treatment claim requires a showing of an adverse employment action either because of gender or because a sexual advance was made by a supervisor and rejected.kotcher rosa sullivan appliance,cir.an adverse employment action may or may not entail economic loss,but there must be a link between the discrimination and some tangible job benefits such as compensation,terms,conditions or privileges of employment.karibian columbia,cir.
a hostile work environment claim requires a showing that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,and that a specific basis exists for imputing the objectionable conduct to the employer.perry ethan allen,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff must show that the workplace was so severely permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that the terms and conditions of her employment were thereby altered.leibovitz city transit,cir citing meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d brennan metro.opera ass n,cir.this test has objective and subjective elements the misconduct shown must be severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment,and the victim must also subjectively perceive that environment to be abusive.harris forklift,d.as a general rule,incidents must be more than episodic they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive.perry,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.isolated acts,unless very serious,do not meet the threshold of severity or pervasiveness.brennan,at see also faragher city of boca raton,d noting that w e have made it clear that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment.but it is well settled in this circuit that even a single act can meet the threshold if,by itself,it can and does work a transformation of the plaintiff workplace.see,howley town of stratford,cir vile and sexually explicit verbal abuse of a female firefighter that challenged her competence,was witnessed by a large group that included her subordinates,and created a justified fear that she would be left in peril at fire scenes richardson state dep t of corr,cir observing that a single sexual assault may be sufficient to alter the terms and conditions of the victim employment.
in short,a plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment must demonstrate either that a single incident was extraordinarily severe,or that a series of incidents were sufficiently continuous and concerted to have altered the conditions of her working environment.cruz coach stores,cir quoting perry,at.to decide whether the threshold has been reached,courts examine the circumstances in their totality and evaluate the severity,frequency,and degree of the abuse.harris,at.relevant factors include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance see also cruz,at.
finally,it is axiomatic that in order to establish a hostile work environment under title vii,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct occurred because of her sex.brown henderson,cir richardson,at same as to racial discrimination.
admissibility of the personnel actions 
docs argues that,because the district court properly ruled that the eight personnel actions could not support the claim for disparate treatment,the court erred in permitting the jury to consider them in deciding whether alfano suffered a hostile work environment,and that the remaining four incidents which do have sexual overtones are too few and far apart to support the verdict.
docs argument misstates the district court rulings,confuses the two kinds of title vii claims,and depends on the idea that the ruling on disparate impact was it may have been,though its soundness need not be decided because no appeal was taken from that ruling 
the district court dismissed alfano disparate treatment claim on two grounds first,that alfano had pointed to no negative consequences or tangible harm flowing from any of the incidents,such as demotion,suspension,loss of wages or other disadvantaging results tr,so that the incidents could not,individually or in the aggregate,amount to an adverse employment action tr.and second,that she failed to prove that a discriminatory motive infected all of those incidents because 
w here discriminatory motive is to be proved by evidence of disparate treatment,the plaintiff must demonstrate that employees who are similarly situated in all material respects received more favorable treatment,
and alfano did not.tr.
after that ruling,docs argued that in deciding the hostile work environment claim,the jury should not be allowed to consider the nonsexual events.tr.the district court rejected that argument,and listed for the jury all twelve incidents on which alfano was relying.tr.the jury was instructed that with respect to the requirements for a hostile work environment claim,y ou may consider any unequal treatment of the plaintiff that would not occur but for her gender,and that it is not enough for plaintiff to prove that she was subjected to harassment.plaintiff must also demonstrate that the harassing conduct was prompted by gender.tr.
although we conclude ultimately that alfano failed to demonstrate a hostile work environment,we reject as the district court rejected the argument that such a claim can be supported only by overtly sexual incidents.there is little question that incidents that are facially may sometimes be used to establish a course of example,where the same individual is accused of multiple acts of harassment,some overtly sexual and some not.see,raniola bratton,cir howley,at.
docs argues,however,that once the district court determined that certain incidents were free of animus as a matter of law,the jury should not have been allowed to consider them as part of a course of conduct tending to show a hostile work environment.this argument fundamentally misapprehends what the district court did.under either theory disparate treatment or hostile work environment,a plaintiff must prove that she was singled out for mistreatment because of her sex.as the district court properly noted,however,the two theories differ in pleading and in proof.the disparate treatment theory requires a finding that similarly situated people of the other sex were treated more favorably.alfano failure to make that showing precluded a recovery under a disparate treatment theory.for the purpose of that ruling,the district court had no need to decide whether any or all of the eight personnel actions were free of animus as a matter of law,and the record reflects no such ruling 
thus,the district court determined that a jury could reasonably conclude that alfano had been singled out for mistreatment because of her sex even in incidents as to which there was no showing that men were treated differently.this is a logical possibility that the law acknowledges by creating two separate theories of recovery.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we conclude that the twelve incidents cited by alfano,taken together,are insufficient as a matter of law to meet the threshold of severity or pervasiveness required for a hostile work environment,and that the district court therefore should have granted docs motion for judgment as a matter of law.as noted earlier,this determination can be made only by carefully examining the circumstances in their totality,weighing the nature,severity,and frequency of the conduct.
in deciding whether the threshold has been met,we are guided by recent case law on hostile work environment claims in this circuit and others.preliminarily,however,a review of the incidents relied upon by alfano reveals that fewer than half provide any support for her claim.
several must be removed from the equation at the outset because they support no inference of mistreatment.two are the good evaluations rather than excellent given by brown in january and by brown and deering in january.although alfano cites these disappointing ratings as abuse that was nonsexual in nature but was nonetheless directed towards alfano because of her sex,she has pointed to no resulting disadvantage or adverse effect on her job performance.and there is no way to read these evaluations as part of a pattern of mistreatment,because brown rated her excellent in.
just as insubstantial is brown treatment of a prison visitor who made an obscene gesture at alfano.alfano claims that brown should have ejected the visitor forthwith,and that his decision instead to warn the visitor undermined alfano authority.but there is nothing in the record to indicate that brown warning was intended to undermine alfano,that it was unreasonably indulgent under the circumstances especially considering the interests of the inmate,or that it deviated from ordinary practice.
alfano also cites her difficulty not experienced by male peers in getting action on her requests for routine maintenance.alfano recalled one occasion on which she apparently was required to fill out paperwork for maintenance that she heard male could arrange less formally.this is essentially a complaint that alfano supervisors made it more difficult for her to do her job,and,if reasonably substantiated,it might be marginally relevant to her hostile work environment claim.but it is unsubstantiated.the requirement that alfano fill out paperwork was consistent with what she testified was normal policy or practice,and her testimony that maintenance requests by male peers were more easily in conclusory terms without corroborating insufficient to support a finding that docs imposed a burden on her because she was a woman.
of the twelve incidents,therefore,four the two good evaluations,the maintenance problems,and brown allegedly inadequate punishment of a prison visitor are of no weight whatsoever.this leaves four facially incidents the december memo improperly placed in alfano personnel file by brown the december formal counseling by brown the late investigation concerning alfano and officer farda and the december informal counseling by deering,as well as the four incidents with sexual overtones the three incidents in late and early,and the graphic cartoon in early.
several more of these must be removed from consideration,however,because even though they can support an inference that alfano was mistreated,they do not support an inference that this was because of her sex.one caveat in concluding that certain incidents must be excluded from consideration,we do not cast doubt on the rulings that admitted those incidents into evidence.at issue here is docs motion at the close of evidence for judgment as a matter of law under.in a hostile work environment case,it may well be a proper exercise of the district court broad discretion to allow the plaintiff to build her case partly by adducing incidents for which the link to any discriminatory motive may,in the first instance,appear tenuous or nonexistent.the plaintiff must,however,establish at trial that incidents apparently were in fact motivated by bias.thus,at the close of her case,to the extent that the plaintiff relies on facially neutral incidents to create the quantum of proof necessary to survive a rule motion for judgment,she must have established a basis from which a reasonable could infer that those incidents were infected by discriminatory animus.that is the burden alfano failed to carry with regard to a number of incidents here.
some of the incidents in this case lend themselves to a distinction,which often is dim,between incidents having an overtly sexual tone such as demeaning advances and humiliations that depend upon or are sharpened by one sex,and personnel decisions that lack earmarks of bias earmarks such as unreasonable actions taken by persons shown to have engaged in incidents having an overtly sexual element,or a peculiar enforcement of personnel rules correlated somehow with the claimed ground of discrimination.
everyone can be characterized by sex,race,ethnicity,or real or perceived disability and many bosses are harsh,unjust,and rude.it is therefore important in hostile work environment cases to exclude from consideration personnel decisions that lack a linkage or correlation to the claimed ground of discrimination.otherwise,the federal courts will become a court of personnel appeals.see,byrnie bd.of,cir the court role is to prevent unlawful hiring practices,not to act as a superpersonnel department that second guesses employers business judgments.quoting simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also rojas florida,cir federal courts are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.instead,our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,many personnel decisions can be ascribed to discrimination no matter what the supervisor does.thus,it is easy to claim animus whether a supervisor resorts to counseling if this is seen as a form of discipline or not if lack of guidance is deemed to set up an employee for harsher discipline.similarly,it is easy to ascribe animus whether an employer prepares a memo after an event of discipline if the memo is deemed an escalation in severity or not if the failure to prepare a memo is deemed a.and an employer investigation of an anonymous or disputed act of discrimination can be deemed to prolong and amplify the victim humiliation,or the failure to investigate may be deemed a.
keeping these considerations in mind,we see that the majority of incidents cited by alfano are on their face.facially neutral incidents may be included,of course,among the totality of the circumstances that courts consider in any hostile work environment claim,so long as a reasonable could conclude that they were,in fact,based on sex.but this requires some circumstantial or other basis for inferring that incidents on their face were in fact discriminatory.compare howley,at holding that could reasonably infer that facially incidents were where the perpetrator had previously made sexually derogatory statements,and williams motors,cir where plaintiff was ostracized on multiple occasions,the use of slurs in some incidents justified the inference that all of the incidents were,allowing the facially neutral incidents to be considered in hostile work environment analysis,with bowman shawnee state,cir objectionable but facially behavior by one person could not be considered in hostile work environment claim where there was no evidence of that person bias.
most of the incidents cited by alfano involve brown.but there is nothing in the record to indicate that brown unfairness if any was motivated by alfano sex.notably,all of the incidents involving brown were facially the memorandum placed in alfano personnel file the merely good evaluations the warning to the prison visitor the formal counseling and the investigation in concerning alfano and officer farda.nor are there circumstances from which a reasonably could infer sexual animus on brown part.alfano makes much of brown admission at trial that he disliked alfano personally,but there is no indication that he disliked her because she was a deering,for example,who testified that he had believed early in his career that women were unsuited to be corrections officers.nor does the record show that brown was involved in the anonymous cartoon incident or the carrot incidents which consisted of one objectionable conversation with captain fenton,one anonymous note posted in the cafeteria,and the anonymous incident with the carrot and potatoes.fenton did testify that it was brown who told him that alfano had been seen by someone else allegedly simulating oral sex with a carrot,but without more information about the circumstances under which brown conveyed the information,this is hardly a basis for holding brown responsible for any of those incidents.
in short,four incidents,none of which were perpetrated by brown,do not justify the inference that wholly different,facially incidents involving brown were part of any campaign to harass alfano on the basis of her sex.
once the brown incidents are thus excluded from consideration,alfano is left with five incidents in a span of more than four years the three carrot incidents from late to early,the graphic cartoon in february,and the december informal counseling by deering.we now address whether,as a matter of law,these incidents are sufficient to support a finding of a hostile work environment.
there is no fixed number of incidents that a plaintiff must endure in order to establish a hostile work environment rather,we view the circumstances in their totality,examining the nature,severity,and frequency of the conduct.harris,at.cruz,at.evaluating alfano evidence in the light of recent case law,we are convinced that it falls well below the threshold.in this circuit and others,hostile work environment claims have been dismissed for insufficiency of evidence even though,compared to what was adduced here,they involved a similar or greater number of incidents,that were more compressed in time,and that were more severe and had more pronounced discriminatory overtones.in each of the following cases,the evidence was held insufficient as a matter of law to alter the terms and conditions of employment quinn green tree credit,cir an appreciative comment about plaintiff buttocks and a deliberate touching of her breasts celestine petroleos de venezuella sa,cir in a period,eight incidents of alleged racial harassment shepherd comptroller of pub.accounts,cir in a period,made impertinent and intimate observations about plaintiff anatomy,attempted to look down her shirt,and touched her multiple times black zaring homes,cir in a period,repeated sexual jokes,and at least five other sexually offensive remarks baskerville culligan int l,cir in a period,nine sexually offensive incidents,including repeated references to plaintiff as a pretty girl,grunting noises when she wore leather skirt,and one episode of simulated masturbation hocevar purdue frederick,cir in a period,several sexually derogatory remarks about women by one or more men,a sexual advance at a company dance,disruption of plaintiff presentation by talking followed by comment on her legs,and a lascivious remark in a group setting by a company official predicting his sexual conquest of three female employees sprague thorn americas,cir in a period,five sexually offensive statements,including one made while harasser had his arm around the plaintiff and was peering down her dress penry fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir in a period,harasser made remarks concerning plaintiff bra strap,her underclothing,and whether she had sexual dreams claimed sexual conquest of another woman employee made pornographic architectural analogies and took the plaintiff to a hooter restaurant on business travel six total incidents mendoza borden,cir in an period,harasser once made inappropriate physical contact,made one arguably offensive statement,and several times made disgusting noises while staring impertinently,cert.denied,d see also hopkins baltimore gas,cir adusumilli city of chicago,cir.
conversely,recent cases on hostile work environment in this circuit have found triable issues of fact only where the harassment was of greater frequency and severity than anything alfano has demonstrated.thus,in raniola bratton,cir,we saw a triable issue where the plaintiff demonstrated that,in two and a half years time,she was subjected to offensive remarks,disproportionately burdensome work assignments,workplace sabotage,and one serious public threat of physical harm.in schwapp town of avon,cir,we held that the plaintiff ha
