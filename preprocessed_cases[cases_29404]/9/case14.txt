kingsley hendrickson et.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
argued april,decided june,
while petitioner kingsley was awaiting trial in county jail,officers forcibly removed him from his cell when he refused to comply with their instructions.kingsley filed a complaint in federal district court claiming,as relevant here,that two of the officers used excessive force against him in violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause.at the trial conclusion,the district court instructed the jury that kingsley was required to prove,inter alia,that the officers recklessly disregarded kingsley safety and acted with reckless disregard of his rights.the jury found in the officers favor.on appeal,kingsley argued that the jury instruction did not adhere to the proper standard for judging a pretrial detainee excessive force claim,namely,objective unreasonableness.the seventh circuit disagreed,holding that the law required a subjective inquiry into the officers state of mind,whether the officers actually intended to violate,or recklessly disregarded,kingsley rights.
under,a pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable to prevail on an excessive force claim.
a this determination must be made from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,including what the officer knew at the time,see graham connor,and must account for the legitimate interests stemming from the government need to manage the facility in which the individual is detained,appropriately deferring to policies and practices that in th e judgment of jail officials are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security,bell wolfish.
b several considerations lead to this conclusion.an objective standard is consistent with precedent.in bell,for instance,this court held that a pretrial detainee could prevail on a claim that his due process rights were violated by providing only objective evidence that the challenged governmental action was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or that it was excessive in relation to that purpose,at.block rutherford.experience also suggests that an objective standard is workable.it is consistent with the pattern jury instructions used in several circuits,and many facilities train officers to interact with detainees as if the officers conduct is subject to objective reasonableness.finally,the use of an objective standard adequately protects an officer who acts in good faith,by acknowledging that judging the reasonableness of the force used from the perspective and with the knowledge of the defendant officer is an appropriate part of the analysis.
c none of the cases respondents point to provides significant support for a subjective standard.whitley albers,and hudson mcmillian,lack relevance in this context because they involved claims brought by convicted prisoners under the eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause,not claims brought by pretrial detainees under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.and in county of sacramento lewis,a statement indicating the need to show purpose to cause harm,at,for due process liability refers not to whether the force intentionally used was excessive,but whether the defendant intended to commit the acts in question,at,and.finally,in johnson glick,a factor was not suggested as a necessary condition for liability,but as a factor,among others,that might help show that the use of force was excessive.
applying the proper standard,the jury instruction was erroneous.taken together,the features of that instruction suggested that the jury should weigh respondents subjective reasons for using force and subjective views about the excessiveness of that force.respondents claim that,irrespective of this court holding,any error in the instruction was harmless is left to the seventh circuit to resolve on remand.
vacated and remanded.

michael kingsley,petitioner stan hendrickson,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,an individual detained in a jail prior to trial brought a claim under stat,against several jail officers,alleging that they used excessive force against him,in violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause.the officers concede that they intended to use the force that they used.but the parties disagree about whether the force used was excessive.
the question before us is whether,to prove an excessive force claim,a pretrial detainee must show that the officers were subjectively aware that their use of force was unreasonable,or only that the officers use of that force was objectively unreasonable.we conclude that the latter standard is the correct one.
some but not all of the facts are undisputed michael kingsley,the petitioner,was arrested on a drug charge and detained in a wisconsin county jail prior to trial.on the evening of may,an officer performing a cell check noticed a piece of paper covering the light fixture above kingsley bed.the officer told kingsley to remove it kingsley refused subsequently other officers told kingsley to remove the paper and each time kingsley refused.the next morning,the jail administrator,lieutenant robert conroy,ordered kingsley to remove the paper.kingsley once again refused.conroy then told kingsley that officers would remove the paper and that he would be moved to a receiving cell in the interim.
shortly thereafter,four officers,including respondents sergeant stan hendrickson and deputy sheriff fritz degner,approached the cell and ordered kingsley to stand,back up to the door,and keep his hands behind him.when kingsley refused to comply,the officers handcuffed him,forcibly removed him from the cell,carried him to a receiving cell,and placed him face down on a bunk with his hands handcuffed behind his back.
the parties views about what happened next differ.the officers testified that kingsley resisted their efforts to remove his handcuffs.kingsley testified that he did not resist.all agree that sergeant hendrickson placed his knee in kingsley back and kingsley told him in impolite language to get off.kingsley testified that hendrickson and degner then slammed his head into the concrete bunk an allegation the officers deny.
the parties agree,however,about what happened next hendrickson directed degner to stun kingsley with a taser degner applied a taser to kingsley back for approximately five seconds the officers then left the handcuffed kingsley alone in the receiving cell and officers returned to the cell minutes later and removed kingsley handcuffs.
based on these and related events,kingsley filed a complaint in federal district court claiming among other things that hendrickson and degner used excessive force against him,in violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause.the officers moved for summary judgment,which the district court denied,stating that a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers acted with malice and intended to harm kingsley when they used force against him.kingsley josvai,wd,app to pet.for cert.kingsley excessive force claim accordingly proceeded to trial.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
excessive force means force applied recklessly that is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances of the time.thus,to succeed on his claim of excessive use of force,plaintiff must prove each of the following factors by a preponderance of the evidence 
defendants used force on plaintiff 
defendants use of force was unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances at the time 
defendants knew that using force presented a risk of harm to plaintiff,but they recklessly disregarded plaintiff safety by failing to take reasonable measures to minimize the risk of harm to plaintiff and 
defendants conduct caused some harm to plaintiff.
in deciding whether one or more defendants used unreasonable force against plaintiff,you must consider whether it was unreasonable from the perspective of a reasonable officer facing the same circumstances that defendants faced.you must make this decision based on what defendants knew at the time of the incident,not based on what you know now.
also,in deciding whether one or more defendants used unreasonable force and acted with reckless disregard of plaintiff rights,you may consider factors such as 
the need to use force 
the relationship between the need to use force and the amount of force used 
the extent of plaintiff injury 
whether defendants reasonably believed there was a threat to the safety of staff or prisoners and 
any efforts made by defendants to limit the amount of force used.app.emphasis added.
the jury found in the officers favor.
on appeal,kingsley argued that the correct standard for judging a pretrial detainee excessive force claim is objective unreasonableness.and,the jury instruction,he said,did not hew to that standard.a panel of the court of appeals disagreed,with one judge dissenting.the majority held that the law required a subjective inquiry into the officer state of mind.there must be an actual intent to violate the plaintiff rights or reckless disregard for his rights.quoting wilson williams.the dissent would have used instructions promulgated by the committee on pattern civil jury instructions of the seventh circuit,which require a pretrial detainee claiming excessive force to show only that the use of force was objectively unreasonable,at opinion of hamilton,see pattern civ.jury instr.the dissent further stated that the district court use of the word reckless in the jury instruction added an unnecessary and confusing element.at.
kingsley filed a petition for certiorari asking us to determine whether the requirements of a excessive force claim brought by a pretrial detainee must satisfy the subjective standard or only the objective standard.in light of disagreement among the circuits,we agreed to do so.compare,murray johnson,fed.appx,bozeman orum,per curiam,with aldini johnson,young wolfe,fed.appx.
we consider a legally requisite state of mind.in a case like this one,there are,in a sense,two separate questions.the first concerns the defendant state of mind with respect to his physical acts,his state of mind with respect to the bringing about of certain physical consequences in the world.the second question concerns the defendant state of mind with respect to whether his use of force was excessive.here,as to the first question,there is no dispute.as to the second,whether to interpret the defendant physical acts in the world as involving force that was excessive,there is a dispute.we conclude with respect to that question that the relevant standard is objective not subjective.thus,the defendant state of mind is not a matter that a plaintiff is required to prove.
consider the series of physical events that take place in the world a series of events that might consist,for example,of the swing of a fist that hits a face,a push that leads to a fall,or the shot of a taser that leads to the stunning of its recipient.no one here denies,and we must assume,that,as to the series of events that have taken place in the world,the defendant must possess a purposeful,a knowing,or possibly a reckless state of mind.that is because,as we have stated,liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.county of sacramento lewis,emphasis added.see also daniels williams,historically,this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life,liberty,or property thus,if an officer taser goes off by accident or if an officer unintentionally trips and falls on a detainee,causing him harm,the pretrial detainee can not prevail on an excessive force claim.but if the use of force is deliberate,purposeful or knowing the pretrial detainee claim may proceed.in the context of a police pursuit of a suspect the court noted,though without so holding,that recklessness in some cases might suffice as a standard for imposing liability.see lewis,supra,at.whether that standard might suffice for liability in the case of an alleged mistreatment of a pretrial detainee need not be decided here for the officers do not dispute that they acted purposefully or knowingly with respect to the force they used against kingsley.
we now consider the question before us here the defendant state of mind with respect to the proper interpretation of the force a series of events in the world that the defendant deliberately not accidentally or negligently used.in deciding whether the force deliberately used is,constitutionally speaking,excessive,should courts use an objective standard only,or instead a subjective standard that takes into account a defendant state of mind it is with respect to this question that we hold that courts must use an objective standard.in short,we agree with the dissenting appeals court judge,the seventh circuit jury instruction committee,and kingsley,that a pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.
a court judge or jury can not apply this standard mechanically.see lewis,supra,at.rather,objective reasonableness turns on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.graham connor.a court must make this determination from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,including what the officer knew at the time,not with the vision of hindsight.see ibid.a court must also account for the legitimate interests that stem from the government need to manage the facility in which the individual is detained,appropriately deferring to policies and practices that in th e judgment of jail officials are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.bell wolfish.
considerations such as the following may bear on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the force used the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used the extent of the plaintiff injury any effort made by the officer to temper or to limit the amount of force the severity of the security problem at issue the threat reasonably perceived by the officer and whether the plaintiff was actively resisting.see,graham,supra,at.we do not consider this list to be exclusive.we mention these factors only to illustrate the types of objective circumstances potentially relevant to a determination of excessive force.
several considerations have led us to conclude that the appropriate standard for a pretrial detainee excessive force claim is solely an objective one.for one thing,it is consistent with our precedent.we have said that the due process clause protects a pretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.graham,supra,at.and in bell,we explained that such punishment can consist of actions taken with an expressed intent to punish.at.but the bell court went on to explain that,in the absence of an expressed intent to punish,a pretrial detainee can nevertheless prevail by showing that the actions are not rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose or that the actions appear excessive in relation to that purpose.at.the bell court applied this latter objective standard to evaluate a variety of prison conditions,including a prison practice of.in doing so,it did not consider the prison officials subjective beliefs about the policy,at.rather,the court examined objective evidence,such as the size of the rooms and available amenities,before concluding that the conditions were reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of holding detainees for trial and did not appear excessive in relation to that purpose.ibid.
bell focus on punishment does not mean that proof of intent or motive to punish is required for a pretrial detainee to prevail on a claim that his due process rights were violated.rather,as bell itself shows and as our later precedent affirms,a pretrial detainee can prevail by providing only objective evidence that the challenged governmental action is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective or that it is excessive in relation to that purpose.block rutherford,where there was no suggestion that the purpose of jail policy of denying contact visitation was to punish inmates,the court need only evaluate whether the policy was reasonably related to legitimate governmental objectives and whether it appears excessive in relation to that objective schall martin,similar see also united states salerno,t he distinction turns on whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may rationally be connected is assignable for it,and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned to it quoting schall,supra,at emphasis added and some internal quotation marks omitted.the court did not suggest in any of these cases,either by its words or its analysis,that its application of bell objective standard should involve subjective considerations.our standard is also consistent with our use of an objective excessive force standard where officers apply force to a person who,like kingsley,has been accused but not convicted of a crime,but who,unlike kingsley,is free on bail.see graham,supra.
for another thing,experience suggests that an objective standard is workable.it is consistent with the pattern jury instructions used in several circuits.we are also told that many facilities,including the facility at issue here,train officers to interact with all detainees as if the officers conduct is subject to an objective reasonableness standard.see brief for petitioner app.brief for former corrections administrators and experts as amici curiae.
finally,the use of an objective standard adequately protects an officer who acts in good faith.we recognize that r unning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking,turner safley,and that safety and order at these institutions requires the expertise of correctional officials,who must have substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions to the problems they face,florence board of chosen freeholders of county of burlington,slip,at.officers facing disturbances are often forced to make judgments in circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly evolving.graham,at.for these reasons,we have stressed that a court must judge the reasonableness of the force used from the perspective and with the knowledge of the defendant officer.we have also explained that a court must take account of the legitimate interests in managing a jail,acknowledging as part of the objective reasonableness analysis that deference to policies and practices needed to maintain order and institutional security is appropriate.see part,supra.and we have limited liability for excessive force to situations in which the use of force was the result of an intentional and knowing act though we leave open the possibility of including a reckless act as well.ibid.additionally,an officer enjoys qualified immunity and is not liable for excessive force unless he has violated a clearly established right,such that it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,see also brief for united states as amicus curiae.it is unlikely though theoretically possible that a plaintiff could overcome these hurdles where an officer acted in good faith.
respondents believe that the relevant legal standard should be subjective,that the plaintiff must prove that the use of force was not applied in a effort to maintain or restore discipline but,rather,was applied maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.brief for respondents.and they refer to several cases that they believe support their position.see,at citing whitley albers,hudson mcmillian,lewis,johnson glick.
the first two of these cases,however,concern excessive force claims brought by convicted prisoners under the eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause,not claims brought by pretrial detainees under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.whitley,supra,at hudson,supra,at.the language of the two clauses differs,and the nature of the claims often differs.and,most importantly,pretrial detainees unlike convicted prisoners can not be punished at all,much less maliciously and sadistically.ingraham wright,graham,supra,at,see also blackstone,commentaries i f the offence be not bailable,or the party can not find bail,he is to be committed to the county jail b ut only for safe custody,and not for punishment thus,there is no need here,as there might be in an eighth amendment case,to determine when punishment is unconstitutional.whitley and hudson are relevant here only insofar as they address the practical importance of taking into account the legitimate concerns of those who run jails.and,as explained above,we believe we have done so.
lewis does not prove respondents point,either.there,the court considered a claim that a police officer had violated due process by causing a death during a automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspect.we wrote that j ust as a purpose to cause harm is needed for eighth amendment liability in a prison riot case,so it ought to be needed for due process liability in a pursuit case.at.respondents contend that this statement shows that the court embraced a standard for due process claims that requires a showing of subjective intent.brief for respondents.other portions of the lewis opinion make clear,however,that this statement referred to the defendant intent to commit the acts in question,not to whether the force intentionally used was excessive.at,and.as explained above,the parties here do not dispute that respondents use of force was intentional.see part,supra.
nor does glick provide respondents with significant support.in that case judge friendly,writing for the second circuit,considered an excessive force claim brought by a pretrial detainee under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.judge friendly pointed out that the management by a few guards of large numbers of prisoners in an institution may require and justify the occasional use of a degree of intentional force.at.he added that,in determining whether that intentional use of force crosse s the constitutional line,a court should look 
to such factors as the need for the application of force,the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used,the extent of injury inflicted,and whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.ibid.
this statement does not suggest that the fourth factor malicious and sadistic purpose to cause harm is a necessary condition for liability.to the contrary,the words such as make clear that the four factors provide examples of some considerations,among others,that might help show that the use of force was excessive.
respondents believe these cases nonetheless help them make a broader point namely,that a subjective standard protects against a relative flood of claims,many of them perhaps unfounded,brought by pretrial detainees.brief for respondents.but we note that the prison litigation reform act of,which is designed to deter the filing of frivolous litigation against prison officials,applies to both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.nor is there evidence of a rash of unfounded filings in circuits that use an objective standard.
we acknowledge that our view that an objective standard is appropriate in the context of excessive force claims brought by pretrial detainees pursuant to the fourteenth amendment may raise questions about the use of a subjective standard in the context of excessive force claims brought by convicted pri
