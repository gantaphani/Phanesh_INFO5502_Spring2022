this civil rights action represents another chapter in a pitched battle over the pension benefits due to retired municipal employees of the city of providence.the district court below disposed of several of plaintiffs claims at summary judgment and,later,dismissed the remaining claims on jurisdictional grounds.plaintiffs seek reversal of the district court order dismissing their claims under the contract clause,takings clause,and due process clause of the united states constitution.we affirm the district court judgment in toto.
although we ultimately resolve this appeal on straightforward grounds,the attendant facts and procedural history are somewhat more involved.we recite only the undisputed facts,unless otherwise noted.
plaintiffs are all former members of the police and fire departments of the city of providence who retired after january.defendants include the city of providence city,members of the providence city council city council,the mayor of the city of providence,and members of the city of providence employee retirement board retirement board.
at a meeting held on december,the retirement board voted to approve a variety of retirement benefits for both class a and class b city employees including a generous increase in the cost of living adjustment cola for pension benefits.following the retirement board vote,however,the city chafed at the prospect of honoring the terms of the newly enacted retirement plan.the city hired outside counsel to challenge the validity of the retirement board action in state court.in its complaint,the city challenged the retirement board cola and pension award action as ultra vires.the case reached a bench trial before the rhode island superior court.upon completion of that trial,the trial judge entered a written decision in which he determined that the retirement board december,vote establishing the pension and cola modifications was a valid and binding exercise of its authority.counsel to the case were ordered to prepare and submit an appropriate judgment for entry by the trial court.
instead of preparing that judgment,counsel informed the trial court that they were attempting to negotiate a final settlement of the case,ostensibly to avoid further proceedings and bring finality to the ongoing pension controversy.by december,an agreed case settlement had been negotiated under which the beneficiaries to the settlement would receive a compounded cola increase.the terms of the proposed settlement were adopted formally by vote of the retirement board at a december,meeting,and the settlement was thereafter presented to the trial court for approval and entry as a consent decree.
the city complied with the terms of the consent decree for a period of roughly two years.then,in,the city again balked at funding cola benefits for retirees.on january,the city council passed ordinance,which terminated the compounded cola increase for retired police and firefighters.on the same day,the city council also passed ordinance,which established a new scheme of retiree benefits,but did not include the compounded cola increase.the city deviation from the terms of the consent decree triggered a contempt proceeding in state court.
meanwhile,the city council and city filed a separate action in state court in pursuit of a declaration that the consent decree was invalid.the city council and city argued that the decree had not been entered with the permission or ratification of the city council,thereby rendering the decree unenforceable.the trial judge was asked not only to determine the validity of the consent decree,but also to resolve lingering doubts concerning the actual scope of the consent decree.numerous city employees who retired after december,claimed entitlement to the compounded cola increase the city responded by arguing that the consent decree,even if valid,did not apply to later retirees.
after a labyrinthine tour of the state court system,which included an appeal to the rhode island supreme court and subsequent remand,the various consent decree litigations were ultimately consolidated into a single appeal before the rhode island supreme court.in city of providence employee retirement board,the court held that the consent decree was valid and binding upon the city.id.at.the court further held that the decree covered only those employees who had retired on or before december.id.at.consequently,the court rejected the employees argument that any subsequent changes to cola benefits would effect an unconstitutional impairment of contract rights as applied to those retiring after december.id.at.
between and,during the pendency of the ongoing consent decree controversies,the city and plaintiffs acting through their collective bargaining representatives negotiated and agreed to a series of collective bargaining agreements cbas that provided for a compounded cola increase.although of the providence code of ordinances requires that the city council ratify all cbas between the city and a labor organization,it is undisputed that the city council never ratified the cbas in question.
then,beginning in,the city council passed a handful of municipal ordinances,each of which placed the amount of plaintiffs cola benefits below the levels established under the cbas chapter established a cola increase chapter provided a increase up to the first of the retirement allowance and chapter provided a increase up to the first of the retirement allowance.
in,plaintiffs commenced the present suit in federal court alleging numerous constitutional claims pursuant to.the amended complaint asserted that,by adopting an ordinance that terminated the cola provisions of the consent decree,defendants deprived plaintiffs of property in violation of the due process clause count.by adopting various city ordinances that are at odds with provisions of the collective bargaining agreements,defendants were also alleged to have violated the due process clause count the due process component of the rhode island constitution count the contract clause and a cognate provision of the rhode island constitution count and the takings clause count.lastly,the complaint contained a claim for violation of the equal protection clause count and a due process claim count.
in november,both parties moved for summary judgment on all counts of the complaint.in september,the district court below entered a written order allowing partial judgment in favor of defendants.at the outset,the district court noted that plaintiffs claims essentially comprised an attack on two fronts 
first,they challenge defendants efforts to reduce the amount of colas to which plaintiffs claim they are entitled under the consent decree.next,they challenge defendants efforts to provide colas that are less than those called for under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements which were never formally ratified by the city council.
picard city of providence,slip op.at,wl.the district court then abstained from ruling on the merits of the claims arising from the consent decree because neither party had addressed a lurking jurisdictional issue under the doctrine in particular,the court noted that its jurisdiction to entertain those claims was questionable in light of a state superior court ruling that held that the consent decree applied only to those who had retired on or before december.id.at referring to mansolillo employee ret,wl,
the district court did not,however,feel similarly constrained in ruling on plaintiffs second means of attack.the court entered summary judgment against plaintiffs on their claims based on the cbas.the district court reasoned that the failure of the city council to ratify the cbas pursuant to of the providence code of ordinances rendered those agreements void and thereby foreclosed the possibility of finding any enforceable contract rights protected by the constitution.id.at citing providence city council cianci.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment as to counts,and and denied summary judgment as to the remaining claims.
later,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the remaining consent decree claims based on lack of standing,lack of subject matter jurisdict
