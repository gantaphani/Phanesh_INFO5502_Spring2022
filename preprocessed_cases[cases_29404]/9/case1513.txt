opinion of the court 
ronald long,a new jersey state prisoner who proceeded pro se before the united states district court for the district of new jersey,appeals an order of that court denying his untimely motion for reconsideration of a prior order dismissing his complaint.long relies on federal rule of appellate procedure a a,which provides that,if a timely motion for reconsideration under federal rule of civil procedure e is filed,the time to appeal begins to run from the district court disposition of the motion.he reasons that,here,we can review the underlying dismissal order because his motion for reconsideration should be deemed timely since mail delay within the prison caused him to file the motion late.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with long that,in cases where the record supports a finding of delay in prison mail delivery,such delay may make an untimely rule e motion timely so as to permit the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over an order we would otherwise lack jurisdiction to review.when the record is insufficient to support a prisoner allegations of prison delay,we may remand to the district court for appropriate.ultimately,however,we rule that the issue of delay need not be resolved on remand because we have jurisdiction over the district court denial of reconsideration which,in this case,proves sufficient.
factual background and procedural history 
on february,long filed an in forma pauperis complaint under against the atlantic city police department,the new jersey state police,two police officers,and two forensic chemists.he alleged that the defendants conspired to obtain a capital murder conviction against him by knowingly presenting false evidence at his trial,and deliberately preventing him from obtaining dna testing that would prove his innocence the complaint sought monetary damages to compensate him for the consequences of the alleged conspiracy.
on august,after screening the complaint pursuant to e and the district court issued a memorandum concluding that long claims were barred by heck humphrey,unless and until long could demonstrate that his state court conviction was invalid.accordingly,the district court dismissed the complaint sua sponte,even though the defendants had not yet been served.the court issued an accompanying order closing the case that same day.on august,the memorandum and the order were entered on the district court docket.thus,under the rules then in effect long had until september,to file a motion for reconsideration under rule e.see.e stating the deadline by reference to the entry of the judgment.
he did not do so.instead,on september,long a motion for reconsideration along with a letter brief explaining that he had not received the district court filings until september,after the day period to file an appeal under appellate rule a had lapsed the motion for reconsideration claimed that the delay was caused,in part,by long transfer from one state prison to another.specifically,long claimed that although he had informed the district court of his transfer to a new prison,he received the district court memorandum and order only after they were sent to his old prison and then forwarded to him.he also attributed his delayed receipt of those documents to the fact that officials at his new prison open legal mail outside of the inmate presence.amicus app.at.
on october,the district court issued a memorandum treating long motion for reconsideration as timely because he had executed his motion on september,within three days of receipt amicus app.at,but rejecting long motion for reconsideration on the merits,based on heck.the district court memorandum,as well as its accompanying order,were entered on the docket on october.on october,long signed a notice of appeal that was therefore timely as measured from the denial of reconsideration,see fed.a a providing that a notice of appeal must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from in a case in which the united states or its agent is not a party,but untimely as measured from the august,order dismissing the case.
we consolidated long appeal with other cases presenting similar issues implicating appellate rule a for the purpose of determining whether,and to what extent,we have appellate jurisdiction to consider it 
the parties agree that we have jurisdiction to review the district court order denying long motion for reconsideration long contends that we also have jurisdiction to review the underlying dismissal order because his motion for reconsideration should,under appellate rule a a,toll his time to file an appeal.that appellate rule provides,in pertinent part,that certain timely file d motions,including motions to reconsider under rule e,serve to postpone the time to file an appeal until the entry of the order disposing of the last remaining motion.fed.a a.although long acknowledges that his motion for reconsideration was late,he asks us to treat it as timely,due to the mail handling in prison that allegedly delayed his filing.
our amicus,fine kaplan,takes a contrary view regarding long attempt to appeal the underlying order of dismissal.according to amicus view of the law,when long did not receive a copy of the district court dismissal order until after the day time limit for filing a notice of appeal had lapsed,his only recourse was to file a motion under appellate rule a for an extension of time to appeal or a motion under appellate rule a to reopen the time to file an appeal because long filed neither of those motions and instead filed a motion for reconsideration under rule e,amicus argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court underlying dismissal order.
a.our jurisdiction to review the district court initial dismissal order 
we therefore begin our analysis by evaluating whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court order dismissing long complaint.that inquiry leads us to examine two distinct questions.
first,we address whether allegations of prison delay can excuse the untimeliness of a motion to reconsider under rule e so as to permit us to exercise jurisdiction under appellate rule a a to review the underlying dismissal.if an untimely rule e motion can be considered timely as a result of prison delay,appellate rule a a permits the time to file an appeal to run from the entry of the order disposing of that motion.fed.a a.second,assuming appellate rule a a does provide an avenue for us to reach the underlying dismissal order,we consider whether there is a temporal limitation on the operation of that rule that would prevent its application in circumstances where a rule e motion is filed after the otherwise applicable time period for filing a notice of appeal,see fed.a,has lapsed.
we address those questions in turn.
whether prison delay can render an untimely rule e motion timely 
the idea that prison delay may serve to toll the time to appeal stems from our holding in united states grana,cir,abrogated on other grounds by virgin islands martinez,cir.there,we held that delay by prison authorities in delivering mail to a prisoner should be excluded in calculating the time for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case.see id.at.although the prisoner in grana filed a pro se appeal fifteen days out of time under appellate rule b,grana alleged that the prison had negligently handled his incoming mail,and as a result he did not receive the district court final order until may,after the expiration of the appeal period.id.at.he consequently argued that,for purposes of jurisdiction,his appeal should be treated as having been filed on time.we agreed.
pointing to the supreme court adoption of the prison mailbox rule we observed that prison delay beyond the litigant control can not fairly be used in computing time for appeal and we perceive d no difference between delay in transmitting the prisoner papers to the court and transmitting the court final judgment to him so that he may prepare his appeal.id.at.we therefore held that,in computing the timeliness of pro se prisoners appeals,any prison delay in transmitting to the prisoner notice of the district court final order or judgment shall be excluded from the computation of an appellant time for taking an appeal.id.we remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the appeal was timely under that standard because the record d id not show the date the prison received notice of the district court final order or conclusively establish the date the prison transmitted the notice to the appellant.id.we instructed that,on remand,the prison would have the burden of establishing the relevant dates because the prison was best equipped to provide that information.id.
in united states fiorelli,cir,we extended the grana rule to permit an untimely motion for reconsideration to be made timely so that it would,in turn,toll the time to appeal under appellate rule a a.fiorelli filed a civil case under mounting a collateral attack on his criminal conviction.id.at.his claim for relief was denied by the district court on april.id.at.on april,outside of the day period for filing a motion for reconsideration but within the day period for filing a notice of appeal,see fed.a b providing that a notice of appeal must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from in a case in which the united states or its agent is a party,he filed what the fiorelli court ultimately construed as a rule e motion for reconsideration,fiorelli,at.the district court denied that motion on may,and fiorelli filed a notice of appeal on july.id.
thus,as in this case,fiorelli notice of appeal was timely as measured from the denial of the untimely motion for reconsideration,but was otherwise untimely.fiorelli alleged,however,that he received the district court original order during the normal mail distribution at the federal prison where he was confined,days after the district court issued the order denying his claim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the question,therefore,was whether fiorelli delayed receipt of the original order,which delay was allegedly caused by prison officials,should result in his untimely motion for reconsideration being viewed as timely,thereby rendering his appeal of the original order denying his claim timely under the provisions of appellate rule a a.see id.fiorelli appeal may be properly filed if his motion for reconsideration is deemed timely,thus invoking the tolling provision of appellate rule a a.
we answered that there was no reason why grana exclusion of prison delays from the time limits of jurisdictionally sensitive filings should not apply to motions for reconsideration,inasmuch as such deadlines are critical to appellate jurisdiction.id.at.it followed that a prison actual delay or interference in the delivery of a final order of the district court is excluded from the calculation of the timeliness of motions for reconsideration filed by pro se inmates.id.at.while we emphasized that the tolling rule requires a prisoner to allege that actual delay or interference in mail delivery was caused by the prison,we were satisfied that fiorelli statement that he received the district court order during the normal mail distribution could refer to such interference and remanded for the district court to determine whether the tolling rule could be properly invoked.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as we did in grana,we instructed the district court to undertake factual findings as to the relevant dates of the prison receipt and delivery of the district court order so that,on review,we could make a determination of our jurisdiction.id.
notwithstanding fiorelli extension of the grana tolling principle to a case governed by the federal rules of civil procedure and appellate rule a,we seemed to reject that approach in poole family court of new castle county,cir.in poole,a pro se prisoner filed an untimely notice of appeal,apparently because of delay in receiving notice of the entry of the order dismissing his claims.id.at.citing grana,poole argued that his otherwise untimely notice of appeal should be regarded as having been filed on time because there was a delay in his receipt of notice from the district court clerk office regarding the entry of the order of dismissal.id.that delay was allegedly the result of poole transfer from one correctional institution to another shortly before the order of dismissal was entered.id.at.without mentioning fiorelli,we concluded that the grana tolling rule did not apply,distinguishing poole appeal because it unlike the appeal in grana occurred in a civil case,id.at,and because the delay was not primarily due to poole status as an inmate but to the simple fact that he was moved,id.at.poole proper remedy,we explained,would have been to file a motion to reopen in accordance with appellate rule a.see id.at.
while poole is plainly in tension with fiorelli,we view the holding in poole as turning not on its distinction between criminal and civil cases but rather on the nature of the alleged delay.in fiorelli,the delay in the prisoner receipt of the order was allegedly the result of the prison handling of the mail.it was,in other words a classic prison delay case,after the manner of grana.in poole,by contrast,the delay allegedly was caused by the clerk office and did not stem from actions or omissions by prison officials.fiorelli,at grana makes clear that only delays caused by the prison warrant tolling of the filing deadlines,and t o the extent that the delay represents slow mail,there is nothing that this court can do to preserve an appellant right to appellate review.emphasis added quoting grana,at.
we therefore read fiorelli to articulate a rule that applies when delay is allegedly caused by actions or omissions of prison officials in the delivery of mail to a prisoner litigating pro se we reaffirm that we can view a rule e motion as timely in such situations,allowing us to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to appellate rule a a over an appeal of the underlying order,if the delay in filing the rule e motion is caused by a prison actual delay or interference in the delivery of a final order of the district court.id.at.thus,when a pro se prisoner makes allegations in connection with a motion for reconsideration that could reasonably be construed as a assertion that the prison delayed delivering the court order that he is asking be reconsidered,the district court should engage in the necessary to a jurisdictional analysis under appellate rule a a.see id.the timeliness of a motion under civil rule is critical to appellate jurisdiction.in some instances,such as when the prisoner allegations are uncontested,the district court may of course choose to credit what the prisoner says.there ought,however,also be some effort to confirm that the order was sent to the prisoner correct prison address and an explicit determination that the prisoner allegations as to the date of receipt are accepted as being true we then,in turn,would accept any such as long as it was not clearly erroneous.even when the district court determines it needs further information to decide whether the prison actually delayed or interfered with a prisoner receipt of an order,we are not suggesting that a hearing will be necessary we are instead directing only that,in such a case,the prison has the burden of providing evidence of the date it received the district court final order and the date on which it was transmitted to the appellant.see grana,at.as a practical matter,this should add no burden to prison because prison officials have,at least since grana,been on notice that they should maintain clear and accurate mail logs.id.
in the present case,long that his delayed receipt of the district court memorandum and order was a result of two things first,that those documents were incorrectly mailed to his old prison,and second,that his new prison opened legal mail before delivering it to prisoners.thus,although some portion of the delay was allegedly caused by the district court clerk office and any such time lost would not count towards making long untimely motion for reconsideration timely,some of the delay was also allegedly a consequence of prison delay,as long complains of his new prison practice of opening legal mail before sending it to inmates.we can not sort out these alleged sources of delay,however,because the district court made no express finding as to whether the prison actually delayed or interfered with long receipt of its order,and the record before us does not indicate when the prison where long currently resides received the district court memorandum and order or when it transmitted those documents to long.we would therefore ordinarily remand to the district court to find those facts.
whether there is a temporal limitation on fiorelli tolling rule 
our amicus,however,indicates that remand would be fruitless here since there is a day outer time limit or day,when the united states or its agent is a party on fiorelli tolling rule because appellate rule a imposes that jurisdictional time limit on the filing of a notice of appeal.amicus argument is based on the supreme court decision in bowles russell.in that case,the supreme court held that timing requirements for filing notices of appeal,as set forth in and from which appellate rule a is derived,are mandatory and jurisdictional,and,as such,a court has no power to create equitable exceptions to them.at.as we discuss more fully in the companion case filed today,baker united states,and,there is no doubt after bowles that the rules listed in,one of which is restated in appellate rule a,are jurisdictional because of that,and because fiorelli tolling can permit a litigant entitled to its application to file a notice of appeal from the original order after appellate rule a jurisdictional deadline has lapsed,our amicus has taken the position that fiorelli can not allow an untimely motion for reconsideration to be deemed timely for purposes of appellate rule a a if that motion is filed after the expiration of the or day jurisdictional period for filing a notice of appeal under appellate rule a.were we to hold otherwise,amicus warns,we would be allowing,and perhaps encouraging,an around appellate rule a s jurisdictional deadline.
but amicus argument is misplaced.properly viewed,the fiorelli tolling rule does not extend any of the deadlines set forth in and appellate rule a.rather,it concerns the timeliness of a motion for reconsideration,which then determines,under appellate rule a a,the orders over which we can exercise jurisdiction.when facts are found that demonstrate prison delay,all that fiorelli does is allow us to,by excluding the time lost due to prison delay,deem as timely what would otherwise be an untimely motion for reconsideration.after subtracting such time,the prisoner must still file his appeal within or days of the district court disposition of his motion.if he does so,he will be considered to have properly filed his appeal in accordance with appellate rule a a.fiorelli tolling rule is nothing more than an application of the principle from houston lack,that time lost due to prison delay can not fairly be used in computing time for appeal.grana,at.
it is quite possible,then,that,after by the district court,we could conclude that we do have jurisdiction to consider the district court underlying order that dismissed long complaint.our usual practice would therefore be to remand for the district court to find the facts that are essential for a determination of our jurisdiction over that order.fiorelli,at.that step is unnecessary in this case,however,since we agree with the parties that we have jurisdiction to consider long appeal to the extent he challenges the district court denial of his motion for reconsideration which proves sufficient in this case.
b.the district court denial of reconsideration 
we acknowledge that our review of the order denying reconsideration is subject to a more deferential and circumscribed standard of review than would apply if we also were to have jurisdiction to consider the underlying dismissal order,as we review only whether the district court denial of reconsideration constitutes an abuse of discretion see,lazaridis wehmer,cir t he appropriate standard of review of an appeal from the district court denial of a rule motion is for an abuse of discretion.consequently,in the ordinary case,we would not assume that reviewing a denial of reconsideration would be functionally the same as reviewing the underlying order,even if the former covered all of the same issues as the latter.
however,though we are bound by an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the denial of reconsideration,it would indeed be an abuse of discretion in this case if the district court were wrong in saying that heck required dismissal of long complaint.see planned parenthood of cent.att y of the state of,cir a court abuses its discretion when its ruling is founded on an error of law or a misapplication of law to the facts.internal citation omitted.thus,even though we can not conclude on this record whether we have jurisdiction to exercise plenary review to consider whether the district court erred in dismissing long complaint,the legal question presented is essentially the same under either plenary or review whether the district court correctly found long complaint to be barred by heck.
in heck,the supreme court held that a suit should be dismissed when a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.at.here,long complaint seeks the sort of relief that is plainly barred by heck because he seeks relief on the ground that the defendants conspired to obtain a capital murder conviction against him,but he has not demonstrated that his conviction has already been invalidated.see amicus app.at alleging that the defendants violated long constitutional and civil rights by committing perjury fabricating evidence and engaging in conspiratorial acts to hide evidence to prevent dna testing,causing long to be falsely convicted of capital murder.although the supreme court has clarified that heck does not bar a litigant from seeking access to dna evidence through,see skinner switzer,the conspiracy described in long complaint does not,even liberally construed,seek such relief.
therefore,we hold that the district court committed no legal error in denying long motion for reconsideration,and so did not abuse its discretion in declining to change its order dismissing long complaint.and because the same result would obtain were we to ultimately determine that we have jurisdiction to review the district court dismissal order,we need not remand for fiorelli.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
in his own words,long claimed that the defendants violated his constitutional and civil rights by committing perjury fabricating evidence and engaging in conspiratorial acts to hide evidence to prevent dna testing,causing him to be falsely convicted of capital murder.amicus app.at see also id.at alleging a conspiracy to hide the evidence to prevent it from being dna tested and to prevent long from being able to establish his innocence.citations to amicus app.are to the appendix filed by amicus,fine,kaplan black,fine kaplan.
collectively,those provisions provide that district courts should screen civil complaints in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer,and dismiss the case if the action is frivolous or malicious fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.
currently,a motion to alter or amend a judgment under rule e must be filed no later than days after the entry of the judgment.e,and all deadlines stated in days no matter the length are computed in the same way.advisory committee notes on amendments.however,at the time long case was before the district court,a day deadline applied.e,and time periods involving less than days were calculated by excluding intermediate saturdays,sundays,and legal holidays.a.
long signed his motion on september,and it was entered on the district court docket on october.heeding the supreme court instruction in houston lack,we presume,for purposes of our discussion,that long filed his motion on the date he executed it.s
