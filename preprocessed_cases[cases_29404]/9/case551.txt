local rule 
according to local rule,a party who moves for summary judgment must submit a separate,short,and concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried and the basis of such contention as to each material fact.the opposing party must then file a statement of the material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried.id.failure to file such a statement will result in the court deeming admitted the movant statement.id.movant statement will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be served by the opposing party.
as we have previously declared,w e have consistently upheld the enforcement of the district court of puerto rico local rule,noting repeatedly that parties ignore it at their peril and that failure to present a statement of disputed facts,embroidered with specific citations to the record,justifies the court deeming the facts presented in the movant statement of undisputed facts admitted,cir quoting ruiz rivera riley,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred when it deemed defendant facts admitted because of plaintiffs failure to comply with local rule.plaintiffs argue that defendants themselves failed to refer to the record in their statement of facts.
the district court correctly ascertained that the plaintiffs statement of facts failed to adhere to local rule.instead of filing a statement of contested facts,plaintiffs filed their own uncontested facts lacking any references to the record that might aid the court in making its decision.plaintiffs also filed commentaries to defendants uncontested facts,in which plaintiffs make reference to testimonies that are not in evidence.plaintiffs further made numerous conclusory allegations and assertions of fact for which they offered no support.district courts are not required to ferret through sloppy records in search of evidence supporting a party case.see morales orssleff eftf,cir i n his submission to the district court,plaintiff made only a general reference to a witness testimony without pinpointing where in that deposition support for that reference could be found.this is precisely the situation that local rule seeks to avoid.additionally,contrary to plaintiffs allegations,defendants statement of facts contained references to the record,making plaintiffs argument devoid of any merit.
therefore,the facts pleaded by defendants were properly deemed admitted according with local rule.see.
