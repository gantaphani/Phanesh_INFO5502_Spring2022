sean smith appeals a district court order granting summary judgment against him in his action alleging that he was fired for exercising his rights in violation of the united states and north carolina constitutions.concluding that the district court erred in granting summary judgment,we reverse and remand for trial.
smith was employed as an assistant district attorney ada for the mecklenburg county,north carolina,district attorney office the da office from through july.in his last several years with the da office,he worked on the team.peter gilchrist was the elected district attorney da during smith tenure.
in february,smith met with gilchrist to notify him of his intention to declare his candidacy for the office of mecklenburg county district court judge.gilchrist initially told smith that to run for the office he would need either to resign from his position as ada or take an unpaid leave of absence until the november election.however,smith later brought to gilchrist attention the existence of north carolina general statute b,which smith interpreted as entitling him to run without resigning from his position as an ada.as a result,gilchrist reconsidered and informed smith that he could run for judge without resigning or taking a leave of absence.smith subsequently formalized his candidacy.
a few months later,on his own time and at his own expense,smith attended a course in charlotte that the nonprofit safety and health council of north carolina shc offered to ticketed drivers according to smith,ticketed drivers would receive a pamphlet about the course from the ticketing police officer.drivers who took the course were required to pay court costs and pay to the driving school,but they received a prayer for judgment continued pjc and were not assessed a fine this program substantially reduced the number of cases that the da office and the courts were required to handle,freeing up resources that could be used for other matters.
on friday,july,smith gave an interview to the charlotte fox television affiliate detailing concerns he had about the course.smith gave the interview as a part of his judicial campaign,and it was not related to his responsibilities as an ada in the team,which did not include anything related to traffic court.the following wednesday,gilchrist,having been contacted by the interviewer for a reaction to the criticism by one of his adas regarding the course,called smith to ask if he had given the interview.when smith said he had,gilchrist asked him to come to his office immediately.smith then met with gilchrist and deputy da bart menser in gilchrist office,whereupon the three engaged in a brief conversation.
gilchrist had not seen the interview.rather,smith description of the interview during this meeting was the sole basis for gilchrist knowledge of what smith had said.smith told gilchrist that he gave the interview as part of his campaign for judge,and according to gilchrist,smith voiced three concerns first,that the students of the course were not paying attention second,that law enforcement officers were giving legal advice to ticketed drivers regarding whether they should take the course and third,that some drivers who decided to take the course and receive pjcs were harming themselves by losing the option to obtain a pjc for a future citation.gilchrist testified that none of these concerns had to do with mecklenburg county district attorney policy.see also gilchrist testimony that smith in the interview did not criticize any of gilchrist policies.
in addition to discussing what smith had said during the interview,smith,gilchrist,and menser also discussed smith views generally regarding the program.according to menser,smith explained to gilchrist and menser that smith had issues with the driving school and with the fact that the district attorney office was involved in recommending that people go to the driving school.menser testified that smith told gilchrist and menser that smith did think the driving school was a good idea.
at the end of the conversation,menser asked smith if there were any other policies of the da office with which he disagreed gilchrist testified that smith said that there were,but when smith was asked to identify the specific policies,smith said,i decline to answer.internal quotation marks omitted.the following day,gilchrist terminated smith employment.he did not provide smith with any reason for the termination.he testified,however,that smith refusal to identify the da office policies with which he disagreed was the sole reason he was terminated.gilchrist testified that he considered that refusal to be insubordinate.
smith subsequently brought an action in federal district court seeking money damages against gilchrist in his individual capacity.see.smith alleged that the statements he made during the television interview were a substantial motivation for gilchrist decision to fire him and that the firing violated his rights under the united states and north carolina constitutions.in his answer to the complaint,as is relevant here,gilchrist denied firing smith for making the statements during the interview,and he asserted and qualified immunity.
following discovery,gilchrist moved for summary judgment,arguing only that smith had failed to forecast evidence creating a genuine issue regarding whether the interview was a substantial motivation for gilchrist decision to fire smith.after smith filed a response challenging the asserted lack of evidence,and gilchrist filed a reply,the district court sua sponte requested that the parties brief an issue not previously argued by gilchrist whether qualified immunity provided an absolute defense to smith claims in response to the district court direction,gilchrist again focused on the asserted lack of evidence that smith public statements were a substantial motivation for his firing.gilchrist agreed that i t is uncontested that smith was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern,and there are no relevant facts to challenge finding that smith interest in speaking outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public.nevertheless,gilchrist presented the argument that even assuming smith had created a jury issue regarding causation,gilchrist was entitled to qualified immunity based on the subtlety of the test for determining whether an employee interest in speaking as a private citizen on a matter of public concern is outweighed by the employer interest in efficiency.see dimeglio haines,cir o nly infrequently will it be clearly established that a public employee speech on a matter of public concern is constitutionally protected,because the relevant inquiry requires a particularized balancing that is subtle,difficult to apply,and not yet.internal quotation marks omitted.gilchrist contended that because smith interview criticized the policies of the office for which he worked,a reasonable official in the da position might have believed he was constitutionally justified in firing smith for making the statements.in smith supplemental brief,as is relevant here,smith noted that gilchrist had conceded that the statements were protected,and smith repeated his view that there was a genuine factual issue regarding gilchrist motivation for firing him.
the district court then granted summary judgment to gilchrist.see smith gilchrist,cv rjc dlh,wl.in so doing,the court assumed that smith had created a jury issue regarding whether his constitutional rights had been violated,but concluded that gilchrist was entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable official in gilchrist position could have believed that the interest of the da office as employer in suppressing smith speech outweighed smith interest in speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.see id.at.the court concluded that the same reasons entitled gilchrist to immunity on the claim.see id.at.
smith first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on his first amendment claim.we agree.

to survive a claim of qualified immunity,a plaintiff must satisfy the following test the allegations underlying the claim,if true,substantiate a violation of a federal statutory or constitutional right and this violation was of a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have known.ridpath board of governors marshall,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has observed that the outcome of the clearly established test depends largely upon the level of generality at which the relevant legal rule is to be identified.wilson layne,internal quotation marks omitted.for that reason,the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established.id.at.
here,smith has alleged a violation of his first amendment rights to free speech.the first amendment to the united states constitution,in relevant part,provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.the fourteenth amendment makes this prohibition applicable to the states.see fisher king,cir.not only does the first amendment protect freedom of speech,it also protects the right to be free from retaliation by a public official for the exercise of that right.suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir.protection of the public interest in having debate on matters of public importance is at the heart of the first amendment.mcvey stacy,cir.at the same time,the government,as an employer,is entitled to maintain discipline and ensure harmony as necessary to the operation and mission of its agencies.and for this purpose,the government has an interest in regulating the speech of its employees.id.citation omitted.
the supreme court in connick myers,and pickering board of education,has explained how the rights of public employees to speak as private citizens must be balanced against the interest of the government in ensuring its effective and efficient operation.in light of these competing interests,we have held that in order for an adverse employment action to violate a public employee first amendment rights to freedom of speech,it must be the case that the employee was speaking as a citizen upon a matter of public concern rather than as an employee about a matter of personal interest that his interest in speaking upon the matter of public concern outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public and that his speech was a substantial factor in the employer decision to take action against him.mcvey,at.
this appeal concerns the second prong of the mcvey test whether the employee interest in speaking upon the matter of public concern outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public.id.at.that smith was speaking on matters of public concern during the interview is clear and is not challenged by gilchrist.see urofsky gilmore,cir en banc speech involves a matter of public concern when it involves an issue of social,political,or other interest to a community.that ticketed drivers are not paying attention in their defensive driving class is of obvious interest to the community,see goldstein chestnut ridge volunteer fire,cir explaining that statements relating to public safety are quintessential matters of public concern,as are the facts that police officers are improperly providing legal advice,see robinson balog,cir holding that speech exposing actual or potential wrongdoing is speech on a matter of public concern internal quotation marks omitted,and that some ticketed drivers are unwittingly making decisions that are contrary to their legal interests.accordingly,smith could not be fired for making the statements he made unless his right to speak was outweighed by his employer legitimate interests.
regarding this balancing,the government bears the burden of justifying the discharge on legitimate grounds.rankin mcpherson.the balancing test requires us to consider the context in which the speech was made,including the employee role and the extent to which the speech impairs the efficiency of the workplace.see id.at.
factors relevant to this inquiry include whether a public employee speech impaired the maintenance of discipline by supervisors impaired harmony among coworkers damaged close personal relationships impeded the performance of the public employee duties interfered with the operation of the agency undermined the mission of the agency was communicated to the public or to coworkers in private conflicted with the responsibilities of the employee within the agency and abused the authority and public accountability that the employee role entailed.
ridpath,at.in balancing the competing interests,we do not require the public employer to prove that the employee speech actually disrupted efficiency,but only that an adverse effect was reasonably to be apprehended.maciariello sumner,cir quoting jurgensen fairfax,cir.whether the employee interest in speaking outweighs the government interest is a question of law for the court.see joyner lancaster,cir.
gilchrist conceded in the district court with good reason that smith had forecasted evidence sufficient to establish that his interest in speaking outweighed the government.see t here are no relevant facts to challenge finding that smith interest in speaking outweighed the government interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public.gilchrist,after all,had agreed in his deposition that none of the concerns smith expressed in the interview had to do with mecklenburg county district attorney office policy or in any way impugned the authority or credibility of the da office,and gilchrist had testified that he did not consider the decision to give the interview to be disloyal to the da office.indeed,there is no evidence that the concerns expressed during the interview even pertained to circumstances within gilchrist control.the concerns related to the in the shc classroom,improper legal advice by police officers,and ticketed drivers making decisions that were not in their legal best interests and,there was no evidence that smith sought to place any blame on gilchrist during the interview for any of these actions.there simply was no evidence that smith public statements would cause problems with harmony or discipline in the da office such that the efficiency of the office would be expected to be adversely affected.
nor was there any evidence that gilchrist had any reason to believe that smith interview would negatively affect the efficiency or effectiveness of the da office.gilchrist testified that he felt,since the defensive driving program was responsible for such a significant reduction of the da office caseload,that any criticism of the shc necessarily impacted the da s office.but gilchrist offered no explanation of,or support for,his belief.this attempt to connect what smith said to the da office is such a stretch as to be entitled to no weight at all and leads us to agree with gilchrist initial assessment that no relevant facts
