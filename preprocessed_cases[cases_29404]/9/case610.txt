this appeal involves a unique provision of the age discrimination in employment act adea.a federal employee or a disappointed applicant for federal use the term federal employee throughout this opinion as a shorthand to cover both classes of wishes to pursue an adea claim has a right,not available to other adea claimants,to bypass the administrative process and go directly to a federal district court.see id.c d.the sole issue to be decided in this appeal concerns the limitations period that applies to such actions.
the only appellate court to have addressed this issue thus far chose to borrow the limitations period used for title vii actions.see edwards shalala,cir citing c.reluctant though we are to create a circuit split,we part company with the edwards court and hold that when a federal employee opts to bypass the administrative process and pursue an adea claim directly in the district court,the applicable limitations period should be borrowed from the fair labor standards act flsa,a.that period,which extends for at least two years from the date of the allegedly discriminatory act or practice,is longer than either the limitations period contained in title vii or the hybrid period fashioned by the lower court.see rossiter potter,d,accordingly,we reverse the order dismissing the plaintiff complaint as and remand for further proceedings.
background 
since this appeal deals primarily with matters of timing,a thumbnail sketch of the facts will suffice.we draw that sketch mindful that an appellate court reviews a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,applying the same legal standards that bind the trial court.banco santander in re colonial mortgage bankers,cir.consequently,we assume the truth of all facts contained in the complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences therefrom to the plaintiff behoof.id.
in or around,paul rossiter sought employment with the united states postal service usps.after passing the usps preliminary screens including a written examination and a drug test,rossiter was interviewed by steve froio,a usps hierarch.although rossiter had years of experience in the service industry,the usps refrained from contacting any of his references.this did not bode well for rossiter prospects,and in early january he received a letter stating that he would not be hired.
rossiter pursued the matter.on january,froio told him that he had been rejected because he seemed nervous during the interview.froio added that i f rossiter were years younger,being nervous would have been acceptable.when rossiter suggested that he was being denied employment on account of his age,froio replied it did help you any.rossiter requested that his application be reconsidered,but froio told him that reconsideration was impracticable as no more positions were available.less than ten days later,however,rossiter received correspondence announcing that the usps was still seeking to hire people in the job category for which he had unsuccessfully applied.
at age,rossiter was a member of the class protected by the adea.see a.convinced that he had been denied employment by reason of age discrimination,he contacted the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in.following an initial meeting,rossiter submitted an informal complaint.he later agreed to participate in mediation,which took place on may.nothing was resolved.

discussion 
the path that we must travel has been.when congress creates a cause of action but is silent as to the limitations period that should apply to the right is the case in judicial task is to borrow the most appropriate rule of timeliness from some other source.delcostello int l of teamsters,d.after careful review of the evolution of the adea and its various enforcement schemes,we conclude that the flsa provides the most analogous rule of timeliness for adea actions brought by federal employees who opt to bypass the administrative process.
a guide to the statutory scheme 
every journey is best understood if it begins with a roadmap.congress passed the adea with a view toward ending workplace discrimination based on age.as originally enacted in,the statute reached only private employers.see,b,stat.see also lehman nakshian,d.seven years later,congress elongated the adea reach to include governmental employers federal,state,and local.see,stat.see also nakshian,at.to accomplish this augmentation,congress broadened the adea stock definition of employer to include state and local governments,thereby subjecting such employers to the enforcement mechanisms contained in the general statutory scheme.see,a,stat.see also nakshian,at.federal employers,however,were treated differently they were added in an entirely new and distinct statutory that contained its own enforcement mechanisms.see fair labor standards amendments of,b,stat,codified at see also nakshian,at.this dichotomy persists.
the general provisions of the adea applicable to private employers and to state and local governments originally embodied an enforcement scheme that resembled the flsa.see lavery marsh,cir.this included incorporation of the flsa statute of limitations.e amended incorporating by reference.the flsa model set a limitations period of two years after the date of injury for general violations and three years for willful violations.see id.a.
in,congress removed the flsa incorporated statute of limitations from this portion of the adea and inserted a limitations scheme akin to that governing title vii actions.see civil rights act of,stat,codified as amended at e.under this reconstructed framework,there is no external requirement that a federal civil action predicated on an adea violation be filed within a specified time following the date of the discriminatory act or practice rather,the applicable timing requirements relate to,and derive from,the administrative process.an employee must file an administrative complaint within days of the alleged discrimination in order to preserve his or her claim.d.this filing vivifies the administrative process,and the date of injury has no further bearing on the question of timeliness.the applicable limitations period begins to run at the end of the administrative process from that point,the employee has days within which to bring suit.id.e.
the legislative scheme for adea claims brought by federal employees is materially different.congress provided dual means of enforcement for federal workers and left the choice between them to the claimant.on the one hand,a federal employee may invoke the eeoc administrative process and thereafter file suit if he or she is dissatisfied with the administrative outcome.see id.b c see also stevens dep t of treasury,d.on the other hand,a federal employee may bypass the administrative process altogether and file a civil action directly in the federal district court.see c d see also stevens,at.in that event,the only preconditions are i that no civil action may be commenced by any individual under this section until the individual has given the eeoc not less than thirty days notice of an intent to file such action,and ii that s uch notice shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.d see stevens,at.reaffirming these preconditions.
the bottom line is that the section of the adea limning the rights of federal employees contains no express statute of limitations.indeed,that section says nothing about the outside date for the filing of suit regardless of whether an employee has elected to undergo or to bypass the administrative process.courts have been left to intuit the rules of timeliness applicable to such adea actions,and those rules must be borrowed from an exogenous source.see stevens,at.devising an appropriate limitations period is rarely here,the duality of the means of enforcement exacerbates the difficulty of the task.
adea bypass actions why title vii limitations period does not fit 
the borrowing equation differs in each of the two configurations that congress has provided.in cases in which a federal employee opts for the administrative process,this most often agreed that the title vii limitations period is the most analogous and,therefore,have elected to import it.see,burzynski cohen,cir jones runyon,cir long frank,cir lavery,at.but see lubniewski lehman,cir applying limitations period borrowed from a.this importation makes good sense because when a federal employee elects to enter the administrative process,the adea and title vii enforcement schemes are homologous.moreover,in such a situation the federal employee is pursuing essentially the same route that congress has prescribed for employees,and,thus,there is every reason to borrow a compatible rule of timeliness.
this relatively straightforward answer does not resolve the materially different question of where to derive an appropriate rule of timeliness when a federal employee elects to bypass the administrative process and file an adea suit directly in the district court in that situation,stevens forecloses the importation of title vii limitations period.we explain briefly.
in stevens,the supreme court observed that the statutory provision authorizing the bypass option,d,calls for a notice of not less than days to the eeoc of an intent to sue,and that the notice shall be filed with the eeoc within days of the alleged unlawful practice.at.finding these two requirements satisfied,the court asked whether there were any other bases upon which the suit could be considered.id.at.noting that the statute does not expressly impose any additional limitations period for a complaint of age discrimination,the justices concluded that congress intended that an appropriate limitations period should be borrowed from state or federal law.id.although poised to decide which rule of timeliness should be borrowed for use in connection with c d,the court refrained from making that decision.it explained that there was no need to decide the question because stevens had filed his suit one year and six days after the allegedly discriminatory interval that was well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action.id.at.quoting respondents brief.
we think that this decision can only be read as a definitive rejection of the importation of title vii limitations period into the framework established by c d.we base this conclusion on two principal lines of reasoning.first,the entire focus of the stevens court inquiry was on the date of the alleged discrimination as the accrual date for limitations purposes.under title vii,the relevant date would have borne some relation to final agency action,or at least to the expiration of the notice period.
perhaps more title vii temporal requirements were to be applied to bypass actions,stevens claim would have been.stevens served a notice of intent to sue on october,and filed suit on may.stevens,at.were title vii to be the source of the borrowing,a federal employee who elected to bypass the administrative process would have no more than days from the filing of his notice within which to commence a civil action.see edwards,at finding that title vii limitations period would begin to run no later than the expiration of the waiting period following the filing of a notice of intent to sue rossiter,d at same.since stevens started suit more than days after he filed his notice of intent to sue,the supreme court could not have found his suit timely unless it rejected the proposed incorporation of title vii limitations period into the adea bypass scheme.
to be sure,the government resists this conclusion.it suggests that the court stevens suit had been brought well within whatever statute of limitations might apply,at.mere dictum and that,in all events,the point was never fully litigated.we reject these importunings.
first and foremost,when a statement in a judicial decision is essential to the result reached in the case,it becomes part of the court holding.see seminole tribe florida,d defining as binding both the court result and those portions of the opinion necessary to that result.consequently,the stevens court statement was not dictum 
we also dismiss the government attempt to sidestep stevens on the basis that the statute of limitations issue was never fully litigated.that asseveration depends on the premise that the court statement that stevens suit had been brought well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action,at,was merely a recitation of the government concession.that premise is faulty.although the government accepted stevens position on the question,the supreme court did not stop there but chose to decide the issue,recognizing that a final determination was essential to the outcome of the litigation see at.in other words,the supreme court resolved that the limitations issue was properly before we decline to the legal effect of that resolution.
if more were we doubt that it policy considerations support the result reached by the stevens court.title vii limitations period is entirely derivative of,and dictated by,the administrative process.the limitations period begins to run upon final agency action.the bypass procedure,however,is a horse of a vastly different hue.see burnett grattan,d discussing how going through an administrative process differs from filing a claim directly in court and noting,inter alia,that borrowing an administrative statute of limitations for use in the latter situation ignores the congressional determination that the claim belongs in court.because bypass actions involve no final agency action,it would be anomalous to impress them with a title rule of timeliness.
the government attempts to parry this thrust by noting that the eeoc must receive notice of a federal employee intent to sue in a bypass case.that is indisputably true,see d,but it is beside the point.this notice is a event that bears no real resemblance to the processing and resolution of an administrative complaint.in a traditional adea case,the administrative process,once begun,takes center stage until an administrative outcome is reached.by that time,the case is likely to be fully developed.permitting a short window of opportunity within which to file suit makes sense when that window follows a final agency determination.in that context,the short window of time is actually more like a right to appeal than a statute of rights of appeal often have a severely limited shelf life.see,a delineating a appeal period.requiring petitions for certiorari to be filed within days after judgment fed.requiring generally that a notice of appeal be filed within ten days of a bankruptcy court order.moreover,the administrative process is often lengthy and,thus,starting the limitations period from the date of injury would run the risk of allowing the expiration of the time for suit despite best efforts on the employee part.
these justifications are utterly absent in adea bypass cases.there is no required agency action and no persuasive rationale for linking a rule of timeliness to the time of agency notification.viewed holistically,bypass cases are more like traditional civil suits,in which limitations periods begin to run at the time of the injury.we think it is hardly coincidental that this is the precise locus on which the stevens court focused.
edwards does not persuade us to the opposite view.there,a panel of the eleventh circuit ruled that the applicable limitations period for adea actions brought pursuant to section c d should be imported from title vii.edwards,at.although the panel paid lip service to stevens,it
