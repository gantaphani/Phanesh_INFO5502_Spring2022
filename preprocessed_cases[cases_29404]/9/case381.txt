following a jury verdict in an employment discrimination case premised on a claim of political connivance,the district court used its equitable powers to augment the verdict.that action,along with the court refusal to allow the affected public corporation to intervene in the proceedings,have produced a series of conundra,with which we must now grapple.
after careful consideration of a meandering record,we reverse the court grant of equitable relief in the nature of both reinstatement and backpay.recognizing,however,that there is still work to be these particular facts,the issue of reinstatement is potentially subject to vacate its order denying intervention to the agency and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we rehearse here only the bare facts needed to place these appeals into perspective.in charting this course,we assume the reader familiarity with our earlier opinion in santiago,cir,which involves this litigation and which provides useful background information.
this case,like many political discrimination cases,traces its genesis to the changing of the guard.the precipitating event in this instance was puerto rico general election,which resulted in the replacement of a new progressive party npp governor with one backed by the popular democratic party.
the governor installed carlos santiago as director of the commercial development administration cda.within weeks of his appointment,santiago personally dismissed two of the plaintiffs,maribel negrón and aracelis gascot.he also approved the decision by his subordinate,susana hernández,to dismiss the third plaintiff,nilda pérez.
the trio brought suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico their complaint rested on the premise that they had been fired for reasons relating to their membership in the npp,in violation of the first amendment,the fourteenth amendment,and local law.the complaint described the plaintiffs federal claims as being brought pursuant to and sought a gaggle of remedies,including compensatory damages,punitive damages,backpay,front pay,declaratory relief,and injunctive relief,reinstatement.
santiago was the only defendant sued in his official capacity and the only defendant against whom the plaintiffs demanded injunctive relief.he was also sued in his individual capacity,as was hernández and another cda functionary,vilma jiménez.
on march,the district court entered a summary judgment order,which addressed the claims brought against santiago in his official capacity.the order stated 
as to plaintiffs section cause of action against the named defendants in their official capacity,i t is well settled that neither a state agency nor a state official acting in his official capacity may be sued for damages in a section action.wang bd.of registration in,cir citing johnson rodríguez,cir.this is so because did not abrogate an unconsenting state eleventh amendment immunity from being sued in damages in federal court.estado libre asociado de,d.the court need not go further.accordingly,plaintiffs section claims against the named defendants in their official capacities must be dismissed.
at an ensuing trial,the district court twice granted motions for judgment as a matter of law.first,at the end of the plaintiffs case in chief it granted jiménez free passage with respect to all claims against her.see.a.second,at the close of all the evidence it directed a verdict in favor of the remaining defendants santiago and hernández in their individual capacities on the remaining claims.id.
the plaintiffs appealed from the latter order.they could have,but did not,appeal the earlier summary judgment.we concluded that the evidence proffered against santiago and hernández was sufficient to reach the jury and,therefore,reversed the order from which the appeal had been taken.see,at.
the parties retried the case.on march,the district court submitted it to a jury.in pertinent part,the court instructions on damages informed the jurors,without objection from either side,that y ou should consider the following elements of damages to the extent you find them proved by a preponderance of the evidence,and no others net lost wages and benefits to the date of the trial the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs,awarding them both compensatory and punitive damages.
a flurry of motions ensued,beginning with the plaintiffs motion for an assortment of equitable relief.that relief included reinstatement to their former positions and retroactive contributions to their retirement and social security accounts.the defendants objected on various grounds,noting among other things that the requested relief was unavailable because the commonwealth was not a party to the action and no defendant remained before the court.the defendants also argued that,in the circumstances at hand,reinstatement was inappropriate.
on april,the district court rejected the defendants arguments and granted the requested relief.the court specified that reinstatement should include benefits in the government employees retirement system and the social security administration.the court declared that it was never its intention to bar plaintiffs from seeking and obtaining equitable relief at the time of the dismissal of their monetary claims against defendants in their official capacities.
within ten days,the defendants moved for clarification.they later characterized this motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment,see.e a characterization that we accept.no matter how a party titles it,a motion made within ten days of the entry of judgment that questions the correctness of a judgment is properly construed as a motion to alter or amend judgment under.e.global naps,verizon new,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants motion raised eleventh amendment concerns and queried whether the benefits awarded were meant to be retroactive.the plaintiffs served an opposition that denigrated the defendants eleventh amendment concerns and supported retroactive application of the order for benefits.the defendants filed a,in which they cited this court opinion in aquino,cir,for the proposition that backpay could not be awarded against an individual employee but only against an employer.
the district court overrode the defendants objections and confirmed that it had intended to grant,and was granting,retroactive benefits against the defendants in their individual capacities.the court shrugged off the statement in to the effect that a backpay award must be paid by or on behalf of the employer by definition,id.at,saying that the court there already had determined that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and,thus,the quoted statement was dictum.
in a closely related disposition,made on the same day,the court denied a motion to intervene filed by the puerto rico trade and export company comex.that aspect of the court ruling deserves further amplification.
comex,a public corporation,see laws ann.tit,is arguably the to the cda the extent to which that is so is a matter in dispute among the parties,and we do not purpose to resolve it here.comex filed its motion to intervene approximately one month after the district court initial grant of equitable relief.it suggested that the motion was timely in light of the fact that it had no notice of its exposure until the district court suddenly resurrected the previously dismissed claims against santiago in his official capacity comex maintained that,given this unexpected turn of events,it deserved an opportunity to oppose reinstatement and other forms of equitable relief that it would have to effectuate.
in an accompanying rule e motion,filed provisionally,comex contended that any grant of equitable relief had to be annulled because i neither it nor the cda was a party to the action and ii the district court lacked authority to revisit its summary judgment that terminated the claims against santiago.alternatively,comex argued that it was not the same entity as the cda which no longer existed and that no proper substitution of parties had been effected.see.c,d.
the district court branded comex attempt to intervene untimely on the ground that,notwithstanding the wording of the court earlier order,the claims against santiago for injunctive relief had never been dismissed.therefore,the cda interest and,thus,comex interest had been implicated throughout the litigation.in so holding,the court stressed that,in its order,it had intended to terminate only the section claims for damages.the court did not reach the arguments advanced in comex provisional rule e motion,but it did criticize comex decision to wait a full month after the initial award of equitable relief before seeking to intervene.
these timely appeals followed.one,prosecuted by comex,challenges the denial of its motion to intervene.the other,prosecuted by the defendants,disputes their liability for the aforedescribed equitable relief.the jury award of compensatory and punitive damages is conceded.
ii.analysis 
we begin with the question of intervention comex appeal and then move to the question of backpay the defendants appeal.
intervention.
the parties agree that comex motion to intervene seeks intervention as of right and is,therefore,governed by.a.we thus constrain our review to a search for an abuse of discretion.pub.serv.of patch,cir banco popular greenblatt,cir.that same standard of review governs a district court subsidiary findings regarding timeliness.see greenblatt,at narragansett indian tribe ribo,cir.
abuse of discretion is a relatively deferential standard of review.under it,we may not reverse a determination simply because we,if sitting as a court of first instance,would have weighed the relevant considerations differently.iragorri int l elevator,cir.that does not mean,however,that the standard is a rubber stamp,counseling affirmance of every discretionary decision made by a trial court.to the contrary 
a district court may abuse its discretion if it fails to consider a significant factor in the decisional calculus,if it relies on an improper factor in working that calculus,or if it considers all the appropriate factors but makes a serious error in judgment as to their relative weight.within this framework,an error of law is always tantamount to an abuse of discretion.
cir internal citation omitted.
here,moreover,we are dealing with a claim for intervention as of right.where that modality is concerned,the district court discretion is somewhat more circumscribed than in the context of intervention generally.see patch,at int l paper inhabitants of town of jay,cir citing stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d brennan,concurring.
the case law applying rule a reflects a preference for multipartite tests as part of a district court analysis.see,travelers indem.dingwell,cir.one of these seems particularly pertinent here a intervenor as of right must satisfy a test focusing on whether it has i made a timely motion,ii demonstrated a sufficient stake in the ongoing suit,iii showed that resolution of the suit in its absence somehow threatens to prejudice its interests,and iv negated the likelihood that some other party can be expected adequately to protect its interests.see fernández,kellogg usa,cir patch,at.a failure to satisfy any one of these criteria is fatal to the motion.see fernández,at patch,at.
the only factor analyzed by the district court was the timeliness of the proposed intervention.especially where,as here,the proposed intervention the entry of judgment,timeliness is a crucial element in the rule a calculus.see greenblatt,at.although judgments as to timeliness depend on the totality of the circumstances,a number of factors serve to structure and guide that analysis.these include the length of time the applicant knew or reasonably should have known that its interest was imperilled before it moved to intervene,a quantification of the foreseeable prejudice to existing parties if intervention is granted,and a similar quantification of the foreseeable prejudice to the applicant if intervention is denied.id.at see culbreath dukakis,cir.
these guideposts are standard in this case,there is a special twist.almost every aspect of the district court timeliness analysis depends on the interpretation of its order granting summary judgment in favor of santiago in his official capacity.in denying intervention,the court relied upon the premise that the order did not terminate the plaintiffs claims for reinstatement and other equitable relief that comex ought to have known as much and that,therefore,comex should have tried to intervene years before.in order to evaluate the plausibility of this reasoning,we must as a first step distill the meaning of the order.only then can we decide whether the lower court timeliness determination and,thus,its denial of intervention constitutes an abuse of discretion.
district court orders are documents of considerable import.a district court speaks to the parties and the court of appeals primarily through its orders.see in re thinking machs,cir explaining that c ourt orders are customarily important events in the life of a judicial proceeding they are the primary means through which courts speak advance fin.isla rica sales,cir similar.thus,the phrasing of a court order is significant.when that phraseology is imprecise,there may be some play in the joints.for example,a reviewing court can comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court intention.see,weyerhaeuser wyatt,cir subsalve usa watson,cir see also martha vineyard scuba hq.unidentified vessel,cir explaining that some deference is due to the writing judge in elucidating the meaning and intendment of an imprecise or ambiguous order.but when a court order is clear and unambiguous,neither a party nor a reviewing court can disregard its plain language simply as a matter of guesswork or in an effort to suit interpretive convenience.alstom caribe,geo.reintjes,cir see lefkowitz fair,cir enforcing district court order that contained not the slightest ambiguity over a claim that the authoring judge must have meant something different.
the short of it is that,absent amendment or vacation,a court must carry out and enforce an order that is clear and unambiguous on its face,whether or not the inscribed language reflects the court recollection of its actual intent.see united states spallone,cir.put another way,unless and until a clear and unambiguous order is amended or the court below eschewed that course a court must adopt,and give effect to,the order plain meaning.id.internal quotation marks omitted see in re gypsum,cir.
in this instance,the plaintiffs suggest that we should interpret the district court order as leaving intact their claims for injunctive relief against santiago in his official capacity.they concede that the language of the order is inhospitable to this reading but cite three supposedly ameliorative facts.first,they note that the district court itself took this view of the order three years after entering it.second,they observe that the case law cited in the to the order deals with the prohibition against bringing section claims for damages against state actors in their official capacities.third,they assert that,at least once after,the district court referred to santiago as the director of the cda.
in the circumstances of this case,this of random facts lacks force.the order stated unambiguously and with conspicuous clarity that the plaintiffs section claims against the defendants in their official capacities must be dismissed excess capitalization omitted.this statement was made categorically and without any apparent limitation.the only section claims that had been pleaded against any party in his or her official capacity were the claims pleaded against santiago for injunctive relief.viewed against this backdrop,the wording of the order is clear on its the plaintiffs suggested reading would render the affected portion of the order nugatory.we therefore decline the plaintiffs invitation to sanction a kafkaesque interpretation of the order that stands plain meaning on its head.
accordingly,we conclude that when the district court terminated the plaintiffs section official capacity claims,the claim for reinstatement fell out of the case.comex had no reason to believe that its interests,as opposed to the interests of the individual defendants,were implicated in the ongoing litigation.
the fact that the case law cited in the text of the order focused primarily on claims for damages does not get the plaintiffs very far.a party faced with a clear and unambiguous court order has no duty to look behind it.see d judgments explaining that a trial court reasons form no part of the judgment itself.moreover,to the extent that there was any room for doubt that the order meant exactly what it said,it was the burden of the doubters here,the plaintiffs to ask the district court in a timely fashion to clarify the scope of the order.see wyatt,at.the plaintiffs failed to do that failure estops them from now alleging the existence of a hidden ambiguity.see glover johnson,cir.
finally,the district court reference to santiago as the director of the cda is unavailing.taken in context,that use of santiago title was in all probability intended as a gesture of respect rather than a description of his precise legal status in the suit 
at oral argument before us,the plaintiffs advanced a new and different theory for upholding the district court denial of intervention.they posited that even if the order dismissed all the section claims,their complaint nevertheless contained an implicit cause of action under ex parte young.that cause of action,they maintain,suffices to support the award of reinstatement.
the doctrinal roots of ex parte young run deep.for roughly a century,that decision has stood for the proposition that the eleventh amendment does not prevent federal courts from granting prospective injunctive relief to prevent a continuing violation of federal law,in part because a suit challenging the constitutionality of a state official action in enforcing state law is not one against the state.green mansour,d.but a legal doctrine can not be viewed in a vacuum more important than doctrine here is the commonsense principle that a litigant can not freely reinvent his case as he goes along.
the plaintiffs complaint made an explicit representation that their claims for injunctive relief were being brought under section given the sweep of that statute,recognizing a separate implicit cause of action under the aegis of ex parte young would serve simply to introduce a useless artifice into the act of pleading.ex hypothesi,the ex parte young cause of action that the plaintiffs now say they impliedly pleaded would provide no different rights than were already available to them under section.to recognize such a cause of action on these facts would,therefore,serve only to pervert the legitimate goals of notice pleading.
there is a second,equally impassable,obstacle that bars the plaintiffs belated assertion of an ex parte young theory.the record reveals that this theory was not briefed on appeal.consequently,it has been waived.see united states houlihan,cir noting settled appellate rule that issues not briefed and properly developed on appeal are waived martínez colón,cir same united states hadfield,cir same.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we conclude that the district court was bound by the plain meaning of the order the court misinterpreted the order that interpretive bevue influenced its finding as to timeliness including its comments as to prejudice,which were clearly tied to the court conclusion that comex should have known of its stake in the litigation since at least and that tainted finding,in turn,led to the denial of intervention.
the plaintiffs have a fallback position.they note the district court observation that the motion to intervene was filed one month after the court initial grant of equitable relief.under the peculiar circumstances of this the district court incorrect reading of its period of delay is so slight as not to render that intervention motion untimely.see,united airlines,mcdonald,d reversing denial of intervention sought within the time limit for appealing the judgment geiger foley hoag llp ret.plan,cir finding rule a motion timely when intervenor waited roughly one month after receiving notice that her interest had suddenly fallen into jeopardy see also dimond.
this disposes of the question of intervention.for the reasons discussed above,the order refusing intervention must be vacated.
equitable relief backpay.
we turn next to the district court denial of the defendants motion to alter or amend the judgment.a trial court disposition of a rule e motion engenders review for abuse of discretion.see río mar,lp uhs of,cir aybar,cir.within that rubric however,abstract questions of law receive de novo review.pérez volvo car,cir.that is important because a court material error of law is invariably an abuse of its discretion.see río mar,at,cir.
in the matter at hand,the defendants postulate that the district court committed two errors of law,both of which relate to the award of retroactive contributions toward the plaintiffs retirement and social security accounts.this award was faulty,the defendants say,because such redress i can not be granted against supervisors who are sued only in their individual capacities and ii amounted to a double recovery.this latter point derives from the district court instruction to the jury to include lost benefits in its calculation of compensatory damages.
the plaintiffs initial rejoinder is that neither of these arguments has been preserved for appellate review.as to the first argument,the plaintiffs are plainly incorrect.the rule is that if an argument is raised belatedly in the district court but that court,without reservation,elects to decide it on the merits,the argument is deemed preserved for later appellate review.see,me.green party me.sec y of state,cir united states lombard,cir.so it is here although the defendants did not raise this status argument until they filed their,the district court opted to address the argument.no more is exigible to preserve the point for appellate review.thus,we proceed to the merits.
it is settled law in the federal courts that backpay as such can not be awarded against a defendant in his or her individual capacity.see,police protective league gates,cir lenea lane,cir dwyer regan,cir.by definition,backpay is an award against an employer and,thus,any demand for backpay from an defendant is a.see fred aponte roque,cir,at.this makes perfect sense a suit for backpay,even one brought under a cause of action such as that supplied by section,necessarily stems from the contract of contract to which the defendant was never a party.see omosegbon wells,cir police,at observing that allowing awards of backpay against supervisors would thwart the policies underlying the qualified immunity doctrine.
as the plaintiffs point out,our previous decisions on this point discuss retroactive awards of wages and benefits,but do not specifically address retirement or social security contributions.see,at.but the logic that prohibits the imposition of the former against an defendant applies with equal force to the imposition of the latter.the concept of backpay is not monolithic but,rather,encompasses a panoply of items.rasimas.dep t of mental health,cir observing in title vii case that backpay includes s ick leave,vacation pay,pension benefits and other fringe benefits the claimant would have received but for discrimination.one common denominator,however,is that all species of backpay are improper forms of relief when imposed upon a defendant who is sued only in his or her individual capacity.
lest the cynical among us suggest that cold logic has robbed the plaintiffs of their just desserts,we hasten to add that this rule is in no way inequitable.while backpay as such can not be imposed upon an defendant,a successful plaintiff is nonetheless entitled to receive compensatory damages against such a defendant.see,cir holding that lost wages are a form of legal redress to be awarded by the jury,not equitable relief to be awarded by the judge,in a section action for a politically discriminatory firing.properly proven,those damages will equal the grand total of the plaintiff aggregate lost wages and benefits.see,at.indeed,the district court jury instructions in this very
