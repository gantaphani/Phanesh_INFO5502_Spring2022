docs also provides an expedited process for complaints of inmate harassment or other misconduct by prison employees.the requirements of this expedited procedure are contested by the parties to this case.at the time the incidents alleged by the plaintiff occurred,relevant docs regulations stated 
a.an inmate who feels that he has been the victim of employee misconduct or harassment should first report such occurrences to the immediate supervisor of that employee.this does not preclude submission of a formal grievance.
all allegations of employee misconduct shall be given a grievance calendar number and recorded in sequence with all other grievances all documents submitted with the allegation must be forwarded to the superintendent by the close of business that day.

facts and procedural history 
hemphill made the following allegations in his complaint.on november,as he was returning to his cell from a medical appointment,hemphill was stopped by corrections officer co miller,who said he wished to speak with him.cos miller,boss,and straley then escorted hemphill to a room,where co surber was waiting.co surber ordered hemphill to enter,at which time co gunderman grabbed hemphill,slammed him into a chair,slapped him,and placed his knee in hemphill groin while surber pressed his elbow into hemphill neck and said,you know what you did,admit it,you better drop it.the chair tipped over,and hemphill fell to the floor.as surber and gunderman put their weight on hemphill,surber allegedly repeated,you know what you did,admit it.the two cos then lifted him from the floor,slammed him into a wall,and punched him in his stomach,back,and side.co kelly came into the room and pushed hemphill head down.
during the alleged assault,hemphill says he asked,what are you talking about drop what the only thing that i did was file a notice of intention to file a claim upon the attorney general.hemphill inquired of surber,is that what you and your punk ass friends beat me up for after repeating you know what you did,you better drop it,surber informed hemphill that he would be placed in keeplock,and instructed gunderman,kelly,boss,and miller to escort hemphill to his cell.hemphill told surber he wanted to go to the facility medical clinic,and surber allegedly responded,shut up and go to your cell,you keep lock.
after some time passed,co straley allegedly went to hemphill cell and told him he was not,in fact,under keeplock.hemphill says he asked straley for medical attention,but she ignored his request.subsequently,he obtained a pass to the clinic from another officer.on his way to the clinic,he encountered co gunderman,who allegedly demanded,what do you think you doing when hemphill presented his pass and indicated he was on his way to the clinic,gunderman allegedly responded,no you not,get in here.gunderman then took hemphill back to the room where he initially had been assaulted.surber was there,and punched hemphill in the stomach,saying,i gave you a break by not writing you up for sexual harassment on a female officer,but you want to be stupid.at some point during the assault,hemphill asked what he had done,and surber told hemphill that he knew hemphill had sexually harassed straley by ask ing her for a kiss.surber and gunderman then allegedly beat plaintiff down to the ground.
according to hemphill,sergeant williams entered the room at this point but did not intervene when hemphill requested his help in calling off the officers.after surber allegedly punched hemphill again in the ribs,williams left the room.sergeant keyser came into the room and hemphill was ordered to place his hands against the wall.he says surber then pressed his head into the wall and stated,if you want to write this up you do it from shu special housing unit.surber said he had given the plaintiff a break by not bringing charges against him and threatened that if hemphill pursue d this any further,surber would bring criminal charges against him for assaulting an officer.surber warned that he had officers who would testify to that effect.straley subsequently entered the room,and said,that him.he asked me for a kiss.surber then stated,you better make up your mind right now,drop it or go to the box and face criminal charges.you do go to the clinic,you do do nothing but drop it if you re lying i will have all my night officers watching your every move.if you go to the clinic,i will know about it and then i make your life a living hell throughout this penal system because i have friends all over.hemphill asserted in his complaint that with fear of being assaulted by the defendants he agree d to their threats so that he would be tortur ed any more.
in april,hemphill apparently wrote a letter to the green haven superintendent,christopher artuz,which was submitted to the district court but never placed in the record,for reasons that are not clear.in her report and recommendation of july,the magistrate judge described the letter as follows this letter informs the superintendent that plaintiff intends to bring criminal charges against the corrections officers who are named as defendants in the present civil action.the letter states that the named officers assaulted plaintiff on november,covered up the assault by failing to issue the appropriate reports,and deprived plaintiff of medical care on two occasions.
hemphill thereafter brought this suit against the state of new york,cos surber,kelly,gunderman,straley,miller,boss,and sergeant williams.the defendants denied hemphill allegations in their answer.on july,the district court,on sovereign immunity grounds,dismissed hemphill claims against the state of new york and against the individual defendants to the extent that he sought money damages against them in their official capacities.but it left standing hemphill claims brought against the individual defendants,in their private capacities.on december,the defendants moved for summary judgment as to these,arguing that hemphill had not satisfied the plra exhaustion requirement.the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment on hemphill medical indifference claims,but denying it on hemphill excessive force claim both on the merits and because,before the supreme court decided porter nussle,the plra exhaustion requirement was inapplicable to excessive force claims in this circuit.see nussle willette,cir.
on march,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation of january,as to the excessive force claim,but remanded the medical indifference claim to the magistrate judge for further findings.in doing so,the court asked whether hemphill letter to the superintendent qualifies as an attempt to exhaust his administrative remedies as to all his grievances,including his claim of deliberate indifference to his medical needs.the answer,judge mcmahon noted,depended upon the requirements of green haven inmate grievance procedure.
in her july,report and recommendation the magistrate judge,adhering to the earlier recommendation,pointed out that hemphill had acknowledged in his deposition that he had not filed a grievance.she also stated that hemphill had not suggested that he was unaware of the grievance procedure,or that he was directly prevented from utilizing the process.the magistrate judge concluded,inter alia,that hemphill letter to artuz fail ed to comply with the specific and detailed process which an inmate must follow in order to exhaust his or her administrative remedies.
in an april decision and order dismissing hemphill medical indifference claim,judge mcmahon agreed with the magistrate judge,and rejected hemphill argument that his letter to artuz sufficed to exhaust his remedies.artuz failure to respond to hemphill letter did not matter,the court ruled,since hemphill had not followed either the regular grievance procedure,or the expedited process for harassment claims.under this expedited procedure,judge mcmahon wrote,a grievance is filed with both the inmate committee and the harassing employee supervisor.if the grievance raises a bona fide harassment issue as this one would have,level review is bypassed and the matter is sent directly to the superintendent for review.had plaintiff utilized this procedure,any failure by artuz to render a decision on his matter within twelve working days could have been appealed to albany,thus completing the grievance cycle and exhausting his remedies in a matter of weeks.hemphill state of new york,d.even if plaintiff letter could be interpreted as a grievance,the judge observed,it was untimely,and hemphill did not file for an extension of time.id.the district court did not address the question of whether hemphill allegations that cos threatened retribution should he complain about his treatment might excuse his failure to comply with normal procedures.
seven days later,in view of the supreme court decision in porter nussle,the district court dismissed the rest of hemphill complaint on similar exhaustion grounds.hemphill filed a timely notice of appeal.
on april,appellees counsel sent a rule j letter notifying the court that docs had,as of april,amended b,the regulatory provision describing the expedited grievance procedure for complaints about employee harassment,to add the underlined text and delete the bracketed text 
an inmate who wishes to file a grievance complaint that alleges employee harassment shall follow the procedures set forth in section a above.
note an inmate who feels that s he has been the victim of employee misconduct or harassment should first report such occurrences to the immediate supervisor of that employee.however,this is not a prerequisite for filing a grievance with the igp.this does not preclude submission of a formal grievance.
the letter stated that,a s amended,section b confirms docs view,at issue in this appeal that a prisoner can not obtain the expedited review provided by section without first submitting a formal grievance pursuant to a.docs intends the amendments to clarify,not change,the requirements for section review.these amendments are among various amendments to the igp regulations that,in the words of docs notice of proposed rule making,
merely clarify text in areas where there has been confusion resulting from ambiguity in the current text.increased litigation in this area and numerous judicial opinions setting forth sometimes inconsistent analysis of the provisions of this regulation have been,on occasion,contrary to the department interpretation,intention or existing practice.these clarifying changes reflect the policies and procedures the department has followed and have been in place at least since the last general changes were adopted effective may,they are not intended to change program policies.rule j letter at 
ii.discussion 
read together,our recent decisions,and our holdings today in the other consolidated cases,suggest that a inquiry is appropriate in cases where a prisoner plaintiff plausibly seeks to counter defendants contention that the prisoner has failed to exhaust available administrative remedies as required by the plra,a.depending on the inmate explanation for the alleged failure to exhaust,the court must ask whether administrative remedies were in fact available to the prisoner.abney mcginnis,wl.the court should also inquire as to whether the defendants may have forfeited the affirmative defense of by failing to raise or preserve it,johnson testman,wl,or whether the defendants own actions inhibiting the inmate exhaustion of remedies may estop one or more of the defendants from raising the plaintiff failure to exhaust as a defense,ziemba,at.if the court finds that administrative remedies were available to the plaintiff,and that the defendants are not estopped and have not forfeited their defense,but that the plaintiff nevertheless did not exhaust available remedies,the court should consider whether special circumstances have been plausibly alleged that justify the prisoner failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements.giano goord,wl citing berry kerik,cir rodriguez order.
we consider each of these questions in turn with respect to the plaintiff before us.
availability of administrative remedies 
we hold today in abney mcginnis that,in some circumstances,the behavior of the defendants may render administrative remedies unavailable.to the extent that the plaintiff lacked available administrative remedies,the plra exhaustion requirement is inapplicable.in abney,the plaintiff obtained a favorable resolution of his grievance,and therefore did not appeal the prison disposition of the grievance.by the time he discovered that the favorable decision was not being implemented,the deadline for appealing the administrative ruling had come and gone.on these facts,we held that all available administrative remedies had been exhausted.abney,citation.
on the facts before us,administrative remedies were available to hemphill at the outset that is,the prison provided grievance procedures that inmates c
