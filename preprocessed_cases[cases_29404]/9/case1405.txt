this appeal arises from the withholding of a newborn infant from the custody of her parents on the basis of a toxicology test administered shortly after her birth that indicated the presence of methadone in her urine.the infant,plaintiff mora,was held by defendant long island college hospital against the stated wishes of her mother for a total of ten days,during the first eight or nine of which the hospital was awaiting the results of a confirmatory urine test.as soon as results of a test showing that there was in fact no methadone in the infant urine were received,the hospital medical staff gave her medical clearance to be discharged.she remained in the hospital for a day or two more,nonetheless,while a hospital social worker contacted the new york city child welfare administration and received word from the agency that in its judgment the child should be discharged.she was thereupon released to her parents.
the child mother,plaintiff kia,brought suit individually and on behalf of her infant daughter mora alleging,inter alia,that the defendants infringed their constitutional rights in violation of.the district court frederic block,judge granted the defendants motions for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint in its entirety.see kia mcintyre,d.the plaintiffs appealed the portions of the district court judgment holding that the defendants did not violate the plaintiffs substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by unjustifiably infringing the plaintiffs interests in family integrity the defendants did not violate the plaintiffs procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by removing mora from the custody of her parents without a pre or hearing the defendants did not violate mora rights under the fourth amendment by conducting an unreasonable seizure the defendants did not violate the plaintiffs equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment by discriminating against the plaintiffs on the basis of kia status and certain of the individual defendants are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity.
we affirm the judgment of the district court without reaching the issue of qualified immunity.
background 
on march,kia went into labor.believing it would be impossible to reach the north central bronx hospital,where she had received prenatal care,in time,she went to long island college hospital the hospital to give birth.the hospital is privately owned and operated.when she was admitted,kia disclosed that she had abused crack cocaine in the past,that she was,and that she had a history of tuberculosis and syphilis.
later that day,kia daughter,mora,was born.kia husband,edwin,accompanied kia to the hospital and was present for mora birth.
because of kia status and history of tuberculosis and the hospital belief that kia had not received adequate prenatal care,in accordance with hospital policy,the hospital tested a sample of mora urine for drugs shortly after her birth.on march,the hospital test indicated the presence of methadone in mora urine.that day,a hospital social worker,defendant susan morance,who is a mandated reporter,a person who,by the nature of her professional position,is required by new york state statute to make reports to the state of suspected abuse or maltreatment of children notified the new york state central registry for child abuse of the positive drug test.the registry in turn notified the new york city child welfare administration cwa.
also on march,kia was discharged from the hospital.when she asked to take mora home with her,morance denied her request because,morance told kia,methadone had been detected in the baby urine.according to kia,morance explained i have to talk to cwa,and,your daughter has a social hold on her.you will not be able to take her home.this is a case of cwa.morance also allegedly stated that kia could not stay in the hospital with mora,and that kia would be forcibly ejected by hospital security if she tried to stay.kia was told,by her account,that she could come in and see her daughter and feed her,but could not take her home.
there is no dispute that the hospital had two reasons for retaining mora.first,the hospital medical staff believed mora had methadone in her bloodstream and was in danger of suffering from methadone withdrawal,a potentially fatal condition.as the district court noted,there is undisputed evidence in the record that an infant methadone withdrawal can take a minimum of one week to manifest itself.hospital records indicate that mora exhibited tremors and irritability,which are symptoms consistent with methadone withdrawal.kia,d at.the second reason for holding mora was the hospital compliance with hospital and cwa policies requiring that any child under investigation by cwa not be released from the hospital without cwa permission.
either of these considerations could have resulted in the hospital retention of mora.but from our review of the record on appeal we conclude as a matter of law that between the receipt of the results of the first test and mora ultimate medical clearance eight or nine days later,mora was held by the hospital for medical reasons,not concerns about possible parental mistreatment and cwa policies.it was the medical staff that made the initial decision to withhold mora release because of the danger of methadone withdrawal.and from mora birth to her medical release,the infant was under medical observation and care by the hospital medical staff.
kia denied ever having used methadone,and she and her husband voluntarily submitted to drug tests,each of which yielded a negative result.mora urine sample,meanwhile,was sent by the hospital to an outside laboratory,smithkline beecham,for confirmatory testing.because of the small quantity of urine submitted to it,the laboratory was unable to perform the requested tests.the sample was therefore sent to a second outside laboratory,national medical services,for analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry,a more sophisticated testing method.during this period,hospital medical personnel monitored mora for further symptoms of methadone withdrawal.then,on april or,the hospital was informed by national medical services that its test indicated that there was no methadone in mora urine.
the same day,shortly after receipt of the gas spectrometry test results,the hospital staff medically cleared mora for discharge.morance,made aware of this decision,then called defendant rosemary mcintyre,the cwa caseworker assigned to the matter,and informed her of the medical clearance.after mcintyre discussed the case with her supervisor,cwa decided that it would not seek custody of mora.mcintyre then returned morance call,but was unable to reach her because she had left for the day.mcintyre successfully made contact with morance the next day,april,and communicated to morance cwa conclusion that mora could be discharged.mora was released from the hospital the same day,a day or two after the medical clearance had been given.
neither cwa nor the hospital ever discovered evidence of a danger of child abuse or neglect other than the initial test result and the hospital medical staff observations of the symptoms of methadone withdrawal in mora.on june,the state department of social services advised kia that it had found no credible evidence that mora had been abused or maltreated and that it considered the report of suspected child abuse or maltreatment to be unfounded.
on february,kia,on behalf of her daughter and herself,brought this lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seeking damages and injunctive relief pursuant to and new york state law.the plaintiffs complaint asserted seven causes of action that mora was seized and removed from her parents custody pursuant to hospital and city policies in violation of the fourth,fifth and fourteenth amendments that the defendants conducted a constitutionally inadequate investigation because of inadequate training and supervision by the hospital and the city that defendants sabol,little,mcintyre,delamothe and the city the city defendants violated new york state law by failing to provide services to preserve family integrity before removing mora from her parents custody,and by failing to reunite the family subsequent to mora removal that the defendants unlawfully interfered with plaintiff custody of her minor child that the defendants unlawfully imprisoned mora that the defendants investigation deviated from the standard of reasonable care as well as accepted professional standards and that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs because of kia status in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion,dismissing the complaint in its entirety.see kia,d at.
the district court first determined that morance and the hospital the hospital defendants acted under color of law and were state actors for purposes of the claims under.the court reasoned that although the hospital defendants did not engage in state action insofar as they provided medical care to mora during her hospitalization,they did engage in state action when they held mora for reasons pursuant to hospital and cwa policies prohibiting the release of any child under cwa investigation without cwa permission.see id.at.
the district court next determined that the defendants did not infringe the plaintiffs substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.applying the test articulated by this court in joyner dumpson,cir,the district court ascertained,first,that both kia and mora had a constitutionally protected fundamental right to family integrity.see kia,d at.second,the district court decided that this fundamental right was not significantly infringed because kia was permitted to visit with mora during mora hospitalization,including her feeding times.id.at quoting joyner,at.third,the district court found that the defendants had a reasonable basis to believe that mora was in danger of abuse or neglect.id.weighing these three factors,the district court held that the defendants had not engaged in action that is arbitrary,or oppressive in a constitutional sense.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also concluded that the defendants had not violated the plaintiffs procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.in the court view,the initial test result indicating the presence of methadone in mora urine gave the defendants an adequate emergency basis for removing mora from the custody of her parents without a hearing.see id.at.the district court further held that there was no need for a hearing in light of the low risk that the initial test result would be wrong and that the plaintiffs would,as a consequence,be erroneously deprived of their liberty interests,and the minimal value that a hearing would have added while the confirmatory were pending.see id.
determining at the threshold that only mora had standing to assert a fourth amendment claim,the district court rejected the argument that the testing of mora urine for purely medical reasons constituted a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.see id.at.the plaintiffs do not appeal these determinations.the district court also held,however,that mora was seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment when kia was told that she was not free to take mora home on march.balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion on mora fourth amendment interests against the governmental interests at stake,the district court found that this seizure was reasonable and that mora fourth amendment rights therefore were not violated.id.at.
the district court rejected in a more cursory fashion the plaintiffs claimed right to an adequate and neglect investigation.see id.this portion of the district court judgment has not been appealed.
the district court also dismissed the plaintiffs equal protection claim based on hiv discrimination because it was supported only by conclusory allegations.see id.
finally,as to all constitutional violations,the district court concluded that the individual city defendants either were not personally involved in the events in question defendants sabol and little or were entitled to qualified immunity defendants delamothe and mcintyre.see id.at.the plaintiffs do not appeal the dismissal of the claims against sabol and little,but they do challenge the district court determination of qualified immunity for delamothe and mcintyre.the district court held that morance,the only individual hospital defendant,had waived the defense of qualified immunity by failing to plead it in her answer.see id.at.
because the district court had disposed of all federal claims,it exercised its discretion under c to dismiss the plaintiffs state law claims.see id.at.
this appeal followed.
we now affirm the judgment of the district court but on the basis of a somewhat different analysis.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see tenenbaum williams,cir,cert.denied.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c,w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.an issue of fact is material for these purposes if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.
we may affirm the award of summary judgment on any ground with adequate support in the record.see,network solutions,cir shumway united parcel,cir it is beyond cavil that an appellate court may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground appearing in the record.
ii.state action 
section imposes liability on anyone who,under color of state law,deprives a person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.k a radiologic tech,commissioner of dep t of health,cir quoting blessing freestone,d.t he core purpose of is to provide compensatory relief to those deprived of their federal rights by state actors.hardy new york city health hosps,cir quoting felder casey,d.our first inquiry,therefore,is whether the actions alleged by the plaintiffs come within the definition of under color of state law.carlos santos,cir quoting.
the traditional definition of acting under color of state law requires that the defendant in a action have exercised power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.id.quoting,inter alia,west atkins,d other citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the hospital is owned and administered by a private corporation it is not a state or municipal facility.the district court held,see kia,d at,the parties do not dispute,and we agree that insofar as the hospital and its employees rendered medical care to kia and her newborn daughter,the hospital was therefore not a state actor.see blum yaretsky,d holding that decisions made in the administration of a nursing home do not constitute state action.whatever misdeeds the hospital defendants may have committed in providing that any there are not redressable under.
a.the hospital failure to release mora prior to april 
mora was born on march.her urine tested positive for methadone and hospital doctors observed in her behavior symptoms of methadone withdrawal,including irritability and tremors.because methadone withdrawal in an infant is a serious,sometimes fatal condition,the hospital retained mora for observation and treatment after it released her mother.following a second attempt to confirm the test results using a sophisticated testing procedure,the first attempt having been inconclusive,the hospital learned on april or april that the positive result of the hospital test for methadone had been in error.as a result of the laboratory report combined with the child apparent good health some two weeks after her birth,she was given medical clearance for discharge.it was only after the medical clearance that the medical staff told morance,the responsible hospital social worker,that mora was medically ready to leave the hospital.these mora urine for methadone,holding and treating mora for methadone withdrawal,and medically clearing mora after the negative confirmatory taken by the hospital in its capacity as a private provider of medical care and thus do not subject the hospital to liability under 
in addition to having a relationship with each of kia and mora as a provider of medical care,the hospital had a discrete and distinguishable role in the complex relationship among the state,the parent and the child in determining the safety and propriety of releasing mora to the care of her mother.in the latter capacity,the hospital defendants were required by statute to report the birth of mora,who initially tested positive for methadone and whose mother had a history of drug addiction,because it raised the specter of potential child abuse or neglect.there is evidence from which a jury could conclude that in addition to the hospital medical decision not to issue a release until april or pursuant to its medical relationship with mora,it also put a hold on her release in its social welfare role because of its concern about her care in the hands of her mother.as the district court correctly found,insofar as the hospital was acting in the latter part of the reporting and enforcement machinery for cwa,a government agency charged with detection and prevention of child abuse and hospital was a state actor.
c onduct that is formally private may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional limitations placed upon state action in certain instances the actions of private entities may be considered to be infused with state action if those private parties are performing a function public or governmental in nature and which would have to be performed by the government but for the activities of the private parties.
perez sugarman,cir quoting evans newton,d internal quotation marks omitted.but the refusal of the hospital to release mora to her mother for reasons relating to child abuse and child welfare laws did not become effective until the medical release was issued and mora was no longer being held by the hospital doctors for treatment and observation,on april or april.
we conclude,therefore,that the hospital actions in its capacity as a state actor had no effect,and thus did not subject it to liability under,for the period between mora birth and her medical clearance.the plaintiffs due process claim turns on whether the hospital,acting in its role as an instrumentality of the government by holding mora as part of the state effort to detect and prevent child abuse,deprived kia or her daughter of liberty without due process of law.the hospital,treating mora as its medical patient,did not declare her ready for release until april or.therefore,from the date of mora birth to april or,whatever liberty interest kia and mora possessed was being denied by the hospital as a private actor providing medical care.the hospital in its role as state actor during that period of time was incapable of depriving,and therefore did not deprive,mother and daughter of liberties that had already been taken away by the hospital medical staff as private,professional persons 
b.the hospital failure to release mora between april or and april 
between mora medical clearance on april or and her discharge to her mother care on april,mora was being held by the hospital solely pending action by the cwa.the hospital defendants were therefore behaving as state actors and may be held accountable under for events occurring during that period.our conclusions with respect to state action necessarily limit our analysis of the alleged constitutional violations to the hospital actions after mora medical clearance on april or april.
iii.due process 
substantive due process.
mora claim based on her detention at the hospital must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to the fourth amendment,not under the rubric of substantive due process.tenenbaum,at quoting united states lanier,d alteration in original.w here another provision of the constitution provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection,a court must assess a plaintiff claims under that explicit provision and not the more generalized notion of substantive due process.conn gabbert,d quoting graham connor,d.we therefore analyze mora detention claim under the fourth amendment in part iv below.
but,like the parental plaintiffs in tenenbaum,kia do es not at least no longer allege s cognizable fourth amendment claims based on her daughter removal.tenenbaum,at.because kia claims can not be analyzed under any other more specific constitutional provision,we must assess them in terms of the fourteenth amendment substantive guarantee.
for all its consequence,due process has never been,and perhaps never can be,precisely defined.lassiter department of social,d.however,s ince the time of our early explanations of due process,we have understood the core of the concept to be protection against arbitrary government action.county of sacramento lewis,d see also tenenbaum,at substantive rights guard against the government exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.quoting county of sacramento,at.
the substantive guarantee also provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.washington glucksberg,d.we have described the interest of a parent in the custody of his or her children as a fundamental,constitutionally protected liberty interest.gottlieb county of orange,cir see also tenenbaum,at observing that a family has,in general terms,a substantive right under the due process clause to remain together without the coercive interference of the awesome power of the state quoting duchesne sugarman,cir wilkinson russell,cir it has long been settled in this circuit that a parent interest in the custody of a child is a constitutionally protected liberty interest subject to due process protection.quoting cecere city of new york,cir alteration in original duchesne,at describing right of family to remain together as the most essential and basic aspect of family privacy.
no matter how important the right to family integrity,it does not automatically override the sometimes competing compelling governmental interest in the protection of minor children,particularly in circumstances where the protection is considered necessary as against the parents themselves.wilkinson,at internal quotation marks omitted.as we said in van emrik chemung county department of social services,cir 
though a decision to remove a child from parental custody implicates the constitutional rights of the parents,it obliges protective services caseworkers to choose between difficult alternatives in the context of suspected child abuse.if they err in interrupting parental custody,they may be accused of infringing the parents constitutional rights.if they err in not removing the child,they risk injury to the child and may be accused of infringing the child rights.
recognizing the need for unusual deference in the abuse investigation context,we have held that an investigation will pass constitutional muster provided simply that case workers have a reasonable basis for their findings of abuse.wilkinson,at quoting van emrik,at.
because of our holding regarding state action,the hospital did not hold mora in its capacity as a state actor until after the primary evidence of abuse had been discredited,when the drug test indicated the absence of methadone in mora urine and she was medically cleared for release.we conclude,however,that the hospital decision to hold mora thereafter while it informed cwa of the test result and waited for a response was a decision not without a reasonable basis,wilkinson,at,or without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective,tenenbaum,at quoting county of sacramento,at.we think the constitution allows the cwa a short day or two in this process the new information provided by the test results,to review mora case in light of this new information,to decide whether to authorize mora release,and to communicate its decision to the hospital.the hospital holding of mora pending the outcome of this deliberative process is a reasonable accommodation of the state compelling interest in protecting children from abuse and neglect.as a matter of law,kia rights to substantive due process were not abridged.
procedural due process.
for purposes of procedural due process analysis,parents have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the care,custody and management of their children,tenenbaum,at citing cases,and children have a parallel constitutionally protected liberty interest in not being dislocated from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily family association,duchesne,at quoting smith organization of foster families for equality reform,d.the state also has a profound interest in the welfare of the child.tenenbaum,at.the question then is what procedures must be afforded to a parent when the coercive power of the state seeks to separate them 
the supreme court has indicated that the answer generally depends on three factors 
first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
mathews eldridge,d accord,zinermon burch,d.p rocedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases.mathews eldridge,at.accord walters national ass of radiation survivors,d santosky kramer,d mackey montrym,d parham,d.in other words,the requirement of a hearing or other procedural safeguard typically will not depend on the quantum of evidence possessed by the government in any one particular case.
this court,in a substantial line of cases,has addressed the standards by which a state actor is measured for due process purposes when he or she removes a child from a parent custody in the interests of the safety of the child.see,tenenbaum,at,and cases cited therein.but the situation of kia and her daughter was different.mora was not taken from kia.kia placed her child in the care of a actor for medical care when she gained admission to the hospital and gave birth there.it was while mora was under that care,after she had been medically cleared,that the hospital defendants,acting for the state,held her for an additional day or two while it sought cwa advice as to her release.
kia claims are therefore covered by a subset of our cases addressing circumstances where the government,although not physically taking the child away from a parent,gains custody of the child by refusing to release him or her after the parent has voluntarily granted temporary custody to the government or a third party.such situations unquestionably also implicate the parent and child procedural due process rights.see cecere,at holding that when parent voluntarily leaves child with third party,and third party later refuses to return child to parent on basis of state authority,parent is deprived of constitutionally protected liberty interest in custody of her child at moment of refusal to return that child duchesne,at,holding that even though mother voluntarily left children with neighbor,when state officials assumed custody of children from neighbor and refused to return children to mother,such officials were required to initiate proceeding joyner,at holding that parents who voluntarily relinquished children to state nonetheless possessed substantive due process rights with respect to state later refusal to return children and state practice of strictly controlling visitation,thereby isolating the child and straining familial bonds.
the rule in this circuit is that under these circumstances the state has the duty to initiate a prompt hearing after the child has been removed from the custody of his or her parents.see gottlieb,at in other words,in those extraordinary situations,where deprivation of a protected interest is permitted without prior process,the constitutional requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard are not eliminated but merely postponed.duchesne,at quoting boddie connecticut,d.because,among other things,the state actor ordinarily has a far greater familiarity with the legal procedures available for testing its action,t he burden of initiating judicial review must be shouldered by the government,id.at.we must therefore resolve whether the plaintiffs were denied a prompt hearing in this case.
we hold that as a matter of law they were not.shortly after mora was cleared medically by the hospital staff,morance called mcintyre,the cwa caseworker,and reported the clearance.mcintyre discussed the case with her supervisor who,in consultation with mcintyre,decided to give the hospital permission to release mora to her parents.mcintyre then returned morance call.unable to reach her that day,mcintyre successfully made contact with morance the following day,april.mcintyre told morance that as far as cwa was concerned,mora could be discharged.mora was released from the hospital the same day,a day or two after the medical clearance had been given.failure of the hospital defendants to obtain a hearing during that short period did not violate the rule that a hearing be held promptly,especially in light of the fact that the time was used by the cwa to decide promptly whether to release mora after it received news of the drug test showing an absence of methadone in cecere we held that certain emergency conditions permitted the deprivation of a parent custody of her child over a period including a weekend and two weekdays.see cecere,at.in other words,we held that emergency circumstances justified an immediate removal of the child from her parent,and that a delay without a hearing was constitutionally permissible.cecere differs from the case at bar inasmuch as the child in cecere was separated from her mother because of evidence of abuse.it nonetheless indicates the amount of breathing room that we think the law allows child welfare officials to permit them to determine what action should be taken after parent and child have been separated.
we underscore what should be plain from the foregoing discussion had kia been held by the hospital solely for purposes of protecting the child from possible abuse or improper parental care for the entire ten days during which parent and child were kept apart,without a hearing and a court order permitting their enforced separation,there is a serious danger that the hospital defendants would have violated the plaintiffs procedural due process rights.as a state actor under those circumstances,the hospital defendants could have been held liable to the plaintiffs under for any such violation.
finally,we note that there is no evidence that cwa or any of its employees proximately caused mora to be kept from her parents without a hearing.no cwa employee ever directed the hospital to hold mora against her parents wishes pending the cwa investigation.and while the cwa had a policy prohibiting hospitals from releasing children under cwa investigation without cwa permission,there is no evidence that mora was detained pursuant to that policy.because there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the city defendants proximately caused the alleged violation of the plaintiffs procedural due process rights to a prompt hearing,those defendants would be entitled to summary judgment in any event.see gierlinger gleason,cir i n all cases,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant action was a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.
iv.fourth amendment 
with respect to the plaintiffs claim under the fourth amendment,as applied to the states under the fourteenth amendment,the district court held that only
