luis appeals the dismissal of his political discrimination and due process claims against his employer,the puerto rico electric power authority prepa,and various of its representatives.brought suit under,claiming violations of his first,fifth,and fourteenth amendment rights he also alleged violations of puerto rico law.the district court dismissed all of plaintiff claims,and we affirm.
because plaintiff claims were dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b,we accept the allegations in plaintiff complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.parker hurley,cir.
an attorney,has held a career position as a member of prepa auction committee since.the complaint gives no information about what the auction committee does.he is an active member of the new progressive party npp,which controlled the government in puerto rico at the time of his appointment.the elections,however,brought the popular democratic party pdp into power.the new administration in increased the size of prepa auction committee from three to five members,with the two new members being pdp adherents.prepa officials then ceased appointing to temporary terms as acting president of the auction committee,appointing the new pdp committee members instead.they did this even though the two new individuals were not yet according to full permanent members of the committee.
in january,the president of the committee formally retired.at the time of the filing of this complaint,prepa had yet to start the appointment process for a replacement president.this takes us to the crux of complaint that prepa has not yet opened up the presidency position for no other reason than to discriminate against plaintiff by allowing the newly appointed members of the pdp to obtain their status as permanent members of the auction committee and thus qualify for an appointment as president,all in retaliation for plaintiff political activities in support of the npp.plaintiff asserts that he is the only member of the committee who is currently qualified to hold the presidency.also amended his complaint to add allegations of continuing harassment and retaliation.the alleged retaliation is his receipt of a reprimand for raising his voice to a and an ethics charge for engaging in private practice outside work hours,both of which actions were taken in january.
brought suit in federal district court in november,alleging that defendants deprived him of a reasonable employment promotion expectation in violation of his first amendment and due process rights.he sought compensatory and punitive damages and requested that the court either order prepa to retroactively instate him as president a position he has never held or to start the appointment process.
defendants moved for dismissal,arguing that had failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim under and that many of his claims under were also.the district court agreed.it found plaintiff allegations regarding the change in the auction committee composition barred by the statute of limitations.it ruled out the due process claim because had not identified a recognized and protected property interest of which he was deprived,and it found no first political discrimination claim because plaintiff had not alleged any adverse employment action.as to the amended complaint,the court found the complaint had not pled any facts from which an inference could be drawn of a connection between the reprimand and ethics charge and political affiliation.the court thus dismissed the claims with prejudice and,declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims,dismissed those claims without prejudice.
our review of rule b dismissals is de novo.parker,at.the district court unpublished opinion carefully and correctly analyzed plaintiff claims we thus keep our analysis brief.
to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,a complaint must contain factual allegations sufficient to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,d.while a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle ment to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.id.at quoting.a alteration in original citations omitted.
bell atlantic retire d the seemingly broader language regarding pleading standards in conley gibson,d.bell atl.at.specifically,the court cabined conley language that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley,at.the court clarified that conley described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims,not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaint survival.bell atl.at see also damon moore,cir discussing bell atlantic retirement of conley language margo caribe,cir same.thus plaintiff assertion that all he needs to plead is enough facts for the honorable court to be able to frame a constitutional claim,is simply wrong.a plaintiff complaint must itself frame a viable constitutional claim.
in puerto rico,claims are subject to a statute of limitations.molina,cir.the statute of limitations on such claims begins to run when the injury occurs,even if the plaintiff did not know of the discriminatory animus at that time.id.at.the district court clearly explained why the statute bars plaintiff attack on the change in the auction committee composition and correctly concluded that any did not fall within the continuing violation doctrine see limestone dev.vill.of lemont,cir posner,t he continuing violation doctrine is misnamed the office of the misnamed doctrine is to allow suit to be delayed until a series of wrongful acts blossoms into an injury on which suit can be brought.any injury to plaintiff from the actions was clear by.further,plaintiff does not provide any legal argument or case citations on appeal as to why the district court was wrong.we have steadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner,not accompanied by developed argumentation united states bongiorno,cir.
we turn then to plaintiff timely claims regarding prepa failure to open the application process in order to fill the position of the auction committee presidency after january.the first amendment protects public employees from adverse employment actions based on their political opinions,at.to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination in violation of the first amendment,a government employee must demonstrate both that there was an adverse employment action and that this adverse action was motivated by discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.see,city of mayag√ºez,cir.
adverse employment action includes not only discharge and demotions,but also a government entity refusal to promote,transfer,recall after layoff,or even hire an employee.rutan republican party of,d.as the district court noted,plaintiff has alleged no specific changes in his existing working conditions.further,prepa has not turned him down for a promotion.asserts only that prepa has not begun accepting applications for a position for which he feels eminently qualified.as the district court summarized,w e have not found,nor has plaintiff cited to,a case where the failure to open up a position in a timely fashion served as the basis for a political or employment discrimination claim.plaintiff still has not identified such a case on appeal.we agree there is no cognizable adverse employment action here within the scope of rutan.plaintiff also makes no coherent claim of a violation of free speech rights independent of his political affiliation claim.
plaintiff procedural due process rights claim does not fare better.the district court explicated and applied the correct standard.argues primarily that the court impermissibly reached this issue sua sponte.we do not agree.
there is no concern about unfairness to plaintiff.while defendants motion to dismiss the claims
