plaintiff augustine betancourt appeals from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york as dismissed his claims against defendants city of new york city,its mayor,and its police commissioner,brought under,challenging betancourt arrest on a charge of violating city administrative code.betancourt alleged that subsection b of that section,which,inter alia,prohibits leaving boxes and erecting obstructions in public spaces,is unconstitutionally overbroad and,as applied to him,unconstitutionally vague he also alleged that his arrest was without probable cause and violated his right to travel.the district court,john martin,granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment dismissing those claims on the grounds that b was sufficiently clear to give notice both to betancourt and to law enforcement officials as to what conduct was prohibited that the section plainly applied to betancourt observed conduct and that the section did not implicate betancourt right to travel.on appeal,betancourt principally pursues his contentions that b is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that he was arrested without probable cause.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
this case arises out of the arrest of betancourt and other homeless persons pursuant to a city program designed to improve the quality of life in the city public spaces.viewed in the light most favorable to betancourt,as the party against whom summary judgment was granted on the claims at issue on this appeal,the following facts are not in dispute except as indicated.
a.the events 
in,the city undertook a quality of life initiative designed to reduce a wide range of street crimes including prostitution,panhandling,and drug sales.betancourt asserted that the initiative was thereafter expanded to,inter alia,reduce the number of homeless persons residing in public spaces.the city police department issued a guide for law enforcement officers,listing laws that prohibited conduct targeted by the initiative.those laws included city administrative code,subsection b of which states that 
i t shall be unlawful for any person,such person agent or employee to leave,or to suffer or permit to be left,any box,barrel,bale of merchandise or other movable property whether or not owned by such person,upon any marginal or public street or any public place,or to erect or cause to be erected thereon any shed,building or other obstruction.

in the early morning hours of february,in or around certain parks in lower manhattan,police officers arrested individuals,including betancourt.betancourt had come to the park at approximately on february with some personal possessions,three folded cardboard boxes,and a loose piece of cardboard.he used the three boxes to construct a tube large enough to accommodate most of his body he placed the tube on a park bench,climbed into the tube,covered the exposed part of his body with the loose piece of cardboard,and went to sleep.at approximately on february,the police roused betancourt from his sleep and arrested him.at approximately on march,betancourt was given a desk appearance ticket,noting that he was charged with violating,and was released.by that time,the district attorney office had signed a declination of prosecution,stating that prosecution of th e case against betancourt was declined because the case lack ed prosecutorial merit.declination of prosecution dated february.
b.the present action 
the present action was commenced in september under by betancourt and by another plaintiff who has not pursued his claims.betancourt alleged principally a that b is unconstitutionally overbroad and unconstitutionally vague as applied to him,b that he had been arrested without probable cause and in violation of his right to travel,and c that he had been subjected to an unreasonable strip search.following a period of discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.
as to the vagueness challenge,defendants contended that b was clear on its face.betancourt disputed that contention,pointing out that subsection a of states that t he purpose of this section is to punish those persons who abandon remove component parts of motor vehicles in public streets,nyc admin.code a.he argued that as a whole did not provide him with reasonable notice that his conduct,which was unrelated to motor vehicles,would be unlawful.
in a memorandum opinion and order dated december,the district court granted betancourt motion for summary judgment as to liability on his claim that was eventually settled and is not at issue on this appeal.as to betancourt remaining claims,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.see betancourt giuliani,civ,wl,at,betancourt i.
in addressing betancourt vagueness challenge,the district court stated that a statute is not unconstitutionally vague if it give s the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,and provide s explicit standards for those who apply it.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also noted that b ecause the statute is judged on an as applied basis,one whose conduct is clearly proscribed by the statute can not successfully challenge it for vagueness.id.quoting united states nadi,cir.
the district court found the plain language of b sufficiently clear to alert betancourt that his conduct was prohibited.the court stated that the language that makes it unlawful to erect or cause to be erected any shed,building or other obstruction,betancourt i,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted,was reasonably understood to apply to betancourt conduct because he 
had erected a cardboard structure,housing a human inside,in a public space.he was not simply occupying a park bench with a few personal items.rather,he had erected an obstruction in a public space.
because plaintiff had sufficient notice that his conduct was prohibited by section b,the statute passes the first prong of the vague as applied test,
the district court rejected betancourt argument that subsection b implicitly included subsection a reference to motor vehicles.the court noted that the predecessor to b had referred to,inter alia,erecting obstructions and leaving boxes and vehicle s on public street s,nyc admin.code.section was substantially revised in and was eventually codified as.subsections a,c,e,and f of were drafted to deal explicitly with motor vehicles the language of became subsection b of but was amended to remove any reference to vehicles.however,the court noted,
the prohibition against leaving boxes,barrels,bales of merchandise,and erecting sheds or obstructions in public spaces remained in subsection b.while subsection a explained the purpose of the new subsections regarding motor vehicles,no such explanation was needed to explain the purpose of the prohibition against leaving other things in public spaces.moreover,the plain meaning of subsection b,which unlike the other subsections contains no reference to vehicles,requires that it be read as prohibiting leaving boxes and erecting obstructions in public spaces.
betancourt i,wl,at emphases added.
the district court also found that b did not give law enforcement agents unfettered discretion to make arrests,but instead provided adequate guidelines to permit them to determine whether a person was engaging in conduct that violated that subsection.distinguishing city of chicago morales,d,in which the supreme court had found unconstitutionally vague a city ordinance that simply prohibited gang members from loitering in public spaces,without providing guidance as to what constituted loitering,the district court stated that 
the ordinance at issue in this case offers law enforcement personnel guidance in the form of a list of specific objects,including boxes,that should not be left in public spaces.
similarly,there is less uncertainty involved in a police determination of what constitutes an obstruction of a public space than in a police determination of what constitutes loitering in a public space.the fact that the police must exercise some discretion in the application of section b does not render the regulation void the text of section b provides sufficient guidelines to limit police discretion in its application,and therefore it is not void in its application to plaintiff conduct.plaintiff constitutional challenge to section b therefore fails.
betancourt i,wl,at emphasis added.
following the decision in betancourt i,betancourt attempted an immediate appeal.however,as his claim had not yet been fully resolved,this court dismissed the appeal sua sponte for lack of appellate jurisdiction.see betancourt giuliani,cir.after the claim was settled in by the city agreement to pay betancourt,a final judgment was entered,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,betancourt principally pursues his claim that b is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him,arguing that t he district court properly recognized that section b required at least a fairly stringent standard of vagueness,because the section imposes criminal penalties and does not have any intent requirement,but that the court should have applied a stricter,especially stringent standard of vagueness,because section b also implicates the fundamental right to travel.betancourt brief on appeal at.betancourt also argues that b is overbroad and that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him.for the reasons that follow,we find no basis for reversal.
a.the vagueness claim 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that laws be crafted with sufficient clarity to give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and to provide explicit standards for those who apply them.grayned city of rockford,d see,smith goguen,d the due process doctrine of vagueness incorporates notions of fair notice or warning and requires legislatures to set reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.thus,
a s generally stated,the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d smith goguen,d grayned city of rockford,d papachristou city of jacksonville,d connally general construction.although the doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary enforcement,the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is not actual notice,but the other principal element of the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.smith,at.where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines,a criminal statute may permit a standardless sweep that allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections,at.
kolender lawson,d.
regulations need not,however,achieve meticulous specificity,which would come at the cost of flexibility and reasonable breadth.grayned,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the degree of vagueness that the constitution well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair in part on the nature of the enactment.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.for example,economic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test than is legislation regulating noncommercial conduct.id.on the other hand,a greater degree of precision is required for enactments that provide for criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively more severe.id.at.p erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.id.at.if it does pose such a threat,a more stringent vagueness test should apply.id.
in the present case,b is a criminal statute,and thus is subject to more than a minimal level of scrutiny.but as applied in the present case it does not impinge on constitutionally protected rights.betancourt does not contend that his construction of a cardboard enclosure in which he could sleep,with some protection from the cold,was intended to be expressive activity protected by the first amendment.nor does b impinge on betancourt other constitutionally protected rights,for,despite his contention to the contrary,it does not impair his right to travel,given that it does not restrict interstate or intrastate freedom of movement,kolender,at.thus,only a moderately stringent vagueness test was required for a determination of whether b was impermissibly vague as applied to betancourt.the district court properly recognized this standard,and we see no basis for reversal in its application of the standard to the language of b that prohibits the erection of an obstruction.
we pause to note our disagreement with the district court ruling to the extent that it determined that the first of b prohibitions,leav ing,or permit ting to be left,any box,provided guidance to officers in their arrest of betancourt,on the premise that that segment made clear that boxes should not be left in public spaces,betancourt i,wl,at emphasis added.that part of b was not applicable to betancourt.he did not leave his box behind he remained inside it.
nonetheless,the second b prohibition forbids a person to erect in any public place any shed,building or other obstruction,and those words have plain dictionary meanings that applied to the conduct of betancourt.for example,webster third new international dictionary webster third gives one definition of the verb to erect as to put up as a building or machine by the fitting together of materials or parts.id.at.an ordinary person planning to fashion three boxes into a structure that was sufficiently large for a man to crawl into,and that was designed to give him shelter against the cold,would recognize that he was planning to put up something by the fitting together of materials or parts.webster third defines obstruction as something that obstructs or impedes,and defines obstruct as to block up.id.at.an ordinary person would understand that an agglomeration of boxes large enough for a man to fit into would be something that obstructs or impedes.
betancourt points out that sheds and buildings are structures that would normally be of some permanence.see,webster third at defining shed as a slight structure as a penthouse,or partially open separate building built primarily for shelter or storage.he also points out that the first b prohibition,forbidding the leav ing of any box,barrel,bale of merchandise or other movable property,concerns movable objects.he argues that b final prohibition concerning other obstruction s should therefore be interpreted as limited to structures of permanence.we disagree.
an object plainly may obstruct or impede without doing so permanently.had the lawmakers intended obstruction to mean a permanent edifice,they could have simply added that adjective before obstruction.we think it clear that b was meant to forbid any obstruction,whether permanent or temporary.
in sum,as b forbids a person to erect an obstruction in a public place,we conclude that the district court properly ruled that that language was sufficient to alert betancourt,and to provide adequate guidance to law enforcement agents,that betancourt conduct was prohibited.accordingly,b is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to betancourt.
betancourt other claims 
betancourt other claims do not require extended discussion.he claims that b is unconstitutionally because it prohibits innocent,unoffending conduct that is beyond the state police power to regulate betancourt brief on appeal at,sitting,lying,or sleeping by homeless persons in parks and other public places,where they are not impinging on the rights of others id.at.this claim is doubly flawed.first,the supreme court ha s not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment.united states salerno,d.because betancourt has not raised a first amendment challenge and is a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied,he will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others,in other situations not before the court.parker levy,d quoting broadrick oklahoma,d.second,b by its terms prohibits leaving or constructing in public spaces inanimate objects that are,inter alia,obstructions.that section does not appear to prohibit the conduct sitting,lying,or sleeping described by betancourt.
finally,the district court properly dismissed betancourt false arrest claim because the police,having observed him in a cardboard structure large enough to house an adult human being,which he had erected in a public space,had probable cause to arrest him.
conclusion 
we have considered all of betancourt arguments on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal.the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the twilight arrest of augustine betancourt,purportedly for erect ing an obstruction in a public park,presents a textbook illustration of why vague criminal laws are repugnant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.it is,as a result,troubling to me that the majority goes to such lengths to find clarity and guidance in a city ordinance that provides little of either.because i believe the law in question,as applied to betancourt,is unconstitutionally vague,i respectfully dissent.
for a criminal law to comport with the due process clause and withstand a challenge,it must both give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and provide explicit standards for those who apply them.grayned city of rockford,d.as the circumstances of betancourt arrest demonstrate,section b of the new york city administrative code hereinafter section b or subsection b fails to perform these essential functions.
the constitutional defects arise from the ambiguous text of the law at issue.on its face,section b is a bizarre grab bag of and imprecise proscriptions 
it shall be unlawful for any person,such person agent or employee to leave,or to suffer or permit to be left,any box,barrel,bale of merchandise or other movable property whether or not owned by such person,upon any marginal or public street or any public place,or to erect or cause to be erected thereon any shed,building or other obstruction.
admin.code b.the majority opinion admits that most of these restrictions are inapplicable to betancourt.thus,the majority explicitly disavows the district court conclusion that betancourt conduct was subject to section b prohibition against leaving boxes or other movable property in a public place.see majority opinion,at finding that betancourt did not leave his box behind he remained inside it.moreover,the majority does not at any point suggest that betancourt erected a shed or a building.left only with the language barring individuals from erect ing some other obstruction,the majority nonetheless insists that the law is not vague as applied to betancourt,whose offending conduct was seemingly to lie down on a park bench encircled in a cardboard tube made of two boxes tucked into one another.
the first test for constitutional vagueness is whether a penal statute define s the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.kolender lawson,d.as to this,i simply can not see how one could divine,even after carefully studying the full text of section b,that sleeping on a park bench covered with cardboard is any more unlawful under the ordinance than doing so covered with blankets which is plainly not illegal under the law at hand.moreover,the specific words that the majority emphasizes to erect and obstruction do not,with or without the aid of published definitions from webster third new international dictionary,provide meaningful notice to the ordinary citizen of what is enjoined.see colautti franklin,d it is settled that,as a matter of due process,a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute is void for vagueness.could anyone reasonably believe that to erect refers,as the majority would have it,to all acts of fitting together of materials or parts see majority opinion,at.such a sweeping construction would encompass everything from stitching two blankets together to stuffing one winter jacket into another,that lacing a silk scarf under the collar of a fur coat on an unusually cold winter day.and,if these activities do not fall within the meaning of to erect,on what possible basis could a person know that putting one cardboard box into another would be unlawful see united states harriss.the underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.
presumably the majority believes that it is only when one erects an obstruction that the prohibition of section b is triggered.but betancourt cardboard tube placed on a park bench was no more of an obstruction than his prone body alone.indeed,had he draped stitched blankets,stuffed jackets,or a warm fur coat over his body before laying down,would betancourt thereby have created an obstruction hardly not even the district court thought that section b penalize d people for merely occupying any public place with a few of their personal belongings.betancourt giuliani,jsm,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted.nor does the law,according to the lower court,authorize the arrest of individuals for hanging around in public places.id.what the law covers in this context then is entirely unclear,and how a person of ordinary intelligence is supposed to figure out that betancourt actions were forbidden is beyond me.
but it is not just the wording of the provision that makes it hard to know what the law prohibits.it is also the statutory context in which the specific ordinance is found.for the meaning of section b is further obfuscated by the fact that the law is buried among a series of provisions that exclusively pertain to abandoned automobiles.in fact,apart from section b,subsection b all the other subsections of section either concern the abandonment of vehicles and vehicle parts,or they prescribe the civil and criminal penalties for violating specific provisions of the code 
vehicles and other movable property.
legislative intent.the need for this legislation is indicated by the ever increasing number of abandoned cars in the city of new york.the purpose of this section is to punish those persons who abandon remove component parts of motor vehicles in public streets.it is not the intent to prohibit or preclude any person in lawful possession of a vehicle from making lawful repairs or removing any component part for the purpose of making such lawful repairs to a motor vehicle on a public street.
c.it shall be unlawful for any person,such person agent or employee to leave,or suffer or permit to be left,any motor vehicle,not otherwise lawfully parked,whether or not owned by such person,in any marginal or public street,or any public place.the owner or driver of a disabled vehicle shall be allowed a reasonable time,not exceeding three hours,in which to remove said vehicle.
any person convicted of a violation of the provisions of subdivision b or c of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars,imprisonment for not more than ten days,or both.
e.it shall be unlawful for any person,such person agent or employee,to abandon,or to suffer or permit to be abandoned any motor vehicle,whether or not owned by such person,in any marginal or public street,or any public place.
f.it shall be unlawful for any person to dismantle,or to remove any component part of any motor vehicle in any marginal or public street or any public area.
any person convicted of a violation of the provisions of subdivision e or f of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars,or imprisonment for not more than one year.
any person violating the provisions of subdivision b or c of this section shall be liable and responsible for a civil penalty of not less than dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.
