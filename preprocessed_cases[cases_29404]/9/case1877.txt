this case involves the visual and delousing of two men held in two different jails in west virginia.plaintiffs michael cantley and floyd teter brought a action for damages and equitable relief against the west virginia regional jail and correctional facility authority wvrja and three former and current executive directors of the wvrja.the wvrja is the state agency tasked with overseeing the ten regional jails,each of which receives arrestees pending their arraignments when local courts are not immediately available.plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the strip searches and delousing procedure.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs for summary judgment on the grounds that the strip searches and delousing procedure did not violate the fourth amendment.cantley.reg l jail corr.facility,wl.we now affirm,albeit on alternate grounds with respect to plaintiff teter.see,ellis,cir this court is entitled to affirm the court judgment on alternate grounds,if such grounds are apparent from the record.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
because the facts surrounding the visual strip searches of the plaintiffs are materially different,we consider them each in turn.plaintiff cantley was arrested in september for violating a domestic violence protection order.he was arraigned before a magistrate,who committed him to the western regional jail,one of ten in the wvrja system.upon entering the jail,cantley was,given a brief medical examination,booked,and placed in a holding cell.during the booking process,cantley cursed at the officers and threatened them.once in the holding cell,he kicked the cell door insistently until officers put him in a restraint chair.over the course of an hour and a half,cantley repeatedly attempted to get out of the chair,at one point grabbing at a nurse hand and at another threatening to strangle an officer.
after cantley had calmed down and been released from the chair,he was and deloused by a single male officer.the officer instructed cantley to remove his clothes,rais e his scrotum,bend over,and cough.cantley.reg l jail corr.facility,wl,at.at no point did the officer touch cantley.the officer then used a spray bottle to apply delousing solution to cantley body.after showering,cantley dressed in a prison uniform and was escorted to a holding cell,where he remained until he was moved to a cell in the general housing area 
the district court held that,under florence board of chosen freeholders of county of burlington,the strip search of cantley was constitutional.cantley,wl,at.in the alternative,the court held that cantley behavior and his arrest for violating a domestic violence protection order justified searching cantley to ensure the officers personal safety and the safety of others in the facility.id.at.
in florence,the supreme court held that every detainee who will be admitted to the general population of a jail may be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed.at.before he was,cantley appeared before a magistrate,who ordered him committed to the jail general population.florence squarely covers the strip search of cantley.we thus affirm the district court grant of defendants summary judgment motion on cantley strip search claim on the grounds that the search was constitutional.
plaintiff teter was arrested between and on february,for obstructing an officer and putting debris in the road.he was taken to a hospital for a medical examination,and then fingerprinted at the preston county courthouse.he did not appear before a magistrate.from the courthouse he was brought to the tygart valley regional jail at,where he was,examined by a nurse,and booked.after that,teter was escorted to a shower room,where he was and deloused by a single male officer.the officer instructed him to remove his clothes and spread his legs,lift his testicles,turn around,bend over,and spread his cheeks.cantley.reg l jail corr.facility,wl,at.at no point did the officer touch teter.the officer then used a garden sprayer to apply delousing solution to the hairy areas of teter body.
after showering and dressing in a prison uniform,teter was placed in a holding cell,where he was joined by another arrestee.eventually,the two arrestees were moved to a smaller cell in expectation of the arrival of a larger group of detainees,who were to be placed in the larger holding cell.in the morning,teter was taken out of the holding cell and escorted through the general population housing committed prisoners the video conferencing room,where he appeared before a magistrate via video connection.individuals arrested later in the day or in the evening often do not appear before a magistrate until the next morning.the magistrate ordered teter released on bond at all told,teter spent almost eleven hours in tygart valley.
the officer who teter testified that pat searches have turned up knives,brass knuckles,ammunition,pieces of metal,lighters,cell phones,and all types of drugs.he further testified that he has found as much contraband as the result of strip searches as from the pat searches.strip searches have uncovered drugs,lighters,matches,and cigarettes the contraband is sometimes taped to the arrestee body or hidden in a balloon in the rectum.
the holding area at tygart valley has six cells.because of overcrowding in the housing unit,however,officers generally only have use of two of the cells for holding arrestees.as a result,officers only separate arrestees by sex instead of by seriousness of the charges.up to fifteen individuals may be held in a single holding cell.at the time teter was arrested,tygart valley conducted strip searches of every arrestee who came in,regardless of arraignment status or seriousness of the charge.after blanket strip searches were suspended in,there were at least two instances of drug use in the holding cells.
the district court found that the strip search of teter struck a reasonable balance between the need to provide safety and security at the facility and teter privacy interests and thus held that the search was constitutional.id.at.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects defendants in suits from the burden of going to trial where the conduct at issue does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald.a defendant is entitled to judgment if either the facts do not make out a violation of a constitutional right or if the law was not clearly established at the time of defendant alleged misconduct.pearson callahan.we may address either prong of this analysis first,id.at,and we find it unnecessary to reach the constitutional merits of the strip search of teter.
the law is clearly established only if the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.ashcroft,quoting anderson creighton,
alterations omitted.we examine whether the law was clearly established as of the time the allegedly unlawful action occurred.anderson,at.in making our inquiry,we ordinarily need not look beyond the decisions of the supreme court,this court of appeals,and the highest court of the state in which the case arose.lefemine wideman,cir quoting edwards city of goldsboro,vacated on other grounds.although the law does not require that there be a prior case identical to the case at bar for the law to be clearly established,see hope pelzer,existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.al kidd.at.
plaintiff contends that logan shealy,cir,clearly established that the strip search of a prearraignment arrestee without individualized suspicion is unconstitutional.but this case is quite different from logan.teter was in a private room in the presence of one officer.logan was in a holding room with a transparent window she was exposed to the general view of persons known to be in the vicinity.logan,at.the district court recognized that there were significant security justifications for searching teter and similar arrestees.cantley,wl,at.in logan,there was no credible justific
