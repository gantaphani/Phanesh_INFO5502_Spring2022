background 
a.the bureau of prisons administrative remedy program 
the mdc,where johnson was incarcerated during the period relevant to this appeal,is a facility operated by the bureau of prisons bop.the bop provides prisoners a grievance procedure applicable to issues.the procedure is called the administrative remedy program arp,and consists of up to four steps,depending upon the circumstances.in some cases,the inmate is required to seek informal resolution of his complaint.then,if the matter is not resolved,he must file an administrative remedy request at his facility within twenty days of the incident.if the inmate is not satisfied with the facility reply,he may file a regional appeal to the bop regional director within twenty days of the warden response.in some situations,including those involving sensitive subjects,appeals from disciplinary proceedings,and other specified matters,the inmate may begin the process with a regional appeal.in all cases,if the prisoner is not satisfied with the regional director resolution of the matter,he may appeal to the central office,within thirty days.at all stages of the arp,prison staff must inform the inmate in writing of the appropriate administrative procedure if the request or appeal is not acceptable under the administrative remedy program.see.
facts and procedural history 
johnson allegations are set forth in his original complaint,as well as his first and second amended complaints.we recount the facts as described in those three pleadings.
johnson claim against testman 
johnson alleges that he was in the mdc barber shop with other inmates when one of the barbers asked johnson to demonstrate a type of haircut called the fadeout.defendant corrections officer co testman saw johnson using the hair clippers,asked johnson what he was doing with them,and after hearing his reply,told the inmates that he was terminating barber shop services for the day because of johnson use of the clippers.when inmate elio franco asked why he could get a haircut,testman allegedly told him it was due to johnson unauthorized use of the clippers,and that if franco ha d a problem with not being able to get a haircut,he should take it up with johnson.franco said yea,and left the area.shortly thereafter,as johnson was walking down a hallway,he was attacked by franco,who plunged a tile cutter into johnson neck and slashed his face and upper torso.johnson claims the attack caused him serious injuries to his face,neck,and upper torso,as well as emotional damage.
after the assault,johnson received a disciplinary infraction for fighting with another person,and was placed in administrative detention in the special housing unit shu while he awaited a hearing.at the hearing,johnson described the circumstances surrounding the attack,including testman alleged comment to franco.on the incident report,his own statement,and franco was found guilty of the infraction,and was sentenced to an additional days in the shu,the loss of days of good conduct time,and a year loss of visiting and commissary privileges.
johnson appealed the disciplinary conviction to the bop northeast regional office.on appeal,he again recounted testman conduct.johnson regional appeal was denied,and he sought review by the bop central office.the central office ruled in johnson favor,finding that the incident report did not describe any factual evidence inmate johnson was actual ly fighting and not a victim in this case.it therefore remanded the incident report to the mdc for a new hearing,at which johnson was exonerated.
johnson claim against james 
after defendants answered his original complaint,johnson filed an amended complaint on march,naming additional defendants,adding state law claims,as well as claims against co james based on another incident.the district court appointed counsel,who,in july,filed a second amended complaint on johnson behalf.according to the second amended complaint,on october,james asked johnson to come to his cell door to be handcuffed while another inmate was placed in the cell.johnson complied his hands were cuffed behind his back an inmate was placed in the cell and that inmate cuffs were removed.johnson asked james to remove his cuffs,but james refused.johnson then asked to speak to a lieutenant,and james denied his request.johnson remained for seven hours,and suffered severe pain in his shoulder and back,for which he was treated by the physician.
james thereafter issued a disciplinary infraction to johnson,citing him for refusing to obey an order of any staff member.james maintained that johnson had refused to be.johnson was found guilty of the infraction and received a loss of visiting and commissary privileges.his appeal to the facility warden was denied,but he sought review of that denial to the northeast regional office,which granted his appeal and directed mdc to conduct further investigation because the evidence is contradictory.mdc,however,apparently failed to investigate,and johnson filed another appeal with the regional office.the regional office elected to expunge the incident reports,because johnson had been moved from brooklyn to atlanta,it had taken an extended length of time to correct the error,and there is a lack of sufficient information at this stage of the process to support the charges.having prevailed,johnson filed no further appeals.
subsequent procedural history 
on december,defendants testman and james filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint or,in the alternative,for summary judgment in their motion,the defendants contended that they were entitled to qualified immunity,and that johnson had not exhausted his administrative remedies against testman.after oral argument on january,the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity,and reserved decision on the exhaustion issue.after the supreme court decision in porter nussle,d,the district court dismissed johnson complaint without prejudice,finding that he had failed to meet the exhaustion requirement as to his claims against both testman and james.the court found it unnecessary to consider whether james had waived the exhaustion requirement.it noted first that our circuit had not yet decided the validity of such waivers.and then,interpreting circuit case law to require the dismissal of exhausted claims when these are filed together with unexhausted ones,the court stated that johnson failure to exhaust his claim as against officer testman requires that i dismiss the entire case.
johnson filed a timely notice of appeal on may.we appointed counsel,and ordered briefing on the following issues whether the plaintiff exhausted his claims against testman by describing the defendant alleged activities at the bop disciplinary proceedings whether johnson exhausted his claims against james through the bop administrative scheme,even though he did not appeal to the office of general counsel whether james waived the affirmative defense of exhaustion by failing to raise that defense in his motion papers and whether the plra compels a rule of total exhaustion
