plaintiffs national association for the advancement of colored people and the new haven branch of the naacp collectively,the naacp appeal from a supplemental judgment on attorney fees entered on march,by the united states district court for the district of connecticut peter dorsey,judge.on motions,the district court ruled that the naacp was entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party in its suit against the town of east haven and the east haven board of education pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the court restricted the award,however,to reimbursement of fees for work performed prior to the naacp receipt of a letter from counsel for the town in the course of correspondence about possible settlement terms.see naacp town of east haven,d naacp ii in the view of the district court,the letter as amplified by the testimony of the town lawyer indicated that the naacp could have achieved its objectives through settlement without filing suit.the court therefore held that the naacp should not recover fees and costs incurred in litigation initiated after the letter was received.see id.at.we conclude that this decision constituted an abuse of the district court discretion.we therefore vacate the district court supplemental judgment and remand for an award of costs and attorney fees consistent with this opinion.
background 
the naacp suburban litigation program seeks to address perceived pockets of employment discrimination arising largely from municipal hiring preferences given to residents of primarily white towns that have a large minority workforce available nearby in,the naacp began to consider east haven,among other connecticut towns,for inclusion in the program.the town did not have a formal resident hiring preference.as the district court later found,though,
t he town then employ ed full time,and seasonal persons.on the last roster,were residents of towns other than east haven,and were town residents according to its equal employment opportunity reports from through,the town employed no blacks.the first black was hired after the lawsuit was begun in february,as welfare director.
naacp town of east haven,naacp i.by contrast,blacks composed of the work force of private employers that reported relevant statistics to the eeoc and that were located in the two zip code areas in which east haven is situated.see id.at.
the naacp sought to remedy the stark of blacks in the municipal workforce through a consent decree providing for an aggressive recruitment program that would include radio advertising targeted at a black audience in neighboring communities.the town opposed such a decree on the grounds that it had no resident hiring preference and that it already had a program in place to recruit employees from outside east haven.
in,contemplating a title vii suit against east haven,the naacp sought and received a letter from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc the letter expired,however,without the naacp instituting litigation against the town.
in october and november,stephanie rones,an assistant general counsel of the naacp,sought without success to open settlement negotiations with east haven through its outside counsel,michael albis.on february,therefore,the naacp obtained a second letter from the eeoc with respect to its claims.nine days later,on march,rones again contacted albis in order to explore the possibility of a settlement.
on april,albis responded by writing that he had discussed the matter further with town officials.he stated that the town intend ed to continue the recruitment practices which it ha d developed over recent years to attempt to attract qualified applicants,including minority applicants,from outside the geographical boundaries of the town.he insisted,however,that because the town had no hiring policy that was preferential toward town residents,a consent order like those entered into between the naacp and other municipalities was neither necessary n or appropriate.he indicated his interest,however,in continuing to explore the possibility of settlement.
rones answered albis by letter dated may.she wrote that a lawsuit and a consent decree could be avoided if the town agreed to several conditions,including an expansive recruitment effort with radio advertising,and reimbursement of the naacp costs and attorney fees.
albis responded by letter of may.the complete text of the letter reads 
dear attorney rones 
thank you for your letter of may.i have forwarded your proposal to the appropriate officials of the town of east haven for their review,and i will advise you of their response.
however,apart from any other issues,i must state at this time that i do not see any basis for the town agreeing to pay any expenses such as attorneys fees at this time.our consistent position has been that the town is not engaging in any discriminatory preference in favor of local residents,and we have produced documentary evidence in support of that position.in short,the town does not feel that you would have prevailed in your claim of descrimination sic had suit been filed,and therefore i do not expect the town to be willing to pay for any expenses which the naacp may have incurred for such a suit.
in any event,i will advise as to the town position on the remaining points once they have had the opportunity to review your proposal with local officials.thank you for your courtesy in this matter.
yours truly,
michael albis 
rones did not receive the letter,apparently because she was working away from her office at the time.unaware of its existence,she sent albis another letter on may,warning that if the town did not respond to her may offer,the naacp would file suit on may.albis answered by faxing a second copy of his may letter to rones.albis testified during the attorney fees phase of the litigation that he informed rones during this time period that t he things demanded by the naacp other than the payment of attorney fees were all items that the town had been doing all along and that he had agreed in previous conversations he did not think would be a problem.
on may,having received no further reply from the town and with two business days remaining before the expiration of its letter,the naacp filed suit under title vii on disparate treatment and disparate impact theories.the complaint sought an injunction requiring employment practices,a vigorous recruitment program designed to attract black applicants in numbers that more closely reflect the proportion of blacks in the relevant labor market,and measures to remedy the present effects of past discrimination.no further effort to settle the dispute was made by either side.
the ensuing litigation lasted more than five years.although the naacp was unable to prove the discriminatory intent on the part of the defendants necessary for it to sustain its disparate treatment claim,it prevailed at a bench trial on its disparate impact claim.see naacp i.at.the district court decree requires the town and the board of education,inter alia,to increase awareness of job opportunities through advertising directed to the black community and communications with black community organizations to implement a formal system for monitoring,enforcing,and keeping records of hiring and recruitment efforts to develop employment tests that comply with title vii and the uniform guidelines for employee selection procedures,to consult with independent testing agencies in selecting and administering such tests and to refrain from using hiring preferences arising from residence,political affiliation,or collective bargaining provisions.
the naacp then sought in attorneys fees and another in litigation costs in connection with the completed proceedings.see naacp ii,d at.the defendants for approximately in such fees and costs,claiming that they rather than the naacp had prevailed.the district court ruled that the naacp was a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees and that neither of the defendants was.but the court excluded all claimed fees and costs incurred by the naacp after may on the grounds that the town had acquiesced in the naacp substantive demands at that time and that the naacp could therefore have achieved its legitimate substantive goals through settlement and without litigation.the court therefore awarded the naacp in fees and in costs accrued through may and in connection with the fee application itself.see id.at.on appeal,the naacp challenges the amount of the award.
discussion 
title vii provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party in litigation under title vii a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.k we review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see fletcher,cir.despite this highly deferential standard of review,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record.id.
t he most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.farrar hobby,d quoting hensley eckerhart,d.the district court concluded that the naacp was a prevailing party and that it had achieved more than nominal success,thus making it eligible for attorney fees.naacp ii,d at.with respect to the amount of the fee award,the district court noted that w here a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,his attorney should recover a full compensatory fee.if a plaintiff obtains limited success,the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.id.at quoting hensley,at.citations omitted.
the district court found that the naacp could have achieved its objectives via settlement,with the possible exception of recovery of fees and costs.id.at.it therefore concluded that the results achieved by the naacp were not excellent.id.at.in calculating a reasonable fee in light of what the court saw as the naacp limited success,the district court restricted the award of attorney fees to work performed by naacp lawyers prior to the date in may when,in the court view,the matter should have been settled.see id.at.we conclude that the district court decision was an abuse of discretion because it was premised on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record,or because it was inconsistent with our decision in ortiz regan,cir,or both.
the district court denial of fees in and after may was based in part on its findings that in may,east haven met naacp substantive demands with respect to its hiring practices,naacp ii,d at,that therefore t he demand for attorney fees was the sole unresolved issue when suit was brought,id.at,and that the litigation thus hoped to achieve only a fee award,id.at.the record does not support those findings.
in rones november,and march,letters,she indicated that the naacp primary demand was an expanded,aggressive recruitment campaign including radio advertising directed to black residents of neighboring cities.she provided east haven outside counsel,albis,with consent decrees from previous cases as examples of the kind of agreement the naacp sought.albis responded with an april letter insisting that the town had no resident hiring preference and that it was already recruiting applicants from outside of east haven.speaking for the town,he said that it was not appropriate for the town to enter into a consent decree similar to those that rones had supplied.albis then asked whether there were other means whereby this matter can be settled emphasis added.thus,despite expressions of a willingness to settle,albis april letter provides no support for the district court finding that the town had met the naacp substantive demands.to the contrary,the april letter states the town intention to continue its current recruitment practices and reflects no willingness to accede to the naacp primary demand of an expanded recruiting effort directed specifically to blacks.
east haven continued to resist the naacp demands.rones may letter to albis listed four conditions for settlement expansive sic recruitment on radio stations directed toward black listeners mak ing the agreement public allow ing the naacp to go promptly to federal court,if after joint discussions,we decide the town is not complying with the terms of the agreement and reimbursing the naacp for expenses including attorneys fees.the letter also stated if these terms seem acceptable to your client,please let me know and we will draft an agreement incorporating the aforementioned terms.
albis responded with his may letter,set forth in full above.it flatly rejected rones insistence on the payment of the naacp attorney fees.and it took no position on the remaining terms,stating that the town will advise on the remaining points once the town reviewed the proposal.we therefore can not agree with the district court characterization of this communication as east haven me eting naacp substantive demands with respect to its hiring practices,naacp ii,d at,or east haven acquiesc ing in an naacp demand for a more extensive employment recruiting program reaching out to the black community,id.at,or the town,through its lawyer,inform ing naacp attorney stephanie rones that the town agreed to all of the items except attorney fees which remained unresolved,id.
albis testimony also does not suggest that he and rones entered into an agreement on behalf of their respective clients settling naacp substantive claims.albis characterized the situation in early may as moving closer to a settlement,not reaching one.indeed,counsel for the defendants told us at oral argument that the defendants were not claiming that the town had agreed to the naacp demands and conceded that he did not think that factual finding by the district court is accurate.audiotape of oral argument,february.
after the may exchanges,no further progress was made in the negotiations.the town made no counteroffer.neither did it subsequently advise the naacp,as promised in albis may letter,as to whether it accepted the naacp substantive demands.
the naacp filed suit shortly thereafter,immediately prior to the expiration of its eeoc letter.the town then aggressively defended the lawsuit without formally agreeing to any of the terms in the naacp may letter or suggesting other terms for settlement.in light of these facts,we conclude that the district court finding that the town had agreed to all of the naacp demands except for attorney fees was clearly erroneous.the court denial to the naacp of attorney fees for work performed in and after may other than work on the fee application based on that finding was therefore an abuse of discretion 
the defendants urge us to adopt an alternative view of the district court decision.perhaps the district court,instead of finding that the town had in fact agreed to all of the naacp terms,found only that the parties would have agreed on everything except attorney fees if negotiations had continued.this would support the district court finding that the naacp brought suit solely for the purpose of obtaining those fees and that fees incurred during the course of that litigation should therefore not be reimbursed.
the defendants reading of the district court opinion is plausible.we conclude,however,that a denial of fees on this basis would also be an abuse of discretion because it would be contrary to our holding in ortiz regan,cir.as we read ortiz,the parties closeness to settlement in informal negotiations,or a defendant subjective willing ness to reach an agreement,appellees br.at,are,together or alone,insufficient grounds for declining to award attorney fees incurred in subsequent litigation.absent a showing of bad faith,a party declining settlement offers should not operate to reduce an otherwise appropriate fee award.ortiz,at quoting cowan prudential ins.of,winter,sitting by designation,rev on other grounds,cir see also raishevich foster,cir holding that a district court abused its discretion by denying fees to a party on the basis of that party rejection of the court informal oral settlement proposal,which was also rejected by his adversary.if a district court were allowed to rely on informal negotiations and hindsight to determine whether further litigation was warranted and,accordingly,whether attorney fees should be awarded,plaintiffs with meritorious claim
