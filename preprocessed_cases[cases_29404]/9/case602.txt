stephen wright wright appeals the award of summary judgment to his former employer,compusa,compusa,on his claims of disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the americans with disabilities act,et.ada and the massachusetts fair employment practices act.laws ch.after careful review,we affirm the district court decision regarding disability discrimination.we reverse and remand wright retaliation claim,however,because the record creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether compusa proffered reason for terminating wright was pretextual.
background 
wright began working for compusa in february.in,he became direct sales manager at the brighton,massachusetts store,a position he held until his discharge in august.in may,wright was diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit disorder add,and he began taking ritalin.wright first informed his manager that he suffered from add in august.he did not request accommodation at that time.
in june,a new general manager,gregory caughman,was assigned to the brighton store.soon after,wright began experiencing severe stress and anxiety on the job,which exacerbated his add symptoms.around june,wright experienced a panic attack at work and sought his physician advice,which included increasing his level of medication.during july,wright was involved in several conflicts with caughman,and he attributes the severity of his symptoms during this period to caughman managerial style.wright also alleges that his symptoms and need for increased medication were alleviated when caughman was gone from the office during part of that month.toward the end of the month,wright physician recommended that wright take a leave of absence from work.compusa granted wright a medical leave from july,to august.while on medical leave,wright requested a transfer to the braintree store.this request was denied.wright then requested that he be allowed to work from home.this request was also denied.
wright returned to work on august with letters from his physician,horan,and from his psychiatrist,song.a note from horan approving wright return to normal duties was accompanied by a letter indicating that wright was being treated for a medical condition which required him to take medications with meals three times a day.song letter noted that wright had responded positively to treatment with ritalin,described the symptoms of add,and made specific recommendations regarding how compusa could accommodate wright symptoms,including allowing wright to determine the length of time needed to complete tasks,avoiding early morning meeting times,and clarifying work assignments in writing.song letter also mentioned that discussions with wright indicated to song that wright difficulties in june and july were caused by increased stress due to the new managerial style in place since caughman arrival.wright alleges that after receiving this letter caughman nevertheless continued to issue orders contrary to song suggested accommodations.
on august,wright was scheduled to attend a meeting for direct sales managers at the compusa store in danvers.on the night of august,wright son suffered a head injury at work,and when wright realized the following morning that he needed to take his son to see the doctor,he called caughman to explain that he would be delayed.wright and caughman spoke on the phone several times that day,and caughman told wright not to come to the brighton store until he had gone to danvers.when wright was finished caring for his son,he was unable to reach anyone at the danvers store by phone.wright contacted a manager at another store who had attended the danvers meeting and asked him to fax the materials from the meeting to the brighton store.after confirming that the materials had been faxed to brighton,wright arrived at the brighton store and attempted to meet with caughman to give him the materials.caughman called wright into his office and discharged him,allegedly for insubordination due to wright failure to go to danvers as instructed.
in february,wright filed a disability discrimination and retaliation complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination.no action was taken on wright complaint.wright withdrew his administrative claim and filed a civil action in suffolk superior court,adding two individual defendants,caughman and robert morsilli compusa regional manager.on september,compusa removed the case to federal court.on december,the district court granted the individual defendants motion to dismiss,wright compusa,d,leaving compusa as the sole defendant.on december,the district court granted compusa motion for summary judgment on each of wright claims.
ii.analysis

discrimination claim 
wright contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for compusa regarding disability discrimination by failing to view the facts in the light most favorable to his claim.to establish disability discrimination under the ada and massachusetts law,wright must show that he suffers from a disability that he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of his job,either with or without reasonable accommodation and that compusa took adverse action against him because of his disability.carroll xerox,cir citing lessard osram sylvania,cir.the district court held,and we here affirm,that the evidence presented,even viewed in the light most favorable to wright,is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether wright add qualifies as a disability under the ada.
the ada defines a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual a record of such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment.wright alleges that his impairment,add,substantially limits him in the major life activities of reading,speaking,concentrating,hearing and processing information,and thinking and articulating thoughts,thus affecting his ability to write,to be spontaneous,to plan,to communicate with others,to run errands,to complete everyday chores,and to deal with stressful situations.
eeoc regulations define substantially limits as i u nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform or ii s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner,or duration under which an individual can perform a major life activity as compared to the condition,manner,or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.j.factors to be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity are i t he nature and severity of the impairment,ii t he duration or expected duration of the impairment,and iii t he permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.j.accordingly,this court has refrained from finding a disability pursuant to the ada absent evidence that the plaintiff could not perform some usual activity compared with the general population,or that he had a continuing inability to handle stress at all times,rather than only episodically.calef gillette,cir employee with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder not disabled under ada absent showing that substantially limited in the major life activities of learning or speaking.
as the district court found,the evidence wright provided indicated that his treatment for add had been quite successful,and wright acknowledges that the disruptive severity of his symptoms did not begin until caughman arrived in june.song specifically noted in his letter that wright stress in the summer of was due to the changed work environment.so,while wright presented evidence that caughman managerial style created a stressful environment for him that
