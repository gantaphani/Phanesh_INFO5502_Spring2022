by order dated november,the district court dismissed plaintiffs civil rights action as a sanction for violations of three deadlines set in an oral initial scheduling conference isc discovery order.the order of dismissal was entered despite the fact that under the district court local rules,plaintiffs had at least until november,to respond to the defendants motion requesting this drastic sanction.the court then did not accept plaintiffs motion for reconsideration in this very active case,as it denied plaintiffs permission to file a motion that exceeded the page limit in the local rules.as best one can tell,the court never considered plaintiffs explanation for their failure to meet the isc deadlines.on these and other facts presented,we reverse.
on september,plaintiffs filed an action against the commonwealth of puerto rico,its department of education,a particular high school teacher,and various officials and other parties,alleging that plaintiffs had been victims of gender discrimination,sexual harassment,and quid pro quo exchange of higher grades for sexual favors.in the early months of the litigation,the district court granted a number of extensions to various defendants to file their answers,and then allowed supplemental answers asserting new defenses as late as july.even so,two of the defendants did not timely file their answers and default judgment was initially entered against them 
the case proceeded to discovery.by order dated march,the district court notified the parties that they should prepare for the isc.the order informed the parties that all orders issued during the isc would be effective immediately,even if the isc order were not formally entered until a later date.the march,order also notified the parties that failure to comply with that order would result in stiff penalties,including but not limited to the entry of default,the dismissal of one or more claims or defenses,barring of witnesses or evidence,or monetary sanctions.
the isc order was not formally entered until august,though it was apparently orally communicated to the parties at the isc on june.the written isc order also provided that might result in the imposition of sanctions includ ing the imposition of a fine,or the elimination of any of the allegations of the complaint,the answer,or any pleading.in the middle of discovery,on november,two of the defendants filed a motion requesting that plaintiffs case be dismissed with prejudice as a sanction for plaintiffs failure to comply with the isc order.
the court order dismissing the case,signed by the district judge on november,was entered before plaintiffs had filed a response to the defendants motion.the district court stated it was dismissing the action with prejudice because plaintiffs had failed to meet three of four discovery deadlines in july and august of.the three deadlines,listed under the heading preliminary orders in the isc order,were that plaintiffs were to provide,by july,either the name of the person in charge of a previous investigation against the teacher or copies of complaints previously filed against that that plaintiffs expert was to tender his report by july,and that plaintiffs were to provide their medical records and health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa consent forms by august,all three of these deadlines predated the written isc order formal date of entry.
the district court,citing damiani rhode island hospital,cir,found that this was a case of extreme misconduct that warrants the sanction of dismissal with prejudice because the plaintiffs had violated discovery orders failed to seek consent and failed to seek approval for based on a truly valid reason.the court did not order plaintiffs to show cause,and it noted that plaintiffs had not opposed the motion.the court order was entered on november,day after the date it was signed by the district judge.
plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on november.because the motion exceeded pages in length,the limit set by the local rules,it was accompanied by a motion for leave to file an overlength document.both motions were denied the next day,november.there is no indication that the district court ever reviewed the merits of the motion or gave the plaintiffs a later opportunity to file a conforming motion.
at the time the court dismissed the case for plaintiffs failure to comply with the isc deadlines there was a pending motion from the plaintiffs to amend the isc order.this motion was filed on october,and was raised again in a filing on november.there was also activity by a previously defaulted defendant seeking to enter the case.and throughout discovery the plaintiffs had filed numerous motions to compel defendants to comply with discovery,arguing that the defendants were stalling and.at least some of plaintiffs allegations apparently had merit on august,the court granted the plaintiffs motion to compel defendants to produce certain documents,and it also partially granted plaintiffs motion to quash several of the deposition notices on the grounds that the defendants had not provided notice to all parties.
a district court may dismiss an action for noncompliance with a discovery order.b c when a district court invokes this power,our review is for abuse of discretion.see hockey league metro.hockey club,d per curiam,cir per curiam.
the sanction imposed here was dismissal with prejudice,the harshest sanction,other than contempt,which may be visited on a party.it has been used where the plaintiff has failed to prosecute his case.see link wabash,d see also pomales celulares telefonica,cir reversing a dismissal with prejudice for lack of prosecution,cir same.in that context,the sanction is reserved for cases of extremely protracted inaction measured in years,disobedience of court orders,ignorance of warnings,contumacious conduct,or some other aggravating circumstance.cosme nieves deshler,cir.this case does not involve a failure to prosecute.indeed,the plaintiffs zealously prosecuted the action.the docket sheet shows over entries at the time of entry of dismissal.

our inquiry into sanctions orders is not a mechanical one,and our cases set forth a variety of important considerations
