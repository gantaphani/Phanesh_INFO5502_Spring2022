edna martínez rivera martínez is a former employee of puerto rico vocational rehabilitation administration vra,an agency tasked with integrating persons with disabilities into the workforce.sometime after the vra let her go,martínez filed a suit against the defendants listed in our caption.essentially believing that they had discriminated against her because of her disability,age,and politics,her complaint seemingly alleges various violations of federal and local law we say essentially and seemingly because her complaint is quite muddled in key ways,forcing us to spend a lot of time piecing together what claims she makes against whom which is fair to other litigants waiting in line for our attention,by the way.adding to the confusion,the district judge homed in on one federal claim under,concluded that it ought to be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and then without explaining why dismissed the remaining claims too.
martínez appeals.unfortunately,her briefs are,like her complaint,disorganized and opaque they float legal theories but do not always ground them in the case,for example yet she still ends up with a partial victory,as we affirm in part and reverse in part.we explain our thinking below.first,a little background.
how the case got here 
a lawyer by training,martínez worked for years as a puerto rico government employee.in the late,for example,she held key posts director of the office of legal affairs and auxiliary administrator of the office of administration within the vra.a member of the popular democratic party one of puerto rico two main political parties,the other being the new progressive party martínez has a disability that affects her mobility.and our defendants knew about her political affiliation and her disability.
martínez professional life was going along swimmingly until the new progressive party luis fortuño burset became puerto rico governor in january.sadly for martínez,over the next six months vra personnel stripped her of meaningful duties,banished her to a subpar office,and made fun of her disability to list just a few of the indignities inflicted on her.as a coup de grâce,the vra told her in a letter dated january,which she acknowledged receiving the next day,january that she was being terminated effective february,as part of a government downsizing required by law.that law known as law called for among other things the termination of certain commonwealth employees based on seniority,all in the hopes of putting puerto rico on a better financial footing.see generally hornedo puig,cir discussing law.she could not work after january,the complaint says,because the stress caused by all the political and disability discrimination perpetrated by defendants exacerbated her physical disability.
not willing to go away without a fight,martínez attempted her word,not ours to file an administrative appeal with the public service labor relations commission on february.accusing the vra of discriminating against her because of her political affiliation and disability,her attempted filing asked the commission to declare void and null the layoff that was notified.as best we can tell,martínez never says what became of her attempted filing.anyway,the vra let her go days later,on february.
still upset about the termination,martínez filed a complaint with the eeoc on july,and an amended complaint on august,alleging political and disability discrimination her amended eeoc complaint specifically accused the vra of replacing her with two nondisabled female lawyers who are politically affiliated with the governing party.she asked the eeoc for a letter on february.but before getting one,she sued our defendants in federal court on february.the eeoc gave her a letter about a month later,on march.
martínez paragraph federal complaint is hardly a picture of clarity.giving that document a generous read,she seemingly alleges as best we can discern four categories of claims.the first involves a claim tied to dealing with deprivations of rights at the hands of state actors,declaring all persons have the same right to be free from discrimination in specific activities,like making and enforcing contracts and bringing suits,and forbidding racial discrimination by recipients.the second involves a claim under title i of the americans with disabilities act ada,et.the third involves an claim under the age discrimination in employment act aeda,et.and the fourth involves a of claims under puerto rico law.
to martínez complaint,defendants responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.see.b.basically they argued that the statute of limitation had run out on any section claim the applicable limitations period,they wrote,started running no later than january,the date when she could no longer work because of all the alleged discrimination she had experienced but she filed her complaint on february,they added,nearly one month after the limitations period had expired.oddly,defendants cited no authority as far as we can see for the idea that a section claim is jurisdictionally barred from federal court.see generally williams henderson,wl,at cir,unpublished agreeing with cases from the seventh and ninth circuits holding that section limitation period is not jurisdictional.odder still,they argued without supporting reasoning that because she filed her section claim out of time,the judge had to dismiss all federal claims not just the section claim.and then they suggested that the judge should decline jurisdiction over the claims.
focusing with intensity on the section claim,martínez fired back that the limitations clock did not start ticking until after february,when she learned that the vra had replaced her with persons who unlike her were politically affiliated with the new administration she does not specify the precise date,regrettably.alternatively,she argued that her august eeoc filing tolled section limitations period tolling typically operates to interrupt and so postpone the limitation period running,making her section claim filed less than a year later timely.
taking up defendants rule b motion,the district judge like the parties zeroed in on section.and he ruled,first,that the limitations period began running on january,when martínez got the termination letter,not when the vra hired her replacement though he then concluded that the limitations clock reset when she filed her eeoc complaint on july.so far,so good,for martínez.but noting that she had sued defendants before getting an eeoc letter,the judge ruled that she had not exhausted her section claim administratively remember,the judge keyed his analysis to section.and here the kicker he then dismissed all claims not just the section claim with prejudice as best we can discern,he jettisoned all federal claims on exhaustion grounds and relinquished jurisdiction over the supplemental claims.
which brings us to today,with the parties fighting over the judge section driven decision.essentially,martínez argues that she did not have to exhaust her section claim for political discrimination with the eeoc she also insists that she timely filed her federal complaint,either because she brought it within a year after learning that the vra had replaced her with persons politically simpatico with the party in power she did not know about the vra motives until the replacements appeared,the theory goes or because her eeoc filings reset the limitations clock.and,wrapping up,she contends that her receipt of the eeoc letter before the judge dismissed the case cured her failure to exhaust her claims.defendants brief disagrees with just about everything martínez says though they changed their tune a bit on the issue at oral argument,as we soon see.
time to roll up our sleeves and sort this all out.
standard of review 
relying on rule b,the judge to repeat ourselves decided the and exhaustion issues as if they implicated the court jurisdiction.on both scores,we have our doubts.as a general matter,statutes of limitations are affirmative defenses rather than jurisdictional bars.see,bowles russell,d.and,for reasons that we get to shortly,the exhaustion requirements involved here though compulsory are not jurisdictional either.perhaps then the judge should have analyzed the case under federal rule of civil procedure b failure to state a claim rather than under rule b lack of jurisdiction.see mercado ritz carlton san juan hotel,spa casino,cir.
no matter,because under either rule we review the judge order de novo,accepting martínez facts as mccloskey mueller,cir see also román oliveras power,cir.and we can affirm a dismissal under either rule on any ground supported by the record.see,mccloskey,at.the parties and we rely on facts outside the pleadings.but that is okay given the particular circumstances here.see,aversa united states,cir explaining that a court can consider whatever evidence has been submitted in deciding a rule b motion arturet vélez reynolds tobacco,n cir noting,among other things,that a court faced with a rule b motion can consider facts susceptible to judicial notice and concessions in plaintiff response to the dismissal motion watterson page,cir adding also that a court confronted with a rule b motion can consider documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties.
political discrimination section claim 
administrative exhaustion 
whether martínez had to administratively exhaust her section claim for political discrimination is easy.controlling caselaw holds that for a person in her shoes,exhaustion is not a precondition to bringing a section claim in federal court.see,patsy bd.of regents of state of,d hornedo,at so we have no trouble concluding that the judge erred in holding otherwise.
now on to the more difficult issue whether the statute of limitations ran out on martínez section claim.
statute of limitations 
for anyone not on how a analysis works for a section claim,here a quick primer.
because section does not have its own statute of limitations,a provision intended to protect defendants from having to defend against stale claims,courts use the limitations period adopted by the state where the injury supposedly occurred in puerto rico,one year see,morris gov t dev.bank of,cir citing,among other things,laws ann.tit.courts use federal law,though,to figure out when the limitation clock starts ticking.so for,say,an ousted public employee pushing a claim,our rule is that the ticking starts when she knew or had reason to know of the injury on which her claim rests.and this is true even if she did not know that political animus had caused her injury.see id.at explaining that a plaintiff need not know all the facts that support her claim in order for the limitations countdown to commence see also morales tañon power,cir citing marrero gutiérrez molina,cir.but just as we borrow the state limitations period in section cases,so too we borrow the state tolling rulings unless of course they are hostile to federal interests.see,rodríguez,at lópez gonzález mun.of comerío,cir.one tolling rule a rule courts construe narrowly against the person seeking its protection provides that an extrajudicial claim can interrupt the statute of limitations,causing the limitations period to restart.see laws ann.tit,rodríguez narváez nazario,cir discussing puerto rico law.
back to our case.like the district judge,we believe the limitations countdown began on january,the day martínez learned authoritatively of her termination,plus the reason for it the legitimacy of which she could then assess,even though,as she points out,the missive made the ouster effective february.and we reach this conclusion because in employment discrimination actions,limitations periods normally start to run when the employer decision is made and communicated to the affected employee.morris,at collecting caselaw see also rivera muriente,emphasizing that i n employment discrimination cases involving wrongful discharges,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff learns of the decision to terminate his employment even if the notice he receives is informal.
normally implies that exceptions exist,martínez protests.and she thinks that the circumstances of her case are among them because her argument continues she did not know that political animus lay behind her firing until the vra replaced her with persons affiliated with a party different from hers sometime after february,meaning by her lights that she timely filed her section claim on february,before the limitation period had expired.
we are unmoved.put to one side that martínez complaint suggests she knew or at least had chargeable knowledge of the political animus well before her replacements came on board do forget,the complaint alleged that the stress caused by the political discrimination heaped on her affected her ability to work in and around the time of january.what dooms her effort here is that our cases as we noted a few paragraphs back flatly reject the idea that a claim only accrues and the limitations countdown only starts when the plaintiff knows of both the injury and the discriminatory animus.see marrero gutiérrez,at.stated differently and more colorfully,a plaintiff cause of action does not exist in what amounts to a state of suspended animation until she is aware of the political motives behind the adverse employment decision.see morris,at.
so again,the limitations period expired one year after january,about a month before martínez filed suit.her only hope then is to convince us that some tolling act occurred.and she tries to do just that.citing section,martínez argues that her august eeoc filing is an extrajudicial claim that caused the limitations term to start anew meaning at least in her mind that she did file her february federal complaint within the period.
call us unconvinced.the parties cite no translated case from the puerto rico supreme court and no case from us or the united states supreme court interpreting puerto rico law holding that an eeoc complaint can toll the limitations period for a section claim based on the same core of facts.but,thankfully,the caselaw out there does provide enough light to illuminate the path to decision.
for instance,cases say that to have any tolling effect,an extrajudicial claim must be identical to the later suit in several respects the two must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities new defendants should not be added they must be based on the same substantive claims and they must seek the same form of relief.rodríguez garcía mun.of caguas,cir discussing tolling under section.the purpose behind the identicality requirement is to stop plaintiffs from sidestepping the notice function of the statute of limitations when they file their belated federal court complaints.id.at.
the first problem for martínez all but leaps off the pages of the record her eeoc charge named only the vra and its administrator,nydia colón zayas conspicuously absent are the other defendants named in this suit.and so we easily conclude that the limitations period can not be tolled as to the parties unnamed in the eeoc charge,even without getting into thicket of whether an eeoc complaint can toll a section claim.
but we can not avoid this thicket in dealing with the vra and its administrator.taking it one step at a time,though,we see that the puerto rico supreme court says that the filing of an administrative complaint will not toll the statute of limitations if the agency lacks jurisdiction over the charge the idea apparently being that in such a situation,the administrative complaint and the judicial claim can not be identical for tolling purposes.see cintrón,english translation available at wl see also secretario del trabajo inetex hosiery,offic.trans.the parties who agree on little else agree that the eeoc does not have jurisdiction over section claims for political discrimination having uncovered no authority to the contrary,and given puerto rico tolling caselaw,we conclude that martínez eeoc filing did not reset the limitations clock for her section claim.
as for whether this result jibes with federal interests,we think that it does.here is why.our judicial superiors have said that reconstruction era acts like sections and exist independent of any other legal or administrative relief that may be available as a matter of federal or state law.burnett grattan,d emphasis added.they have also said that a discrimination charge filed with the eeoc does not toll the limitations period for a section action based on the same facts section,remember,protects certain rights against racial discrimination.see johnson ry.express agency,d.for our part,we have indicated without holding that the logic of johnson suggests no is the right answer to the question of whether filing an eeoc charge affects the limitations period for a section claim.see cintrón lorenzo fondo del seguro del estado,cir.and ultimately,martínez offers no compelling argument as to why today decision which makes explicit what cintrón lorenzo implies contravenes federal interests.
the net result of all this is that martínez section claim is.so we affirm the dismissal of this claim albeit on different grounds and push ahead.
disability discrimination ada claim 
as we said many pages ago,the judge did not explain why he kicked out martínez ada claim of disability discrimination.but based on our reading of his order,we believe that he intended to dismiss that claim on the same grounds as the section claim,failure to exhaust administrative remedies,because she sued about a month before getting the letter.the parties are of the same view,apparently,because their briefs spill much ink over whether the ada claim fails on grounds.
let step back to gain some perspective.the ada,broadly speaking,prohibits covered entit ies from discriminat ing against qualified persons because of their disabilities.see a,b.modeled on title vii of the civil rights act of,the ada incorporates that statute enforcement provisions,including as relevant to the type of ada claim in play here the requirement that a plaintiff exhaust her administrative remedies before seeking judicial redress.see,bonilla muebles alvarez,cir.more specifically and simplifying slightly,without affecting the analysis,one part of the statutory schematic creates federal jurisdiction over all actions brought under the statute,see f and another sets out conditions precedent to bringing suit,among which are filing a timely charge with the eeoc,see id.e,and receiving an eeoc letter before suing in federal court,see id.f.
as far as precedents go,the supreme court holds that the requirement is mandatory but not jurisdictional the rationale being that the timeliness provision is entirely separate from the statute jurisdictional provision and does not speak in jurisdictional terms.see zipes trans world airlines,d.all of this means that the timeliness requirement is subject to waiver,estoppel,and tolling when equity requires.see id.at see also generally arbaugh y h,d stressing that when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.the provision requiring notice of a right to sue is also separate from the jurisdictional provision.and in a case touching on that requirement,we said that a lthough plaintiff filed her original court complaint before she filed her eeoc complaint,she did receive a right to sue letter eventually and defendants have not argued the point so consistent with zipes holding about delay in filing charges not affecting jurisdiction and the applicability of equitable exceptions like waiver we found the point waived.city of providence,cir quoting zipes see also frederique alexandre dep t of nat.envtl.res.of,cir holding that the exhaustion requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite,but rather is subject to equitable exceptions,but noting that futility does not fall within the small field of exceptions.echoes the prevailing view elsewhere,which we now expressly adopt as our own,that while the requirement remains,it is simply a precondition to bringing suit,not a jurisdictional bar,and thus can be waived by the parties or the court.pietras bd.of fire comm rs of farmingville fire,cir collecting caselaw see also surrell ca.water serv,cir worth tyer,cir jones am.state bank,cir.
at oral argument,defendants lawyer changed his position,waiving any argument about the letter by essentially agreeing with martínez that the judge should not have dismissed the ada claim on that ground.consistent with,we accept defendants waiver and reverse the dismissal of that claim and given our conclusion,we need not ponder martínez theory that the eeoc eventually giving her a letter cured any issues with her prematurely filing suit.
age discrimination adea claim 
as for martínez supposed adea claim the adea,roughly speaking,protects persons years old or older from employment discrimination,see adamson walgreens,cir we need only say this.martínez had to exhaust her administrative remedies before bringing an age discrimination claim under the adea to court.see jorge rumsfeld,cir citing d see also generally kale combined ins,cir noting that the requirement is mandatory,though not jurisdictional.and she rightly concedes as much.but she did not mention age discrimination in her eeoc charge she alleged only political and disability discrimination.and given her fatal failure to exhaust,her supposed adea claim does not belong in federal court which compels us to affirm the dismissal of this claim.
local law claims 
that leaves one loose end.the judge we remind the reader did not explain why martínez claims had to go he spent no time on whether any of these claims has legs,for example though we assume that having dismissed the federal claims,he declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.the parties give us no reason to assume otherwise.given that assumption,and because we are reversing the dismissal of the ada claim,the judge on remand must reinstate the claims too.of course if the judge again gets rid of the ada claim before trial,he can reassess whether to keep jurisdiction over the claims.rivera corraliza puig morales,cir.
final words 
to the extent that martínez briefs hint at other arguments,they lack coherence,development,or both and instead of trying to hazard our own guess as to what these arguments may or may not portend,we do what we have done before including in this very opinion rely on the familiar rule that arguments are waived.see marek rhode island,cir quoting zannino,at 
so our work is at an end,with the bottom line being that we affirm the judge in every respect,except that we reverse the dismissal of both martínez ada claim and her claims.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.no costs to either side.
martínez son,mother,and sister joined as parties plaintiffs.the district judge found and martínez does not argue otherwise that their claims are derivative of hers.so we treat the case as if martínez were the only plaintiff and appellant.
her opening brief jurisdictional statement,for instance,makes passing reference to the possibility that defendants violated her fifth and fourteenth amendment rights.but she never explains how or why this is so.obviously then,any argument based on these theories is waived.see,hsbc realty credit usa,cir explaining that arguments not developed in a party opening brief are waived.
eeoc stands for equal employment opportunity commission.
reader alert recall how martínez complaint seemingly suggests that three statutes drive her claim section,section,and section.well,her brief does not seriously discuss whether or how sections and apply in the context of this case,meaning she has waived any possible arguments tied to those provisions.see,rivera muriente agosto alicea,cir citing united states zannino,cir,for the canonical rule that arguments not developed in any meaningful way are waived see also rodríguez mun.of san juan,cir adding that claims not made and claims confusingly constructed and lacking in coherence are considered waived too quoting united states eirby,cir.
