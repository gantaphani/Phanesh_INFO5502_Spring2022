gary webber appeals from the district court judgment which was granted to his former employer,international paper company ip,as a matter of law notwithstanding the jury verdict which webber obtained on his disability discrimination claim.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
we relate the record evidence,and all reasonable inferences therefrom,in the light most consistent with the jury verdict.see crowley bean,cir.from and until his termination in,webber was a mechanical draftsman for ip at its mill in bucksport,maine.in,he was promoted to the position of engineer,a job description which required an engineering degree,which webber did not possess.in,webber was assigned to oversee a million construction project at the mill site consisting of a chemical storage facility.
in,webber injured his knee while working temporarily as a forklift operator.surgery was required.over the years,webber had heard other unspecified employees say that salaried people do not get hurt.during his convalescence,webber supervisor,stephen finley,told webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost twenty pounds.finley and another supervisor,lawrence schaub,laughed at finley remark.webber returned to work one month later.in,he resumed his former duties as a project engineer,despite the fact that his mobility was severely restricted,necessitating his use of a cane.
webber requested that ip provide him with several accommodations,including permission to work from his home,reduced work hours,special parking privileges,reassignment from a to a office,and the installation of a glide chair which would permit webber to ride from his office to the engineering department.ip granted all of these requests.another supervisor,steve moser,dubbed the glide chair the costanza chair,a reference to a character from a popular television sitcom who used a glide chair to feign a work disability.
in january,webber underwent total surgery.one month later,a plan,called functional fast,was instituted by ip national headquarters,which would result in the elimination of employees nationwide.in may,thomas thompson,webber immediate supervisor,asked him how long it would be before his knee healed.
in june,fred oettinger,the bucksport mill manager,learned that the overall workforce was to be reduced by positions,which was to include an reduction in technical,staff,from to.ip national office in memphis informed oettinger that other ip mills of comparable size employed only six project engineers,whereas bucksport had ten.rather than eliminate four project engineers,however,oettinger decided to cut only two positions.
following consultations with the national office,oettinger eventually selected webber and wayne jacobs for termination.oettinger notified supervisors schaub and moser of the decision on friday,june.neither schaub nor moser voiced objection.on the following monday,thompson approached webber and informed him you the weakest link,you gone.thereafter,oettinger summoned webber to a meeting,at which webber was notified of his termination.adverting to the quality and quantity of webber work,oettinger explained that he had based his termination decision on the fact that webber was the only one of the ten engineers without an engineering degree,thus was less capable than the other engineers of handling more complex engineering projects.
in august,webber submitted a employment discrimination claim against ip with the maine human rights commission mhrc,received a letter,and commenced the instant diversity action in federal district court,alleging that ip had violated the maine human rights act.ann.ch,et.the district court denied the pretrial motion for summary judgment submitted by ip,as well as its motion for judgment as a matter of law.in due course,a jury returned a million verdict against ip.
thereafter,however,the district court granted ip renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacated the jury verdict,citing the insufficiency of webber evidence as to ip discriminatory animus.webber int l paper,d.webber appeals from the judgment.
discussiona.standard of review 
a district court judgment entered as a matter of law is subject to de novo review,which requires that we view all the evidence,reasonable inferences,and credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,webber.see,cir.b.moreover,we will affirm the ruling only if we determine that the record,thus viewed,strongly and overwhelmingly points to but one no reasonable jury would have reached a contrary result.see,at.although the standard for setting aside a jury verdict is plainly stringent,bears the ultimate burden of have adduced more than a mere scintilla of evidence supporting the elements of his claim,and can not prevail where the verdict necessarily rests upon evidence which is overly speculative or conjectural.see ricci alternative energy,cir.
prima facie evidence 
as webber adduced no direct evidence of discriminatory intent,see chuang of cal.davis,bd.of trustees,cir describing the stringent requirements of a case,his case was subject to the paradigm.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d fernandes costa.masonry,cir.accordingly,webber was required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,by adducing competent evidence that he was a member of a protected class,disabled he satisfied his employer legitimate job performance expectations his employer terminated him and his employer did not accord similar treatment to persons outside the protected class.see thorndike kmart,d,mhra accord sun oil,cir.once the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case,his employer must shoulder the burden to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff termination.see reeves,at.once the employer satisfies that minimal burden of production,the plaintiff must bear the ultimate burden of adducing sufficient evidence from which a factfinder rationally might infer that the employer articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination,and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus.see id.in this endeavor,many veins of circumstantial evidence may be mined and t hese are by no means limited of differential treatment,evidence of discriminatory comments,statistical evidence,and comparative evidence.rathbun autozone,cir citation omitted.
the district court assumed arguendo that webber had satisfied his initial burden to establish a prima facie case,shifting to ip the burden of production,see,hall giant food,and on appeal,webber does not contend that he established a prima facie case.instead,he urges three grounds for determining that the issue is not properly before us.
first,webber argues that ip waived this argument by failing to include it in its motion for judgment as a matter of law.but,of course,ip is not the appellant,and we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record on appeal.see geffon micrion,cir.
second,webber maintains that he was not required to establish that the eight engineers retained by ip were not disabled,because,unlike such obvious attributes as race or gender,disability or lack thereof is too difficult of proof.he cites no authority for such an exception to the fourth element nor have we found any.prima facie proof of coemployees may be somewhat more than proof of their race or gender,but the burden is neither unreasonable nor onerous.webber presumably had ample opportunity to discover this sort of information,and had he proffered even minimally competent testimony that the retained engineers suffered from no such disability,ip would have had the burden to counter webber assertions with contrary evidence,if any existed.we can discern no sound reason for excusing a claimant from adducing such straightforward evidence as part of his prima facie case.
finally,webber argues that the sufficiency vel non of his prima facie case was relevant only during trial,and that after the jury verdict,the question became entirely moot.see united states postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d.however,webber reliance on aikens is misplaced.during trial,the plaintiff failure to establish a prima facie case will justify summary disposition,since the employer would not be required to shoulder its burden to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff discharge.the paradigm was designed primarily as a procedural mechanism for use in cases involving no direct evidence of discrimination,in order to facilitate the orderly presentation of circumstantial evidence of discrimination.if the employer fails,however,to move for summary disposition at this procedural,when plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case,and voluntarily assumes its burden of production,the inadequacy of plaintiff prima facie showing,standing alone,is no longer grist for the summary judgment mill.see,richardson leeds police dep t,cir 
webber argument is flawed,however,because he assumes that,after trial,the total absence of evidence which would have comprised his prima facie case is irrelevant to the decision whether plaintiff met his burden of proof at the third stage of.while the failure or weakness of a prima facie showing will not alone constitute grounds for judgment for the employer,it significantly weighs in the balance when we assess whether the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence overall from which a jury rationally might infer that the employer articulated reason constitutes a pretext for discrimination,and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus.see,barnes city of cincinnati,cir nonetheless,the evidentiary underpinnings of a plaintiff case are not irrelevant or insulated from our examination to aid our determination whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.see also schnabel abramson,cir.
webber admittedly failed either to adduce evidence that the eight retained engineers were not disabled,or that ip had terminated any other disabled employee.indeed,the undisputed evidence discloses that ip and oettinger had an exemplary record of granting accommodations to webber and to other disabled employees.although arguably one might reasonably have expected that ip would come forward with evidence in the event that any of these retained engineers had been disabled,this is beside the point inasmuch as ip did not have to bear that burden of proof.webber attempt at a prime facie showing was not merely weak.see reckitt colman,cir noting that strength of plaintiff prime facie case must be weighed with slight evidence of pretext ricci,at noting that plaintiff case can not rest on speculation.as webber adduced no evidence from which the jury rationally could have determined whether the retained or terminated employees were disabled,he completely failed to carry his burden of proof on the fourth element of his prima facie case,which required that he demonstrate that ip either retained no employees who were disabled,or terminated other employees who were disabled.given this evidentiary gap,we next turn to webber other evidence of discrimination.
c.the evidence of pretext 
the circumstantial evidence of ip discriminatory intent 
webber points to evidence that his,moser,and a history of making discriminatory remarks concerning his disability.for instance,schaub laughed when another supervisor told webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost pounds.then,after ip installed the glide chair,moser referred to it as the costanza chair a reference to an episode in the television sitcom seinfeld wherein a character had used such a chair lift to fake a disability immediately prior to the time oettinger notified webber of his termination,thompson gloated you the weakest link,you gone.
webber he utter absence of evidence i that schaub,moser,or thompson affirmatively conveyed any alleged discriminatory animus to oettinger,who was the decisionmaker of record,see cariglia hertz equip.rental,cir discussing lack of infection,or ii that oettinger either independently harbored or demonstrated any discriminatory animus toward webber.therefore,any alleged animus on the part of schaub,moser,or thompson is relevant only if they participated in or influenced the decision to terminate webber.see caribbean forms,cir cariglia,at pueblo int l,cir 
as webber adduced no evidence that thompson was involved to any extent whatsoever in oettinger decisionmaking,we need not discuss any discriminatory remarks allegedly made by thompson.
on the other hand,a somewhat closer question is presented by the conduct of schaub and moser.webber notes i that oettinger consulted with schaub and moser three days prior to the termination,and ii that moser decided to mull the issue over during the weekend.ip counters that the purported animus on the part of schaub and moser is irrelevant since oettinger testified i that he was the only decisionmaker regarding webber termination,ii that he simply notified schaub and moser of his final decision,and iii that neither schaub nor moser either participated in or contributed to the decision.the truth is to be found somewhere between these two characterizations,however.
oettinger,who independently harbored no discriminatory animus,did testify that he had made up his mind to terminate webber prior to the meeting with schaub and moser,and that he consulted schaub and moser to reassure himself that he had not overlooked any relevant facts.on the other hand,moser testified that he thought that he could have changed oettinger mind had he expressed disagreement with oettinger decision.thus,moser decision to mull over the decision during the weekend could support a reasonable inference that oettinger expected such input.in the end,of course,moser simply acquiesced in the oettinger decision,and there is no evidence that moser ever told oettinger that webber should be terminated.be that as it may,we shall assume arguendo that,even in the absence of any such direct,affirmative communication between oettinger and moser,a supervisor silence,his discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power conferred upon him by his employer could constitute sufficient participation or influence to warrant imputing moser purported animus to ip.
the pivotal question thus becomes whether the jury could rationally infer from these record facts that moser conceivably influenced the decision to fire webber we conclude that such an inference is excessively speculative to sustain the jury verdict.the moser testimony that he believed that he could have changed oettinger mind regarding the termination not only conflicts with oettinger assertion that his decision was final,but even more importantly is unsupported by any other corroborative evidence of moser power to veto these decisions,either prior to or following webber termination.furthermore,oettinger testified that he did not seek moser opinion,but instead intended to ascertain whether moser was aware of any material facts which oettinger might have missed.thus,had moser intervened,he would have had to supply facts,yet oettinger nonetheless would have remained the ultimate decisionmaker.thus,at best the record evidence could support only a most tenuous inference that the moser decision not to stand up for webber proximately caused the webber termination.
the nondiscriminatory basis ip proffered for the termination 
in explicating its nondiscriminatory basis for selecting webber for termination,ip pointed to his lack of an engineering degree,and a consequent,relative absence of experience with sophisticated engineering projects while at ip.webber argues on appeal that the trial evidence generated a jury question as to whether the reason articulated by ip was a pretext for discrimination,in that i his job description had required that he possess such a degree,yet ip let him work at ip as a project engineer for eighteen years without a degree ii ip did not establish that webber was incapable of handling any type of engineering project which was,or conceivably might be,undertaken at ip and iii webber adduced evidence that he was better qualified than four of the retained engineers with degrees.
a plaintiff may establish pretext by demonstrating,inter alia,that the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory reason which had no basis in fact,did not actuate the termination,or was insufficiently weighty to motivate
