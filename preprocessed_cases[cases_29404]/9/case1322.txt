this is an appeal in an employment discrimination case.there is a nursery rhyme that teaches sticks and stones may break my bones,but names will never hurt me.such is a lesson particularly doubtful in the workplace,as illustrated by this case,because alleged epithets and demeaning invective directed at a plaintiff by his or her superiors or can,if believed by a factfinder,subject an employer to legal liability for discrimination.
plaintiff howard mandell,a practicing jew and a employee of the suffolk county police department suffolk county police or the department,instituted the instant action against defendants,the county of suffolk and john gallagher,its police commissioner,individually and in his official capacity,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york mishler.
adverse employment actions were taken against him,plaintiff contends,because of his religion,and also in retaliation for his june testimony before the suffolk county legislature public safety committee and for his interview with newsday,the long island daily newspaper.accordingly,the complaint alleges religious discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and first amendment retaliation in violation of.it also asserts claims under new york state human rights law,exec.law,and the new york state constitution,article.
background 
i factsa.plaintiff allegations of and bias within the suffolk county police department 
because we are reviewing a dismissal of the complaint at the summary judgment stage,we view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and resolve all factual disputes in plaintiff favor.see.c.plaintiff was employed by the suffolk county police for over years,retiring with the rank of deputy inspector in.he joined the department as a police officer in and attained the rank of captain in,through a series of promotions based on civil service examinations.mandell asserts that throughout his police career he faced a and,more specifically,bias.further,he contends for a long time has been a part of the department culture.he has repeatedly been a target of remarks and taunting,such as being called that jew and jewboy and being told that all jews stick together,and was subjected to insulting and demeaning conduct by fellow officers.he relates that on one occasion,for example,another officer tossed a dime on the floor before him to see if he would stoop down to pick it up.plaintiff claims also to have heard virulent remarks directed at other jews,such as f ing jews and f ing jew lawyer.although these overt expressions of in his presence virtually ceased in upon his promotion to deputy inspector,he attributes this to his rank,not to a shift in the department attitude toward him.
rabbi jeffrey wartenberg,a suffolk county police chaplain,supported plaintiff allegations,stating in an affidavit that during his years with the department he had heard many jewish officers complain about the disparaging remarks made against their religion.based on his experience,rabbi wartenberg concluded that is a way of life within the department and that jewish officers had been held back in their careers by superiors with negative feelings about them.he said his complaints to every police commissioner,including defendant gallagher,did not result in any corrective action,and the suffolk county police continues to favor catholics,while jewish officers are only promoted in the rare cases where merit is the sole criterion.
plaintiff career before and his public criticism of the department 
in june,when he was a police lieutenant,mandell testified before the suffolk county legislature public safety committee.his testimony described the department as insufficiently proactive in fighting organized crime,resistant to change,and more focused on protecting its internal bureaucracy than on protecting the public.he also set out his view that the network within the department covered up officers misconduct,including criminal activity,and that racism and were systemic.on the following day,plaintiff photograph and an excerpt from this testimony appeared on the front page of newsday under the headline,suffolk cop charges they look out for their own.
apparently members of the department were offended because in january plaintiff was expelled from the suffolk county patrolmen benevolent association for having branded the entire department as racist and.plaintiff says his expulsion was another manifestation of the general hostility toward him,triggered by his testimony,that persisted in the department for years.
later in mandell was promoted from lieutenant to captain.this promotion,like those before it,was not discretionary to the commissioner,but based on a civil service examination,subject to the commissioner bypass.as part of the promotion procedure,mandell inspector john stewart wrote an evaluation that gave a generally positive assessment of plaintiff work as a police officer,describing him as an acceptable candidate for promotion to the rank of captain.in the evaluation stewart also stated that plaintiff was a somewhat controversial individual and complained that he stewart had spent too much time on issues relating to plaintiff,the media,and internal investigations.he wrote,specifically underlining the second clause,
while i do not consider that the attitude projected by plaintiff should necessarily affect plaintiff suitability for promotion to captain,i do feel that his attitude should be taken into account when placing him in any future assignment.
this evaluation was placed in plaintiff personnel file.
a year later plaintiff was promoted to the rank of deputy inspector.this promotion was distinct from mandell preceding promotions because all promotions beyond the rank of a captain were made at the discretion of the police commissioner,who at that time was daniel guido.unlike the commissioners before and after him,commissioner guido was not from suffolk county he was an outsider and a known reformer.mandell attributes his promotion to commissioner guido effort to institute a promotion policy and maintains that after commissioner guido resignation,the department reverted to its network practices of nepotism and cronyism.the promotion to deputy inspector was not only plaintiff sole discretionary promotion it was also his last.
several years later,in the summer of,at his supervisor request,mandell gave an interview to newsday for its series of articles entitled black n blue in wyandanch summer in the precinct.the series focused on the operation of the predominantly white police force in a predominantly black community of wyandanch.the second article quoted plaintiff as saying that the suffolk county police had difficulty recruiting black officers because the black community viewed police officers as oppressors.the article reported,in addition,plaintiff comment that he had to remove some officers with racist attitudes from covering wyandanch despite his efforts to screen officers for racist attitudes before assigning them there.
after the publication of the newsday article,mandell hostility toward him escalated.for example,other police officers would not talk to him unless they had to,and two police chiefs expressly warned him that his comments in newsday might harm his chances for advancement.within days of publication,chief edwin michel told him that if he wanted to be a chief he would have to learn to keep his mouth shut,and chief gerald marcoe advised that his career might be adversely affected because he was still carrying the baggage from having testified,referring to the public safety committee testimony.in january,five months after the interview,mandell was transferred from the executive officer position he held in the first precinct to a post of commanding officer in the staff services bureau.plaintiff viewed this transfer as punishment because his superiors knew he preferred to work in the more prestigious patrol division rather than in the desk job at staff services.
plaintiff career during gallagher tenure as commissioner 
in january defendant john gallagher became police commissioner of suffolk county.the crux of plaintiff complaint is that gallagher,who is,promoted a mentality in the department.at official police functions gallagher made statements like w e are all good christians,and,w e can all work well together because we all went to good christian schools,were taught by the christian brothers and learned good christian values.defendants respond that gallagher statements were innocuous and taken out of context.
during gallagher tenure as commissioner,shomrim,a fraternal organization for jewish police officers that mandell,saw its membership decrease dramatically the organization was defunct when plaintiff retired.plaintiff contends that this occurred under gallagher administration because visibility as a jew in the department was seen as a liability.
on four separate occasions between and,gallagher declined to promote plaintiff to the rank of an inspector on august,one position open on september,two positions open on august,two positions open and on november,one position open.these promotions went to catholic officers instead.
when he was passed over the first time in august mandell complained to gallagher about discrimination in the department.defendant said he would institute a formal internal affairs investigation.dissatisfied with this response,plaintiff wrote a letter on august,to suffolk county legislator maxine postal.in the letter he criticized gallagher decision to forward his discrimination complaint to internal affairs,and labeled defendant as either the most pathetically inept commissioner that we have ever had or the most devious.it is sharply contested whether gallagher saw a copy of this letter prior to the instant litigation.
in november gallagher involuntarily transferred plaintiff,who was then a commanding and position in a the more subordinate position of executive officer.this transfer was perceived as a demotion not only by plaintiff but also by his fellow officers who commented that the transfer was not favorable,not in anticipation of a promotion,and that it was plain the department was trying to force plaintiff to resign.
ii proceedings below 
the instant action was commenced in march,with an amended complaint filed in february.in the amended complaint mandell contends that the four denials of promotion to inspector in and the transfer to executive officer were motivated in part by religious discrimination and in part by retaliation for his public criticism of the department.at the close of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on a number of different grounds.concluding that plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or to adduce evidence of a causal connection between the two instances of speech and the adverse employment actions at issue,the district court granted defendants summary judgment on all plaintiff claims.this appeal ensued.we affirm,in part,and vacate and remand,in part.
discussion 
i standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.graham long island,cir.a district court may award summary judgment only if,after drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in the party favor here plaintiff,it concludes that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.to overcome such a motion,the party must offer sufficient proof to allow a reasonable factfinder to decide in its favor.in discrimination cases where state of mind is at issue,we affirm a grant of summary judgment in favor of an employer sparingly because careful scrutiny of the factual allegations may reveal circumstantial evidence to support the required inference of discrimination.graham,at.
ii title vii and state human rights law claims against gallagher 
although the district court ruled in favor of defendant gallagher on other grounds,the district court dismissal of plaintiff title vii claims against gallagher in his personal capacity must be affirmed because under title vii individual supervisors are not subject to liability.see wrighten glowski,cir per curiam tomka seiler,cir see also shumway united parcel,cir noting that an appellate court may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground appearing in the record.individual liability is sometimes possible,however,under new york human rights law.gregory daly,cir tomka,at.since the parties have not briefed this issue,either in the district court or on appeal,and because,as discussed below,we vacate the dismissal of the state human rights law claims against the county,we also vacate the dismissal of those state claims against gallagher,without prejudice to his raising the issue of individual liability on remand.
iii title vii and state human rights law claims against county 
we analyze plaintiff federal and state law discrimination claims together since in other contexts we have applied federal standards of proof to discrimination claims under the state human rights law.see delta air lines,cir,cert.denied,d age discrimination weinstock columbia,cir sex discrimination torres pisano,cir hostile work environment van zant klm royal dutch airlines,cir hostile work environment and retaliation.as the parties do not contend that federal and state standards diverge,we will for purposes of this opinion assume that the standards of proof applicable to plaintiff title vii and human rights law claims are the same in all relevant respects.
prima facie case 
mandell religious discrimination claims are analyzed under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.see meiri dacon,cir applying the mcdonnell douglas framework to a religious discrimination claim.at the first stage of the mcdonnell douglas analysis,a plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he or she is a member of a protected class was qualified for the position at issue was denied the position and that the circumstances of the adverse employment decision give rise to an inference of discrimination.howley town of stratford,cir rosen thornburgh,cir.defendants do not contest the first three elements,focusing instead on the fourth element,and contending,as they did in the district court,that the circumstances do not give rise to an inference of discrimination.
the burden of establishing a prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas is minimal.howley,at.in the case at hand,plaintiff evidence of discrimination falls into three categories gallagher statements indicating his preference for promotion of christians or catholics evidence of department culture tolerant of and promotion of catholic officers on the four occasions at issue.
gallagher comments.at an official police function shortly after he became commissioner,gallagher addressed members of the department in a speech replete with references to christian values and catholic education,including such comments as the all good christians remarks noted earlier.on another occasion,the commissioner professed his belief in absolute papal authority at a breakfast meeting with department members.from these statements,a reasonable juror could infer that gallagher viewed,more broadly,a necessary part of a good police officer and that he considered officers to be lacking the right.
in his response,gallagher declares that he mentioned christian schooling only in pointing out that chief monteith and he had attended the same school run by the christian brothers order,and the pope absolute authority,he said,was used as an analogy to a police commissioner prerogative to circumvent hierarchical channels of communication and to work directly with officers at the various level of the chain of command.at the summary judgment stage,however,we must resolve all factual disputes in plaintiff favor.accepting plaintiff account of gallagher comments as true,a reasonable juror could conclude that these comments indicated gallagher or bias.
the trial court rejected the proof regarding gallagher preference for catholics as insufficient to support a prima facie case of religious discrimination,absent any proof of animus directed specifically at jews.we think this reasoning was error.first,contrary to the district court belief,plaintiff did submit evidence of animus,which we discuss in a moment.second,to establish a claim of religious discrimination,plaintiff does not have to prove that defendants discriminated solely against his religion.an employer discriminating against any violates the laws no less than an employer discriminating only against one discrete group,in this case,jews.
culture of department.comments and behavior have traditionally been part of the culture of the suffolk county police department.the facts section detailed the epithets aimed at plaintiff and the department tolerance for conduct,such as the coin toss mentioned earlier,which was a reference to the demeaning ethnic stereotype that jews are cheap.although most of these examples of overt plaintiff promotion to deputy inspector,a reasonable juror could find this improved behavior reflects not a change in attitude,but only greater caution by fellow officers regarding their conduct in the presence of an officer who outranked them.
further support for plaintiff allegations about the department culture bias is provided by the affidavit of rabbi wartenberg who served as the suffolk county police chaplain for years.although his affidavit contains a number of conclusory characterizations,rabbi wartenberg also avers that he had communicated his concern about attitudes within the department to every commissioner with whom he had worked,including commissioner gallagher.all responded by acknowledging that was a problem,but failed to take any concrete action to remedy it.for instance,throughout his tenure as a chaplain,rabbi wartenberg said he had never seen an official statement issued by a commissioner condemning,nor had he ever heard of a police officer receiving punishment beyond chastisement for conduct.
this proof indicates that department leadership,including gallagher,knowingly tolerated attitudes and conduct.interpreted in the light most favorable to plaintiff,it suggests an bias on defendants part and therefore further supports the assertion that gallagher decisions not to promote plaintiff and to transfer him to a subordinate position were motivated by an illegal animus.
promotion of catholic officers.on four occasions gallagher passed over plaintiff for promotion to inspector in favor of others.of the six deputy inspectors promoted in,five were concededly catholic.mandell admittedly does not know the religion of the sixth deputy inspector though he believes he is also catholic.defendants do not dispute the religious backgrounds of the promoted deputy inspectors,declaring instead that such promotions are not proof of discrimination.
a showing of disparate is,a showing that the employer treated plaintiff less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside his protected group is a recognized method of raising an inference of discrimination for purposes of making out a prima facie case.graham,at.a plaintiff relying on disparate treatment evidence must show she was similarly situated in all material respects to the individuals with whom she seeks to compare herself.id.ordinarily,the question whether two employees are similarly situated is a question of fact for the jury.in the instant case,plaintiff has adduced enough evidence to support a finding that the promoted officers and plaintiff were sufficiently similarly situated to support an inference of discrimination.mandell and the promoted officers were all qualified and mandell had greater or comparable seniority,having spent more time in rank and more time in the department than all but one officer of those promoted ahead of him.
in contesting the significance of the promotions,defendants first rely on gallagher statement that at the time of the promotions he was not aware of the promoted officers religious backgrounds.additionally,defendants assert that an inference of discrimination is not warranted because on each of the four occasions the pool of candidates included other deputy inspectors with similar or greater seniority than plaintiff,some of whom gallagher knew to be catholic and yet chose not to promote.yet,even were gallagher denials of knowledge to be believed,it still remains true that in a predominantly christian department,gallagher decision to reject the one known jewish candidate in favor of a candidate of unknown religion,coupled with his comments,could support an inference of discrimination.in any event,we think the proof detailed in,and is sufficient to satisfy plaintiff minimal prima facie burden.
defendants proffer of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons 
given that plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination,we now turn to the remaining two stages of the mcdonnell douglas analysis.under mcdonnell douglas,once plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,a presumption arises that his employer unlawfully discriminated against him.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.to rebut this presumption,the employer must come forward with admissible evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its adverse actions toward plaintiff.see id.
with respect to the august promotion,gallagher deposition testimony provides sufficient evidence of legitimate reasons for his decision not to promote plaintiff.gallagher testified that in evaluating candidates for the august promotion he relied heavily on the recommendations of police chiefs and the deputy commissioner.several of the chiefs as well as precinct community leaders recommended the officer ultimately promoted at that time,deputy inspector hamann.in addition,gallagher maintains that he chose hamann because hamann was already working in the precinct where the vacancy existed,and was therefore familiar with conditions there.
gallagher further attributes his decision not to promote plaintiff to the negative impression plaintiff made on him during a interview.he states in vague terms that mandell did not project the image of someone who has a positive grasp of some unspecified areas of interest to gallagher.while defendant does not clarify what particular image he was seeking,it appears that the negative impression stemmed at least in part from plaintiff reaction during the interview to gallagher expressed preference for promoting an officer from within the precinct.plaintiff told gallagher he considered this approach unfair because it disadvantaged officers in support services functions,a position mandell then held.
gallagher testimony also provides evidence of nondiscriminatory reasons for the denials of promotion.gallagher explains that he chose not to promote mandell on those three occasions because of plaintiff derogatory comments about him in the letter sent to county legislator postal,which plaintiff wrote after being passed over for the august promotion.the letter characterized gallagher as either inept or devious,and it further labeled him a modern day version of pontius pilate because plaintiff thought that by referring his discrimination complaint to the internal affairs bureau,gallagher washed his hands of the problem in the department.gallagher maintains that he received a copy of the letter prior to the september round of promotions and was influenced by its content,as well as by the negative impression made on him by mandell interview.
defendants do not articulate any basis for the transfer from commanding officer to the more subordinate position of executive officer.in fact,in their briefs in the district court and here,defendants address the transfer claim primarily by stating that officers other than plaintiff have also been transferred from commanding officer positions to executive officer positions.without any evidence with respect to the circumstances of these transfers,the fact they occurred is not relevant to our analysis.accordingly,defendants failed to carry their burden of establishing legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the demotion,and the dismissal of plaintiff claim of discriminatory transfer must be vacated.
plaintiff ultimate burden of establishing discrimination 
once the employer produces evidence of legitimate reasons for its actions,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the real reason for the a
