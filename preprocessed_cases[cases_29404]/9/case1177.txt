this case requires us to sail into the unsettled waters of free speech rights in public schools,waters rife with rocky shoals and uncertain currents.plaintiff zachary guiles,a student at williamstown middle high school wmhs,williamstown high school,or school in williamstown,vermont,claims his right under the first amendment to wear a depicting president george bush in an uncharitable light has been violated.the,through an amalgam of images and text,criticizes the president as a president and accuses him of being a former alcohol and cocaine abuser.to make its point,the shirt displays images of drugs and alcohol.
upon the complaint of another student and her mother,school officials made guiles put duct tape over the alcohol and pictures on the ground that those illustrations violate a school policy prohibiting any display of such images.plaintiff,through his mother and father,brought the instant action to enjoin the school application of the policy to his shirt,asserting that the policy violates his freedom to engage in political speech.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions,held the school censorship a permissible abridgement of guiles first amendment rights.from this holding the plaintiff appeals.the district court also ordered that the disciplinary action defendants took against plaintiff be expunged from his school record.from this holding defendants appeal.guiles ex rel.lucas marineau,d.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand this case to the district court.
background 
a.the parties 
in may plaintiff guiles was a student at williamstown middle high school.defendant seth marineau was the student support specialist at the school during the academic year.his job included enforcing dress code policy.defendant kathleen was the principal of the high school,and defendant douglas shoik was the superintendent of the orange north supervisory union,which includes wmhs collectively,defendants.in his action guiles has sued the defendants in their official capacities.
in march plaintiff began wearing the offending to school.he had purchased it at an rally he attended.the front of the shirt,at the top,has large print that reads george bush,below it is the text.directly below these words is a large picture of the president face,wearing a helmet,superimposed on the body of a chicken.surrounding the president are images of oil rigs and dollar symbols.to one side of the president,three lines of cocaine and a razor blade appear.in the chicken wing of the president nearest the cocaine,there is a straw.in the other wing the president is holding a martini glass with an olive in it.directly below all these depictions is printed,chicken hawk wing,and below that is text reading world domination tour.
the back of the has similar pictures and language,including the lines of cocaine and the martini glass.the representations on the back of the shirt are surrounded by smaller print accusing the president of being a crook,cocaine addict,awol,draft dodger,and lying drunk driver.the sleeves of the shirt each depict a military patch,one with a man drinking from a bottle,and the other with a chicken flanked by a bottle and three lines of cocaine with a razor.without question guiles uses harsh rhetoric and imagery to express disagreement with the president policies and to impugn his character.
school action relating to the 
guiles wore the on average once a week for two months.although the shirt evoked discussion from students,it did not cause any disruptions or fights inside or outside the school.but,the raised the ire of one fellow student whose politics evidently were opposed to guiles.this student complained to teachers who told her that the shirt was political speech and therefore protected.
on may,guiles was to go on a school field trip.he wore the that day.a parent who was to chaperone the the parent of the student who had previously complained to teachers regarding the the shirt and voiced her objection to defendant marineau.
marineau,after consulting with shoik,determined that the,specifically the images of drugs and alcohol,violated the following provision of the wmhs dress code 
any aspect of a person appearance,which constitutes a real hazard to the health and safety of self and others or is otherwise distracting,is unacceptable as an expression of personal taste.example clothing displaying alcohol,drugs,violence,obscenity,and racism is outside our responsibility and integrity guideline as a school community and is prohibited.

marineau gave guiles three choices turn the shirt tape over the images of the drugs and alcohol and the word cocaine or change shirts.marineau was unsure whether the word cocaine violated the policy.he did not,however,relay this doubt to the student,leaving the student to think that it too must be taped over.guiles father came in to speak with marineau,who reiterated that the shirt contravened dress code policy.guiles and his father then went to speak with shoik who reaffirmed what marineau had said.guiles returned home with his father for the remainder of that day.
on may,plaintiff returned to school wearing the.marineau again instructed him to tape over the offending images with duct tape,turn the shirt inside out,or change shirts.guiles declined,and marineau filled out a discipline referral form and sent plaintiff home.the discipline referral form remains in guiles record.on may,guiles again wore the to school,this time,however,with the images of drugs and alcohol and the word cocaine covered with duct tape.on the duct tape plaintiff had scrawled the word censored.
district court proceedings 
plaintiff then brought suit in federal district court seeking to enjoin defendants from enforcing the dress code policy with regard to his,and the district court conducted a bench trial.defendants submitted the deposition testimony of carol rose,the prevention and safety coordinator for the safe and healthy school team at the vermont department of education.rose opined that the williamstown high school policy of prohibiting all images of drugs and alcohol even such images used on and posters was appropriate because it furthers the school environmental calls for limiting student exposure to all such images.however,when asked whether clothing that depicts,drug or cigarette messages is just as harmful to students as clothing that advertises it,she responded that she did not know.
plaintiff submitted a letter of the vermont department of education stating that it did not take a position with respect to the merits of the case and that t estimony provided by deposition of carol rose was not intended to draw any conclusions with respect to the outcome of the case or any substantive legal issue therein and t o the extent it did,it did not reflect an official position of the department.guiles also presented the testimony of charles phillips,a former principal of a neighboring school.phillips testified that at his school the approach was to ban images that advocated drug and alcohol use.he also testified that he was unaware of any evidence that and messages encouraged students to use such substances.because guiles conveyed an message,he would not have censored it at his school.
finding the images plainly offensive or inappropriate under bethel school district fraser,d,the district court held the school censorship of the images was proper and declined to issue an injunction.the trial court also held the school violated guiles free speech rights by censoring the word cocaine,and therefore it ordered the discipline referral form expunged from guiles academic record.guiles and defendants both appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
normally we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see.a ramos town of vernon,cir.but because this appeal concerns allegations of abridgement of free speech rights,we do not defer to the district court findings of fact.instead,in first amendment cases we make an independent and searching inquiry of the entire record,since we are obliged to conduct a fresh examination of crucial facts so as to assure ourselves that the lower court judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.hurley.gay,lesbian bisexual group,d see also bery city of new york,cir w e are required to make an independent examination of the record as a whole without deference to the factual findings of the trial court.
i free speech law in schools 
we wrestle on this appeal with the question of how far a student constitutional right freely to express himself on school grounds extends.as the supreme court aptly put it,o ur problem lies in the area where students in the exercise of first amendment rights collide with the rules of the school authorities.tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.we begin with several premises.first,we are mindful that the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of our schools.healy james,d.thus neither party disputes that students have first amendment rights to political speech in public schools.brandon bd.of,cir.but while students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,tinker,at,neither are their rights to free speech automatically coextensive with the rights of adults,fraser,at.indeed even for adults it is familiar law that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances.chaplinsky new hampshire.noting that certain limited categories of speech may be prevented without raising a constitutional problem these include the lewd and obscene,the profane,the libelous,and the insulting or fighting which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.
with these basic precepts in mind,we discuss tinker,fraser,and hazelwood,a trilogy of cases in which the supreme court enunciated standards for assessing whether a school censorship of student speech is constitutionally permissible.
tinker involved high school students who,to protest the vietnam war,sought to wear black armbands to school.at.in light of this proposed collective act of expression,the school prohibited the wearing of black armbands and punished students who ignored the ban.id.holding that this constituted an unconstitutional abridgement of the students free speech rights,the supreme court ruled that with regard to personal expression that happens to occur on the school premises,hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d discussing tinker,a student may express his opinions,even on controversial subjects if he does so without materially and substantially interfer ing with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school and without colliding with the rights of others,tinker at.alteration in original.the rule of tinker has come to mean that a school may not regulate student expression unless the regulation may be justified by a showing that the student speech would materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.see also hazelwood,d brennan,dissenting o fficial censorship of student expression is unconstitutional unless the speech materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.
nearly two decades later the supreme court revisited student speech in fraser.school officials in fraser disciplined a student for giving a speech peppered with sexual innuendo at a school assembly.fraser,at.the court held the school actions permissible because it is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse among its students.id.at.schools may regulate student speech insofar as it is vulgar,lewd,indecent,or plainly offensive.id.at.hazelwood,at.the decision in fraser rested on the vulgar,lewd,and plainly offensive character of the student speech.the court declined to apply tinker more exacting material and substantial disturbance test because the student speech was unrelated to any political viewpoint.fraser,at.
the supreme court examination of student speech continued in hazelwood,where school officials censored certain articles in the school newspaper written by students regarding pregnancy and a student experience with divorce.hazelwood,at.the supreme court upheld the school action relying on the distinction between speech and student speech that happens to occur on school grounds.see id.at.in the case of the former,school officials may exercise editorial control over student speech so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.id.at.see also peck baldwinsville cent.sch,cir discussing difference between that happens to occur on school sponsored speech.
we distill the following from tinker,fraser,and hazelwood 
schools have wide discretion to prohibit speech that is less than wit,vulgar,lewd,indecent or plainly offensive speech,fraser,at.hazelwood,at.
if the speech at issue is,educators may censor student speech so long as the censorship is reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,hazelwood,at.and 
for all other speech,meaning speech that is neither vulgar,lewd,indecent or plainly offensive under fraser,nor under hazelwood,the rule of tinker applies.schools may not regulate such student speech unless it would materially and substantially disrupt classwork and discipline in the school.see tinker,at.
our articulation of the trilogy is in accord with how other circuits commonly understand these cases.see,saxe state coll.area sch,cir alito,to summarize under fraser,a school may categorically prohibit lewd,vulgar or profane language.under hazelwood,a school may regulate speech speech falling outside of these categories is subject to tinker general rule chandler mcminnville sch,cir we conclude that the standard for reviewing the suppression of vulgar,lewd,obscene,and plainly offensive speech is governed by fraser,speech by hazelwood,and all other speech by tinker.
we pause here to acknowledge some lack of clarity in the supreme court cases.tinker involved political discrimination and established a material and substantial interference test that permits schools to restrict student speech only where,as noted,necessary to avoid material and substantial interference with schoolwork or discipline.at.it is not entirely clear whether tinker rule applies to all student speech that is not sponsored by schools,subject to the rule of fraser,or whether it applies only to political speech or to political discrimination.nor is tinker entirely clear as to what constitutes substantial disorder or substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.id.at.the opinion alludes to threats and acts of violence on school premises,id.at,but does not otherwise explain what might qualify as materially and substantially disrupt ing the work and discipline of the school.id.at.
language in the supreme court subsequent ruling in hazelwood sheds some light on these questions by suggesting that the court considers the rule of tinker to be generally applicable to cases.hazelwood,at.distinguishing between the tinker standard for determining when a school may punish student expression and the standard for determining when a school may refuse to lend its name and resources to the dissemination of student expression.but see fraser,at.noting t he marked distinction between the political message of the armbands in tinker and the sexual content of the speech in this case and that the court had upheld the students right to engage in a nondisruptive,passive expression of a political viewpoint in tinker emphasis added id.at.noting that the penalties imposed for the sexually explicit speech were unrelated to any political viewpoint and thus did not implicate the rule of tinker bd.of,island trees union free sch.dist.pico,d plurality opinion stating that tinker held that students rights to freedom of expression of their political views could not be abridged by reliance upon an undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance arising from such expression emphasis added.proceeding according to the understanding that tinker applies to all student speech tha
