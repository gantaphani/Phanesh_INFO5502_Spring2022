appellant geoffrey wood claims that he was unconstitutionally strip searched on three separate occasions by correctional officers at the hancock county jail in ellsworth,maine.he filed a lawsuit seeking damages under from the county,the sheriff,and the jail administrator,but a jury found in favor of the defendants on appeal,wood contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on both the definition of a strip search and the law governing routine strip searches of inmates after contact visits.we see no error as to the law applicable to visits,but have concluded that a sufficiently misleading definition of a strip search warrants a partial new trial.
factual background 
in,appellant wood was arrested twice on misdemeanor charges and required to completely disrobe three times in the presence of correctional officers.the first two episodes occurred as part of his processing into the hancock county jail following the arrests.although wood characterizes these events as strip searches,the county defendants maintain that the encounters were clothing searches and that any observation of wood naked body was incidental to the correctional officers purpose to examine his clothing.the third search occurred on the morning after wood second arrest,following a contact visit with his attorney.the parties agree that wood was subjected to a strip search at that time,but disagree about its constitutionality.
the details of these three incidents,with the facts largely depicted in the light most consistent with the jury verdict,are described below.before turning to those details,we briefly review the jail relevant search policies.
according to policy no,titled admissions not bailed,an individual who is being assigned to a housing unit in the charged with a misdemeanor or subject to a clothing search and must shower after disrobing in the presence of a corrections officer.jail policy procedure c,titled search procedures,states that a inmate charged with a misdemeanor subject to a more intrusive strip search only if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing contraband and is about to come into contact with inmates of the facility.
a clothing search is defined as t he removal and search of all of an inmate clothing,while a strip search is defined as a visual search of an inmate which requires the removal of all clothing,to include a search of the clothes removed.policy thus,individuals arrested for a broad range of minor offenses classified as misdemeanors,including failure to pay highway tolls or speeding,could be asked to disrobe completely and shower if they are unable to post bail and must be assigned housing.only felony detainees and those suspected of carrying contraband are subject to the more extensive examination that the policy describes as a strip search.
search.on may,wood was arrested on misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse and taken to the hancock county jail.he did not immediately post bail and therefore was required to shower and undergo a clothing search.he was escorted by a correctional officer into a room near the booking area known as the nurse station or medical room and directed to disrobe,one article of clothing at a time,until he was naked.he was standing four to five feet from the officer.wood contends that two officers were present,but jail records indicate that only officer christopher rivers supervised the search and shower.
officer rivers testified that his standard practice in clothing searches is to instruct the inmates to turn over their underwear last and then to enter the nearby shower stall.although rivers said the objective of the search is to detect contraband in the clothing,he and a fellow officer,chad wilmot,both testified that they maintain a visual on the individuals as they disrobe and enter the shower.rivers stated that,during the process,the inmates end up standing naked for s econds,and wilmot noted that w e not physically inspecting them,having them raise their arms or anything like that,and we also bringing clothes and a towel so that they can dry off and change up when they get out of the shower.
the jail administrator,linda hannan,testified that the corrections staff attempts to provide as much privacy as possible in the circumstances she said that the shower curtain,which was admitted into evidence,is black from about shoulder height down,and she further stated that the officers are trained to avert their eyes from the inmate during the clothing search.she acknowledged that officers might observe the inmate naked body for a split second as they reach for that last piece of clothing.hannan depiction of the policy departed somewhat from the two officers consistent report that they were trained to maintain eye contact with the inmate and that they were not trained to look away because that would be an officer safety issue.
search.wood was arrested again on july and charged with violating a protection from abuse order.he again was brought to the hancock county jail and searched in similar fashion to the may occurrence he remained at the jail overnight.
search.on the morning of july,appellant was twice visited by his attorney.both encounters were contact visits,meaning that counsel and client were without a glass partition or other divider separating them.although jail policy calls for inmates to be strip searched after all contact visits appellant was not searched after the first session with his counsel.after the second,longer visit,however,as appellant and his counsel passed through the booking area,the booking officer stated that appellant needed to be strip searched pursuant to jail policy.he was taken into the same room where the previous searches had been conducted,and a full strip search was done.he was asked to fully disrobe,and then was ordered to stick out his tongue,hold his hands above his head,turn around,bend over,and manually spread his buttocks.
appellant contends that all three of these searches violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and that the jury was led to conclude otherwise by the trial court erroneous instructions.with respect to the first two searches,appellant argues that,despite being labeled clothing searches,they effectively were strip searches.the parties agree that the search constitutes a fourth amendment violation if it was indeed a strip search.see infra at.appellant asserts that the jury was led astray because the court instruction improperly limited the definition of a strip search.see infra at.he claims that the instruction concerning the third a strip established a presumption of reasonableness regarding strip searches after contact visits.see infra at.
defendants assert in response that the court instructions accurately reflected the law and that the jurors properly found no constitutional violation.they insist that the may and july searches were carefully limited clothing searches,not strip searches,and as such involved permissible incidental viewing of appellant naked body.in any event,they say,the label given to the first two searches is unimportant because the jury verdict is supportable even if appellant were subjected to unlawful strip searches.they assert that the verdict form may be interpreted to reflect a judgment that the county and its supervising not liable for the officers conduct because the officers actions did not represent a widespread practice or custom.see monell new york dep t of social,d miller kennebec county,cir.finally,defendants assert that the july strip search was wholly constitutional and that the court instruction correctly set out the law governing routine strip searches following contact visits.
for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that appellant is entitled to a new trial on the claims related to the may and july searches,but we uphold the jury judgment on the july strip search.
ii.discussion 
a jury instruction that was objected to at trial will constitute reversible error only if it i is misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law and ii can not be considered harmless richards relentless,cir citations omitted.in probing whether the error could have affected the outcome of the jury deliberations,we consider its impact in light of the entire record.see tum barber foods,cir citing federico order of benedict,cir and allen chance,cir.
with this guidance in mind,we consider in turn each of the challenged instructions.
definition of strip search 
the district court defined a strip search to the jury as follows 
a strip search involves a deliberate,visual inspection of the naked body of a prisoner which includes the examination of the mouth and armpits.a visual search is a strip search that includes visual inspection or visual examination of the anal and genital areas.
appellant objected to this instruction and proposed an alternative to the court that more broadly defined such a search,essentially classifying any required exposure of a private body part as a strip search 
the definition of a strip search was crucial to appellant case.our case law holds that an individual detained on a misdemeanor charge may be strip searched as part of the booking process only if officers have reasonable suspicion that he is either armed or carrying contraband.see savard rhode island,cir en banc opinion of selya,petition for cert.filed,roberts rhode island,cir.in so concluding,we have recognized that strip searches are intrusive and degrading and,therefore,should not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officers.savard,at.when such an intrusion is extended to relatively harmless offenders,a severe incursion on privacy occurs,roberts,at.
in savard,for example,one of the plaintiffs had been arrested for a traffic ticket that had been issued to his son six years earlier and never paid another was arrested in error for failing to appear for a probation review after her probation had ended.see at opinion of bownes.requiring particularized suspicion to strip search misdemeanant arrestees balances institutional security needs with individual privacy,which includes a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily,to be observed unclothed or to have one private parts observed or touched by others.justice city of peachtree city,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.there is no dispute that wood was not suspected of carrying a weapon or contraband either time he was arrested and booked.thus,if he was strip searched,he suffered a constitutional injury.
having carefully reviewed the relevant precedent,we believe the court instruction erroneously circumscribed the jury evaluation of the evidence.nearly twenty years ago,we defined a strip search as an inspection of a naked individual,without any scrutiny of the subject body cavities,blackburn snow,cir and we repeated substantially that same description in subsequent cases.see savard,at defining strip searches as visual inspections of the naked body roberts,at a strip search involves a visual inspection of the naked body of an inmate.see also peckham wisconsin dep t of corrections,cir strip search refers to a visual inspection of a naked inmate without intrusion into the person body cavities the district court departed from these formulations by defining a strip search to include an examination of the mouth and armpits,and by stating that the inspection must be deliberate.although strip searches often may involve additional steps,we decline to draw the line so narrowly that standing naked for inspection by officers falls short of being a strip search if unaccompanied by a demand to open one mouth or lift one arms.unquestionably,the serious intrusion stems from exposing one naked body to official scrutiny the impact of that forced nudity is undervalued if focused attention on the mouth and underarms is also required to reach the threshold of a strip search.
under the court instruction,the most deliberate visual inspection of a naked body,even including a look in the mouth,would pass muster,simply because one or two armpits were not inspected.alternatively,a complete and prolonged viewing of a naked body could survive challenge if a jury were to find that it was not sufficiently deliberate because it was designed to examine clothing rather than the body.
the court instruction was therefore flawed in two respects.by adding the word deliberate to the definition we previously have in the first portion of its instruction that a strip search involves a deliberate,visual inspection of the naked body of a prisoner the court unduly directed the jurors to the officers subjective intent.the word inspection sufficiently connotes the need for a focused look.see the random house dictionary of the english language ed unabridged at defining inspection as the act of inspecting or viewing,esp.carefully or critically,and,alternatively,as formal or official viewing or examination whether or not the officers set out deliberately to inspect a prisoner naked body is not the question it is,rather,whether the officers did,in fact,perform such a search.the remainder of the instruction then added specific elements to the of the mouth and are not prerequisites for finding that a strip search took place.
these variations can not be considered harmless in this case although the jury may not have based its judgment for defendants on the scope of the issue we discuss infra at problems with the instruction were sufficiently critical to the jury deliberations that appellant is entitled to have the issue to a jury.we begin our explanation of that conclusion with a brief review of the evidence of what occurred.
appellant testified that he was subjected to examinations that met the district court definition of a strip search,including scrutiny of his mouth and armpits,see supra notes,while the officers testified that the only viewing of appellant naked body occurred in the few seconds after he had completely disrobed while they maintain ed a visual on him before he entered the shower.defendants emphasize that,even if the jurors had accepted appellant version,the jury properly may have found no liability against the county.
as first set forth by the supreme court in monell,a governmental entity may not be held liable under for constitutional violations committed by its employees unless the plaintiff injury results from either an officially sanctioned policy or from a custom or practice that is so and widespread that the policymaking officials can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice,bordanaro mcleod,cir.in the latter case,the custom must have been the cause of and the moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.see also miller,at.thus,in rejecting liability,the jury may have believed appellant but concluded that the officers acted randomly beyond the jail policies.
another possibility,however,is that the jury believed the officers description of what occurred and with the jury these were not strip searches because there was no check of appellant mouth or underarms.such a conclusion would have made unnecessary any further discussion about the specific nature of the search and whether the visual observation of appellant constituted an inspection that would qualify as a strip search.
in our view,if the jury had had such a discussion,with the benefit of the correct definition of strip search,it could have reached a different result.both officers testified that appellant was under constant watch as he disrobed.see supra at.officer wilmot stated that the officers are physically inspecting the clothes,not the person,but he replied affirmatively when asked by counsel if the process necessarily included maintain ing a visual of their body while they in the process of disrobing.in addition,while administrator hannan stated that the only target of the search was appellant clothing,she acknowledged that officers conducting clothing searches must at least observe inmates out of the corner of their eye s to be sure the prisoners do not take contraband from their clothing and hide it on their persons.she explained that the concern about concealment is why disrobing for a clothing search must be done in an officer presence rather than behind a screen or in another private area.
based on this evidence,a properly instructed jury could have decided that both clothing searches performed on appellant embraced a visual inspection of his naked body focused on detecting contraband,and thus amounted to a strip search.our precedent does not require that a search be either prolonged or thorough to be termed a strip search,and we decline to add such limitations.the critical question is whether viewing the naked body was an objective of the search,rather than an unavoidable and incidental.had appellant been allowed to disrobe behind a screen,for example,and directed to enter the shower while officers examined the clothes he left behind,the momentary exposure as he walked from the screen to the shower clearly would have been incidental to the search of his clothing.by contrast,the procedure utilized by the hancock county jail in this case,as described by the officers,allowed visual inspection of appellant body through the progressive stages of his undressing.indeed,the combined effect of administrator hannan and the officers testimony it does not inference that,during clothing searches,officers routinely keep watch through the disrobing process,at least in part,to be sure no items are secreted on the body 
although less objectionable than more sustained inspections of an individual naked body,and less intrusive than a search that includes examination of the mouth and underarms,the search that occurred here unquestionably implicated the reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily,justice,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.appellant is entitled to have a properly instructed jury decide whether it crossed the line from incidental observation to impermissible inspection.
having determined that the erroneous instruction could have impacted the jury verdict,we reject defendants fallback contention that such error should not lead to a new trial because the jury judgment may have signaled a determination that the or not stem from a widespread practice or custom attributable to the defendants that possibility is not enough,however,to avoid retrial.appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the error,which was preserved by objection,can be deemed harmless.on this record,we can not say that the jurors probably would have found the defendants blameless if they found that a constitutional violation occurred.
the record contains adequate evidence to permit a jury to conclude that appellant experience was typical of clothing searches at the hancock county jail.first,appellant testified that when he asked on may at the outset of the search why he needed to take off his clothes,he was told it was routine procedure.second,officer rivers,after testifying that memos are generated on searches only when circumstances require multiple officers to participate,stated that no memo was prepared on the may search because i t was a routine search to me.third,the fact that appellant himself experienced two separate searches conducted similarly by two different officers,on two different dates,further suggests a standard practice.finally,the jurors could have viewed the standard clothing search as described by administrator hannan to include at least a brief inspection of inmates naked bodies.on that with the correct definition of a strip search in jury may have found official knowledge of a practice of strip searching misdemeanants.
in so concluding,we hasten to add that the defendants assertions to the contrary do not indicate an attempt to mislead.the labels applied to searches do not always reflect a common understanding of the procedures that will be utilized.although the hancock county jail officers disclaimed doing strip searches,for example,their understanding of what such a search entails is informed by the jail policy.and,while the strip search definition contained in policy is consistent with our precedent a visual search of an inmate which requires the removal of all clothing,to include a search of the clothes removed the detailed procedures spelled out for a strip search have the effect of narrowing the scope of the definition by requiring particularized scrutiny of certain body parts.see note supra thus,a jury could find that defendants truthfully denied conducting strip searches,within their understanding of what that entailed,but nonetheless committed a constitutional violation by inspecting appellant body in a manner that federal law would deem a strip search.
we therefore conclude that appellant is entitled to a new trial on his claims of constitutional injury arising from the searches on may and july.
instruction on visit strip search 
appellant second complaint centers on the court instruction on the july strip search 
i now discuss with you the alleged july,postcontact issue.i instruct you that without more all prisoners after all contact visits in order to prevent smuggling of contraband is not unreasonable under the fourth amendment.
however,plaintiff may present to you additional facts that make the application of a postcontact visit policy unreasonable under the circumstances of this case.in the postcontact visit context,a search is reasonable where the need for the search outweighs the resulting invasion of privacy.
among those things you should consider when making this determination are the scope of the search,the manner in which it was conducted,the justification for initiating it,and the place where it was conducted.when balancing these interests,keep in mind that the central objective of jail administration is safeguarding institutional security.you should accord deference to the policies and practices that jail administrators consider necessary to preserve internal order and discipline.
remember,in order to recover,plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his strip search following a contact visit on july,was unreasonable 
appellant argues that this instruction failed to follow the blueprint for evaluating strip searches that the supreme court set out in bell wolfish,d.in considering the constitutionality of a prison blanket policy of strip searching inmates after contact visits,the court articulated a test of reasonableness that requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.id.at.factors to be weighed are the scope of the particular intrusion,the manner in which it is conducted,the justification for initiating it,and the place in which it is conducted.id.applying that test,the court in bell upheld the strip searches at issue.
appellant argument is,first,that the district court improperly preempted the jury balancing by directing it to presume the july search was reasonable,and,second,that the court then unfairly cemented the presumption by advising the jury to defer to jail policies and practices.we conclude that the instruction as given fairly presented the relevant law.
we agree with appellant that the bell balancing test is the correct starting point for assessing any strip search.but bell and other cases lead inevitably to the district court conclusion that it is presumptively reasonable for a detention facility to conduct strip searches after contact visits.in bell,the court recognized that all such facilities are fraught with serious security dangers,and that smuggling of drugs,weapons and other contraband is all too common an occurrence,id.the court further observed that the lack of reported cases of smuggling at the metropolitan correctional center in new york,the institution at issue in bell,may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the opportunity arises,id.
the particular risk posed by contact visits is a theme repeated in the case law and substantiated by this record.in block rutherford,d,the supreme court made the following observations in deciding that a detention facility could constitutionally prohibit contact visits 
contact visits invite a host of security problems.they open the institution to the introduction of drugs,weapons,and other co
