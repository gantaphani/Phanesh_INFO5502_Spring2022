adhering to longstanding precedent,the district court dismissed this age discrimination action against the university of puerto rico university or upr on the ground that the university is an arm of the state entitled to eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.on appeal,the plaintiff asserts that this circuit test for analyzing whether a public entity is an arm of the state has changed in recent years,and he argues that the university does not qualify for that status under current law.detecting no error in the court analysis,we affirm.
we recount only briefly the underlying facts alleged in the complaint,as the details of the alleged discrimination play no role in our analysis.plaintiff jesús irizarry mora irizarry,a sociologist with a in population planning,applied during the second semester of the academic year to be an assistant professor at the university of puerto rico.he was not chosen for the position.a job announcement seeking candidates for the position of assistant professor of sociology was again published during the fall semester of the next academic year.irizarry reapplied,and he again was not selected.the individual hired for the position was thirty years old.at the time irizarry filed this lawsuit in,he was.
irizarry alleged in his complaint that the upr discriminated against him on the basis of his age and retaliated against him for filing discrimination charges,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,a,d.the university moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,asserting that the upr is an arm of the state and thus entitled to immunity from suit in federal court under the eleventh amendment.see hess port auth.trans hudson,d fresenius med.care cardiovascular,the caribbean cardiovascular ctr,cir.
in ruling on the motion to dismiss,the district court observed that the district of puerto rico and the first circuit had consistently concluded that the upr is an instrumentality of the state for eleventh amendment purposes and,as such,is not amenable to suit in federal court.irizarry mora of,cv adc,slip op.at.the court rejected irizarry argument that our decision in fresenius had set out a totally new test for identifying an arm of the state and thus cast doubt on the validity of earlier precedent.the court further noted that the district of puerto rico had reexamined the upr status on numerous occasions after fresenius and had declined to depart from the well settled proposition that the upr is immune from suit in federal court.id.quoting montalvo padilla of,d.the court also pointed to the first circuit reiteration after fresenius,albeit in passing,that the upr is an arm of the commonwealth and shares its sovereign immunity.id.citing montalvo padilla,d at citing toledo sánchez,cir aponte torres of,cir.
notwithstanding the precedent weighing against the plaintiff position,the district court went on to perform its own thoughtful evaluation of the factors prescribed in the case law.see infra section ii.it agreed with the previous decisions in concluding that the upr is entitled to immunity from suit in federal court.hence,it dismissed irizarry action,and this appeal followed 
legal background 
before our decision in fresenius,this court for more than a decade had assessed an entity status under a test that was set out in metcalf eddy,puerto rico aqueduct sewer authority,cir.in fresenius,we examined supreme court decisions that had updated and clarified the doctrine in the years since metcalf eddy to determine whether those opinions cause us to reshape the metcalf eddy test.fresenius,at.concluding that a reshaping was appropriate,id.at,we relied primarily on the court decision in hess to reformulate our analysis as a inquiry whose steps reflected the eleventh amendment twin concerns for the states dignity and their financial solvency.fresenius,at.under that framework,
a court must first determine whether the state has indicated an intention either explicitly by statute or implicitly through the structure of the entity that the entity share the state sovereign immunity.if no explicit indication exists,the court must consider the structural indicators of the state intention.if these point in different directions,the court must proceed to the second stage and consider whether the state treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.

appellant asserts that this evolution of the law means that determinations predating fresenius are no longer binding.that argument,however,fails to recognize that we explicitly stated in fresenius that the reshaping of our law did not represent an actual change in the substance of the analysis.we observed that hess had refined the metcalf eddy analysis,which we described as consistent with hess.fresenius,at.indeed,we observed that metcalf eddy presciently predicted the ways in which the supreme court would view the issue.id.at.
the reshaping effected in fresenius was the replacement of metcalf eddy test with the supreme court inquiry first,the structural prong and,if necessary,the prong.the specific considerations remained essentially the same,however,because the metcalf eddy factors covered elements relevant to both the agency operational autonomy and its fiscal independence although the inquiry was not framed as a progression from one stage to the next,as in fresenius and hess,the same two key questions and the same types of factors informed our analysis fresenius,at.hence,fresenius was not a turning point in our eleventh amendment jurisprudence.rather,our course was fixed in metcalf eddy,which foreshadowed hess in determining that when there is ambiguity from the structure about whether an entity is an arm of the state,the primary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.id.at.
arguably,our conclusion that the substance of the law did not change in fresenius is enough to resolve this case.we observed in metcalf eddy that w here the agency activity and its relation to the state remain essentially the same,prior circuit precedent will be controlling.at.indeed,the upr has been deemed an arm of the state for more than three decades,see pinto universidad de,cir perez rodriguez bou,cir,and no factual change in its relationship with the commonwealth is asserted.the principle of stare decisis thus has considerable force here.
nonetheless,we recognize that the original precedent on the upr status predates even metcalf eddy.in addition,although we have assumed the continuing validity of that precedent at least twice since fresenius,the eleventh amendment was not a live issue in either case.see toledo,at,finding that the upr was not entitled to immunity for the particular claims at issue aponte torres,at,holding that the plaintiffs fail ed to articulate a cognizable federal claim.thus,like the district court,we think brief consideration of the fresenius inquiry is warranted to confirm that our precedent is in line with current law 
application of the arm of the state test 
structural factors 
the distinctive,role that a state university typically plays in its state higher education landscape undoubtedly accounts for the fact that the vast majority of state universities have been found to be arms of the state.see of chesterton,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper richard freer,federal practice procedure,at noting that state universities usually are considered arms of the state.each state university nonetheless must be evaluated in light of its unique characteristics.chesterton,at.
although puerto rico law contains no explicit statement of intention that the university share the commonwealth sovereign immunity,statutory provisions and case law together describe a public role for the university consistent with such a relationship.by statute,the upr has an obligation of service to the people of puerto rico,laws,tit,a,and it is exempted from the payment of taxes because it achieves a public purpose of the commonwealth.id.f.
the upr important public role also has been acknowledged by the puerto rico supreme court.in university of puerto rico puerto rico association of university professors,no.jr june,the court noted the upr obligation a s a university of the state to serve the people of puerto rico,unoff.trans.at quotation marks omitted,and it rejected a suggestion that the upr could increase fees to the same extent as could a private university in order to raise revenue 
for evident reasons,increasing the costs of registration so substantially would create very serious problems concerning the role played by in puerto rico society,not to mention those related to its implementation.an increase like the board suggests,sufficiently high so as to convert the into a profitable operation,would cause serious problems,for example,concerning students.it would affect both the capacity of our young ones to obtain good quality higher education as well as the capacity to fulfill its statutory mission of developing the intellectual and spiritual wealth of our people,especially those less favored in terms of financial resources.b 
id.at emphasis omitted the commonwealth reliance on the upr to make higher education accessible to students for whom the government feels a special responsibility is also shown by a specific upr tuition exemption for the children of puerto rico military members who have died in action,remain missing,or are prisoners of war.see laws ann.tit,b.
in further support of the proposition that the university is an arm of the commonwealth,we note that ten of the thirteen members of its governing board are appointed by the governor,with the advice and consent of the puerto rico senate,laws ann.tit,b and the board originally was convened by the secretary of education,id.b.see pastrana torres corporación de para la difusión pública,cir noting that commonwealth control is indicated where board comprised of government officials and private citizens is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate chesterton,at noting that appointment of ten of thirteen board members by the governor with consent of senate is a legislative design most courts routinely view as evidence of an entity lack of independence from state control citing cases the board of trustees plays a significant role in governing the university,including appointing the president and chancellors,in consultation with academic senates,laws ann.tit,e,and supervis ing the general progress of the institution,id.d.the board also approves the university system annual budget and the appointment of the finance director,and it is charged with r ender ing a yearly report to the governor and the legislature concerning its activities and the status and finances of the university.id.e.
these structural signals strongly indicate that the commonwealth dignity interest as a sovereign in not being haled into federal court embraces the university.see fresenius,at.yet we acknowledge that the upr also possesses attributes of an autonomous agency.it controls and may acquire its own properties,it may create subsidiary corporations,and its debts are by law not considered those of the commonwealth.see laws ann.tit,a,e,f.as appellant argues,the university has a significant degree of autonomy to set policy,see id.d,a and the upr is authorized to borrow money for any of its purposes and activities by issuing bonds or notes,id.e.it also has authority to raise revenue by charging tuition and other fees,id.b and to spend the proceeds generated from such sources,as well as from the sale of property and donations,in the best interest of the university,id.c.although the university is expressly authorized to issue bonds for the purpose of acquiring or constructing any project,such revenue bonds shall not constitute a debt of the commonwealth of puerto rico and shall not pledge the good faith and credit of the commonwealth.id.
the authority to conduct operations is not necessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the commonwealth intends the upr to share its sovereign status.see,kashani purdue,cir t hese powers are granted the university only so that it is able to carry out its primary purpose of education,in contrast to a city or county,whose exercise of such powers is its very raison.yet,some of the structural indicators unquestionably point in the other direction.we thus think it prudent to proceed to the second stage of the eleventh amendment inquiry and consider whether the state treasury would be at risk in the event of an adverse judgment.redondo constr,at.
impact on the treasury 
it is undisputed that the commonwealth provides the bulk of the funding for the university operations.by law,the commonwealth must dedicate of its general fund revenues to the upr.laws ann.tit.the parties debate what percentage of the university budget those funds represent,but even appellant acknowledges that more than sixty percent of the upr funding comes from the government.he argues that the institution funds are more than sufficient to satisfy any judgments,asserting that in one recent year the upr had nearly million in income appellant calculations,however,patently overestimate the university available resources by including funds that are identified as restricted in the budget document on which he relies.indeed,in the reported year,only about of the funds appear to have been unrestricted leaving the commonwealth as the source for nearly ninety percent of the university general fund.see ass of,unoff.trans.at observing that,at the time of the decision in,percent of the university budget came from the general fund of the commonwealth.
more importantly,however,the university status can not turn on whether its budget shows enough income to allow it,in theory,to pay a court judgment.allocating any portion of the university general fund revenues to court judgments not only would dilute the impact of the public funds the upr receives,but such damage awards also would diminish the university ability to comply with its statutory mission to provide good quality higher education for all residents of puerto rico.id.at the upr does not have the flexibility to offset unanticipated expenses by passing the additional costs on to its customers.see metcalf eddy,at although the central government subsidizes the agency to some extent,the agency relies mostly on user fees and bonds to support its operations.because providing affordable higher education for puerto rico residents is the commonwealth goal,the commonwealth must as a practical matter ensure the university financial viability regardless of its responsibility for particular university debts.we suggested as much in fresenius,where we observed that the commonwealth may indirectly assume the obligation for an entity debts by providing virtually all the funds needed for its operation.at see also pastrana torres,at same metcalf eddy,at quoting blake kline,cir,for the proposition that the nature of the state obligation to contribute may be more important than the size of the contribution.
in sum,the commonwealth investment,financial and otherwise,in the upr ability to fulfill its obligation of service to the people of puerto rico,laws ann.tit,a,puts commonwealth funds at risk when university funds are at risk.hence,we are comfortable that our longstanding precedent remains consistent with current eleventh amendment principles.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment dismissing this action on the ground that appellant claims are foreclosed by the eleventh amendment.
so ordered.
the district court also rejected irizarry request for equitable relief under the ex parte young doctrine,which allows prospective injunctive relief against state officers who are sued in their official capacities.see ex parte young.negrón almeda santiago,cir.irizarry suit names as a defendant only the university,not any individuals.in the absence of consent,waiver,or abrogation,the eleventh amendment bars suit against states themselves regardless of the form of relief sought.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d metcalf eddy,aqueduct sewer,cir see also puerto rico,cir noting that the commonwealth of puerto rico is treated as a state for purposes of the eleventh amendment.in his reply brief,irizarry states that he does not challenge the co
