the issue on appeal is whether abstention under younger harris,is proper in a federal court civil rights suit brought against the massachusetts attorney general by a business trade association,which is not itself a party to any relevant state litigation,and where three of its members are defendants in ongoing state civil proceedings brought not by the attorney general but by private parties.the district court found that younger abstention was appropriate in these circumstances.delivery ass coakley,d.we reverse that determination and hold that younger abstention is inappropriate and the federal courts should exercise jurisdiction.we remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the suit by the massachusetts delivery association mda asserts that a state law is as to motor carriers under the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa,stat.codified in scattered sections of,which expressly state attempts to regulate a price,route,or service of any motor carrier,c.the mda claims that the state law at issue here is such a regulation and is unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.the challenged state law is a portion of a massachusetts statute.laws ch,a,which requires that an individual performing a service for another be classified as an employee unless the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer.the mda also asserts that the state statute imposes an undue burden which violates the commerce clause.we describe these state and federal statutes before turning to the younger abstention issue.
a.the massachusetts statute defining employees 
the state law challenged as unconstitutional is part of a state statutory scheme meant to enhance protections for those whom the state considers to be employees,in contrast to independent contractors.see somers converged access.this provision was initially enacted in as an act enhancing the enforcement of labor laws.legis.serv.amended in,the law currently provides 
a for the purpose of this chapter and chapter,an individual performing any service,except as authorized under this chapter,shall be considered to be an employee under those chapters unless 
the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service,both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact and 
the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer and,
the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade,occupation,profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.
subsection a provides that individuals performing services shall be deemed employees,unless all of the requirements outlined in the three subsections are satisfied.see somers,at the failure of the employer to prove all three criteria set forth above suffices to establish that the individual in question is an employee.
section governs whether an individual is deemed an employee for purposes of various wage and employment laws,chapters,and of the massachusetts general laws see.laws ch,a,d.the massachusetts supreme judicial court has said that a legislative purpose behind the independent contractor statute is to protect employees from being deprived of the benefits enjoyed by employees through their misclassification as independent contractors.somers,at.
if an employing entity improperly classifies an employee as an independent contractor under a variety of sanctions are available,including civil and criminal penalties to be assessed by the state.laws ch,d.but the state is not always involved in disputes about compliance with.independently,employees who allege improper classification as independent contractors may bring their own actions for injunctive relief and treble damages,and may bring such suits as class actions.laws ch,see also somers,at.before bringing suit,such employees must first file a complaint with the attorney general employees must wait to file suit in court until days after filing such a complaint,although they may file earlier if the attorney general consents in writing.laws ch.when an employee brings suit,he institute s and prosecute s it in his own name and on his own behalf,or for himself and others similarly situated,as a civil action.id.he does not bring suit in the name of the state.nor does he have the range of remedies available to the attorney general.
the mda alleges that its members must change their fundamental business model the use of independent contractor delivery drivers to comply with the state statute or risk penalties.no other state,the mda alleges,has made unlawful this use of the historic business model.the massachusetts law,it says,would force motor carriers to use only employees as delivery drivers,which would drive up costs,and adversely affect prices,routes,and services.not only is the law expressly but it also imposes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce,according to the mda.
b.the faaaa pre emption provision and the commerce clause issue 
for businesses in interstate commerce involving transportation,congress,concerned both with the states imposing undue burdens and with the national interest in uniform rules,has expressly preempted certain state regulations.see,a of state regulations relating to motor carriers of passengers id.b of state regulations relating to freight forwarders and brokers id.d of state regulations relating to ground transportation id.of state regulations relating to air carriers.
congress enacted such a provision as part of the faaaa 
except as provided in paragraphs and,a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of or more states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier other than a carrier affiliated with a direct air carrier covered by section b or any motor private carrier,broker,or freight forwarder with respect to the transportation of property.
id.c.motor carrier is defined as a person providing motor vehicle transportation for compensation.id.
in enacting this provision,congress found that state regulation of intrastate transportation of property had imposed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce,as well as an unreasonable cost on the american consumers,and thus certain aspects of the state regulatory process should be preempted.faaaa a,stat.at.the conference report explained that preemption legislation is in the public interest as well as necessary to facilitate interstate commerce.state economic regulation of motor carrier operations causes significant inefficiencies,increased costs,reduction of competition,inhibition of innovation and technology and curtails the expansion of markets.
this federal provision relating to motor carriers is substantially identical to a provision state regulation of air carriers enacted in,and the two statutes are often interpreted in pari materia.see difiore am.airlines,cir,cert.denied,wl.these provisions are broad but vague,and have been the subject of considerable litigation.id.at.
the mda is a trade organization formed to support businesses involved in the delivery service industry.the mda has over forty member businesses which are entities that provide delivery services and often engage delivery drivers they consider to be independent contractors.
the mda brought suit against martha coakley,the attorney general of massachusetts,in her official capacity,on september.the complaint,as amended,alleges that a would require delivery companies to classify their drivers as employees,rather than independent contractors,and that this would have a variety of dramatic effects on the operations of the delivery companies businesses,including driving some out of business and increasing costs to consumers.the mda alleges that subsection a of the state law is under the faaaa and the supremacy clause.
in a separate theory of unconstitutionality,the mda complaint also alleges that the relevant portion of the statute imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce,in violation of the commerce clause.the complaint requests a declaratory judgment that subsection a of the massachusetts law is by the faaaa and the commerce clause with respect to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce,and a permanent injunction preventing the attorney general from enforcing that prong in the future with respect to such motor carriers.
on october,the attorney general filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of younger abstention.the crux of the attorney general argument was that three businesses which are mda members were defendants in ongoing state civil suits brought by private parties under and that the mda was an alter ego of these defendants.the mda,it is alleged,impermissibly sought to open a second front on the question,and as a result younger abstention was required.
the parties agree that there is no state litigation against the mda on this issue and that the three state suits are the only ongoing state proceedings involving any of the mda members.one of the mda four board members and its vice president is the president and director of city express,an entity which is one of the defendants.
the mda opposed the motion,raising a variety of independent arguments as to why younger abstention was inapplicable.the first several arguments,which revolve around the postures and the parties in this and in the state suits,are that younger does not apply where the state suits are civil actions brought by private parties,the relief sought by the mda would not substantially interfere with the ongoing state proceedings,the mda is not a party to any ongoing state proceedings,and is not sufficiently closely related to any such party to be treated as the same for younger purposes,and the mda is neither required to nor would it have any opportunity to raise its challenge in the state suits.in addition,the mda makes other arguments the commonwealth interest in the state suits is insufficient to justify younger abstention,because it is readily apparent that is,an exception to younger applies,and the penalties imposed for violations of provide another exception to younger.
the district court granted the attorney general motion to dismiss on younger grounds.delivery ass n,d at.the mda appealed.
our review of whether the conditions for younger abstention are met is de novo rio grande cmty.health,rullan,cir.the issues raised here are pure issues of law,which also invoke de novo review.hospitality ass city of providence,wl,at cir,to be published in.
overview of younger abstention 
the normal rule is that the federal courts must exercise their jurisdiction and decide cases brought before them.see,quackenbush allstate ins,d we have often acknowledged that federal courts have a strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by congress.there are limited exceptions to that rule one is the younger doctrine.see generally id.at describing the various types of abstention,including younger abstention.the doctrine is judicially created and takes its name from younger harris,a case involving an underlying state criminal prosecution against a defendant who then filed suit in federal court to attack the state statute on which his criminal prosecution was brought.at.
the younger doctrine reflects a longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings,and is based on two conceptual foundations.id.at.first,it is based on a notion that courts of equity should not act,and particularly should not act to restrain a criminal prosecution,when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied relief.id.at.this concern applies to injunctive relief and also,at least typically,to requests for declaratory relief,where the same parties are involved and the federal plaintiff is a party.see samuels mackell,d ordinarily the practical effect of the two forms of relief will be virtually identical rio grande,at.second,and more importantly,younger rests upon basic notions of federalism and comity,and also on a related desire to prevent unnecessary duplication of legal proceedings.younger,at.
younger abstention has extended far beyond its original roots of with state criminal prosecutions.in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d,the court set forth three general guidelines,which we have since described in a series of cases younger applies when the requested relief would interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding that implicates an important state interest and that provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to advance his federal constitutional challenge.rossi gemma,cir.
the question of whether interference exists is a threshold issue.id.at see also rio grande,at younger applies only when the relief asked of the federal court interfere s with the state proceedings.alteration in original quoting quackenbush,at green city of tucson,cir en banc explaining that younger requires not only that the three guidelines be satisfied,but also that the federal relief sought would interfere in some manner in the state court litigation,limited by gilbertson albright,cir en banc.
the first prong,that there must be an ongoing state judicial proceeding,in actuality involves assessment of a complex of issues.the proceeding must be judicial in nature,as opposed to,for instance,legislative proceedings.new orleans pub,council of new orleans nopsi,d.even then,younger does not extend to all judicial proceedings.while the doctrine originated in the context of ongoing criminal proceedings,see younger,at,it has been extended by the court to only two types of civil proceedings enforcement actions to which the state is a party,huffman pursue,d explaining that a nuisance proceeding is more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases,and civil actions involving administration of a state judicial system,juidice vail,d,such as a court contempt proceedings,and the ability to enforce a valid judgment,pennzoil texaco,d.
moreover,the state judicial proceeding must be ongoing,which involves an assessment of which suits were filed when,and how far along those suits have progressed.see hicks miranda,d holding that even where a federal suit is filed first,if the state suit is brought before any proceedings of substance on the merits have taken place in the federal court,the principles of younger harris should apply in full force.
importantly,younger does not typically apply where the plaintiff is not itself a party to the proceedings.the supreme court made this clear in doran salem inn,d,where it held that while two corporations who were not defendants had similar interests and were somewhat related to a third corporation which was a defendant,the two were not barred by younger from bringing suit.
the second prong requires that the proceedings implicate important state interests.middlesex,u.at.this too may involve subsidiary inquiries,which we need not explore here.the third prong requires that there be an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise the federal issue.id.
even if all these requirements are met,and they have not been here,abstention is still not proper in certain extraordinary circumstances or unusual situations.younger,at.the supreme court has indicated that a facially conclusive claim of is p erhaps such an exception to the younger doctrine.nopsi,at.we have held that such a facially conclusive claim is a valid exception.colonial life accident ins.medley,cir citing chaulk.comm against discrimination,cir,cert.denied,d.we need not get into this branch of the analysis here.
application of younger 
we conclude that younger does not permit the state attorney general to succeed in this attempt to preclude federal court examination of the constitutionality of a state statute.the mda has a right to pursue its suit in federal court.
the attorney general pushes the younger doctrine further than the supreme court or this court has ever extended it.while it is not an absolute that because the mda is not a party to the proceedings it may not be subjected to younger,it would be an unjustified extension of younger to treat the mda as if it were such a party.at the very least,such an extension of younger can not be justified because there is no interference.our holding is also consistent with the caselaw of the other circuits.to the extent the circuits have permitted to state proceedings to nevertheless be subject to younger under some circumstances,those circumstances are not present here.for related reasons specified below,federal court adjudication of this suit would not interfere with the ongoing state proceedings.we need not address the other arguments the mda makes.
younger application to non parties to the state court proceedings 
the attorney general argument is based on the premise that the mda and any of its individual members should be treated,for younger purposes,as standing in each other shoes.
distinct parties are typically treated separately for purposes of younger abstention.this is illustrated by steffel thompson,d.there,the court held that when two protesters were warned to discontinue handbilling or they would be arrested,and one continued and was arrested and prosecuted,and the other was not arrested but could fear prosecution,the latter could maintain a federal suit and was not barred by younger.the court explained that t he pending prosecution of petitioner handbilling companion does not affect petitioner action for declaratory relief.id.at.this conclusion accords with the court statement about our historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court,richards jefferson county,alabama,d quoting wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at,and the principle that federal court abstention from the exercise of jurisdiction remains the exception,not the rule,nopsi,at quoting haw.hous.auth.midkiff,d.
the supreme court has addressed in two cases whether distinct but very closely related parties should be treated the same for purposes of younger abstention,but those cases do not lead us to extend younger to the circumstances presented here.see hicks miranda,d doran salem inn,d.
in hicks,two employees of an adult business were prosecuted for showing an obscene movie,and several of the obscene tapes were seized from the business.at.the court found that the business whose employees were criminally prosecuted was barred from bringing suit by younger,as the federal suit would have interfered with the state criminal prosecution,id.at,but its reasons do not establish the principle the attorney general advances.it is true the court stated the business had a substantial stake in the state proceedings,so much so that they sought federal relief,demanding that the state statute be declared void and their films be returned to them.obviously,their interests and those of their employees were intertwined and,as we have pointed out,the federal action sought to interfere with the pending state prosecution.id.at.even if this were dicta,as it may be for the reasons we describe,such dicta is given weight.see,sec rocklage,cir even dicta in supreme court opinions is looked on with great deference.immediately after this discussion,the court identified an independent ground for finding the business subject to younger that the state had,subsequent to the filing of the federal suit,initiated criminal proceedings against the business,and that in such circumstances younger should apply,as no proceedings of substance on the merits had taken place in the federal court.hicks,at.
hicks must be understood in the context of doran,which was decided six days later.there,three corporations operated topless bars,only one of which was criminally prosecuted under a new ordinance.at.the court found that the corporation which the state criminally prosecuted could not bring suit due to younger.id.at.more significantly for our purposes,the court found that the other two corporations,who had similar,perhaps even identical interests,could bring suit and younger did not apply.id.at.the court explained 
while there plainly may be some circumstances in which legally distinct parties are so closely related that they should all be subject to the younger considerations which govern any one of them,this is not such a case while respondents are represented by common counsel,and have similar business activities and problems,they are apparently unrelated in terms of ownership,control,and management.we thus think that each of the respondents should be placed in the position required by our cases as if that respondent stood alone.
as a second reason not to engage in younger abstention,the doran court explained that neither declaratory nor injunctive relief could interfere with enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal plaintiffs,and the state is free to prosecute others who may violate the statute.id.at.
doran makes clear that an alignment of interests among similar but distinct parties is not per se enough,even when the state proceeding is a criminal prosecution and so the state interest in is at its height.if two businesses were not barred from pursuing a federal suit despite having interests and representation in common with a criminal defendant,as was the case in doran,it is difficult to see how an industry association with some interests in common with a few of its members who are civil defendants would be barred by younger from pursuing its own federal suit.doran explained that the parties must be so closely related to justify treating them the same before they may all be subject to the younger considerations which govern any one of them.id.at.
there is no doubt that the mda is legally distinct from its members,each complying with the formalities established by state law.the mda and each of its members have their own interests,which may at times be similar to those of some or all of the members,but which may not be the same.some members may have interests distinct from or even adverse to other members.it is likely that the mda is responsive to a majority of its members,when there are different views.and here,not even a majority is involved in the suits against three members.only a small fraction three out of over forty of its members are involved in the state court proceedings where is at issue.those of its members who are not involved in such proceedings have an interest in a determination of whether is,and the complaint so alleges.the complaint alleges that because many mda members engage independent contractor delivery drivers or contract with entities that engage independent contractor delivery drivers,they arguably violate the statute and this places them in peril of an enforcement action and civil actions by private parties.
under these circumstances,neither hicks nor doran,justifies treating the mda the same as its members who are defendants for younger purposes.hicks involved a close relationship between the plaintiff and defendant,a particular piece of property at issue in both proceedings,and a federal action that sought to interfere with the pending state prosecution.at.here,none of those circumstances is present there is no such relationship,no particular piece of property at issue,and,as is explained below,no risk of interference.
some circuits applying hicks have found younger applicable to where the plaintiff right was derivative of the right of a defendant,finding the interests of the parties to be intertwined in such circumstances.see citizens for a strong ohio marsh,app x,cir younger abstention may also be appropriate for to the state action when s uccess on the merits is entirely derivative of the rights of the state action parties.alterations in original quoting spargo state comm on judicial conduct,cir unified sch.dist,cir w hen in essence only one claim is at stake and the legally distinct party to the federal proceeding is merely an alter ego of a party in state court,younger applies.spargo,at younger applies where the plaintiff claim is entirely derivative of whatever rights that the defendant may have internal quotation mark omitted stivers minnesota,cir younger applies to where t he only standing demonstrated arises from the alleged impact of the challenged action on the defendants.
we need not comment on whether we agree these cases were properly decided,as even assuming they were,their rationale does not apply here.as explained above,the mda members who are not state court defendants the vast majority of mda members have an interest in determining the constitutionality of the state law.the mda itself has a distinct interest in challenging the ordinance as a result,the mda basis for bringing suit is not entirely derived from those of its members who are defendants,and this line of cases does not justify applying younger here.
doran also does not extend to the circumstances present here.there,the court stated that there may be some circumstances where parties are so closely related in terms of ownership,control,and management to be treated the same for younger purposes.at.the mda and its members,who are defendants,on the facts present here are not so closely related to justify treating them the same under younger only a small fraction of mda members are defendants,and the attorney general makes no claim of any substantial ownership,management,or control between the defendants and the mda.
indeed,those circuits to have applied doran to have only found organizations to be sufficiently closely related if the degree of ownership,management or control is substantial and involves at least a majority interest.see cedar rapids cellular,miller,cir applying younger to a in whom a defendant had a controlling interest warmus melahn,cir applying younger where the individual was the beneficial owner,officer and director of the defendant corporation,vacated on other grounds,d.
not all circuits agree with even that formulation.see bickham lashof,cir finding the interests of a corporation,which was the defendant,and its sole shareholder to be insufficiently intertwined to justify applying younger to the shareholder.
we need not decide whether we agree with the first line of cases because no such ownership or control relationship is present here 
further,the one circuit which has addressed a more analogous situation has held that younger does not apply in such circumstances.see citizens for a better env t,nassau county,cir holding that younger does not bar an organization challenge to ordinances notwithstanding pending proceedings against its members because the organization interests lie in the future applicability of the ordinances.
significantly,the circuits are in accord that the application of younger to is proper only in certain limited,exceptional circumstances.see spargo,at t his case presents one of the narrow circumstances in which younger may properly extend to bar claims of who are not directly involved in the pending state action.green,at explaining that younger applies to in quite limited circumstances harmon city of kansas city,cir younger may apply to in extraordinary circumstances united states composite state bd.of med.exam rs,cir.unit b a bstention bars prospective relief to a person not a party to the state action only in the extraordinary situation in which the interests of the state defendant and the federal plaintiff are so intertwined as to be considered identical.robinson stovall,cir.unit a except in extraordinary circumstances,a civil rights plaintiff ability to sue to vindicate his rights in federal court is not affected by the simultaneous pendency of a state prosecution against someone else.
in sum,neither the supreme court nor the other circuits have extended younger abstention to these facts nor do the rationales provided by the court in hicks and doran justify the application of younger here.there is no indication that the court would extend younger application to to such circumstances and such a result would go beyond the outer limits to which the other circuits have extended younger.what is conclusive is that in these circumstances the younger interference requirement has not been met.
lack of interference 
it is also clear on these facts that there is no real risk of interference with the three ongoing private civil actions in the state courts.younger abstention is based,in large measure,on the seriousness of federal judicial interference with ongoing proceedings.huffman,at accord maymó meléndez álvarez ramírez,cir younger is built around the principle that federal courts should refrain from issuing injunctions that interfere with ongoing litigation.as a result,where neither declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with the ongoing state proceedings,there is no basis for younger abstention.doran,at accord rio grande,at younger applies only when the relief asked of the federal court interfere s with the state proceedings.alteration in original quoting quackenbush,at green,at the supreme court has confirmed that interference with ongoing state judicial proceedings is a necessary condition for younger abstention.interference is usually expressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the practical effect of doing so.rio grande,at.
nothing in the mda requested relief would interfere with the three proceedings involving its members.the prospective injunctive relief sought pertains solely to the attorney general,and would only preclude the commonwealth,not private parties,from bringing suit under a with respect to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce 
the declaratory relief sought would also not cause any interference with the proceedings.it is true that the mda seeks a general declaration that subsection a is with respect to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce.the supreme court has made clear that is not a basis to invoke younger.in steffel and in doran,the outcomes of the federal suits would create judicial precedent which might or might not coincide with the determinations made by the state courts as to other parties under the same state statutes.that did not warrant younger abstention.
indeed,the court in nopsi made clear that even though the federal court disposition of such a case may well affect,or for practical purposes,a future or,as in the present circumstances,even a pending action,such an effect was insufficient to give rise to younger abstention.at see also rio grande,at t he mere possibility of inconsistent results in the future is insufficient to justify younger abstention.green,at explaining that the mere potential for conflict in the results of adjudications,is not the kind of interference that merits federal court abstention quoting.river water conservation dist.united states,d.
beyond that,there is another reason there is no interference here.as a practical matter,the s tate courts are not bound by the dictates of the lower federal courts,although they are free to rely on the opinions of such courts when adjudicating federal claims.evans thompson,cir citing lockhart fretwell,d thomas,concurring accord steffel,at rhenquist,concurring explaining that a federal declaratory judgment would not be accorded the stare decisis effect in state court that it would have in a subsequent proceeding within the same federal jurisdiction.although the state court would not be compelled to follow the federal holding,the opinion might,of course,be viewed as highly persuasive.magouirk phillips,cir t he louisiana state courts are not bound by fifth circuit precedent when making a determination of federal law.bromley crisp,cir en banc holding that state courts may express their differing views on the retroactivity problem or similar federal questions until we are all guided by a binding decision of the supreme court united states ex rel.lawrence woods,cir b ecause lower federal courts exercise no appellate jurisdiction over state tribunals,decisions of lower federal courts are not conclusive on state courts.owsley peyton,cir though state courts may for policy reasons follow the decisions of the court of appeals whose circuit includes their state,they are not obliged to do so.citation omitted 
as a matter of state law,massachusetts state courts do not regard the pronouncements of lower federal courts as binding.ace prop.cas.ins.comm r of revenue,although we are not bound by decisions of federal courts other than the united states supreme court on matters of federal law,we give respectful consideration to such lower federal court decisions as seem persuasive.citation omitted quoting commonwealth hill,commonwealth montanez,though we always treat their decisions with deference,we are not bound by decisions of federal courts except the decisions of the united states supreme court on questions of federal law.thus,should the district court issue a declaratory judgment on remand finding the state statute,that judgment would not be binding on massachusetts state courts and litigation by private parties may proceed.that said,a defendant may seek to enforce the declaratory judgment in federal court should the attorney general continue to bring actions under the statute in state court despite the declaratory judgment.
the attorney general does not argue that a federal decision could result in collateral estoppel effects that would amount to interference with the state proceedings.even if such collateral estoppel effects were present,they would not suffice to justify younger abstention.rio grande,at normal res judicata effects of federal actions on state actions are of course not enough to trigger younger.
given this lack of any interference with the proceedings,younger abstention is inapplicable 
the district court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the suit based on younger abstention.we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the amendment to this statute altered,among other provisions,the second prong of the test,which is the basis of the mda claim.before this amendment,the second prong of the test read and such service is performed either outside the usual course of the business for which the service is performed or is performed outside of all places of business of the enterprise.laws ch.
chapter is entitled withholding of taxes on wages and declaration of estimated income tax.chapter is entitled labor and industries and contains a wide variety of provisions relevant to the employment relationship,including a requirement that employees be paid weekly or.see.laws ch.chapter is entitled minimum fair wages,and contains a variety of provisions establishing minimum wage and overtime pay requirements.see.laws ch.chapter is entitled workers compensation and addresses that subject.
improper classification under,of itself,does not appear to give rise to a cause of action instead,the statute seems to require that an improper classification result in a violation of one of the referenced chapters before an entity may be sued under.only employers who fail to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section and in so doing fail to comply,in any respect,with chapter or certain sections of chapter,or chapter shall be subject to all of the criminal and civil remedies provided by the statute.laws ch,d.similarly,employers who fail to properly classify an individual as an employee according to this section and in so doing violate chapter shall be subject to all of the civil remedies provided by the statute.id.
apparently,the mda has not publicly disclosed a list of its members,but it represents that it has members,and the attorney general does not dispute this representation.see.delivery ass coakley,d.
those three actions are reynolds city express,sucv suffolk,filed july,okeke dynamex operations,micv middlesex,filed may,reynolds world courier ground,nocv norfolk,filed may.there are also a variety of other state suits against motor carriers that are not mda members which have been brought under.see,oliveira advanced delivery sys,wl.july,derochers staples,wl.june,fucci connection operating.lexis.
the district court noted that there is some dispute among the district courts in this circuit as to whether a younger motion to dismiss is properly viewed as a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,or a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.delivery ass n,d at.a primary difference between the two is that,under rule b,the district court may weigh the evidence and make factual determinations,if necessary,to determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear the case.torres negrón j n records,llc,cir.here,however,the district court did not engage in any weighing of the evidence,but rather based its decision on the undisputed facts,namely the complaint and certain public documents.delivery ass n,d at.as a result,we need not resolve this question here.
it is in the standing context that organizations may have interests of their own,separate and apart from the interests of their members.see,havens realty coleman,d naacp button,d wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.a n organization can assert standing to protect against injury to its own organizational interests,separate and apart from an organization ability to borrow the standing that could be established by individual members.
the attorney general attempts to characterize the mda as the alter ego of its three individual members,borrowing the phrase from other legal doctrines.it is questionable whether it is appropriate to lift this concept from other areas of law,where it serves different purposes,and use it in abstention cases.even if the alter ego concept were easily transferable to abstention,it would not be met here.the mda has not assumed the expectations of a predecessor employer,and the question here is not the labor law question of whether in consequence the mda has assumed obligations to employees.see nlrb hosp.san rafael,cir describing the labor law alter ego doctrine,whereby an employer will be treated interchangeably with its predecessor for purposes of applying labor laws,typically when the new employer is created by the owners of the first for the purpose of evading labor law responsibilities.nor would the mda be considered an alter ego of its members for purposes of piercing the corporate veil,which typically requires,among other elements,pervasive control over,in re ontos,cir,or complete domination of,goya foods,unanue,cir,the supposed alter ego by other entities.the traditional legal definitions and uses of the alter ego doctrine do not apply here.
our precedent does not support extending younger to these facts.casa marie,superior court of puerto rico,cir,is factually distinguishable because the nonintervenors,who were not parties to the action,were seeking to enjoin enforcement of a valid judgment.id.at.the court made clear that t he nonintervenors,not having been joined in the neighbors superior court complaint,probably could have chosen to press their federal claims in federal court prior to the entry of the judgment and contempt decree,subject only to the less imposing obstacle of colorado river abstention.id.at emphasis added.here,there is no judgment whose enforcement might be interfered with by the federal suit.
in the context of res judicata,the court has recently cautioned against lumping together distinct parties for purposes of claim and issue preclusion,rejecting the virtual representation doctrine.taylor sturgell,d.the court made clear that are bound only in certain limited circumstances.id.at quoting martin wilks,d.
if the attorney general brought such an action in contravention of the injunction,then the usual proceedings provided for when a party has violated an injunction would be available in the district court.additionally,the defendant may be able to raise the injunction as a defense in the state court action.
nothing in the federal declaratory judgment act changes this the act simply provides that,where there is an actual controversy within a federal court jurisdiction,the court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,and that a ny such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.a.the act does not contain any provisions indicating that declaratory judgments are authoritative nonparties to the litigation.in fact,the act indicates it may only declare the rights of interested part ies seeking the declaration.id.the supreme court,in upholding the constitutionality of this act,made clear that its operation is procedural only,aetna life ins.of hartford,hawo
