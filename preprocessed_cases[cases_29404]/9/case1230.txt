a supervisor hot temper and foul tongue triggered this lawsuit.laura ferraro sued her former employer,kellwood company,for violating the new york state human rights law,exec.law,and the new york city human rights law,admin.code tit.her complaint alleges that her supervisor,arthur gordon,demoted ferraro,cut her salary,subjected her to a hostile work environment,and constructively discharged her on account of her breast cancer.the district court granted kellwood motion for summary judgment in this diversity action,a decision from which ferraro appeals.ferraro kellwood,wl,at,see.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to,and for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
on april,ferraro began working in the new york city office of kellwood company,a nationwide apparel merchant,as the president of its vintage blue clothing division.she reported directly to arthur gordon,the ceo of the kellwood western region,who worked out of the company los angeles office.gordon supervised several divisions including vintage blue and enc,the clothing division into which vintage blue was eventually folded.gordon was a tough manager,known to rant,yell,and use profanity when upset,which was frequent.about once a month,ferraro would attend meetings of the division presidents in los angeles,where she would have personal contact with gordon.much of their other communication was by phone.
on september,ferraro was diagnosed with breast cancer.she underwent a lumpectomy on september,took a leave of absence thereafter,and continued to work meaningfully while undergoing radiation treatment.ferraro produced evidence that in october,shortly after returning to work following her surgery,gordon hostility toward her drastically increased.according to ferraro,in addition to gordon general ranting and cursing,he began to single out ferraro for harsh verbal abuse both in the division presidents meetings in los angeles and on the phone.in november,eight weeks after ferraro surgery,the complaint states that gordon sought to replace ferraro because of her breast cancer.he interviewed,but did not hire,a candidate for president of vintage blue and suggested to ferraro that she let the candidate replace her because she may want to take it easy.
in may,after several quarters of poor financial performance by vintage blue and eight months after the surgery,gordon merged vintage blue into the enc division.vintage blue sales volume had declined in late and early,and gordon considered ferraro projections for the third quarter of insufficient to justify maintaining vintage blue as a freestanding division.the merger of vintage blue into enc was designed to create economies of scale and cut overhead.gordon partially blamed ferraro for vintage blue poor performance and was frustrated by her repeated downward revisions to vintage blue sales projections.as part of the restructuring,gordon modified ferraro job so that she reported to the president of enc rather than to gordon.ferraro kept her title as president and still managed vintage blue sales and merchandising efforts,but she was excluded from the presidents meetings in los angeles.at the same time,gordon cut ferraro base salary from to.
ferraro worked her last day at kellwood on friday,may.the next monday,with ferraro present,ferraro therapist called kellwood human resources hr department to report that ferraro was taking disability leave because of anxiety and stress.in her deposition,ferraro stated that the last straw precipitating her leave was hearing that gordon was going to make a business trip to the vintage blue new york office and feeling unable to handle gordon intense verbal abuse in person.on june,in a form submitted to kellwood hr department,ferraro identified stress caused by harassment at work as one of her reasons for requesting a leave of absence.on july,the hr department sent ferraro a letter asking her to complete an attached form to enable kellwood to investigate the details of the harassment claim.ferraro never completed the form,and there is no evidence in the record of an investigation.after ferraro exhausted her disability leave on november,kellwood terminated her employment.
discussion 
in this action,ferraro claims relief under the new york state human rights law,exec.law,and the new york city human rights law,admin.code tit,for discriminatory demotion and reduction in salary and hostile work environment and constructive discharge.both the state and city laws forbid employers from discharging or changing the conditions of employment of an employee because of her disability.exec.a admin.code a.the standards for liability under these laws are the same as those under the equivalent federal antidiscrimination laws.see forrest jewish guild for the blind,t he standard for recovery under section of the executive law is in accord with the federal standards under title vii,and the human rights provisions of new york city administrative code mirror the provisions of the executive law.citations omitted see also tyler bethlehem steel,cir new york courts have consistently looked to federal caselaw in expounding the human rights law.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts in favor of ferraro and asking whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether kellwood is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
discriminatory adverse employment action 
in discrimination claims brought under the new york state and new york city human rights laws,the framework established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d,applies.see shore.hosp.rosa.that framework requires a plaintiff in a case to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,after which the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action in question.once the defendant provides such a reason,the plaintiff shoulders the burden of showing sufficient potential proof for a reasonable jury to find the proffered legitimate reason merely a pretext for discrimination.see richardson state dep t of corr,cir.
we need not decide whether the district court was correct in holding that ferraro failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of disability discrimination because,in any event,ferraro has failed to produce evidence to carry her burden of rebutting kellwood proffered nondiscriminatory reason for demoting ferraro and reducing her salary.kellwood produced evidence that gordon merged vintage blue into kellwood larger enc division because vintage blue low and declining sales volume did not justify its existence as a freestanding kellwood division.kellwood also produced evidence that the restructuring was motivated by the goal of achieving economies of scale through the combining of certain duplicative functions and that the changes in ferraro job description and salary resulted from this restructuring.kellwood further introduced evidence that gordon held ferraro,as the manager in charge of vintage blue sales,merchandising,and sales projections,partially responsible for the poor sales volume.
ferraro produced no evidence showing that the reasons offered by kellwood are a pretext for discrimination.ferraro points out that other divisions with poor financial performance were not reorganized.ferraro,however,has produced no evidence that the other divisions had sales volumes insufficient to support their overhead,that vintage blue did not in fact have poor sales volume,or that efficiencies did not result from folding vintage blue into enc.
to survive a motion for summary judgment,ferraro need not show evidence definitively proving that kellwood reduced her rank and salary because of her illness.she must,however,offer some evidence,such as the falsity of kellwood stated legitimate reason,from which one may infer the ultimate fact of discrimination.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d holding that a prima facie case and sufficient evidence to reject the employer explanation may permit a finding of liability in an action fisher vassar,cir en banc requiring an plaintiff to show that the employer articulated reason is a pretext and notin
