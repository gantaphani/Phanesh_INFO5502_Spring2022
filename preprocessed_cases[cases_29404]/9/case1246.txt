new york state department of corrections docs policy generally forbids the prescription of hepatitis c medication to any prisoner with evidence of active substance abuse within the preceding two years.consistent with docs policy,the defendants in this case refused to prescribe suffers from chronic hepatitis a new regimen of medication because he had,on one occasion in the relevant time period,tested positive for marijuana use.here,however,all of plaintiff treating physicians,including prison physicians,believed that the medically appropriate course of treatment was to prescribe him the new regimen of hepatitis c medication,and they expressly and repeatedly recommended that docs approve a prescription for the medication notwithstanding the fact that docs policy suggested otherwise.
because the defendants reflexively applied docs policy in the face of the unanimous,express,and of plaintiff treating physicians,including prison physicians,we believe a jury could reasonably find that the defendants here acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiff medical needs.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on that basis,and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual history 
the pertinent undisputed or,where disputed,taken most favorably to the as follows.the plaintiff,james johnson,is an inmate in the custody of the new york state department of corrections docs and is currently incarcerated at the great meadow correctional facility.from february,to november,johnson was incarcerated at green haven correctional facility green haven.
in may,following a liver biopsy,plaintiff learned that he suffers from chronic hepatitis c,a serious liver disease,and that his disease was in advanced stage iii with bridging fibrosis,approaching cirrhosis.at the time of his diagnosis,johnson treating physician at green haven was tom scales,johnson also visited regularly with an outside gastroenterologist named antonelle.
in february,johnson began interferon therapy as treatment for his hepatitis c,johnson began receiving the drug alpha interferon at a dosage of million units,three times per week.at first,johnson responded quite positively to this therapeutic regimen when johnson began interferon therapy in february,he had a viral load count of million units,but by june,johnson viral load count had decreased to units,and by october,his viral load was classified as undetectable less than.however,johnson condition soon worsened.in december,for example,antonelle johnson outside gastroenterologist noted that johnson liver enzyme counts were increasing.lab tests performed in january showed a further increase in johnson liver enzyme count and also revealed that johnson viral load had dramatically increased from previously undetectable levels to a viral load of over units.
in light of these changes,on february,antonelle recommended that johnson commence rebetron therapy,that is,treatment with both the drug alpha interferon given in interferon therapy and the drug ribavirin.similarly,on february,tom scales,johnson treating physician at green haven correctional facility,indicated that in light of plaintiff january lab reports,johnson was to be started on ribovarin sic as soon as approval can be obtained.scales also noted that he anticipate d a new set of tests to evaluate for any developing anemia.
in a report dated either may,or may,document contains conflicting.antonelle reiterated his belief that johnson should be given rebetron therapy,and shortly thereafter,on may,a note was made in johnson file that a request for ribavirin would be submitted to the central prison pharmacy.pursuant to docs policies at the time,such a request was made to defendant lester wright,docs deputy commissioner and chief medical officer,by defendant carl koenigsmann,the health service director of green haven correctional facility.on june,however,koenigsmann was informed by rita gavin that wright denied the request for ribavaron sic due to drug use within the past year.
at this point,a word about plaintiff drug use is in order.in may one year before the request to provide johnson with ribavirin was tested positive for marijuana use following the administration of a urine toxicology screen,a urinalysis test.it is undisputed that this single,positive urinalysis test is the only evidence in the record on summary judgment indicating that plaintiff took drugs at any time after he was diagnosed with hepatitis c.it is also undisputed that internal department of corrections policy permits prison physicians to deny hepatitis c treatment,in certain circumstances,to prisoners who show evidence of active substance abuse.to wit,on march,the department of corrections issued its initial hepatitis c primary care practice guideline the guideline.the guideline represents,as stated in the introduction,an approach to the current management of hepatitis c disease which is consistent with community standards of care and is appropriate in our corrections settings.the guideline expressly notes,however,that the treatment plans recommended in this document are not necessarily all inclusive and that the guideline represents the current state of knowledge regarding treatment agents for the management of hepatitis 
under the guideline,hepatitis c treatment specifically interferon therapy is to be considered in accordance with various criteria,one of which is.no evidence of active substance abuse drug alcohol during the past years check urine toxicology screen if drug use is suspected.moreover,a hepatitis c treatment referral checklist attached to the checklist whose completion is,at least according to the guideline,intended to assist the clinician in evaluating the inmate for possible treatment further provides,as one of its eleven exclusion criteria,active alcohol or other substance abuse within past two years.the checklist then provides space for an inmate primary care physician to verify when recommending hepatitis c treatment that the inmate has met all the inclusion criteria and does not have any of the exclusion criteria exceptions may be hiv or psychiatric disease.
on august,after antonelle had learned that the request for rebetron therapy had been denied due to johnson drug use,antonelle renewed his request to prescribe ribavirin to johnson,notwithstanding the fact that docs policy provided otherwise.antonelle wrote 
request for ribavirin was refused because of bad urine test for marijuana.do not feel that this should preclude prescription for ribavirin.
had initially responded to alpha interferon but relapsed with last viral load.
would again request approval for ribavirin prescription.will increase alpha interferon to m units in interim.
repeat viral load in mos.
on october,antonelle yet again indicated in his notes that he still feel s johnson should be on ribavirin in spite of drug policy.
on november,johnson was transferred from green haven to great meadow correctional facility and william smith,became johnson treating physician there.on january,smith recorded in his notes that johnson had been denied ribavirin and indicated his disapproval of this denial,noting that he would call wright to obtain approval for ribavarin sic.as of march,however,smith still had not received an update from wright regarding possible use of ribavarin sic.
johnson then took matters into his own hands.on june,johnson filed an inmate grievance complaint in which he requested that docs drug use policy be retracted and that he be permitted to begin rebetron therapy immediately.the next day,johnson proceeded to contact wright directly,writing a letter requesting that he begin such therapy.on july,in response to johnson grievance,bundrick,prepared an investigation sheet indicating that johnson is correct,that rebetron had been recommended,that there were other mitigating factors to receiving approval for this therapy and that further lab work needed to be conducted.
on july,wright wrote johnson a letter informing him that rebetron therapy had been approved and that the health staff will begin your therapy,if they have not already done so,in the
