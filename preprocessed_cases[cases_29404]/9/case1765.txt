opinion of the court 
while the incidents that form the basis of this claim may seem trivial at first,to the plaintiffs who were subjected to them they presented a paradigmatic case of racial profiling.the parties testified to differing versions of the relevant facts.the district court failed to view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and accordingly erred in granting summary judgment based on qualified immunity and the merits.
introduction 
plaintiffs marco antonio carrasca,fidel figueroa,abimael figueroa,and rigoberto vales barreras filed suit against edward pomeroy,a former new jersey state park ranger,and steve losey,a former visitor service assistant at waywayanda state park referred to collectively as the rangers,in the united states district court for the district of new jersey under claiming that the rangers violated plaintiffs rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the fourth amendment.they further claimed that the rangers violated and and the new jersey law against discrimination 
the district court granted the rangers motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs case in its entirety with prejudice.plaintiffs appeal,contending that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact.in contrast,the rangers argue that all parties are in agreement as to all of the material facts.based on the record before us,we conclude that significant factual disputes existed and that the district court should have viewed the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,thus precluding summary judgment.
backgrounda.facts 
plaintiffs claim that shortly after on august,they entered a lake in waywayanda state park,located in sussex,new jersey,and that there were between fifteen to other swimmers in the lake at that time.dep.of fidel figueroa at barreras at carrasca at.the rangers agree.dep.of pomeroy at.furthermore,pomeroy claims,and plaintiffs do not deny,that pomeroy arrived at the lake between approximately and,which was after the posted closing time for the lake.dep.of pomeroy at and.
the events after this point are in dispute.the parties version of the facts are taken from the depositions of all four plaintiffs and pomeroy we will present each version of the facts,beginning with the plaintiffs.
according to plaintiffs,abimael figueroa,the sole female plaintiff,was not in the lake but instead was sitting on the beach when pomeroy arrived at the scene.dep.of abimael figueroa at.the remaining three plaintiffs exited the water,along with everyone else in the lake,upon pomeroy order to do so.dep.of fidel figueroa at dep.of barreras at dep.of carrasca at.a woman and child were the last to leave the lake,emerging from the water a few minutes after plaintiffs.dep.of barreras at.after exiting the water,plaintiffs collected their belongings and began walking towards their car when pomeroy approached them and,in spanish,called them mexican as if he was making fun and told plaintiff carrasca that he was almost naked.dep.of carrasca at.carrasca admits that he was swimming in his underwear,which he contends were dark bikini briefs.dep.of carrasca at.
thereafter,plaintiffs walked to their car at which point pomeroy got into his patrol car,parked behind plaintiffs car,and got out.dep.of carrasca at.pomeroy then asked plaintiffs for a driver license,green card,or some other form of identification.dep.of fidel figueroa at.permanent residency cards are colloquially known as green cards.united states vasquez de reyes,cir.pomeroy proceeded to take the car keys from plaintiff fidel figueroa,went to his patrol car where he spoke on his radio for a few minutes,and returned to search plaintiffs car.dep.of fidel figueroa at.pomeroy then arrested all four plaintiffs without reading them their rights required under miranda arizona,d.dep.of carrasca at.he handcuffed and placed plaintiffs in his patrol car,drove them to the park office,and,when there,handcuffed them to chairs.dep.of fidel figueroa at.plaintiffs remained in that position for approximately three to four hours before pomeroy allowed them to leave.dep.of fidel figueroa at.plaintiff fidel figueroa collected some personal items from the car,which was impounded.dep.of fidel figueroa at dep.of pomeroy at.all four plaintiffs were given a summons for swimming after hours,for which they thereafter paid fines.dep.of fidel figueroa at dep.of carrasca at.responding to pomeroy orders during this time,defendant losey searched plaintiffs car and handcuffed plaintiffs.dep.of carrasca at.
pomeroy testimony significantly differed from that given by plaintiffs.in his deposition,pomeroy testified that after he announced over his vehicle loudspeaker that the lake was closed for swimming,he continued his patrol of the area nearby because most of the swimmers had left the water.dep.of pomeroy at.when he returned to the lake,he observed some individuals,including plaintiffs,still swimming.dep.of pomeroy at.at this time,pomeroy announced for a second time that all persons had to exit the lake.dep.of pomeroy at.further,even after his second announcement plaintiffs remained in the water,which prompted him to leave his car,walk to the lake,blow his whistle,and wave his arms at plaintiffs.dep.of pomeroy at.despite his efforts,plaintiffs remained in the lake,and it was not until pomeroy waved and called out for an additional five minutes that they left the water.dep.of pomeroy at.pomeroy noticed plaintiffs were wearing underwear and clothes,rather than swimming suits.dep.of pomeroy at.it was their improper attire coupled with their failure to comply with his orders to exit the water that caused him to approach them on the beach.dep.of pomeroy at.
unable to speak spanish,pomeroy asked plaintiffs for identification in english,which they could not provide.dep.of pomeroy at.next,pomeroy drove his patrol car to the parking area where he met plaintiffs,inquired about the driver of the car and his driver license,and asked all the plaintiffs once again for identification,including their green cards.dep.of pomeroy at.when plaintiffs said they did not possess green cards.pomeroy called the ins,and spoke to ins agent donald sasso who told pomeroy he would return his call because the ins had potential interest in plaintiffs.pomeroy then handcuffed and arrested plaintiffs for swimming after hours,placed them in his patrol car,and took them to the park office.dep.of pomeroy at.
at the office,pomeroy handcuffed the three male plaintiffs to chairs.dep.of pomeroy at.during this time,pomeroy called his daughter who served as a spanish interpreter and enabled pomeroy to obtain plaintiffs identities and addresses.dep.of pomeroy at.agent sasso did not return pomeroy initial call so pomeroy repeatedly albeit unsuccessfully attempted to call sasso again from the office.dep.of pomeroy at.eventually,pomeroy spoke with ins supervisor carol ford who advised him that the ins was not interested in plaintiffs,despite pomeroy offer to transfer plaintiffs anywhere in the state of new jersey.dep.of pomeroy at.thereafter,plaintiffs were released from the office.dep.of pomeroy at.all four plaintiffs pled guilty to swimming after hours.dep.of pomeroy at.
as is evident,plaintiffs and pomeroy paint significantly different pictures of the same events.importantly,they disagree as to how many times pomeroy asked plaintiffs to exit the water,when plaintiffs did in fact exit the water,the whereabouts of abimael figueroa when pomeroy first approached the swimming area,whether plaintiffs swimming attire differed significantly from the attire of other swimmers,and the amount of time plaintiffs were in custody at the park office.
procedural history 
plaintiffs complaint described the suit as a civil rights action brought by four individuals to redress the rangers discriminatory treatment of them the district court granted the rangers summary judgment motion without oral argument.in a short opinion,after reciting the facts in a manner that plaintiffs claim failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to them,it concluded that i losey played little or no part in detaining plaintiffs ii defendant pomeroy lawfully detained plaintiffs for investigatory purposes iii defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.moreover,even if the court were to reach the merits of this action,the court finds that it is an utterly frivolous case.opinion order at,carrasca pomeroy,footnotes omitted.
plaintiffs timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussiona.standard of review 
the standard of review applicable to an order granting summary judgment is plenary.see witkowski welch,cir.we apply the same test employed by a district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.kelley tyk refractories,cir.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of pomeroy and losey was proper only if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.plaintiffs,as the parties,are entitled to every favorable inference that can be drawn from the record.see sharrar felsing,cir.
because the parties disagree as to various facts,summary judgment would have been appropriate only if these factual disputes were immaterial.for the following reasons,we find that the factual discrepancies as presented by both parties are material,thereby making summary judgment improper.
b.the disputed facts 
plaintiffs contend that they left the water the immediately following pomeroy first announcement to do so.in fact,they claim that other individuals remained in the water even after they had exited.pomeroy,on the other hand,argues that he had to repeatedly order plaintiffs to leave the lake before they acquiesced.contrary to the district court statement that the issue of when plaintiffs exited the water is not a question of material fact,opinion order at,the time plaintiffs exited the water is material as it goes directly to whether they were similarly situated with other swimmers who were neither apprehended nor detained by the rangers.
it is undisputed that plaintiffs were swimming in their underwear,but it is far from clear that this fact alone made plaintiffs dissimilar from the other swimmers for equal protection purposes.pomeroy did not testify that no other male swimmer wore a bikini or that the clothing plaintiffs wore was substantially different from that worn by the other swimmers.furthermore,it was neither developed in the record nor known in response to our questions at oral argument whether there was a sign at the lake describing the required attire for swimming,potentially a significant fact for this appeal.
plaintiffs contend that pomeroy made fun of them when he called them mexican in spanish and approached them on the beach.dep.of carrasca at.the rangers neither admit nor deny this allegation,but contend that even if pomeroy made such a statement,it failed to show discriminatory intent.br.of rangers at.
the reason pomeroy asked for the plaintiffs green cards is in question.plaintiffs see this as an indication of his discriminatory intent toward them as mexicans.the rangers contend that pomeroy inquired about plaintiffs green cards simply for identification purposes and not to question their immigration status.
plaintiffs point to the questioning and subsequent arrest of plaintiff abimael figueroa as evidence of discriminatory intent and racial profiling because she was on the beach and not swimming when pomeroy approached her.they note that who were on the beach were not stopped or questioned.pomeroy did not testify that he observed her swimming after hours,relying only on the fact that she pled guilty to the summons.
plaintiffs contend that they were seized in violation of the fourth amendment.the district court stated that plaintiffs can not point to any evidence which indicates that pomeroy acted without probable cause when he detained plaintiffs for investigatory purposes.opinion order at.the court stated that the undisputed evidence produced demonstrates that pomeroy approached plaintiffs after he witnessed them swimming after hours when lifeguards were off duty.opinion order at.as noted earlier,plaintiffs concede swimming after hours.the crux of their case lies in the alleged differential treatment of plaintiffs and.
the length of the detention is at issue.pomeroy and the district court refer to the length of the detention as two hours.plaintiffs testified they were held between three to four hours and were handcuffed to their chairs.pomeroy offered no explanation for the restraint,and the district court did not refer to it.
plaintiffs testified that losey helped handcuff them at the time of the arrests,participated in the search of their vehicle,and helped handcuff plaintiffs to chairs at the park office.nevertheless,the district court stated it was undisputed that defendant losey played little or no part in the events that occurred at the park.opinion order at.
relevance of the disputed facts 
plaintiffs principal legal argument is that the unequal treatment to which they were subjected on the day in question constituted racial profiling in violation of their equal protection rights and therefore a violation of the federal statutes invoked.whether plaintiffs are correct that the rangers engaged in racial profiling,selectively enforcing the park swimming hours against them and not against others similarly situated to them,due to their race,is a factual issue which the district court was not free to decide and as to which we necessarily express no view.to prevail on an equal protection claim in the racial profiling context,plaintiffs would have to show that the challenged law enforcement practice had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.see bradley united states,cir.to prove discriminatory effect,plaintiffs must show that they are members of a protected class and similarly situated persons in an unprotected class were not prosecuted for swimming after hours.id.at.
it is unquestionable that,as mexicans,plaintiffs are members of a protected class,so the judicial inquiry must be limited to whether or not plaintiffs have submitted evidence that the rangers enforced the swimming hours regulations against them,rather than other similarly situated individuals,because of their race.if plaintiffs testimony is believed,they have provided sufficient evidence to survive a summary judgment motion.it appears that the district court accepted pomeroy version of the facts,which is unacceptable on summary judgment.
if one accepted plaintiffs version of the facts,a fact finder could determine that the rangers singled out plaintiffs,rather than other similarly situated swimmers,for enforcement of the swimming hours regulations,and that pomeroy reference to plaintiffs as mexicans,arguably stated as a pejorative racial slur,demonstrates that the rangers acted with a racially discriminatory purpose.see bradley,at.see also mody city of hoboken,cir noting that a racial slur by police officer may be proof of police conduct.
because it is apparent that we must return this case to the district court we consider for its benefit and that of the parties some of the other issues that must be considered on remand.the district court treated all plaintiffs together,notwithstanding plaintiffs uniform statement under oath that abimael figueroa was on the beach,not in the water,when pomeroy arrived at the swimming area,a fact pomeroy did not dispute.presumably,the district court accepted,without discussion,the rangers argument that because figueroa pled guilty and paid a fine for a summons for swimming after hours,the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars her from challenging the rangers assertion that she was swimming after hours.br.of rangers at.
however,it has been established that judicial estoppel can be imposed only if the party to be estopped is asserting a position that is irreconcilably inconsistent with one he or she asserted in a prior proceeding the party changed his or her position in bad faith,in a culpable manner threatening to the court authority or integrity and the use of judicial estoppel is tailored to address the affront to the court authority or integrity.montrose med.group bulger,cir.in the somewhat comparable situat
