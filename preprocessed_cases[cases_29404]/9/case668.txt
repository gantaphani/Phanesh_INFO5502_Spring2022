appellant bradley donahue brought suit in the district court challenging,on equal protection grounds,an affirmative action program for the hiring of boston police officers.the program is the product of a consent decree entered in.see castro beecher.after concluding that donahue failed to establish standing to assert his claims,the district court entered judgment adverse to donahue on all claims.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
facts and procedural history 
a.the selection process 
to be eligible for appointment to the boston police academy the academy,a candidate must take a statewide civil service examination the examination is administered by the commonwealth of massachusetts human resources division hrd.after hrd administers the exam,it compiles an eligible list setting forth those people who received a passing score on the examination a score of at least seventy is considered passing.in accordance with the terms of the consent decree,hrd assembles the eligible list by alternating minority and candidates.all individuals on the eligible list are considered qualified for appointment to a civil service position.
the candidates on the eligible list are then divided into residents and of boston.residents,regardless of score,are ranked higher than.within the group of residents,candidates with statutory preference receive an additional boost on the eligible list.the categories of statutory preferences include the children of firefighters or police officers who were killed or sustained injuries that resulted in death disabled veterans veterans and widows or widowed mothers of veterans who were killed in action or died from a disability incurred in wartime service.the candidates with a statutory preference are all ranked higher than those without a statutory preference.candidates without a statutory preference or the requisite language skills are ranked according to their scores on the civil service examination,subject to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.
when the time comes to hire a new class of student officers,the boston police department bpd requisitions a certification list from hrd to fill the positions.hrd then certifies sufficient names from the eligible list available for appointment.starting from the top of the eligible list,and moving down in strict rank order,hrd creates the certification list by certifying roughly twice the number of persons requested by bpd.subject to background checks on all candidates on the certification list,bpd must select candidates for appointment in order of their position on the list,starting with the person,unless it supplies a reason for bypassing someone.special certification lists are also created for those candidates who qualify for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak spanish,vietnamese,and.typically,bpd hires one person for every three persons listed on the general certification list.
in addition to this hiring procedure,bpd can hire new officers in three other ways.the first such mechanism is the appointment of police officers from a police cadets program second,former members of bpd who retired because of a disability may seek reinstatement to their former positions.see.laws ch.and finally,the massachusetts criminal justice training council has promulgated regulations that allow an appointing authority to recycle former recruit officers into a subsequent academy class.see code.regs.e.
b.the april exam 
donahue,a white male,took the statewide civil service examination administered by hrd on april.he received a passing score of and was thus placed on the eligible list.donahue does not qualify for a statutory preference,nor does he possess the language skills that would place him on a special certification list.donahue name appears at page of the eligible list.
in response to bpd requisition,hrd provided a certification list containing the names of the top candidates who were eligible for appointment.in addition,hrd provided three special certification lists of persons who qualified for a hiring preference based on their ability to speak spanish,vietnamese,or,respectively.on june,bpd appointed people to the academy,comprised of officers from the general certification list ten from the special language certification lists one disability retiree cadets and four officers from a previous academy class.all officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference.the last hired was a veteran whose name appears on page three of the eligible list.
later,bpd decided that it was necessary to appoint another class of officers from the same eligible list that was created from the results of the april exam.in response to bpd requisition,hrd issued a certification list containing names.additional special certification lists were created with the names of those candidates with the requisite language skills.on may,bpd appointed people to the academy,comprised of officers from the general certification list four from the language certification lists one disability retiree seventeen cadets and three officers recycled from a previous class.of the officers appointed from the general certification list,eighteen had statutory preferences.the thirteen officers without statutory preference,all minority candidates,scored higher on the exam than donahue.
the applicant who was appointed to the may class was an individual whose name appeared on page four of the eligible list,while donahue name appeared on page.since the names on the eligible list alternate between minority and,there were more than names between the appointee and donahue.
c.the may exam 
on may,hrd administered another statewide civil service entrance examination.donahue passed this examination with a score of.on march,consistent with the procedure we have already described,bpd appointed new police officers,comprised of candidates from the general certification list and sixteen from the cadet program.officers appointed from the general certification list qualified for a statutory preference.the seven without statutory preferences were all minority candidates certified to the list pursuant to the alternation requirement of the consent decree.although six of these candidates had exam scores greater than donahue,one minority appointee had a lower exam score.
the applicant appointed was an individual whose name appears on page two of the eligible list,at number.meanwhile,donahue name appears on page seven of the eligible list,at number.thus,there were candidates between the last appointee and donahue.
proceedings in the district court and the april exam 
donahue filed his complaint on may,asserting claims of discrimination under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and and.the complaint names as defendants the city of boston,the bpd,and the commissioner of the bpd collectively,appellees.donahue also asserted claims under and against several state officials collectively,state appellees based on their failure to comply with certain public record requests.donahue complaint prayed for injunctive,monetary,and declaratory relief.
after filing his complaint,donahue took the civil service examination again on april,receiving a passing score of.bpd requisitioned a certification list in order to hire police officers from the class of individuals that took that exam.in response,hrd forwarded a certification list dated september.donahue name does not appear on that certification list.appellees contend that,because donahue had reached the age of when he took the april exam,he was ineligible for appointment to the academy under a recent state statute which provides that,in any municipality that adopts the statute,no person who has reached his birthday on the date of the entrance examination shall be eligible to have his name certified for original appointment to a municipal police officer position.acts ch.chapter codified at.laws ch.
on may,appellees moved for summary judgment on the ground that donahue lacks constitutional standing to assert the claims set forth in his complaint.on september,donahue for summary judgment,claiming that the undisputed facts demonstrate that the consent decree is unconstitutional.on october,donahue also moved for leave to amend his first amended complaint to add a claim based on the results of the april exam and to assert a challenge to the constitutionality of chapter.
in a memorandum and order dated december,the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment.donahue city of boston,d.by orders entered december,the district court denied as moot donahue motion for summary judgment and his motion to amend the first amended complaint.donahue timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
donahue makes numerous assertions of error on the part of the district court.distilled to their essence,however,donahue arguments fall into three basic categories.first,donahue argues that the district court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to assert an equal protection claim seeking both prospective and retrospective relief.second,he argues that the court below abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend.finally,he claims error in the district court entry of judgment on his claims against the state appellees.we address these issues separately.
the standing doctrine is grounded in the requirement of article iii.allen wright,d.in essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.warth seldin,d.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three requirements lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,a plaintiff seeking to invoke a federal court jurisdiction must show that he has suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest.save our heritage,fed.aviation,cir see also defenders of wildlife,at.the asserted injury must be a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.defenders of wildlife,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.second,the plaintiff must show a causal connection between the asserted injury and the challenged action of the defendant this causal connection can not be overly attenuated.id.and third,the plaintiff must show that it is than merely the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.
s tanding is gauged by the specific,statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,d.that is,the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.allen,at.emphasis added.thus,a plaintiff must ensure that he establishes standing for each claim and for each form of relief sought.see adarand constructors,peña,d.
in reaching its determination with respect to standing,the district court did not differentiate between donahue claim for retrospective relief in the form of damages and his claim for prospective relief in the form of an injunction and declaratory judgment.because we perceive crucial analytical differences between the two claims,we scrutinize them independently of one another.our review of the district court ruling on standing is plenary.nyer winterthur int l,cir.
damages claim 
donahue argues that he is entitled to pursue his damages claim because he was denied appointment to the bpd under a facially hiring policy.in contrast,appellees argue that donahue lacks standing to assert his claim for damages because he can not demonstrate that he would have been hired under criteria.we agree with appellees that donahue can not establish standing to claim damages.
the supreme court addressed a similar issue in texas lesage,d per curiam.in lesage,a white plaintiff brought an equal protection action under for monetary damages after unsuccessfully applying to a doctoral program at the university of texas.id.at.although the university did not dispute that race was a factor considered at some stages of the admissions process,the district court granted summary judgment to the university,reasoning that the plaintiff would have been denied admission even if race had not been a factor in the admissions process,id.at.reversing the district court,the fifth circuit held that the plaintiff chances under a admissions scheme were irrelevant if he could prove that his application was treated differently because of race.id.the supreme court then reversed the fifth circuit,holding that the government was entitled to summary judgment on the damages claims.the court stated,s imply put,where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless,there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under.id.at.
in this case,donahue complaint alleged three instances in which he was passed over for appointment to the academy.the first two instances stemmed from hiring decisions based on the results of the april exam.on that exam,roughly applicants scored higher than donahue but were not considered for appointment.thus,in order for donahue to have been appointed based on his april exam scores under an otherwise policy,all of these applicants would have to be considered and rejected.the situation was similar when donahue was passed over for a third time,based on the results of the may exam.there,roughly applicants scored higher than donahue but were also denied appointment.under a policy,the bpd would have had to consider and reject all of these candidates before donahue was offered a position.
it is plain from the undisputed evidence that,notwithstanding the elements of the consent decree,donahue was too far down the list to be even remotely considered for hiring in any of the three instances of which he complains.it follows unavoidably from lesage that donahue damages claim is therefore doomed to fail 
this would ordinarily be the end of our inquiry on this claim.however,the fact that this question comes to us as one framed in terms of article iii is,of course,jurisdictional in one significant consideration.that is,this court must resolve questions pertaining to its jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d see generally scott idleman,the demise of hypothetical jurisdiction in the federal courts,vand.examining the effects of steel prohibition on exercising hypothetical jurisdiction.we must therefore determine whether donahue inability to establish that he would have received the benefit he sought under a policy warrants dismissal based on standing,or,alternatively,whether this deficiency in his case goes only to the ultimate merits of the claim.we hold that,in this case,dismissal for want of standing was appropriate.
by its own terms,the court decision in lesage does not specifically address standing.nevertheless,we read lesage as clarifying the injury in fact to a cognizable interest that is required to support standing for donahue damages claim save our heritage,at see also ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law,at supp.suggesting that lesage is pertinent to evaluating standing for damages claims.is a touchstone of the standing inquiry,and the lesage decision states in no uncertain terms that,unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he would have received the benefit under criteria,there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under.at.without the ability to establish a cognizable injury that would warrant the type of relief sought,a plaintiff can not demonstrate the requisite injury,the causal link between the injury and the defendant conduct,or redressability for the injury.
a recent decision from one of our sister circuits underscores the point.in aiken hackett,cir,petition for cert.filed,may,the sixth circuit addressed an equal protection claim by several white police officers who sought and were denied promotions to the position of sergeant.the promotion system was governed by a consent decree that required a certain number of minority candidates to be promoted.id.at.although some white officers would have received the promotion in the absence of a racial preference,the aiken plaintiffs were not among them.as the court stated,it was beyond debate that the plaintiffs still would not have been promoted to sergeant,as it was their composite test scores not the city affirmative action program that kept them from being promoted.id.at.accordingly,the court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek retrospective relief,reasoning as follows 
if the plaintiffs allege that a racial preference cost them some benefit under a government program,those plaintiffs may have alleged an injury in fact.but if those same plaintiffs can not also allege and show that under a policy they would have received the benefit,those plaintiffs have not alleged an injury in fact because they have not alleged an invasion of some interest that the law protects.
at least one circuit,however,has concluded that an equal protection plaintiff who seeks damages in a challenge to an affirmative action plan need not demonstrate,for purposes of standing,that he would have received the benefit in the absence of considerations of race.see wooden bd.of regents of the.of,cir.the wooden court reasoned that the injury in these kinds of cases is not the denial of the benefit,but rather the direct exposure to unequal treatment.id.at.the court reasoned further that the plaintiff inability to show that he would have ultimately obtained the benefit under criteria under lesage goes less to standing than it does to his ability to succeed on the merits of his claim.id.
our analysis hews closer to aiken than wooden.we think that lesage is a clear cue from the supreme court that we can not apply identical standing analyses to claims for damages and claims for prospective relief.it is equally apparent,in light of lesage,that the equal footing analysis is applied only in claims for the latter type of relief our standing inquiry on the claim for damages therefore asks whether donahue can demonstrate that,under a policy,he would have received the benefit for which he now seeks compensation.
to be sure,cases will arise where,because the issues of causation and injury are disputed and,the plaintiff inability to demonstrate damages should be treated as a question.see,healthy bd.of educ.doyle,d holding that,even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in making a decision adverse to the plaintiff,it can defeat liability by proving as an affirmative defense that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden consideration.but in donahue case,his inability to qualify for hiring on grounds is so overwhelmingly established that any claim to the contrary would be wholly insubstantial and frivolous.bell hood.where the absence of causation and a relevant are presented with such clarity,dismissal for lack of is justified.see steel,at.holding that dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is proper when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.quoting oneida indian nation county of oneida,d accord verizon,pub.serv.comm n,d owasso indep.sch.dist.no.falvo,d.we therefore affirm the ruling of the district court with respect to donahue claim for damages.
claim for prospective relief 
as we have already noted,standing to assert an equal protection claim for prospective relief is viewed through a different prism.the crucial difference between claims for damages and claims for prospective relief was summarized by the lesage court in this manner 
a plaintiff who challenges an ongoing program and seeks relief need not affirmatively establish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not considered.the relevant injury in such cases is the inability to compete on an equal footing.
at.quoting northeastern.chapter of contractors jacksonville,d accord adarand,at.richmond croson,d plurality opinion.in other words,a plaintiff may establish standing for prospective relief if he has or is likely to be expos ed to unequal treatment.wooden,at.however,because the relief sought is,the plaintiff must also be able to show that he is able and ready to apply for the benefit and that the challenged discriminatory policy prevents him from doing so.jacksonville,at.see also littleton,d past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by any continuing,present adverse effects.
notwithstanding the appellees various arguments to the contrary,we think it is plain that donahue was denied the opportunity to compete on equal footing in the bpd hiring process on account of his race.it is not disputed that at least one minority with no statutory preference or language appointed to the academy despite having scored lower than donahue on the may exam.such evidence makes the conclusion inescapable donahue would likely have been hired based on his may exam score if he were a minority applicant.although this is not the same as evidence demonstrating that donahue would have received an appointment under criteria,it is enough to satisfy a key element of standing to seek relief.
appellees assert,however,that donahue lacks standing for his claims for the additional reason that he is not able and ready to apply for future appointment to the bpd.they note that chapter prevents individuals,such as donahue,who are over the age of from applying for a position in the police or fire department of any city that adopts the law.see.laws ch.since donahue can no longer apply to be a boston police officer,appellees argue,he would not be subject to a future violation of his right to compete for the job on equal footing with all other applicants,regardless of race.
donahue responds by arguing first that chapter,by its own terms,does not apply to him.the statute states that those aged or older are not eligible for an original appointment.id.donahue contends that,because he has worked as a police officer in another city yarmouth,massachusetts,his appointment to a position in the bpd would not be original within the meaning of the statute.appellees dispute donahue interpretation of chapter and argue that an original appointment is the appointment of any person who has not been previously appointed to the same position,a boston police officer.
donahue argues further that,while boston initially accepted chapter,it has since repealed it.appellees assert that this is simply not so.but,unfortunately,the record does not disclose what action,if any,the boston city council has taken with respect to chapter.
because it is a relatively new statute,we find no massachusetts cases that give a definitive interpretation of the reach of chapter.and it is difficult to determine on the record and briefs before us whether the statute would pose an obstacle to donahue standing to seek prospective relief.as a general matter,original appointment appears to be a term of art in the state civil service statutes that denotes any position that is filled from an eligible list established as the result of a competitive civil service examination.see.laws ch,see generally city of somerville somerville mun.employees ass n,noting the differences between original and promotional appointments under the massachusetts civil service laws.such a definition appears to have been applied to an earlier statute,since repealed,that is analogous to chapter.see joseph adm r of div.of pers,rescript opinion.
while these considerations would seem to point in favor of appellees interpretation of chapter,the answer is not pellucid.the parties have not provided us with the factual and legal support for a reasoned conclusion,particularly in regards to the question of whether chapter continues to be observed by the city of boston in all events,donahue standing to pursue prospective relief in the form of an injunction against the operation of the consent decree requires greater development.we therefore reverse the district court ruling insofar as it applies to donahue claims.
motion to amend 
donahue sought to add a handful of claims to his complaint by way of a motion to amend,which the district court denied as moot following the entry of judgment on all of donahue claims.we review the district court denial of donahue motion for an abuse of discretion.grant news group boston,cir.
first,donahue attempted to augment his complaint with a claim for damages and injunctive relief based on his failure to be hired in light of his performance on the april civil service exam.as we have already discussed,donahue scored on the exam but was not considered for employment because of chapter.appellees argue that,because donahue was ineligible to seek future appointment to the bpd based on his age,the addition of any claim based on the april test results would be futile.donahue argues that the amendment would not be futile because the terms of chapter do not apply to him and because the boston city council rescinded chapter.
this leads to the second amendment donahue sought to include in his complaint a claim that chapter is unconstitutional because its age restriction does not pass scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.see kimel.bd.of regents,d states may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the fourteenth amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.appellees argue that such an amendment would be futile because age is not a constitutionally protected class and,as a consequence,similar restrictions for police officers have been upheld by other courts.see thomas postal inspection,cir upholding an age limit of for hiring postal inspectors arritt grisell,cir upholding an age limit of for hiring new police officers sobieralski city of south bend,same figueroa bronstein,per curiam same with regard to an age limit of ridaught div.of.hwy.patrol,so d same with regard to an age limit of.bd.of ret.murgia,d holding that a massachusetts statute mandating the retirement of uniformed police officers at age fifty survives scrutiny.
because we remand part of donahue case for further consideration,we view the motion to amend as no longer moot.however,there may be other reasons,well within the district court discretion,for denying donahue motion.thus,we leave it to the district court upon remand to determine in the first instance whether donahue proposed amendments are appropriate.
claims against state appellees 
finally,donahue complains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his remaining claims.the gravamen of these claims is that the state defendants violated and by withholding certain documents including copies of the original consent decree from donahue in a manner inconsistent with the massachusetts public records law.laws ch.the district court order does not mention these claims,nor is it apparent that the court even considered the claims before entering judgment on the entire case.nonetheless,we may affirm the district court judgment on any ground squarely presented below.pure,baker,cir.
as an initial matter,donahue makes only the most attempt to challenge the entry of judgment.donahue main brief devotes only three sentences to the issue,arguing in essence that the absence of a reason given by the district court for entering judgment alone warrants reversal.our general rule with regard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat them as forfeited.see beatty michael bus.mach,cir.sch.of law am.bar ass n,cir.
moreover,donahue has not adduced the sort of evidence that would support a claim under and a claim under requires the plaintiff to show that some animus usually racial lay behind the conspirators action,and that the conspiracy was aimed at interfering with protected rights.see bray alexandria women health clinic,d.in this case,donahue points to no or animus.instead,donahue claim appears to be nothing more than a thinly disguised attempt to repackage a public records action as a claim arising under federal law.we therefore affirm the district court entry of judgment in favor of the state appellees.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we reverse the district court judgment with respect to donahue claim under the equal protection clause for prospective equitable relief.because the case remains active,the district court should also reevaluate the propriety of donahue motion to amend.in all other respects,the district court judgment is affirmed.we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
in accordance with the terms of the consent decree,the civil service exam has been validated under the testing guidelines of the equal employment opportunity commission,see pt.
the cadet program is authorized by state statute,see.acts ch,which permits the boston police department to hire up to percent of its new officers each year from the program,see.acts ch.the program enables the bpd to recruit prospective candidates for police officer positions from all areas of boston by employing police cadets to perform administrative duties while obtaining some basic experience and training.once a person is a cadet for two years,passes the statewide civil service examination,and successfully completes the same screening procedures used to evaluate applicants from the certification list,that person can be appointed to the academy.
the entire text of the statute reads notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary,in any city,town or district that accepts this section,no person shall be eligible to have his name certified for original appointment to the position of firefighter or police officer if such person has reached his birthday on the date of the entrance examination.any veteran shall be allowed to exceed the maximum age provision of this section by the number of years served on active military duty,but in no case shall said candidate for appointment be credited more than four years of active military.laws ch.
only the constitutional requirements of standing are at issue here the elements of prudential standing are not implicated by this case.see generally william fletcher,the structure of standing,yale.
donahue attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that,since he is the only bpd applicant to have filed a lawsuit and other unsuccessful applicants have now forfeited their rights,he is essentially the next in line for an appointment to the bpd.while this argument demonstrates admirable creativity,it is not persuasive.a litigant can not use the fact that he filed his lawsuit to bootstrap an argument against potential standing and causation deficiencies in the very same also argues at some length that appellees are implementing the terms of the consent decree incorrectly by hiring new officers from the cadet program.it is unclear how this allegation bears on donahue claim that he was discriminated against based on his race.to the extent he intimates that the cadet program is being operated based on a racial quota system,he offers little more than speculation as to the program supposedly discriminatory operation.nor does he contend that he applied for the cadet program but was denied entrance due to unlawful racial considerations.
it is noteworthy that donahue did not assert a claim of race discrimination under title vii,which makes it unlawful for an employer to consider race as a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.m.an employer who violates this provision may still be held liable for declaratory relief,certain limited injunctive relief,and attorney fees,even though the employer would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.id.g b.congress is empowered to create substantive rights and to authorize suit for their enforcement.consequently,congress may define an injury,as it did in title vii,in a way that provides the basis for standing even in the absence of other injury to the plaintiff.see defenders of wildlife,at.kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.but as donahue made no claim under title vii,we need not consider its implications for his standing to sue.
although a plaintiff might be able to demonstrate that he was prevented from competing on equal footing,it is unclear how such a plaintiff would satisfy the element of redress
