waugh chapel south,llc,wcs llc,wcs properties business trust collectively wcs sued the united food and commercial workers union locals and ufcw and the mid atlantic retail food industry joint labor management fund the fund under the labor management relations act the lmra,which provides a cause of action for victims of unfair labor practices as defined by the national labor relations act the nlra,b.in its complaint wcs alleges that the defendants orchestrated fourteen separate legal challenges against their commercial real estate project in order to force wcs to terminate their relationship with a supermarket conduct that wcs alleged was an illicit secondary boycott under b ii b.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under the noerr doctrine,claiming that their first amendment right to petition the courts insulated their litigation activity from liability.alternatively,the fund moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that it was not a labor organization under the nlra.the district court agreed with both arguments and granted the motions to dismiss.this appeal followed.
we agree with the district court that the fund is not a labor organization under the nlra,but conclude that the noerr pennington doctrine does not at least at this stage spare the remaining defendants from the allegations of the complaint.although the courts are a medium by which citizens may exercise their first amendment right to petition their government,the act of petitioning those courts may not serve as the means to achieve illegal ends.cal.motor transp.trucking unlimited.under this sham litigation exception to the noerr pennington doctrine,we hold that the pleadings and the concomitant record evidence in this case,if credited by a factfinder,are sufficient to show that the unions have abused their right to petition the courts beyond the point of constitutional protection.we therefore affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand to the district court for a determination of whether the unions waged a secondary boycott in the manner alleged in the complaint.
wcs and elg are commercial real estate developers of two respective shopping centers in anne arundel county,maryland the village at waugh chapel south waugh chapel and the woodmore towne centre woodmore both companies planned to lease a storefront unit in each of their shopping centers to wegmans food markets.because the wegmans supermarket chain does not employ organized labor,both projects were opposed by the defendant unions.
that opposition commenced in december when union leadership set its sights on wegmans to mount an antagonistic campaign.j.according to wcs,a union executive threatened wcs that if wegmans did not unionize,we will fight every project you develop where wegmans is a tenant.the unions thereafter directed and funded a barrage of legal challenges at every stage of the projects development.
the first of these challenges occurred in august,when ufcw secretary treasurer george murphy,represented by his attorney macy nelson,petitioned the anne arundel city council the council to revoke its decision to rezone the waugh chapel site from agricultural and residential to commercial.wcs argued that murphy lacked standing.the day before a scheduled hearing on the merits,murphy withdrew the petition and effectively ceded that he was not an aggrieved party.
after this petition failed,the union employed surrogate plaintiffs to pursue their legal challenges.for the next few years,nelson would represent plaintiffs in sixteen other proceedings objecting to the development of the shopping centers,with the unions allegedly directing the litigation.three of those challenges pertained to woodmore and are not before us on appeal.we summarize the thirteen other challenges to waugh chapel below.
in december,paul gilliam,tracee gilliam,and the environmental organization patuxent riverkeeper appealed the council decision to extend the time for wcs to post fees and bonds for the project.wcs later posted the bonds and fees,mooting the case.
in march,robert smith and madonna brennan sued in maryland state court to enjoin the council approval of tax increment financing tif bonds,arguing that the council did not conduct the requisite hearing.the council did indeed fail to conduct a hearing,a failure it remedied by holding another hearing in may to reauthorize the tif bonds.the case was then dismissed as moot.
in june,smith and brennan sued several defendants associated with the development project,including the council and the maryland department of energy mde,alleging the development had caused a nuisance.after a brief period of discovery in which smith and brennan proffered expert testimony,the parties moved for summary judgment.the state court found that there was no nuisance and dismissed the suit.
in july,smith and patuxent riverkeeper filed a state court petition to vacate the mde issuance of a mining permit to wcs.they filed an identical petition in august when the mde issued an amended mining permit.the state court dismissed the july petition as based only on the conjecture and speculation of affidavits provided by plaintiffs.after this dismissal,the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their august petition.
from may to july,smith,sandra bowie,and rosie shorter appealed the grant of nine separate building and grading permits issued by the council to wcs.they withdrew the appeals after wcs subpoenaed the unions,financial records.
on march,wcs and elg sued the unions under the lmra,alleging two counts of secondary boycott activity under b ii b.count of the complaint pertained to the waugh chapel shopping center wcs,while count pertained to the woodmore towne center elg.as to count,the district court categorized the fourteen legal challenges directed against waugh chapel as follows one successful petition to appeal the issuance of the tif bonds,two environmental suits dismissed for lack of standing,and from which the court would not infer baselessness,ten grading and building petitions withdrawn to avoid subpoenas from which the court would not infer baselessness,one petition appealing the extension of time for wcs to post bonds and pay fees that became moot,and one environmental suit dismissed on the merits after thoughtful consideration.
the fund successfully moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that it was not a labor organization subject to the lmra.and because the district court concluded that none of the prior legal challenges to the development of waugh chapel were objectively baseless,it dismissed count i on noerr pennington grounds.while the court allowed a portion of count ii to survive the unions motion to dismiss a subsequent consent order also dismissed that count.
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we first address the procedural posture of this appeal and our jurisdiction to decide it.
although the parties do not address it,we must determine our appellate jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under,as we are bound in all cases to ascertain our own appellate jurisdiction before reviewing a district court judgment.reid angelone,cir.
with few narrow exceptions,including certain interlocutory and collateral orders,our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.united states myers,cir.in this case,after the district court dismissed wcs count i and most of count ii with prejudice,elg and the unions entered into a consent order,which purported to dismiss the remainder of count ii of the complaint with prejudice,but without prejudice to refiling in any other proceeding.this kind of split judgment ordinarily would not be considered final and therefore appealable under because it does not wind up the entire litigation in the district court.palka city of chicago,cir see also go computer,microsoft,cir.
several of our sister circuits have held that litigants may not use voluntary dismissals as a subterfuge to manufacture jurisdiction for reviewing otherwise,interlocutory orders.see gannon int l,blocker,cir rabbi jacob joseph school province of mendoza,cir lnc investments llc republic of nicaragua,cir marshall kansas city ry,cir james price stern sloan,cir csx,city of garden city,cir itofca,megatrans logistics,cir cook rocky mountain bank note,cir.tolerance of that practice would violate the policy against piecemeal appeals,rabbi jacob joseph school,at,and would allow an around the final judgment rule.palmieri defaria,cir.
elg confesses that its rule a voluntary dismissal was intended to allow appellate review of an otherwise interlocutory order.see appellants br.at the claims relating to one of those actions was dismissed by the march,consent order to allow for a final judgment.
under these circumstances,the question of remedy looms.in most cases,the proper remedy will be to reverse the rule a order and remand for completion of the case,without considering the merits of the earlier interlocutory order s.we may also deem the ambiguous voluntary dismissal of count ii to be with prejudice and go on to consider the appeal from the district court dismissal of all remaining claims.
madsen audrain health care,cir internal quotations omitted.as did the eighth circuit,we choose the latter remedy here,as it polices the boundaries of our appellate jurisdiction without punishing the litigants in this appeal.accordingly,we deem elg voluntary dismissal of count ii to be with prejudice and proceed to consider wsc appeal of its remaining claims.
we next address a procedural wrinkle regarding the district court rule b dismissal.while we have since questioned our decision to do so,see igen int l,roche diagnostics gmbh,cir,we have held that the noerr pennington doctrine is an affirmative defense membership carolina power light,cir.the district court,however,purported to adjudicate the merits of the unions noerr pennington defense under rule b,which is a procedure that tests only the sufficiency of a complaint and can not reach the merits of an affirmative defense unless all facts necessary to the affirmative defense clearly appear on the face of the complaint.goodman praxair,cir en banc internal quotations omitted.
while wcs complaint alleges that the unions directed a series of adverse lawsuits in order to wage a secondary boycott,the mere reference to the purportedly sham proceedings does not show on the face of the complaint whether noerr pennington bars wcs claims as a matter of law.in fact,much of the relevant evidence that the district court considered on the point consisted of the parties appended as part of the rule b motion to dismiss,which is not a pleading.mellon bank,ternisky,cir.
we also note that when matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the rule b motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under rule,and a ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.d.here,the district court did not formally convert the unions motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment,believing instead that it could adjudicate the unions motion under rule b by considering documents incorporated into the complaint by reference,and taking judicial notice of the purported sham proceedings.
it is not obvious to us that incorporation by reference is appropriate in this context given our holding in goodman that a district court may consider only the face of the complaint.goodman,at.nor should judicial notice be used as an expedient for courts to consider matters beyond the pleadings and thereby upset the procedural rights of litigants to present evidence on disputed matters.greater balt.ctr.for pregnancy concerns,mayor city council of baltimore,wl,slip op.at cir.july,en banc internal quotations omitted see haavistola cmty.fire of rising sun,cir.
but the bottom line is that the district court did allow the parties to supplement the record before ruling on the motion to dismiss.moreover,the parties did not request discovery or otherwise object to the court procedural management of the unions motion to dismiss.as we have stated before,
we are not bound by the label that the district court places upon its disposition of the case.whenever outside matters are presented to and not excluded by the trial court,the motion to dismiss should be considered on appeal as one for summary judgment even though the trial court characterized its action as a dismissal of the case for failure of plaintiffs to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the record in this case shows that both parties were given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence upon which the trial court could properly determine whether summary judgment should be entered.therefore,it is proper for this court on appeal to consider this as a motion for summary judgment.
dean pilgrim pride,cir internal quotations omitted.we conclude that the principle announced in dean applies directly here,and so we too will consider the unions motion to dismiss based on the noerr pennington doctrine as one for summary judgment.
as to the dismissal of the fund under rule b,therefore,we will review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,mccauley home loan inv.bank,cir,accepting the allegations of wcs complaint as true,trail local uaw united def.workers of,cir.but because we have refashioned the district court dismissal of the claim against the remaining defendants as a grant of summary judgment,we review de novo whether there are any genuine issues of material fact for the trier of fact to resolve and,if not,whether the unions were entitled to dismissal as a matter of law.reynolds am.red cross,cir.
we first consider the district court decision to dismiss the claim against the fund on the basis that it is not a labor organization under the nlra subject to the secondary boycott prohibitions of the lmra.the nlra defines a labor organization as any organization of any kind,or any agency or employee representation committee or plan,in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose,in whole or in part,of dealing with employers concerning grievances,labor disputes,wages,rates of pay,hours of employment,or conditions of work.
we have given a broad interpretation to the dealing with requirement.nlrb peninsula hosp.med,cir.but we have also explained that the dealing with phraseology denotes a bilateral mechanism through which an employee entity and management reciprocally interact 
as we understand this bilateral mechanism analysis,several general principles are readily apparent while the term dealing with connotes activity which is broader than collective bargaining,an employer does not necessarily deal with its employees merely by communicating with them,even if the matters addressed concern working conditions dealing occurs only if there is a pattern or practice over time of employee proposals concerning working conditions,coupled with management consideration thereof and isolated instances of the conduct described in number two do not constitute dealing.
an employee entity may be a labor organization if its purpose or activity involves dealing with employers.id.at.yet the fund satisfies neither of these criteria.first,wcs own complaint alleges that the fund is prohibited under its charter from participating directly or indirectly in union collective activities.second,while the question of whether an organization is a labor organization is primarily one of fact,peninsula,at,the only fact suggesting any interactions between the fund and an employer concerns the alleged secondary boycott.there is plainly no bilateral mechanism when the only alleged contact between an employee entity and management is an unfair labor practice directed against an employer.
although the fund has designated itself as a labor organization for purposes of tax liability,this is not sufficient to render it a labor organization for the purposes of labor law.the internal revenue code has a distinct definition of labor organization.see c c a.the first circuit has refused to borrow the nlra definition of labor organization to determine the meaning of that term under the tupper united states,cir.we agree with our sister circuit that the and the nlra have very different objectives,and we similarly decline to import definitions from statutes with unrelated or.id.
because plaintiffs fail to allege that the fund has engaged in a pattern or practice of dealing with employers,it is not a labor organization under the nlra and is not subject to the conditions of the lmra.we therefore affirm the district court decision to dismiss the complaint against the fund.
we next consider whether the district court correctly dismissed the claim against the remaining defendants.plaintiffs allege that the unions various legal challenges to the waugh chapel development violated the secondary boycott provision of the nlra,which extends to efforts to exert pressure on an unrelated,secondary or neutral employer in order to coerce the secondary employer to cease dealing with the primary employer,thereby advancing the union goals indirectly.coolsaet constr.local,int l union of operating eng rs,afl cio,cir internal quotations omitted.
the unions counter that their litigation activity is protected by the noerr pennington doctrine,which safeguards the first amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances,const.amend.i,by immunizing citizens from the liability that may attend the exercise of that right.see noerr,at pennington,at.
the principle originated from noerr,where the supreme court extended first amendment protection to lobbying efforts for legislation,explaining that mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws can not comprise a violation of antitrust law.noerr,at.
the court has since expanded noerr pennington immunity to alleged labor law violations,be k constr.nlrb,u,and to the approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies and to courts,the third branch of government.cal.motor,at.however,the first amendment offers no protection when petitioning activity ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action,is a mere sham to cover an attempt to violate federal law.prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures indus.prei,internal quotations omitted.
the supreme court first engagement with this exception occurred in california motor,where highway carriers instituted a slew of state and federal proceedings to resist and defeat applications by respondents to acquire operating rights or to transfer or register those rights.at.respondents,a group of rival highway carriers,filed an antitrust suit claiming this litigation activity constituted conduct.the court concluded that the facts alleged came within the sham exception to the noerr pennington doctrine,explaining that sham litigation occurs where a pattern of baseless,repetitive claims emerge s which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.id.at.
the supreme court revisited the sham litigation standard in prei,which involved a defendant counterclaim that the copyright action it was defending was a sham suit designed to violate antitrust law.in examining the applicability of noerr pennington,the court set forth a definition of sham litigation.first,the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.prei,at.the second inquiry focuses on the litigant subjective motivation and whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to violate federal law through the use of the governmental process.id.at.because the sham exception contains an indispensable objective component,id.at,even an improperly motivated lawsuit may not be enjoined as an unfair labor practice unless such litigation is baseless,id.at.
it is unclear whether prei distinguished or displaced the sham litigation test first propounded in california motor.two of our sister circuits,however,reconcile the two cases by reading them as applying to different situations.professional real estate investors provides a strict analysis to assess whether a single action constitutes sham petitioning california motor transport deals with the case where the defendant is accused of bringing a whole series of legal proceedings.uss posco indus.contra costa cnty.const.trades council,afl cio posco,cir accord primetime joint vent.broad,cir.
we have not had occasion to confront this issue,as our precedent has applied prei only where a party has alleged a single sham proceeding.see igen int l,at baltimore scrap david joseph,cir.nevertheless,we agree with the distinction adopted by our sister circuits.in the absence of any express statement that the sham litigation standard in prei supplanted california motor,we are obligated to follow the case which directly controls,leaving to th e supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.rodriguez de quijas.express,
we distinguish prei because it is to test whether a series of legal proceedings is sham litigation.when a party contends that it is defending a sham lawsuit,it is relatively simple for a judge to decide whether the singular claim it is presiding over is objectively baseless.see prei,at.but it is an entirely different undertaking to collaterally review as here fourteen state and administrative lawsuits for baselessness.it is especially difficult to do so where the presiding tribunal in those cases had no occasion to measure the baselessness of the suit because it had no inkling that the action comprised a possible campaign of sham litigation,and the plaintiffs preempted an assessment of frivolity by prematurely withdrawing some of their suits.
accordingly,when purported sham litigation encompasses a series of legal proceedings rather than a singular legal action,we conclude the sham litigation standard of california motor should govern.in this context,the focus is not on any single case.rather a district court should conduct a holistic evaluation of whether the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.cal.motor,at.the pattern of the legal proceedings,not their individual merits,centers this analysis 
one claim,which a court or agency may think baseless,may go unnoticed but a pattern of baseless,repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.that may be a difficult line to discern and draw.but once it is drawn,the case is established that abuse of those processes produced an illegal result,effectively barring respondents from access to the agencies and courts.insofar as the administrative or judicial processes are involved,actions of that kind can not acquire immunity by seeking refuge under the umbrella of political expression.
id.of course,the subjective motive of the litigant and the objective merits of the suits are relevant,but other signs of litigation including those present in this case may also be probative of an abuse of the adjudicatory process.
we now review the unions motion to dismiss under this test accordingly,we ask whether the record evidence presents a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the unions indiscriminately filed or directed a series of legal proceedings without regard for the merits and for the purpose of violating federal law.we conclude that it does.
in our view,the vast majority of the legal challenges failed demonstrably.in fact,it appears that only the march suit to enjoin the approval of tif bonds could be called successful.
the plaintiffs objectively lacked standing in the proceedings to rescind the rezoning decision by the council,as maryland law requires a party to attend the public hearing of an administrative body in order to have standing as an aggrieved party.see,cnty.council billings.
two additional suits regarding the mde issuance of surface mining permits were dismissed as based in critical part only on conjecture,as the petitioners supplied only their own conclusory affidavits of environmental harm with no scientific data or expert testimony.finally,collateral estoppel would have barred the nine appeals of the building and grading permits,as the petitioners simply repeated the substance of their nuisance claim dismissed weeks earlier that the developments caused environmental harm to their property.
while there is no particular percentage that a litigant must achieve to secure the protection of
