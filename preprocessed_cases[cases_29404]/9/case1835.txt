david bobzien bobzien,the county attorney for fairfax county,virginia,terminated the employment of nancy loftus loftus,an assistant county attorney,following her election to the fairfax city,virginia,city council the city council.after an unsuccessful grievance proceeding,loftus filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,challenging bobzien decision to terminate her employment solely because she had been elected to the city council.loftus contended bobzien actions violated her rights under the first amendment to the united states constitution as well as a virginia statute and fairfax county ordinance.the district court dismissed loftus complaint,concluding the termination of her employment did not violate the first amendment,virginia law or the local ordinance.for the reasons set out below,we affirm the district court judgment.
from until her termination in,loftus was employed by the fairfax county attorney office as an assistant county attorney in early,loftus contemplated becoming a candidate for the fairfax city council,the governing body of a separate and independent municipality from fairfax county under virginia law.see.const.art.vii.code ann.in february,loftus told bobzien she was considering a run for the city council in an election scheduled for may.as of february,however,she had not announced her candidacy and had not formally filed to become a candidate.
bobzien initially expressed misgivings about loftus intentions,stating in an email to her that election to the city council might conflict with her responsibilities as an assistant county attorney because the county attorney office routinely ha s dealings with the city that can lead to contention.at the time,fairfax county and fairfax city had a number of ongoing business,contractual and governmental relationships,including numerous agreements and memoranda of understanding that provided for services such as police,fire,library,health,welfare and social services,and sanitary sewer and waste disposal.in response to bobzien concerns,loftus represented that she had never been involved in any case against,or even with,the city in her duties as an assistant county attorney.
on april,once loftus had become an official candidate for city council,bobzien sent her an extensive and thorough letter that again expressed concern about the conflict of interest that loftus election to the city council would create.in particular,the letter noted that if loftus were to win the election,her duties as a member of the city council would conflict with her responsibilities as an assistant county attorney because of the numerous legal relationships between the city and county.bobzien also expressed concern that loftus conflict of interest would be imputed to every attorney in the fairfax county attorney office.in that circumstance,all of the county attorneys would be prevented from representing fairfax county not only in court proceedings adverse to fairfax city but also in civil matters.in view of that apparent conflict,bobzien cautioned loftus that if you decide to continue to pursue your election to the city council,and you are successful,you will not be able to continue your employment with this office once you take office as a member of the fairfax city council.
in conveying his concerns to loftus in the april letter,bobzien referenced virginia rules of professional conduct the rules and three legal ethics opinions leos from the virginia state bar standing committee on legal ethics the standing committee interpreting the rules leo,leo,and leo.in relevant part,leo provides that if a law firm represents clients before a governing body when one of its lawyers is a member,there is the appearance,if not the fact,of conflicting loyalties.leo explains the ethical dilemma for the 
the law firm,which includes the lawyer who sits on the governing body,owes a duty of loyalty to the client and must use all available resources to achieve the client lawful objective.the duty of loyalty is diluted and the available resources impaired,however,when the law firm must exclude the from the representation,and the law firm can not enlist his knowledge of the subject matter or of the governing body in the representation.the may have acquired or even confidential information as a member of the governing body that would serve the client interest.the client is denied the benefit of such information,however.if the law firm seeks to the limitation on its resources,the law firm might well be asking for consent to less than adequate representation.
similarly,the has a duty to the governing body on which serves and to constituents.when abstains from the governing body because it involves law firm representation of a client,then personal interest is elevated over duty as a public servant.both the governing body and the constituents are deprived of the benefit of voice in the process.
the leo concludes it is not ethically permissible for a law firm to represent a client in a matter before a governing body when one of the law firm lawyers is a member of the governing body even if discloses the conflict and abstains from participation and voting in the matter.
in leo,the standing committee reaffirmed leo and concluded for an member to recuse himself from a matter before his board in order that his law firm may accept representation of a private client creates an impermissible conflict of interest.and,thus,an attorney may not accept representation of a client in a matter that would require an appearance before a board,or other public body,of which any member of that attorney firm is a member.finally,in leo,the standing committee referenced leo and leo as describing an obvious conflict,which can not be cured by recusal because recusal would violate the member obligations to his constituents.based on those leos,bobzien concluded loftus election to the city council would create a similar and intractable conflict of interest both for her and the fairfax county attorney office,as she had been advised in the april letter 
in response to bobzien concerns,loftus contacted the ethics hotline of the office of the virginia state bar ethics counsel ethics counsel.she inquired is it unethical for me to be an a ssistant c ounty a ttorney for fairfax county and also serve on the fairfax city council.answering by letter,ethics counsel stated that the short answer is it is not per se unethical for a lawyer to be employed in a law firm or government attorney office and concurrently hold a public position or office.ethics counsel then qualified his abstract answer by cautioning lawyers that serve on public bodies will create conflicts of interest if the law firm in which the public official practices also interacts with the public body on which one of its lawyers sits.the letter continued 
leos and address this type of conflict and further opine that the public official disclosure,recusal and in the matter brought by her law firm does not cure the conflict from a legal ethics standpoint while recognizing that state and local government officials conflicts of interest laws are satisfied by those curative measures.in other words,lawyers that hold public office are held to a stricter standard than holding public office.
ethics counsel concluded that t his stricter standard is not new and has been repeatedly emphasized by the standing committee on legal ethics going back to opinions issued long before leos and,although those opinions provide the best guidance and analyses of the issue.notwithstanding these ethical red flags,loftus proceeded with her candidacy and was elected to the city council in may.
following his april letter,bobzien confirmed his understanding of the relevant rules with his own inquiry to the virginia state bar.but unlike loftus hotline request,bobzien requested an informal advisory opinion from the standing committee.in particular,he asked the standing committee whether the rules prevent an assistant county attorney from continuing to represent a county board of supervisors upon becoming a member of the city council of a city with which the county has and will have ongoing business matters.in addition,he asked,if the rules did prevent an assistant county attorney from holding those two roles,whether the rules also prevent the other attorneys in the county attorney office from representing the county board in business matters with the city.in response,on may,the standing committee determined bobzien request did not present previously unresolved issues and stated that leo and leo are dispositive of your inquiry.
following loftus election to the city council,but before she was to take office,bobzien placed her on paid administrative leave.bobzien again explained that if loftus were to assume her position on the city council it would create a conflict of interest and that such conflict would be imputed to every attorney in th e county attorney office for the reasons identified by the standing committee and various leos.he also stated that her continued employment would violate fairfax county personnel regulation,which prohibits any county employee from holding any position that may have the effect of reducing the efficiency of such employee.nevertheless,loftus was sworn in as a member of the city council on june,in advance of the actual commencement of her term on july.consequently,bobzien terminated her employment with fairfax county effective june.
loftus filed a grievance in july challenging the grounds for her termination.loftus grievance first was heard internally,in the fairfax county attorney office,and she was denied reinstatement.loftus eventually appealed her termination to the fairfax county civil service commission the commission.in march,the commission affirmed loftus termination,but also suggest ed that fairfax county determine whether there are any suitable,vacant county positions for which loftus is qualified.
in the meantime,loftus also challenged the grievance procedures used by the fairfax county attorney office before county executive edward long long.long affirmed the procedures used by the fairfax county attorney office.
after exhausting her administrative remedies,loftus filed this action in the district court,alleging she had been terminated solely because she had been elected to the city council and her termination was retaliatory,in violation of her first amendment rights as enforced by.in addition,she alleged her termination violated virginia code and fairfax county ordinance,both of which secure a public employee right to participate in certain political activities.loftus sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as in damages.
on bobzien motion the district court dismissed loftus complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim.as to her first amendment claim,the court ruled loftus termination due to a perceived conflict of interest did not violate her first amendment rights and distinguished her claim from one where an employee was terminated because she chose to run for office,because of any positions she espoused when running for office,or for being elected.the district court also dismissed her state law claims,concluding neither virginia code nor fairfax county ordinance created a private right of action.in addition,the court concluded that neither of those enactments actually protected the holding of a public office by a public employee.
loftus timely appealed the district court decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

loftus raises what we understand to be two first amendment arguments on appeal.first,loftus appears to contend that she has an unfettered and inherent first amendment right to hold public office,which was violated when bobzien terminated her employment.in addition,loftus posits that she prevails under pickering board of education,when her first amendment rights,whatever they may be,are balanced against the concerns of her employer.loftus arguments blend together to a degree,and,by necessity,our analysis of those arguments is duplicative in some regards 
loftus initially contends the termination of her employment violated her first amendment right to hold elected office although we have never recognized a first amendment right to hold elected office,we need not decide whether such a right exists to resolve this case.as a lengthy jurisprudential history makes clear,public employees who desire to hold elected office face restrictions different from those faced by employees by virtue of the special trust and responsibilities of being a public employee.this is particularly true for who are public employees,as they are further bound by the ethical requirements of their profession.
seventy years ago,the supreme court affirmed that a may circumscribe the rights of its employees to engage in political activity.see united pub.workers of am.mitchell.as the court put it then,a police officer may have a constitutional right to talk politics,but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman.id.at quoting mcauliffe new bedford,holmes.since that time,the court has consistently approved various restrictions on a wide array of political activity by public employees,including running for or holding public office.see id.at upholding federal statute barring federal employees from taking any active part in political management or in political campaigns see also broadrick oklahoma,upholding state statute that barred public employees from,among other things,becoming candidate s for nomination or election to any paid public office.
in so doing,the court has deferred to the reasoned judgment of the legislative body or government entity charged with making determinations about the intersection of public employment and elected office.see,civil serv.comm ass of letter carriers,congress and the president are responsible for an efficient public service.if,in their judgment,efficiency may be best obtained by prohibiting active participation by classified employees in politics we see no constitutional objection.for example,in letter carriers,the supreme court upheld a federal statute that prohibited civil service employees from becoming partisan candidate s for,or campaigning for,an elective public office.id.at.recognizing the right to participate in political activities is not absolute,the court upheld the restriction based upon four key principles it helped ensure the unbiased administration of the law,avoided the appearance of impropriety,preserved government employment and prevented corruption,and ensured the independence of all government employees.id.at.
later,in clements fashing,the court upheld two provisions of the texas constitution of similar effect to that at issue under the federal statute in letter carriers.the first provision in controversy in clements barred elected judicial officers from seeking election to the state legislature during his or her term.id.at.by operation of the second provision,any elected judicial officer who declared his or her candidacy for the legislature was automatically deemed to resign from the office then held.id.the court upheld these provisions under the same test announced in letter carriers.in particular,the court concluded that the state interest in the principles articulated in letter carriers was sufficient to warrant the de minimis interference with any public employee interest in candidacy.id.at.
any infringement of a public employee first amendment rights caused by the provisions were de minimis,the court reasoned,because t hey limit neither political contributions nor expenditures.they do not preclude candidates from holding an office in a political party.in addition,they allow candidates to distribute campaign literature and make speeches on behalf of a candidate.id.at.thus,because texas and automatic resignation provisions constrained any right to seek and hold elected office only in a circumscribed way they were in reality no different than the provisions upheld in letter carriers.id.
following the supreme court lead,the courts of appeals have likewise accorded state and local governments wide latitude in regulating public employees exercise of any first amendment right to pursue,much less hold,elected office.see,claussen pence,cir.upholding indiana law,similar to that at issue in clements phillips city of dallas,cir.upholding a provision of the dallas city charter,which provided that any city employee who ran for partisan elected office within a county in which the city is located,or in another county within the state,having contractual relations with the city,was automatically deemed to have resigned from his office bilandic,cir.upholding an illinois supreme court policy that prohibited all judicial employees from becom ing a candidate for nomination,or election to,or accept ing appointment to any public office fletcher marino,cir.upholding a new york law prohibiting employees of local school boards from also serving on those school boards wachsman city of dallas,cir.upholding a provision of the dallas city charter prohibiting city employees from participating in political activities otten schicker,cir.upholding a louis police department rule prohibiting officers from becoming candidates for elected office these courts have uniformly upheld reasonable restrictions on the rights of public employees to participate in elective politics,including restrictions on running for nonpartisan office.
against that background,loftus claim must fail.although loftus contends her termination was in violation of the first amendment,the supreme court has made clear that public employers may permissibly bar their employees from participating in a wide array of political activities,including running for elective office.if a public employee can be prohibited from running for office,it follows all the more strongly that she also can be barred from holding elective office while remaining a public employee.in large part,the constitutional questions raised by this case are resolved by clements.if the and automatic resignation provisions of the texas constitution which stripped certain public employees of their office upon declaring their candidacy for the state legislature pass muster under the first amendment,surely the termination of loftus employment only after her election to the city council survives first amendment scrutiny.
loftus attempts to differentiate her situation from the principles represented in clements or letter carriers in two ways.neither has merit.first,loftus contends this case demands a different result because she ran for city council in a municipality different from the one that employed her.on the circumstances of this case,however,we do not believe loftus different municipality proposition carries any weight.see phillips,at upholding the dallas resign to run law,which covered city employees seeking public office in any county that had a contractual relationship with the city.the principles illustrated in letter carriers and clements on avoiding conflicts of interest,or even the appearance of impropriety,do not appear to require that either an actual or potential conflict of interest exist in fact in order for restrictions on political activity of public employees to apply consonant with the first amendment.but even if we were to assume such an actual or potential conflict were required,one exists in this case.
the record reflects multiple potential points of conflict that could face loftus as a member of the city council and an attorney in the fairfax county attorney office.as the leos from the standing committee illustrate,it is not simply loftus status as a public employee that creates a problem,but particularly her status as a lawyer for a public law firm.that role appears to create conflicts of interest not simply limiting loftus under her ethical duties as a lawyer,but imposing significant burdens on her public employer.
moreover,loftus is unable to point to any appellate authority to suggest that,all else being equal,her employment by a different municipality should be a dispositive factor in our analysis.in fact,she can muster only two district court cases to support her position,both of which are factually inapposite and of no precedential value.see segars fulton,supp.hickman city of dallas,supp.neither case involves an attorney representing one municipality while also running for office in another municipality to which her client potentially will be adverse in the future.
second,loftus argues her situation is different than that examined in letter carriers and clements because the city council is.but as we have already noted,any distinction is immaterial,particularly where a potential conflict of interest exists.the evils underlying the rule in letter carriers such human traits as personal ambition,greed,fear,and the like are made no less harmful merely because they may be brought about by political pressures generated in a nonpartisan,rather than a partisan,political context.wachsman,at.as the fifth circuit observed 
if police officer smith is best suited for a promotion vacancy,but the promotion goes instead to officer jones,who is not qualified for the position,because jones helped in the mayor reelection campaign by soliciting campaign contributions from the businesses and residents on his beat while smith,whose personal preference was the mayor opponent,refused to do so,does it make any difference whether the campaign was partisan or nonpartisan will not the injuries to the efficiency of the police force and its morale,and to the rights of officer smith,be fully as grievous in the one case as in the other will not the confidence of the public be just as undermined have not the citizens on officer jones beat been just as imposed on by being solicited by the very governmental employee to whom,day in and day out,they must look for both effective police protection and for evenhanded,reasonable enforcement of the laws regulating their own conduct 
thus,we find no merit to loftus contention that she has a first amendment right distinguishable from those considered in letter carriers and clements.
in the alternative,loftus frames bobzien termination of her employment as a violation of her first amendment right to comment on matters of public concern,a right recognized by the supreme court in pickering.loftus thus contends we must balance her interest as a citizen in commenting on matters of public concern against the interest of the county,as her employer,in promoting efficiency of the public services it performs.connick myers.that balancing,however,is of no assistance to loftus.
many cases,including letter carriers,discuss pickering balancing,and can be explained,at least in part,by that analysis.letter carriers,at see also phillips,at concluding letter carriers supplants pickering in cases involving a public employee right to seek and hold elected office.for example,the letter carriers court expressly relied on the pickering balancing test in upholding the federal law at issue,stating we think the balance congress has so far struck is sustainable by the obviously important interests sought to be served by the limitations on partisan political activities now contained in the statute.letter carriers,at.later,the fifth circuit reasoned that the same interests that supported the federal law in letter carriers certainly supported the constitutionality of a provision of the city of dallas charter,which prohibited city employees from running for any elected office.phillips,
