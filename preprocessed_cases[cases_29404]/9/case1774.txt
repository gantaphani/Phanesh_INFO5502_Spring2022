opinion of the court 
in this disability discrimination case under the rehabilitation act,the principal issue on appeal is whether the commonwealth of pennsylvania waived its sovereign immunity by accepting certain federal funds for the department of corrections.we will reverse in part and affirm in part.
in october,george koslow was hired by the pennsylvania department of corrections as a water treatment plant supervisor for the state correctional institute in graterford,pennsylvania,a state prison receiving federal funds under the state criminal alien assistance program scaap.on june,koslow injured his lower back loading salt bags into industrial water softener,then reinjured his back performing the same task in september and november.on each occasion koslow notified human resources department of his condition,requesting relief from lifting the salt bags and walking stairs.on june,after an investigation,officials informed koslow he either had to return to work at full duty or be placed on workers compensation leave.koslow chose the former,remaining in a position at work that required stair climbing.on february,he was dismissed for being unable to perform essential functions of his job 
koslow alleged the commonwealth of pennsylvania and superintendent donald vaughn collectively,the commonwealth defendants refused to accommodate his disability,violating the americans with disabilities act ada,et,the rehabilitation act,et,and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.stat.ann.et.koslow also alleged phico services and compservices,his past and present worker compensation administrators,had wrongfully processed his compensation claims he sought reinstatement and damages.
the district court granted summary judgment to phico and compservices on koslow phra and ada claims,finding that as agents of koslow employers,they played no decisionmaking role regarding koslow employment.the district court stayed the remainder of koslow action pending resolution of board of trustees of the university of alabama garrett,d,then before the united states supreme court,which held congress abrogation of states eleventh amendment immunity under title i of the ada was invalid.id.at.
with the benefit of garrett and after further briefing,the district court granted the commonwealth defendants motions for summary judgment on koslow ada claims.the district court found neither the ada nor the rehabilitation act abrogated the commonwealth sovereign immunity.it also held the commonwealth defendants had not waived sovereign immunity on the rehabilitation act claims.therefore,koslow could not state valid title i claims against the department of corrections under either statute.nor,the district court found,could koslow pursue injunctive relief against superintendent vaughn under title i of the ada.after disposing of koslow title i claims,the district court also dismissed koslow claim under title ii of the ada.the latter claim is not pursued on appeal as noted,the district court had already dismissed koslow phra claims against phico and compservices,holding they had played no decisionmaking role.this appeal focuses solely on koslow rehabilitation act claims against the commonwealth defendants,his title i claim for injunctive relief under the ada against superintendent vaughn,and his phra claims against phico and compservices.
the district court had jurisdiction over koslow federal claims under and and supplemental jurisdiction on his state law claims under.we have jurisdiction under.
certain background information on the federal fiscal connection to the pennsylvania department of corrections,koslow employer,is essential here.the commonwealth of pennsylvania receives federal funds for various designated purposes.from november through february,at least federal grants were provided to the pennsylvania department of corrections the commonwealth identifies of those federal grants as programs with multiple years of funding.one such multiple year program is the state criminal alien assistance program,originally established to alleviate costs states incur when illegal aliens commit state crimes and are imprisoned in state correctional facilities.despite its stated purpose,funds received under scaap are not necessarily directed by the department of corrections toward costs for imprisoned illegal aliens.nor need the department of corrections track these funds or report to the federal government where the funds are allocated.june.
the record demonstrates the commonwealth of pennsylvania accepted federal funds under scaap in,and,the relevant dates of this litigation.the parties stipulated the commonwealth disbursed all of those funds to the department of corrections despite the stipulation,the exact amount of the federal contribution under scaap to the department of corrections or to is not part of the record.
the most difficult issue in this appeal is whether the commonwealth defendants waived their sovereign immunity to suit on koslow federal rehabilitation act claims.there are three related,yet separate and independent,the commonwealth acceptance of scaap funds means it waived its eleventh amendment immunity for rehabilitation act suits against a department receiving those funds whether the rehabilitation act,especially,imposes an unconstitutional condition on the commonwealth receipt of federal funds and whether the rehabilitation act is valid legislation under the spending clause.we exercise plenary review over these questions of law,blanciak allegheny ludlum,cir,and,more generally,over the grant of summary judgment.doe county of centre,cir.
the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution provides 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
const.amend.xi.the eleventh amendment does not explicitly apply to cases that do not involve citizens of another state or citizens or subjects of any foreign state.see seminole tribe of florida,d the text of the amendment would appear to restrict only the article iii diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts.but as the supreme court has held for over a century,see hans louisiana,the eleventh amendment confirms a broader background principle of state sovereign immunity.seminole tribe,at.
as developed,the eleventh amendment provides states with immunity not only from suits brought by citizens of other states,but also from suits brought by their own citizens.hans,at.recent cases have emphasized the eleventh amendment embodiment of this common law doctrine,alden maine,d aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d declaring the eleventh amendment a fundamental constitutional protection rooted in a recognition that the states,although a union,maintain certain attributes of sovereignty,including sovereign immunity and respect owed them as members of the federation.
but a state eleventh amendment protection from federal brought by citizens of their state or not absolute.two established exceptions to the eleventh amendment bar permit individuals to sue states.coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.first,congress may authorize such a suit under its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment enacted after the eleventh amendment and specifically designed to alter the balance.id.citing fitzpatrick bitzer,d.under this exception,congress abrogates a state sovereign immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and act s pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.garrett,at.quoting kimel bd.of regents,d.second,a state may waive its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit.coll.sav.bank,at.citing clark barnard.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.of course,in addition,a person seeking purely prospective relief against state officials for ongoing violations of federal law may sue under the legal fiction of ex parte young,despite the text of the eleventh amendment.see alden,at.
at issue here is whether plaintiffs rehabilitation act claims fall within one of these exceptions.section of the rehabilitation act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded programs or activities no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the united states shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance a.in its definitional section,the statute provides 
for the purposes of this section,the term program or activity means all the operations of 
a a department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or local government or 
b the entity of such state or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency and each other state or local government agency to which the assistance is extended,in the case of assistance to a state or local government 
any part of which is extended federal financial assistance.
there have been many suits under the rehabilitation act against sovereign states.indeed,t he rehabilitation act has a long history of scrutiny under the eleventh amendment.nihiser ohio epa,cir.in atascadero state hospital,the supreme court held that despite the language of,it was not sufficiently clear that congress intended states receipt of federal funds under the statute to constitute a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.at.finding the act fell far short of manifesting a clear intent to condition participation in the programs funded under the act on a state consent to waive its constitutional immunity.the next year,congress amended to provide specifically that a state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment of the constitution of the united states from suit in federal court for a violation of section of the rehabilitation act of a.
in its sovereign immunity analysis,the district court rejected the possibility that congress had validly abrogated the commonwealth immunity under the fourteenth amendment.the district court held the amendment to the rehabilitation act represented an unequivocal express ion of congress desire to abrogate states immunity.op.at.but this factor alone,the court held,was insufficient to abrogate the department of corrections immunity under the eleventh amendment 
the second part of the test for abrogation,however,is congruence and proportionality that is,whether congress has identified a pattern of discrimination by the states which violates the fourteenth amendment,and whether the remedy imposed by congress is congruent and proportional to the targeted violation.garrett.at.no specific unconstitutional conduct by the states was identified by congress,and therefore must fall victim to the same fate that has lately befallen other antidiscrimination statutes insofar as they are applied to the states.
the district court then considered whether the commonwealth had waived its sovereign immunity by consenting to suit.the district court rejected this possibility as well 
the only way that plaintiff can assert a claim under,then,is if the commonwealth of pennsylvania has waived its sovereign immunity.it clearly has not done so explicitly,as there is no legislation that can be so construed.in order for pennsylvania to have implicitly waived its immunity by accepting federal funds,the conditions on the grant of money must be unambiguously expressed by congress.congress must also be specific a general authorization does not suffice as plaintiff does not argue that there is any connection between federal funds received by the state and his rehabilitation act claim,i hold that the commonwealth of pennsylvania has not waived its sovereign immunity in this case.
op.at.in reaching this result,the district court endorsed the dissenting opinion in jim united states,cir en banc bowman,dissenting,which required a nexus between the purposes of the federal funding and the conditions placed on their receipt.op.at.
we reserve consideration on the abrogation issue.but we disagree with the able district court conclusions on the commonwealth waiver of sovereign immunity.the supreme court has recognized of the rehabilitation act,following the amendment,to be an unambiguous waiver of the state eleventh amendment immunity.lane pena,d.as noted,the amendment was enacted in response to the supreme court decision in atascadero state hospital scanlon,d,which held that mere receipt of federal funds was insufficient to constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity to rehabilitation act claims.id.at.the atascadero state hospital court stated that if a statute manifest s a clear intent to condition participation in the programs funded under the act on a state waiver of its constitutional immunity,federal courts would have jurisdiction over claims against states accepting federal funds.id.at.
it appears that congress responded to the supreme court direction.section of the rehabilitation act as amended,represents a clear intention,as mandated by atascadero state hospital.enacting the amendment to,congress put states on notice that by accepting federal funds under the rehabilitation act,they would waive their eleventh amendment immunity to rehabilitation act claims accord united states dep t of transp.paralyzed veterans of,d under title vi,title ix,and,congress enters into an arrangement in the nature of a contract with the recipients of the funds the recipient acceptance of the funds triggers coverage under the nondiscrimination provision.in lane,the supreme court recognized the care with which congress responded to our decision in atascadero by crafting an unambiguous waiver of the states eleventh amendment immunity.at.
six other courts of appeals have found under the plain language of the amended rehabilitation act statute that accepting federal funds results in a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity for the program or agency receiving the funds.nihiser,at jim,at stanley litscher,cir pederson,cir sandoval hagan,cir,rev on other grounds,d litman george mason,cir clark california,cir.we agree with their conclusions.
under the statutory definitions in the rehabilitation act,the state,as a whole,can not be a program or activity.as other courts have noted,if the entire state government were subject to whenever one of its components received federal funds,subsection b b would be redundant.see jim,at noting that under the flawed interpretation,both the distributing and receiving state entities would already be covered under b a whenever either receives federal funds lightbourn county of el paso,cir schroeder city of chicago,cir.but state departments or agencies receiving federal funds,like the pennsylvania department of corrections,qualify under the relevant statutory definition.b a.
therefore,if a state accepts federal funds for a specific department or agency,it voluntarily waives sovereign immunity for rehabilitation act claims against the department or only against that department or agency.see coll.sav.bank,at.describing these determinations as stringent,in part because of the eleventh amendment important federal purpose see also jim,at 
to avoid the effect of section the state would be required to sacrifice federal funds only for that department.this requirement is comparable to the ordinary quid pro quo that the supreme court has repeatedly approved the state is offered federal funds for some activities,but in return,it is required to meet certain federal requirements in carrying out those activities.

in this sense,the scope of the eleventh amendment immunity waiver directly correlates to the state department or agency receiving federal financial assistance.the commonwealth of pennsylvania arguably could limit its waiver by foregoing certain federal funds.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit explained 
a state and its instrumentalities can avoid section waiver requirement on a piecemeal basis,by simply accepting federal funds for some departments and declining them for others.the state is accordingly not required to renounce all federal funding to shield chosen state agencies from compliance with section.
jim,at.but the rehabilitation act definition of program or activity sweeps all the operations of a department or agency receiving federal financial assistance under the act coverage.b.although a particular activity,scaap or the conduct of that activity,funding inmate educational programs might be the state only link to federal funds,the waiver under is structural.it applies to all the operations of the department or agency receiving federal funds,the pennsylvania department of corrections.
a state waiver of sovereign immunity is not lightly granted.the supreme court has cautioned in deciding whether a state has waived its constitutional protection under the eleventh amendment,we will find waiver only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.edelman jordan,d quoting murray wilson distilling.mere participation in a federal program is not sufficient to waive immunity.id.at.but where a state participates in a federal financial assistance program in light of the existing state of the law,the state is charged with awareness that accepting federal funds can result in the waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.in lane,the supreme court said represents the most express language of waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.at.the commonwealth of pennsylvania could reasonably expect that providing federal funds to the department of corrections could lead to the waiver of eleventh amendment immunity against rehabilitation act claims.accord stanley,at t he ada and the rehabilitation act are identical for purposes of.but the rehabilitation act also is a condition on the receipt of federal funds t he rehabilitation act is enforceable in federal court against recipients of federal largess.
as noted,the district court relied on the dissenting opinion from jim in rejecting koslow claim.the en banc court of appeals for the eighth circuit in jim rejected this analysis,holding,congress may require a waiver of state sovereign immunity as a condition for receiving federal funds,even though congress could not order the waiver directly.at.we agree 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania accepted federal financial assistance under scaap,and provided these federal funds to the department of corrections.therefore,the commonwealth of pennsylvania waived immunity for claims against its department of corrections under the rehabilitation act.like the majority of courts that have considered the issue,we hold the commonwealth acceptance of rehabilitation act funds falls under the second recognized exception to eleventh amendment immunity 
the commonwealth defendants also urge affirmance on two related grounds.first,they contend the provisions placed on their receipt of rehabilitation act funds constitute unconstitutional conditions,requiring a surrender of constitutionally protected rights.frost frost trucking comm n.t he state may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights it is inconceivable that the guaranties embedded in the constitution of the united states may thus be manipulated out of existence.because the federal government is not required to provide states with funds does not mean it may condition distributions on arguably unconstitutional grounds,speiser randall,d the government may not act indirectly to produce a result which it could not command directly.we exercise plenary review.
the constitutionally protected right the commonwealth defendants contend they must sacrifice upon accepting federal funds is their eleventh amendment immunity from suits under the rehabilitation act.the commonwealth defendants draw analogies to select dated unconstitutional conditions cases when the supreme court struck down states attempts to force certain litigants to waive immunity from suit in state court.barron burnside.as the iowa statute makes the right to a permit dependent on the surrender by the foreign corporation of a privilege secured to it by the constitution and laws of the united states,the statute requiring the permit must be held to be void.home ins.morse,wall.the constitution of the united states secures to citizens of another state than that in which suit is brought an absolute right to remove their cases into the federal court upon compliance with the terms of the act of.the statute of wisconsin is an obstruction to this right,is repugnant to the constitution of the united states and the laws in pursuance thereof,and is illegal and void.
more recently,the supreme court held congress may condition the receipt of federal funds on a state relinquishment of certain immunities,alden,at.the federal government does not lack the authority or means to seek the states voluntary consent to private suits coll.sav.bank,at.allowing congress to condition the exercise of an article i power on a state agreement to relinquish eleventh amendment immunity.the eleventh amendment issue the commonwealth defendants now raise was not precisely before the supreme court in alden or college savings bank nonetheless,we believe conditioning federal funds on the waiver of sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment is not unconstitutional per se.the unconstitutional conditions doctrine is based on the proposition that government incentives may be inherently coercive.see frost frost trucking,at.in reality,the carrier is given no choice,except a choice between the rock and the option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood or submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden.but the supreme court has not yet applied the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to cases between two sovereigns.unlike private persons,states have the resources to serve their citizens even if the federal government,through economic incentives,encourages a particular result.new york united states,d where the recipient of federal funds is a state,as is not unusual today,the conditions attached to the funds by congress may influence a state legislative choices.dole,at.congress could influence states authority over the legal drinking age because w ere south dakota to succumb to the blandishments offered by congress and raise its drinking age to,the state action in so doing would not violate the constitutional rights of anyone.a state political the least of which is the power to levy taxes on its ensure the federal government does not coerce the state through economic encouragement.an individual citizen,in contrast,lacks these formidable institutional resources.
as noted,the commonwealth could avoid claims against the department of corrections by declining all federal funds to the department of corrections.though this sacrifice would doubtless result in some fiscal possibly political is a free and deliberate choice by the commonwealth that does not rise to the level of an unconstitutional condition.the commonwealth remains free to make the choice it may decline federal aid to the department of corrections,but having accepted the federal funds,it is bound by conditions of the rehabilitation act.by accepting scaap funds,the commonwealth opens the department of corrections to suits under the rehabilitation act.for these reasons,we reject the contention that the receipt of federal funds constitutes surrender of eleventh amendment immunity and is therefore an unconstitutional condition.
the commonwealth defendants also maintain the conditions placed on the receipt of rehabilitation act funds are so unrelated to the purpose of the federal funds as to violate the spending clause.const.art.i,cl.specifically,the commonwealth defendants suggest the federal government interest in particular programs or projects of the department of corrections is too attenuated from the general waiver of immunity respecting rehabilitation act claims.we exercise plenary review over this question of law.
federal statutes are presumed constitutional.reno condon,d union pac.united states,otto.nevertheless,congress spending power is subject to certain restrictions.united states butler.spending clause legislation must pursue the general welfare impose unambiguous conditions on states,so they can exercise choices knowingly and with awareness of the consequences impose conditions related to federal interests in the program and not induce unconstitutional action.dole,at.
the district court found no connection between rehabilitation act funds received by the department of corrections and koslow discrimination claim on appeal,the commonwealth defendants contend an eleventh amendment waiver must be specifically tailored to a particular federal interest.because koslow has purportedly failed to demonstrate a federal interest in scaap funds received by the pennsylvania department of corrections,the commonwealth defendants contend is demonstrably unconstitutional under the spending clause.jim,at bowman,dissenting quotation and citation omitted.
we disagree.the supreme court in dole declined to define the outer parameters of the germaneness or relatedness limitation on the imposition of conditions under the spending power.at.therefore,one need only identify a discernible relationship imposed by a rehabilitation act condition on a department or agency and a federal interest in a program it funds.through the rehabilitation act,congress has expressed a clear interest in eliminating discrimination in state departments or agencies.alexander choate,d.that interest,which is undeniably significant and clearly reflected in the legislative history,flows with every dollar spent by a department or agency receiving federal funds.the waiver of the commonwealth immunity from rehabilitation act claims by department of corrections employees furthers that interest directly.
moreover,governs only a program or activity receiving federal funds.to put it another way,the waiver of immunity conditioned on receipt of rehabilitation act funds applies on an,or a,basis.b this limitation helps ensure the waiver accords with the relatedness requirement articulated in dole.the commonwealth defendants accepted funds under scaap.rehabilitation act funds received by specific departments or agencies are not tracked.for our purposes,all funds received by the department of corrections under the rehabilitation act are fungible.it is virtually impossible to determine whether federal dollars paid for koslow salary or any benefits he received.hoxworth blinder,robinson,cir legally as well as economically,money is fungible.

for these reasons,koslow rehabilitation act claim against the pennsylvania department of corrections is not constitutionally barred.
we now turn to koslow claims under the ada for prospective relief against superintendent vaughn the district court found koslow could not bring these claims against vaughn in either his individual or his official capacity because the ada does not contemplate such individual,or supervisor,liability.op.at.before reaching this conclusion,however,the district court cited a footnote from garrett,in which the supreme court said 
our holding here that congress did not validly abrogate the states sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under title i does not mean that persons with disabilities have no federal recourse against discrimination.title i of the ada still prescribes standards applicable to the states.those standards can be enforced by the united states in actions for money damages,as well as by private individuals in actions for injunctive relief under ex parte young.
at.the district court then concluded,more significant is the fact that even were i to read the second amended complaint to plead an ada claim explicitly against superintendent vaughn,there is no individual,or supervisor,liability under the ada.op.at.we will first consider the statutory issue before turning to the constitutional argument.we exercise plenary review over both.
title i of the ada,incorporating the enforcement scheme of the civil rights act of,authorizes private injunctive suits against a respondent,defined by statute to include an employer.n,f g.the district court analysis focused on whether there is individual or supervisor liability under the statute.but both title i and title vii define employer to include persons engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has or more employees and any agent of such person.b,a.state governments can constitute employers under the statute as the supreme court held in garrett 
title i of t he ada prohibits certain employers,including the states,from discriminat ing against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms conditions,and privileges of employment.
at.citations omitted.and for the same reasons that we have allowed title vii claims to proceed against public officials in their official capacities,an official sued in his official capacity is an agent of the state employer under title i of the ada.in re montgomery county,cir allowing officials in their official capacities to be held liable under title vii.
while there appears to be no individual liability for damages under title i of the ada,eeoc aic sec.investigations,cir,prospective relief against state officials acting in their official capacities may proceed under the statute.the complaint alleges misconduct by vaughn only as an official supervisor at.therefore,under the statute,insofar as koslow seeks prospective injunctive relief,he states a cognizable claim against superintendent vaughn,but only in his his.
the parties also dispute whether koslow ada prospective claim for injunctive relief against superintendent vaughn is barred by the eleventh amendment.seminole tribe,at.said another way,the parties disagree whether the ex parte young doctrine applies in the first instance.as noted,the eleventh amendment bars private suits against a state sued in its own name except in certain narrow circumstances.alden,at.but the supreme court has said,both prospective and retrospective relief implicate eleventh amendment concerns,but the availability of prospective relief of the sort awarded in ex parte young gives life to the supremacy clause.remedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law.green mansour,d.
the commonwealth defendants contend the eleventh amendment only permits suits against officials in their individual capacities,barring suits against officials in their representative capacities absent waiver or abrogation.we disagree.the eleventh amendment has not been interpreted to bar a plaintiff ability to seek prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.suits are an alternative way to plead actions against entities for which an officer is an agent.see kentucky graham,d 
unless a state has waived its eleventh amendment immunity or congress has overridden it,however,a state can not be sued directly in its own name regardless of the relief sought.thus,implementation of state policy or custom may be reached in federal court only because actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the state.

three other courts of appeals have allowed suits for purely injunctive relief under the ada against state officials.see carten kent,cir a n official who violates title ii of the ada does not represent the state for purposes of the eleventh amendment,yet he or she nevertheless may be held responsible in an official capacity for violating title ii of the ada,which by its terms applies only to public entit ies.gibson.of,cir the eleventh amendment is not a bar to federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to end a continuing violation of federal law.quotations and citations omitted roe ogden,cir.in a different context,we have said,the principle which emerges from young and its progeny is that a state official sued in his official capacity for prospective injunctive relief is a person within section,and the eleventh amendment does not bar such a suit.hindes fdic,cir.
for these reasons,federal ada claims for prospective injunctive relief against state officials are authorized by the ex parte young doctrine.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit analysis in gibson is apposite.in that case,the court found seminole tribe,on which the commonwealth defendants rely,dealt with a markedly different statute than the ada,the indian gaming regulatory act igra.at unlike the igra,the court found there were several enforcement mechanisms for plaintiffs to sue under titles i or ii of the ada.id.at noting all remedies of title vii of the civil rights act of,including equitable orders and contempt proceedings,are applicable to ada title i plaintiffs.second,unlike the igra,congress chose to use existing civil rights enforcement mechanisms when drafting the ada.id.in doing so,congress was aware that federal district courts had issued orders compelling state officials to perform their statutory obligations.id.at.third,the court noted,a single state official can enforce an ada provision,while complying with the igra requires cooperative efforts by state negotiators and ratification by the state legislature.id.considering all of these factors,the court held,the ada is a more suitable candidate than igra for ex parte young suits designed to change the behavior of specific government officials.id.
when the relief sought is prospective injunctive relief,the request is ordinarily sufficient to invoke the young fiction.idaho coeur tribe,d.koslow claim for reinstatement,with accommodations for his disability,is the type of injunctive,relief cognizable under ex parte young.therefore,he can state federal claims under the ada against superintendent vaughn,acting in his official capacity,for prospective injunctive relief.
next,we consider whether the district court properly granted summary judgment to phico and compservices on koslow claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act.the district court found these workers compensation providers had no decisionmaking authority over koslow employment 
they did not fire plaintiff or refuse him an accommodation.phico ceased to be involved in any way after december,and it is not at all clear that plaintiff is complaining about anything that occurred during phico tenure.the only act attributable to compservices is its referral of plaintiff to an independent medical examination i t is ludicrous to suppose that by furnishing to the commonwealth defendants the information that plaintiff was fit to return to work,compservices was discriminating against him 
op.at.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.doe,at 
from to,under agreements with the commonwealth of pennsylvania,phico was the administrator for some portions of the commonwealth workers compensation plans.phico maintains that these services were primarily ministerial,such as forwarding information received from health care providers to the department of corrections,calculating sums correctional facilities owed in benefits,and the like.for these services,phico was paid a flat rate.
phico vice president of claims operations testified the company compensation contracts applied only to phico employees,not to commonwealth employees.koslow contends a jury was entitled to test the credibility of this statement,rendering summary judgment inappropriate.moreover,koslow suggests genuine issues of material fact remain whether phico nonfeasance on his claim contributed to a breakdown in the interactive process between koslow and,which itself might constitute a violation of the ada.
we disagree.the district court correctly concluded phico had no responsibility for ensuring compliance with the ada and the rehabilitation act.only administrators,not phico administrators,could determine whether koslow,if disabled,could be accommodated.no material issues of fact remain unresolved on phico decisionmaking authority over koslow.
additionally,although the district court did not address this issue directly,we do not believe that under these facts,phico is a covered entity under the ada.only covered entities,as defined in a,may be liable under the statute.here,phico could be a proper defendant only as the agent of koslow employer.id.a.but in krouse american sterilizer,cir,we rejected an agency theory similar to koslow,holding that in the absence of evidence that a workers compensation administrator had harassed plaintiff at the direction of plaintiff employer,the administrator was not an agent of the employer and therefore was not a covered entity under the ada.id.at.as in krouse,koslow can not demonstrate phico acted at the direction of the pennsylvania department of corrections in wrongly denying his claim.
on december,compservices began providing workers compensation administration services for claims against accruing prior to july.koslow contends compservices,like phico,had contractual and statutory implicit to discriminate against employees.similar to his previous argument,koslow contends there is an issue of fact whether compservices obligations to comply with title ii of the ada extended to the employees of.
we disagree.compservices,which assumed responsibilities for the account in december,had,at most,only a minimal connection with koslow claim.like phico,compservices had no decisionmaking authority over koslow and had no role in the alleged discrimination.for the reasons noted,compservices is not a covered entity for ada purposes.
the district court correctly disposed of koslow ada claims against phico and compservices.
finally,we consider the dismissal of koslow state law claims against phico and compservices.the district court concluded these phra claims were not cognizable because the statute does not define employer to include an agent thereof 
the phra applies to any employer,but unlike the ada does not contain a reference to an agent thereof.since the phra does not define employer,courts look to the common law indicia of a relationship the employer power to control the nature and parameters of the employee activities is the key to the relationship i reject out of hand plaintiff contention that the supremacy clause requires the term employer as it is used in the phra not to be interpreted any more narrowly than it is defined in the ada or title vii.
we exercise plenary review over this question of law.
the phra defines person as includ ing one or more individuals,partnerships,associations,organizations,corporations and any agent thereof.a.koslow contends the phra defines person to include an agent,so phico and compservices,as alleged agents of the department of corrections,can be liable.we disagree.no pennsylvania authority supports koslow interpretation of the phra.in dici pennsylvania,cir,we said,the employment discrimination provision of the phra declares only that any employer may be liable.we have never said any person can be liable under the statute.see also van horn elbeco,wl,at.july,t he phra has no reference to agents of an employer in its definition of employer.additionally,under the phra,the per
