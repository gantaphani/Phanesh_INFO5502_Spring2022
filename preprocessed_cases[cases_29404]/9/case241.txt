in,angel luis feliciano hernández,a habitual offender with a record of sexual abuse and rape,was convicted of crimes and sentenced by a puerto rico court to a term of perpetual imprisonment for treatment until his rehabilitation,to last a minimum of twelve years.that minimum sentence ended in,and feliciano hernández was not released from prison until,fifteen years later.
on june,feliciano hernández brought suit in federal court under.the defendants are five named former secretaries of the puerto rico department of corrections and their spouses and conjugal partnerships,as well as five unnamed superintendents of prison facilities in the commonwealth,identified as john poe defendants.
the complaint alleged that the defendant officials had incarcerated feliciano hernández beyond the lawful term of his imprisonment,asserting that this violated the fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.the complaint sought compensatory damages in excess of million and punitive damages in excess of million.
on motion,the district court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants,in a thoughtful opinion and order,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see feliciano hernández pereira castillo,civ,wl.after the complaint was dismissed and judgment was entered on august,feliciano hernández on september,filed a motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint,purportedly under rules b and a.the district court denied the motion by a short opinion and order,feliciano hernández pereira castillo,civ,wl,and this appeal followed.
we hold that the complaint failed to state a claim under the pleading standard set forth by the supreme court in ashcroft iqbal,and bell atlantic twombly,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration,including denying leave to file a belated amended complaint.we affirm the dismissal.
the following facts are taken from feliciano hernández complaint of june,the opinion of the supreme court of puerto rico affirming his underlying conviction,people feliciano hernández,offic.trans,and the order of the puerto rico court of first instance regarding plaintiff petition for a puerto rico writ of habeas corpus,people feliciano hernández,crim.no.g of first instance.we treat as true the facts in the complaint.sec tambone,cir en banc.we also consider other puerto rico court documents on which plaintiff relied.
on april,a puerto rico court sentenced feliciano hernández for his convictions on two counts of committing lewd and indecent acts,laws ann.tit,two counts of aggravated restraint of liberty,id.and one count of unlawful carrying and use of a weapon,laws ann.tit,as the law then stood.feliciano hernández had also been charged with attempt to commit rape,but the court ordered acquittal of that count.the court took judicial notice of feliciano hernández two previous convictions for rape and one conviction each for repeated rape and for attempt to commit statutory rape.it sentenced him as a habitual offender to p erpetual imprisonment,for treatment until his social rehabilitation is accomplished and adjudged that the minimum imprisonment would be years.
we do not repeat the complaint allegations that feliciano hernández took steps while in prison to rehabilitate himself because they are not material to the ultimate issues in this case.we focus on the allegations which are pertinent to whether the individual defendants were ever given or put on adequate notice of the claims that feliciano hernández must be released under the terms of his original sentence,so as to support a claim of deliberate indifference to a violation of constitutional rights.
after his minimum sentence was completed in,the parole board reviewed feliciano hernández case annually,and each year it denied his request for parole.the complaint alleges that each year the parole board did not notify the administration of correction of the nature of the plaintiff sentence and of his rights to be released from imprisonment.feliciano hernández does not claim that he personally provided the department of corrections or any particular official with such notice.in he was reclassified to minimal custody status,which he maintained until his release.
in,feliciano hernández filed a pro se pleading with a puerto rico court requesting a writ of habeas corpus to secure his release.the court entered an order on june,requiring the department of corrections to explain the reasons for feliciano hernández continued incarceration in light of the april,judgment.the department of corrections opposed the habeas petition and informed the court that feliciano hernández case was before the parole board.the court denied the request for habeas relief.
on august,the parole board again denied feliciano hernández request for parole and again did not give the department of corrections notice of the nature of his sentence and his right to be released.
the complaint alleges,without subsidiary factual support,that during and unnamed employees of the department of corrections informed their unnamed supervisors of feliciano hernández unlawful incarceration and noted specifically that he had been imprisoned in excess of years,he had been in minimum custody for eight years,he did not require further therapy,and his work was uninterrupted and satisfactory.there is no allegation that any of the individual named or john poe defendants were so notified and there are no supporting facts as to any such notice.
feliciano hernández alleges that the department of corrections records indicated that he was imprisoned for rape or attempted rape,which adversely affected his evaluations,rights,and privileges during his incarceration.while he did have prior convictions for those crimes,which led to his categorization as a habitual offender,the offenses for which he was sentenced in did not themselves include rape or attempted rape.to address this mischaracterization issue,in feliciano hernández initiated pro se mandamus proceedings in the puerto rico court of first instance,moving the court to order the department of corrections to correct its records to show feliciano hernández was not incarcerated for rape or attempted rape.the court granted the petition and so ordered.there is no allegation that the department of corrections failed to comply with the court order.nor is there any allegation that feliciano hernández sought as relief release from prison or asserted any constitutional claim.in his federal complaint,feliciano hernández alleges,without further support,that the department of corrections nevertheless continued to deny him his rights and privileges under the reasoning that he had been sentenced to perpetual imprisonment.
feliciano hernández filed a petition for habeas corpus with the puerto rico court of first instance in mayagüez on may,that petition also did not assert any constitutional claim.instead,it evidently claimed that feliciano hernández had been rehabilitated and that annual evaluations of his progress toward rehabilitation had never taken place.on april,the court,after hearing testimony,accepted the recommendation of counsel and of the public ministry that feliciano hernández be transferred to a halfway house within thirty days,that he remain there for no less than six months and no longer than a year,and that he be referred to the pre release services to assist him with reintegration into the community.he was also ordered to register with the sexual offender registry and to complete special therapies for sexual offenders offered by the department.on june,by separate order,the department was ordered to immediately release feliciano hernández.
on june,feliciano hernández filed his complaint in federal district court.the complaint claims are premised on a theory of supervisory liability and allege violations of the eighth amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and of the fifth and fourteenth amendments due process clauses.this is the first time these defendants have ever had any federal constitutional claims asserted against them by the plaintiff.the complaint also includes supplemental claims under puerto rico law,which were dismissed without prejudice.
on september,former secretary laboy alvarado filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.she raised six arguments in the motion feliciano hernández claims were the official capacity claims were barred by the eleventh amendment the fifth amendment claims were inapplicable to her as a state actor abstention,under colorado river water conservation district united states,was required she was entitled to qualified immunity and the supplemental claims under puerto rico law should be dismissed as well.feliciano hernández filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on october.
on october,defendant rivera gonzález answered the complaint,asserting as an affirmative defense that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted,that the complaint failed to state specific acts on rivera gonzález part that could amount to a violation of feliciano hernández rights,and that rivera gonzález was not personally involved in any alleged violation of feliciano hernández rights.the plaintiff did not file any response to rivera gonzález answer 
on august,the district court entered an opinion and order in which it dismissed the complaint as to all of the defendants for failure to state a claim.feliciano hernández,wl,at.it did not reach laboy alvarado other arguments for dismissing the complaint.as said,the district court dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and dismissed the puerto rico law claims without prejudice.id.that same day the court entered final judgment in the case.
roughly two weeks later,feliciano hernández filed a motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint on september,and tendered his amended complaint that same day without having been given leave to do so.the amended complaint was tendered almost a year after laboy alvarado filed her motion to dismiss.the district court granted laboy alvarado and rivera gonzález joint motion to strike the amended complaint on september.on december,it entered an opinion and order denying feliciano hernández motion for reconsideration.feliciano hernández,wl.this timely appeal followed.
feliciano hernández appeals both the district court dismissal of his complaint and its denial of his motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint.we address each issue in turn.
dismissal of the complaint 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,accepting as true all facts,analyzing those facts in the light most hospitable to the plaintiff theory,and drawing all reasonable inferences for the plaintiff.new york amgen,cir quoting united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir.
we review the dismissal of the complaint in the context of the defendants assertion of their entitlement to qualified immunity and to dismissal under the supreme court decision in iqbal.the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and such right was clearly established at the time of the defendant s alleged violation s.maldonado fontanes,cir quoting pearson callahan.a right is clearly established only if it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.soto torres fraticelli,cir quoting brosseau haugen.qualified immunity provides defendant public officials an immunity from suit and not a mere defense to liability.maldonado,at.
the first prong of the immunity analysis requires that a plaintiff state a claim of violation of a constitutional right.id.at.in determining whether such a claim has been stated under iqbal,we first recognize that the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.iqbal.at.nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked assertion s devoid of further factual enhancement.id.alteration in original quoting twombly,at.
second,only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.id.at.determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.w here the facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,the complaint has alleged but it has not show n that the pleader is entitled to relief.id.second alteration in original quoting.a.
feliciano hernández complaint fails under iqbal to plead adequately that the individual defendants violated his constitutional rights and so fails the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.as such,he necessarily fails the second prong as well an objectively reasonable public official situated as defendants would not be on notice of violations of any constitutional rights.
the named defendants are very officials,each of whom,as secretary of the department of corrections,had vast responsibilities.the secretary oversees many correctional institutions,hundreds of employees,and thousands of prisoners.for example,in,the prison population was approximately.morales feliciano roselló gonzález,civ,slip op.at.there are prison complexes in,among other places,bayamón,vega alta,guayama,and ponce.see morales feliciano acevedo vila,civ,wl,at,see also morales feliciano romero barcelo,in,the department of corrections administered institutions at san juan,río piedras,bayamón,arecibo,aguadilla,ponce,guayama,humacao,vega alta,and miramar,in addition to agricultural camps and halfway houses.the unnamed john poe defendants are also officials,being directors of individual correctional facilities.
the supreme court has held that g overnment officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior.iqbal.a supervisor may not be held liable for the constitutional violations committed by his or her subordinates,unless there is an affirmative link between the behavior of a subordinate and the action or inaction of his supervisor such that the supervisor conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.soto torres,at omission in original quoting maldonado,at.additionally,the plaintiff must show that the official had actual or constructive notice of the constitutional violation.rodríguez garcía miranda marín,cir,cert.denied.quoting rodriguez garcia municipality of caguas,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the complaint sets forth a series of conclusions.it alleges that i n keeping the plaintiff confined beyond the term of his sentence,each defendant acted with deliberate indifference reckless disregard of the plaintiff eighth amendment rights and due process of law and that e ach defendant unjustifiabl y deprived plaintiff of liberty in violation of his eighth amendment rights and due process of law.the complaint states as to each of the defendants that he or she is being sued on the basis of his or her deliberate indifference reckless disregard of the plaintiff rights.it alleges among other conclusions that the defendants failed in their duty to assure adequate monitoring,disciplining,evaluating,training and supervising any and all personnel under their charge,to assure that all inmates were properly classified and released upon completion of their sentence.it relatedly alleges that h ad the defendants complied with their supervisory duties,they would have identified those employees that did not properly register the plaintiff classification and inaccurately categorized the crimes for which he had been sentenced.none of these conclusory allegations suffice to establish a claim.
these are exactly the sort of unadorned,accusation s that both we and the supreme court have found insufficient.iqbal.at.indeed,in sanchez pereira castillo,cir,we held that such allegations failed to state a claim against puerto rico administrative correctional defendants,most of whom were at a lower level than the secretary.we dismissed the claims against those defendants because they did little more than assert a legal conclusion about the involvement of the administrative correctional defendants in the underlying constitutional violation and simply p arrot ed our standard for supervisory liability in the context of section.id.at.
in other cases after iqbal,we have repeatedly held that similarly broad allegations against government officials fail to state a claim.see soto torres,at allegations against fbi special agent in charge of field office insufficient under iqbal because complaint failed to allege facts showing defendant had knowledge of alleged violations of constitutional rights leavitt corr.med,cir regional medical director of correctional medical services in maine can not be held responsible for the conduct of his subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior peñalbert rosa fortuño burset,cir allegations against governor insufficient under iqbal because complaint failed to allege facts showing governor participated in violation of constitutional rights maldonado,at allegations against mayor insufficient under iqbal because complaint failed to allege facts showing an affirmative link between mayor and alleged violations of constitutional rights.
there are a number of other specific deficiencies in the complaint.we start and end with the failure to plead that any of the named defendants,each a former secretary of the department of corrections,had any individual notice that plaintiff incarceration beyond was a violation of his constitutional rights,much less that there was an affirmative link to them or that they were deliberately indifferent to those notices of alleged violations of his rights.actual or constructive knowledge of a rights violation is a prerequisite for stating any claim.see rodríguez garcía,at lipsett of,cir an important factor in making the determination of liability is whether the official was put on some kind of notice of the alleged violations,for one can not make a deliberate or conscious choice to act or not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires the taking of affirmative steps.citation omitted quoting pembaur city of cincinnati.
there are two main strands to feliciano hernández allegations that the individual secretaries were on notice of his allegedly unconstitutional confinement and a constitutional imperative to release him.the first is his general allegation that d uring and,department of corrections employees informed their supervisors of the plaintiff unlawful incarceration.this allegation fails to state who these employees were,what the information was,who the supervisors were to whom these employees made such a report,and whether and how such information made it to the defendants,or why his confinement violated constitutional requirements as opposed to any claims under state law.it fails under iqbal.
the second strand is focused on the notice purportedly given to the named defendants by various court proceedings,some involving plaintiff personally and some not.as to the latter,feliciano hernández argues that laboy alvarado was put on notice of the alleged violations of his rights by an unrelated case in which the district court had held that laboy alvarado had been aware of other constitutional deficiencies in the puerto rico prison system,including those related to the classification of inmates.see morales feliciano,civ.that case concerned prison conditions,such as health care,use of force,security,inmate supervision,and sanitation.id.at.the allegations plaintiff makes here regarding incarceration allegedly beyond a period when release was required by state law were not at issue in that case.further,the portion of morales feliciano that dealt with classification had to do with classifying inmates according to their propensity for violence as well as their emotional and physical health,id.at,pursuant to puerto rico law,see laws ann.tit.that law does not impose any specific duties on the secretary.morales feliciano had nothing to do with classifying inmates as eligible for release from a perpetual sentence upon their rehabilitation.nothing in morales feliciano put laboy alvarado or any other defendant on notice of any purported violation of plaintiff constitutional rights as alleged here.
as to the puerto rico court proceedings involving him,feliciano hernández relies first on his pro se habeas petition and second on a mandamus proceeding.some of the named defendants were not even in office at the time of the filings in and and so could not plausibly have been put on notice.the only named defendants in office during the course of the habeas proceedings were cotto vives and laboy alvarado.the only named defendant in office at the time of the mandamus proceeding was pereira castillo.the plaintiff could not plead facts showing these proceedings gave individual notice of his allegations to the defendants who held office before the proceedings even commenced,and he makes no attempt to plead facts showing they put on individual notice the defendants who took office after these proceedings concluded.feliciano hernández complaint contains no allegation that any defendant was put on notice of alleged violations of constitutional rights by the habeas petition or by any of the other court proceedings the complaint describes.
nor did feliciano hernández make any such argument in his opposition to laboy alvarado motion to dismiss,so he has waived the argument.not until his motion for reconsideration and his amended complaint both filed after the district court entered judgment dismissing the complaint did feliciano hernández allege,even then insufficiently,that the habeas action put laboy alvarado on notice of the violations of his rights alleged here.even if the argument were not waived,as it has been,it would fail.
the complaint fails to connect any of the named or john poe defendants to either the habeas proceeding or the mandamus proceeding and makes no allegation that either proceeding put any of the defendants on notice that feliciano hernández constitutional rights were,as alleged here,being violated.
iqbal requires dismissal here.in iqbal,the plaintiff alleged that attorney general ashcroft and fbi director mueller knew of,condoned,and agreed to subject the plaintiff to harsh conditions of confinement.at.the supreme court deemed those similarly bare allegations to be too conclusory to be entitled to the assumption of truth.id.
even beyond failing to show notice to the individual defendants,the complaint fails on other grounds.feliciano hernández would still have to go further,for not every official who is aware of a problem exhibits deliberate indifference by failing to resolve it.feliciano hernández,wl,at quoting moore tartler,cir.the complaint contains no factual allegations to support even a minimal showing of deliberate indifference.
b.the denial of plaintiff motion to reconsider 
we review the district court denial of feliciano hernández motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.see meléndez garcía sánchez,cir see also aca fin.guar.advest,district courts enjoy considerable discretion in deciding rule e motions,subject to circumstances developed in the case law.feliciano hernández motion states it is pursuant to rules b and a.rule b provides for a motion to amend or make additional findings rule a provides for a motion for a new trial or further action after a trial.see.b,a.on appeal,feliciano hernández states that his motion was actually under rule e,and that rule a in his papers is a typographical error.regardless of which rule of civil procedure plaintiff intended to move under,it is clear from the district court december,opinion and order denying the motion that the court considered feliciano hernández arguments both for amending the august,opinion findings and for reconsidering the conclusion of that opinion.because of the close relationship between rule e and rule b,we do not think that it is of dispositive significance that the district court relied on b rather than e.metal finishing,cir.
the motion for reconsideration argued that the dismissal order was based on inaccurate facts and was erroneous as to laboy alvarado and improperly sua sponte as to the other defendants 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider.the factual allegations that feliciano hernández argues were not considered by the district court are either legal conclusions couched as facts or are facts that the court did indeed include in its opinion.the court was also acting within its discretion in refusing to reconsider arguments that the plaintiff had already made or to consider new arguments that he could have made earlier.a motion to reconsider should not raise arguments which could,and should,have been made before judgment issued.aca,at quoting fdic world,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also wright miller,federal practice and procedure ed.the rule e motion may not be used to relitigate old matters,or to raise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.footnotes omitted.
the motion also requested that the court allow feliciano hernández to file an amended complaint,to which we now turn.
c.the denial of plaintiff motion to file an amended complaint 
feliciano hernández argues that the district court should have allowed him to belatedly amend his complaint pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.feliciano hernández is incorrect for a number of reasons the court lacked authority to accept a amendment the amended complaint was untimely,coming after the court granted a motion to dismiss filed a year earlier the puerto rico court documents attached to the amended complaint reinforce that plaintiff failed to state a claim.
feliciano hernández requested leave to file his amended complaint on september,after the district court had already entered final judgment on august,dismissing the complaint,and almost a full year after laboy alvarado filed her motion to dismiss.
the law in this circuit is clear that a district court may not accept an amended complaint after judgment has entered unless and until the judgment is set aside or vacated under rules or,and the district court here denied the motion to vacate the judgment.see fisher kadant,cir describing as law the rule that u nless postjudgment relief has been granted,the district court lacks power to grant a motion to amend the complaint under rule a quoting acevedo villalobos hernandez,cir.
independently,the district court acted within its discretion in denying plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint first made after it entered its dismissal order.t he district court enjoys significant latitude in deciding whether to grant leave to amend,and w e defer to the district court decision if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.aca,at quoting larocca borden,cir.among the grounds for denial are undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of amendment.id.alteration and omissions in original quoting foman davis,internal quotation marks omitted.the district court had good reason for disallowing filing the amended complaint it was far too late.it was also futile,as we explain below.
the complaint was first filed on june.laboy alvarado filed a motion to dismiss on september,and rivera gonzález answered the complaint on october.feliciano hernández could have moved to amend then,but did not.instead,plaintiff waited to move to amend until september,nearly a year after the motion to dismiss was filed,and after the court had dismissed the case.we have stated that r egardless of the context,the longer a plaintiff delays,the more likely a motion to amend will be denied,as protracted delay,with its attendant burdens on the opponent and the court,is itself a sufficient reason for the court to withhold permission to amend.id.alterations in original quoting steir girl scouts of the usa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,we agree with the district court determination that the amended complaint would not have altered its conclusions and so was futile.as the district court stated in the course of ruling that it would not reconsider its judgment,the plaintiff was unable to demonstrate that defendants were liable under section in his motion for reconsideration,to which his amended complaint was attached.feliciano hernández,wl,at.
the amended complaint contained several attachments purportedly obtained during discovery,and as result of investigation.these attachments,which were filed with the district court in spanish in violation of the local rules,are largely those court filings and related publicly available documents which were referred to in the original complaint but not then provided.the failure to provide english translations of the documents also doomed the amended complaint 
turning to the content of the amended complaint,it again makes conclusory allegations that the individual defendants must have had knowledge of each of feliciano hernández puerto rico court filings,but,with one exception,it fails to provide facts as to why this would be so.the defendants were officials in charge of institutions holding thousands of inmates,the running of a number of different facilities,and the employment of numerous personnel.some defendants were not even in office at the time of the filings in and.
the amended complaint contains just the type of allegations that are so speculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory and the factual and so must be disregarded.peñalbert rosa,at quoting twombly,at.
the amended complaint does allege that feliciano hernández pro se habeas petition put secretary laboy alvarado on notice of the alleged violations of his rights the english translations of the documents filed with this court establish otherwise even if laboy alvarado had been personally served the petition,which was evidently concerned only with puerto rico law,it would not have put her on notice of any claimed constitutional violations.further,the decision of the puerto rico court denying habeas would have informed laboy alvarado,contrary to plaintiff theory,that there was no violation of law in his continued confinement because it was an appropriate matter for the parole board which had justifiably denied relief.
as to notice of that decision,the decision and order of the puerto rico court of first instance dated june,and captioned the people of puerto rico angel feliciano hernandez directed that the order and the petition for habeas corpus and its attachments be notified to the department of justice,to the legal division of the correction administration and also to its administrator.but the department of correction response indicated that feliciano hernández did not fully comply with the order.
in response to the june,court order,an attorney at the ponce correctional complex filed an informative motion,stating that the department of corrections had not received a copy of the petition and did not know about its content.the informative motion also stated that feliciano hernández was referred to the parole board once he served his minimum sentence,that the parole board had denied him the privilege of release,and it attached the last two resolutions of the parole board.those documents from the parole board show that in the board denied parole,stating that feliciano hernández had not submitted a required alternate housing plan or a structured exit plan,that because of the length of his sentence the board wanted additional time to review his adjustment,and concluded he was not prepared at that time for parole.the parole board said he would be reviewed the next year and required reports be submitted to it by the department of corrections.
the june,judgment of the court of first instance denied the habeas petition on the grounds that feliciano hernández has available the administrative ordinary and appellate proceedings before the parole board and the board had not released him.the court directed that its order be entered and notified to the parties and the secretary of the department of rehabilitation and correction.
even if plaintiff could sufficiently allege that the june,judgment reached the desk of laboy alvarado,all that judgment would have lead a reasonable administrator to conclude was that there was no error in the parole board being the appropriate vehicle for accomplishing a prisoner release on rehabilitation under such sentences and that there had been no procedural or substantive violations of law in not releasing a prisoner when the parole board had not allowed his release.under no reasonable interpretation could the june,judgment be seen as notice to laboy alvarado that plaintiff constitutional rights were being violated.the judgment was to the contrary and so undercuts the allegations of notice of any constitutional violation,much less deliberate indifference.
as to the action,it was,as stated by the puerto rico court of first instance,an action for mandamus,not a petition for habeas corpus,and it did not seek feliciano hernández release.the department of corrections was the respondent,not any of the individual defendants here.the department of corrections was ordered to correct the petitioner file to reflect the reality of his penal convictions.the petitioner must notify the court of any deviation to the order entered herein.there is no claim that the department of corrections did not comply or that feliciano hernández ever notified the court of any deviation.nor does plaintiff plead any facts showing that any of the defendants here individually knew of the mandamus proceeding or its outcome.plaintiff has pled that only pereira castillo was in office at that time.
finally,feliciano hernández has not alleged that his petition for habeas corpus or the puerto rico court orders in that case put any of the defendants on notice that his constitutional rights were being violated.again,only pereira castillo was in office when the april,order was issued.that order states that under puerto rico law as it stood at the time feliciano hernández was sentenced,the court understood that annual evaluations of the petitioner should have taken place in order to determine when the imposed security measure would cease,but this was not done.citing laws ann.tit.contrary to plaintiff characterization of the order in the amended complaint,the court did not state that the department of corrections had failed to comply with any duty,and the court certainly did not state that any of the individual defendants here did not comply with any duty.
after hearing testimony,the court accepted the recommendation of counsel and of the public ministry that feliciano hernández be transferred to a halfway house within thirty days,that he remain there for no less than six months and no longer than a year,and that he be referred to the pre release services to assist him with reintegration into the community.he was also ordered to register with the sexual offender registry and to complete special therapies for sexual offenders offered by the department.on june,by separate order,the department was ordered to immediately release feliciano hernández.
the order does not state that feliciano hernández rights under the constitution were violated,that the department of corrections had violated any constitutional rights,or that any of the defendants in this case violated his constitutional rights or knew or should have known his rights were being violated.none of the defendants in this case were parties to the habeas proceedings,and there is no allegation that any of them were even notified of the proceedings.
feliciano hernández makes an argument on appeal never made to the district court.he has shifted his theory of the case to an argument that articles and of the puerto rico penal code as those provisions read when he was sentenced in imposed a duty upon the unnamed defendant superintendents of the institutions in which he was incarcerated from to to provide the court with yearly reports on his rehabilitation process.this argument was available to plaintiff at the time he filed his complaint,but was not made.he did not make the argument to the district court until his motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint,and then in only a cursory fashion.so it is doubly waived.
even so,the argument again provides no support for his claim of constitutional violation by the defendants.it is not clear whether article,which was repealed in,applied after the date of repeal.article by its terms imposed a duty on the court and while the court could obtain a report from the director of the establishment of confinement it is far from clear under puerto rico law that the director had a statutory duty to produce annual reports absent a request from the courts.
nor is it clear that the mechanism for annual review concerning release did not include the parole board,and the plaintiff has offered no citations to puerto rico law to the contrary.in fact,the parole board is to consider the prisoner rehabilitation among other factors in determining whether to grant parole.see laws ann.tit.
regardless of any purported duty on the directors,the named defendants can not be held liable under for the supposed omissions of their subordinates.in a suit each government official,his or her title notwithstanding,is only liable for his or her own misconduct.iqbal.at.moreover,the plaintiff does not allege any facts that would have put either the named or the unnamed defendants on individual notice that his incarceration was not being reviewed annually as required by law.
even had the argument under articles and not been waived,its consideration would not have altered the outcome of dismissal under iqbal.rather,it would have enhanced defendants claims for dismissal.we also add that even were there some violations by someone of duties under puerto rico law,that still does not suffice to establish a violation of federal constitutional rights.berríos romero estado libre asociado de,cir.
that plaintiff has failed to state a federal claim in this case does not mean he has no claims under puerto rico law.the district court dismissed those claims without prejudice.
we affirm.no costs are awarded.
