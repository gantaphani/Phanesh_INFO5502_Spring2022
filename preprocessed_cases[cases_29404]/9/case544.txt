this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment for the in an age discrimination suit.we affirm essentially for the reasons articulated in the district court opinion,which contains a clear and detailed statement of facts and a conclusion,with which we agree,that there was a complete failure of proof of age as a motivating factor.we add this supplementary opinion to address,at urging,the question whether,in light of reeves sanderson plumbing,d,plaintiff prima facie case,together with his assaults on the truth of appellee reasons for terminating him,are enough,without more,to defeat summary judgment.
i.the investigation 
plaintiff,a branch manager who had been employed by the bank or its predecessor since and whose salary had increased from in to in,was dismissed and replaced by a woman.defendant action followed an investigation of plaintiff,which was initiated by a complaint from a fellow employee,nélida colón.she alleged that plaintiff regularly made comments about the physical attributes of female customers entering the bank,had disclosed the bankruptcy filing of a client and former branch manager,discussed an employee evaluation with a client,had not been active in seeking to increase bank business,and had meddled with the personal lives of herself and a coworker.
the bank initiated an investigation into the complaint,which was conducted by a human resources officer,manuel frías.he interviewed colón and three other employees,finding agreement among them confirming colón charges.he conducted two rounds of interviews with these employees and met with plaintiff to review their charges.eventually,frías prepared a report and recommendation for dismissal,based on the facts that plaintiff conduct had a negative impact on the work environment of the branch,that his comments and conduct had exposed the bank to liability,and that he had violated the bank policies against sexual harassment and confidentiality of information.this report was accepted by and implemented by the bank director of human resources.
other facts bearing on the course of this process will be discussed in connection with our analysis.
ii.analysis 
plaintiff asserts that he has established a prima facie case.defendant concurs.he was in the protected age group,had been performing well,suffered an adverse employment action,and was replaced by a younger person.see de la vega san juan star,cir.the question to be resolved is whether the defendant explanation of its conduct,together with any other evidence,could reasonably be seen by a jury not only to be false but to suggest an animus.see reckitt colman,cir.after due consideration,we have concluded that the answer is no.
in reeves,the supreme court emphasized the possibility that a plaintiff may survive summary judgment not by unearthing positive evidence of a discriminatory motive,but by showing that an employer proffered justification for its adverse employment action was such that a trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.see at.citing wright west,d.the court went on to disavow that a showing of pretext automatically would suffice to defeat summary judgment,saying,
whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors.those include the strength of the plaintiff prima facie case,the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,and any other evidence that supports the employer case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in reeves,two characteristics of the evidence stand out there was a substantial showing that respondent employer explanation was false,and,in addition to a prima facie case and the showing of falsity in the employer explanation,there was additional evidence that chestnut employer official was motivated by animus and was principally responsible for petitioner firing.see id.at.
under these circumstances a prima facie case of discrimination,enough evidence for the jury to reject respondent explanation,and additional evidence of animus,id.at.court held that a jury could find intentional discrimination.shortly after reeves was decided,we had occasion to reconsider a ruling we had made in feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort and country club,cir.in an order denying panel rehearing,we held that our analysis was consistent with reeves,and reiterated that the thinness of the plaintiff showing of pretext,while enough to create a triable issue as to the falsity of company reasons,failed to shed any light on what the true reason was,let alone show that the reason was discrimination based on ethnic origin.id.at.there was no other evidence of actions or words evidencing an ethnic bias sufficient to support a jury verdict of discrimination.
in this case,it is undisputed that plaintiff has established a prima facie case.plaintiff was at the time of his termination,had performed well as evidenced by regular salary increases,and was succeeded by a person.but we have no information about that person background or experience.as for additional evidence pointing to age discrimination,appellant has made only conclusory statements about his employer taking out two other older managers,josé ramos and pérez caratini,but he acknowledged that he did not know why they were terminated or who was responsible for the decisions.moreover,the record is bereft of any comments.for the six years preceding the events in this plaintiff already was older than the age at which his successor took the had been awarded annual raises in salary,hardly evidence of preexisting animus.see rivas rosado radio shack,cir no basis for inferring gender discrimination where employee was regularly promoted before discovery of irregularities.
whether plaintiff showing was adequate to warrant further fact finding therefore depends on his evidence of pretext.in reeves,the court cites texas dep t of community affairs burdine,d,for the proposition that a plaintiff must have the opportunity to prove that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.at.the seventh circuit in kulumani blue cross blue shield ass n,cir,elaborates,explaining that a pretext for discrimination means more than an unusual act it means something worse than a business error pretext means deceit used to cover one tracks.this is consistent with dictionary guidance something that is put forward to conceal a true purpose or object.the random house dictionary of the english language ed.
plaintiff attempts to establish this kind of pretext by firing a spirited volley of some twelve charges,with the hope that the resulting smoke will be considered proof of fire.we consider them carefully but conclude that the smoke dissipates with the firing of each charge.
to begin,the investigation leading to plaintiff dismissal was in response to a complaint by a fellow employee,colón.human resources officer frías conducted two sets of interviews with branch employees and met with plaintiff.the other employees generally agreed with the instigating employee.plaintiff did not assert any adverse motive or bias on the part of any of these persons and conceded that frías was doing his job.
while plaintiff denied the alleged misconduct,frías deemed all his informants credible.the question is not whether plaintiff or his fellow employees version is the true one,but whether frías and his superiors believed what he had been told by those he interviewed.see,at t he ultimate question is not whether the explanation was false,but whether discrimination was the cause of the termination.ponte,cir t he issue is not whether the employer reasons were real,but merely whether the decisionmakers believed them to be real.plaintiff plea that his denials establish triable issues of fact foreclosing summary judgment would,if accepted,spell the end of summary judgment.of similar nature is plaintiff assertion that all of the witnesses against him should be deemed unworthy of belief because they were all connected with his and their employer.
