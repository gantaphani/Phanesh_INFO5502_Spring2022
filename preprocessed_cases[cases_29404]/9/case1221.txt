edward root appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut hall,dismissing on summary judgment his fraud,unreasonable seizure,and the setting of unreasonable timothy liston,the connecticut state attorney for the judicial district of middlesex.see root liston,d.root was in police custody for a series of vehicle offenses,with bond set by a judge,when liston learned that root may have committed the more serious offense of threatening a prosecutor believing that root therefore posed a greater flight risk than previously realized,liston unilaterally ordered the police to hold root on bond.the district court ruled that liston was absolutely immune from a damages suit because his actions were prosecutorial in nature and had some colorable jurisdiction under connecticut law.we affirm on the somewhat different ground that although liston actions were judicial in nature,connecticut law arguably just arguably confers on prosecutors a limited power to do what liston did.
the facts bearing on absolute immunity are not in dispute.root was arrested on state charges of operating under suspension,operating without insurance,and having an expired emission sticker,for which he received a court date of july.root was again arrested on similar charges,and given an additional court date of july.when root failed to appear on july,judge carol wolven signed a warrant for the original three charges and an additional count of failure to appear.she set the bond amount at.
on friday morning,july,a dispatcher received a tip suggesting that root had threatened the life of senior assistant state attorney barbara hoffman asa hoffman.when liston heard about the threat,he notified state police,who began an investigation.later that morning,the state police told liston that root had appeared in court for his july court date,had been arrested by middletown police on the failure to appear charge,and was being held in state police barracks on the bond.
around noon of the same day,trooper moysey of the state police called liston to report that moysey was the officer who arrested root on the failure to appear charge.liston then told moysey that root was alleged to have threatened asa hoffman,that an investigation was under way,that it was getting too late on the friday to arraign root on the failure to appear charge,and that detectives were on their way to the barracks to interview root.critically,liston added his own was increasing the amount of root bond from to,because the new allegation the threat against asa hoffman made root a greater flight risk.liston instructed moysey that the bond amount was not to be lowered and that moysey should contact him if the bail commissioner attempted to modify it.
on saturday,july,root lawyer joined by a bail bondsman offered to post root original bond.the state police officers on duty contacted liston,who reconfirmed that root bond was.that evening,counsel again tried without success to obtain root release on a bond.root did not post the higher bond amount,and remained in custody over the weekend.
on monday,july,judge thomas parker signed an arrest warrant for root on state charges of threatening and disorderly conduct based on the alleged threat against asa hoffman,with the bond on that warrant set at.that day,root was transported to court and served with the warrant in the court cellblock.he was subsequently arraigned before judge wolven on charges of failure to appear and threatening and disorderly conduct.after oral argument,judge wolven set the bond on the threatening charge at,and reimposed the bond on the failure to appear charge.
on may,root filed a suit in district court,alleging fraud,unreasonable seizure,and the setting of unreasonable bond in violation of the common law of connecticut and the constitution.the district court granted liston motion for summary judgment on march,on the ground that liston enjoyed absolute prosecutorial immunity for his actions.root appeals,asserting that the district court misapplied the standards governing absolute prosecutorial immunity.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision granting summary judgment.see aslanidis united states lines,cir.summary judgment may be granted only if there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried,and the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.in making this determination,we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.id.
the district court ruled that liston was entitled to absolute immunity as a prosecutor.see root,d at.root argues that the power to increase the amount of a bond is not prosecutorial in nature,that prosecutors lack such authority under connecticut law,and that liston conduct was therefore a usurpation of judicial power for which he enjoys no immunity.liston argument has force up to a point,but we affirm nevertheless.
a bsolute immunity defeats a suit at the outset,so long as the official actions were within the scope of the immunity.imbler pachtman,d.absolute immunity is an extreme protection,insulating the immune party from any judicial scrutiny of the motive for and reasonableness of official action.robison via,cir.
the purpose of absolute immunity is not to protect government officials as individuals,but rather to ensure that they can perform their jobs without harassment by civil suits and without intimidation by the threat of suit.butz economou,d.in determining whether absolute immunity attaches,we therefore consider the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.forrester white,d.under this functional approach,persons enjoy absolute immunity not because of their particular location within the government but because of the special nature of their responsibilities.butz,at.
increasing the bond amount is not among those actions that are connected with the prosecutor role in judicial proceedings.burns reed,d see also imbler,at.for the purpose of ascertaining immunity,the prosecutorial role is generally limited to advocacy,see doe phillips,cir citing dory ryan,cir,and the initiation and presentation of a prosecution,see pinaud county of suffolk,cir citing cases.in pinaud,we held that absolute prosecutorial immunity protects a prosecutor for advocacy in connection with a bail well as more generally for communications with other officials directly pertaining to matters of sentencing.id.at.although liston conduct here had to do with the setting of a bond,it was as root argues different in nature from the prosecutor advocacy for higher bail in pinaud.we find no authority for the idea that modification of a bond falls within the ambit of the prosecutorial function.connecticut law as discussed infra may arguably authorize prosecutors to modify a prisoner bond unilaterally under certain circumstances but such authorization still would not render the act of bond modification prosecutorial in nature.
at the same time,the conclusion that liston conduct was not by nature prosecutorial does not defeat his immunity claim.under the functional approach that controls the analysis,liston also enjoys immunity for his colorably authorized acts that are judicial in nature,notwithstanding that he is a prosecutor.
the doctrines of absolute prosecutorial and judicial immunity are closely related.see imbler,at.it is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of the judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors being referred to as officers,and their immunities being termed as well.the law nevertheless observes an analytic distinction,and we look to the common law and history to define the bounds of the different immunities.see burns,at.a lthough the precise contours of official immunity need not mirror the immunity at common law,we look to the common law and other history for guidance because our role is not to make a freewheeling policy choice,but rather to discern congress likely intent in enacting.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
