in this appeal,we consider whether the exhaustion provision of the prison litigation reform act plra,a,requires a federal district court to dismiss in its entirety a prisoner complaint brought pursuant to with respect to the conditions of his or her incarceration if the complaint contains any claim that has not been administratively exhausted within the prison system.based on an examination of the text of section and the policies underlying the plra,we conclude that such complete dismissal is not required.
this appeal also presents the question whether the due process claim of the,in which he alleges unusually harsh confinement in a special housing unit shu,can survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b despite the fact that his period of confinement was less than days.in accordance with our recent decision in palmer richards,cir,and based on the allegations of fact of this case,we conclude that it can.
background 
many of the relevant facts underlying this appeal are set forth in our prior opinion in this case.ortiz mcbride,cir per curiam.we repeat them here insofar as we think it necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.because the appeal is from the district court dismissal of ortiz complaint,we state the facts as they are alleged in the first amended complaint.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
the arthur kill correctional facility is a prison administered by the new york state department of correctional services docs.on september,while ortiz was incarcerated in arthur kill,sergeant mcbride,a corrections officer,confronted ortiz with the allegations of a confidential informant that ortiz had violated docs rules by smuggling drugs into,and selling them within,arthur kill.ortiz denied the allegations.
four times,mcbride ordered ortiz to take a urine test in an apparent attempt to establish that he was using rather than that he had imported or sold drugs.each time,the test results were negative.nonetheless,and despite the fact that the drug smuggling and sale allegations were based entirely on information provided to mcbride by the confidential informant,mcbride instituted disciplinary proceedings against ortiz.
on october,the charges against ortiz were heard in a disciplinary proceeding over which mara,an arthur kill counselor,presided the tier iii hearing.the only evidence offered against ortiz was mcbride statement that the confidential informant had accused ortiz of selling drugs in the prison.based on this evidence alone,mara concluded that ortiz had committed a disciplinary violation and sentenced him to ninety days of solitary confinement in the prison shu,as well as loss of packages,commissary,phone,and recreation privileges for that time.ortiz appealed the decision through the channels established within docs for such review.
during the first three weeks of ortiz shu sentence,he asserts,prison officials confined him to his cell hours a day.he was not permitted to shower for weeks at a time,was denied deodorant and toothpaste,was served meals later than other inmates,and was not given eating utensils,causing plaintiff to eat with the same fingers he was unable to properly wash.first amended compl.ortiz clothes were also purposely drenched with baby oil.id.further,according to ortiz,w hen he complained of the inhumane conditions,corrections officers threatened that he would be physically beaten and charged with additional infractions.id.
after days in the arthur kill shu,and while his docs appeal was pending,ortiz was transferred to docs fishkill correctional facility.there he was placed in shu for the remaining days of his sentence.ortiz complains that while in the fishkill shu,he was,that is,forced to share the cell,which had only one toilet,with another inmate.according to ortiz,the inmate with whom he shared his cell posed a physical threat to ortiz.ortiz does not assert,however,that he submitted formal docs grievances with respect to shu conditions in either prison.
docs director of special disciplinary program,donald selsky,ultimately reversed ortiz disciplinary ruling in a document titled review of superintendent hearing.it stated,without explanation y our superintendent hearing of october,has been reviewed and reversed on december.the ruling came on the ninetieth and final day of ortiz shu confinement.
on july,ortiz,acting pro se,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york asserting causes of action under.he alleged that the tier iii hearing,which led to the imposition of a sentence of ninety days in shu confinement,deprived him of a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment of the constitution without due process of law and the shu conditions to which he was subjected constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment of the constitution as applied to new york state through the fourteenth amendment.he requested a variety of remedies,including compensatory and punitive damages.he also alleged that he had filed grievances concerning this matter and that all grievances had been denied.compl.
the district court appointed counsel for ortiz.on november,counsel filed a first amended complaint on ortiz behalf.
the defendants then moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim.on march,the district court jack weinstein,judge,ruling from the bench,granted the motion.his ruling is set forth in full in our previous per curiam opinion as follows 
this constitutes my opinion in the case the court is compelled to dismiss the case.the main problem that the court saw in the papers was the problem of lack of a test of the veracity of the informer who apparently provided the basis for the complaint by the sergeant.however,there is no point in pursuing that matter since the administrative proceedings within the prison resulted in dismissal of the complaint.so that the plaintiff has obtained all that could be obtained on that issue.
with respect to the conditions within the cramped cell,the court is compelled under the decisions of the court of appeals for the second circuit to dismiss those complaints.the court of appeals for the second circuit requires a very high standard of abuse.it has to be atypical and significant hardship under colon howard,cir,and other opinions of the second circuit.
moreover,it is very clear that the second circuit in general requires special incarceration of more than days.that is colon,at 
the showering and other personal issues,in connection with other circumstances,may constitute an abusive situation.however,in view of the release from these circumstances within the prison within the days,and dismissal on the main issue,under the cases the court believes it has no alternative but to dismiss.
the court of appeals in neal goord,cir,required dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.in this case the exhaustion with respect to the main issue resulted in a favorable decision for the plaintiff.the oral testimony as well as other information before this court does not make clear any exhaustion with respect to these other issues.
ortiz,at alterations in original.the action was dismissed.the memorandum,judgment,and order of the district court did not state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.
ortiz appealed.in a per curiam opinion,we ordered that appellate counsel be appointed for ortiz and invited counsel to ask that this case be heard with other pending appeals involving related plra issues,id.at,which he later did.we identified four issues to be addressed i n addition to any other arguments counsel may choose to raise.id.they were,
whether ortiz proffered evidence that he administratively exhausted his eighth amendment claim satisfies the requirements of a whether a requires total exhaustion and,if so,whether ortiz may now withdraw any unexhausted claims whether ortiz factual allegations that the conditions of his confinement in shu were unusually harsh sufficed to raise the question of whether that confinement implicated a constitutionally protected liberty interest so as to preclude b dismissal whether ortiz complaint adequately pled,or could be amended adequately to plead,that the defendants are subject to supervisory liability,under the test described in wright smith,cir,for the alleged eighth amendment violations.
ortiz concedes that his eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment claim is not viable because his complaint did not name the prison officials responsible for his allegedly abusive treatment during shu confinement,and the named defendants did not possess supervisory authority over the unnamed prison officials responsible for ortiz shu treatment.accordingly,ortiz concedes that there is no issue of supervisory liability in this case.we thus limit our review to the first three of our questions.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a dismissal granted under rule b de novo,with all inferences drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.moore painewebber,cir.we similarly review a district court ruling on whether a plaintiff whose claim is governed by the plra has exhausted administrative remedies de novo.see mojias johnson,cir.
ii.the status of ortiz claims 
all parties agree,as do we,that ortiz has exhausted his available administrative remedies with respect to his due process claim.he appealed the tier iii hearing and obtained a reversal.he did not appeal to the highest level of docs,but inasmuch as he obtained a favorable determination regarding his due process claim,no such further appeal was required.see abney mcginnis,wl cir to require prisoners to appeal all favorable resolutions would be impracticable.marvin goord,cir per curiam see also ross county of bernalillo,cir once a prisoner has won all the relief that is available under the institution administrative procedures,his administrative remedies are exhausted.prisoners are not required to file additional complaints or appeal favorable decisions in such cases.
there is no basis,however,for us to conclude that ortiz exhausted his available administrative remedies with respect to his eighth amendment claim.he alleges only that he complained orally,to no avail,about the shu conditions which are the subject of the claim.according to his complaint,when plaintiff complained of the inhumane conditions,corrections officers threatened that he would be physically beaten and charged with additional infractions.first amended compl.although in some circumstances threats by prison guards may render administrative remedies unavailable for purposes of section a,see hemphill state of new york,wl cir,ortiz alleges only that he was threatened when he complained.he does not contend that the threats from guards prevented him from filing a grievance or otherwise rendered docs grievance procedures unavailable.
iii.ortiz due process claim 
if ortiz fourteenth amendment due process claim relating to his disciplinary hearing failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,the claim could be dismissed pursuant to c.in that case,only ortiz eighth amendment claim would remain,and,because it is unexhausted,it too would have to be dismissed under a.see infra part iv.since the entire lawsuit would thus be disposed of,we would not reach the question whether a prisoner action under that contains both exhausted and unexhausted claims need be dismissed in its entirety under section a.see id.we conclude,however,that the complaint does state a claim for a violation of ortiz due process rights.
t o present a due process claim,a plaintiff must establish that he possessed a liberty interest and that the defendant s deprived him of that interest as a result of insufficient process.giano selsky,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.prison discipline implicates a liberty interest when it imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.sandin conner,d.
as a result of the tier iii hearing,ortiz was sentenced to ninety days in shu.according to his complaint,his treatment while in shu was unusually harsh.
to be sure,with respect to normal shu confinement,we have held that a confinement does not meet the sandin standard of atypicality.sealey giltner,cir.the duration of shu confinement,however,is not the only relevant factor.we have said that under abnormal or unusual shu conditions,periods of confinement of less than days may implicate a liberty interest.see palmer richards,cir shu confinements of fewer than days could constitute atypical and significant hardships if the conditions were more severe than the normal shu conditions colon howard,cir we do not exclude the possibility that shu confinement of less than days could be shown on a record more fully developed than the one in sealey to constitute an atypical and significant hardship under sandin.sealey,at both the conditions and their duration must be considered,since especially harsh conditions endured for a brief interval might be atypical.citation omitted.in palmer,we held that the defendant confinement for days in shu under unusually harsh conditions raised a question of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment on the issue of whether palmer had been deprived of a liberty interest.palmer,at.the district court in the case before us thus erred when it dismissed ortiz due process claim based solely on the fact that his shu confinement was for fewer than days.
we need not delineate the precise contours of normal shu confinement.for present purposes,it is sufficient to note that,ordinarily,shu prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for hours a day,provided one hour of exercise in the prison yard per day,and permitted two showers per week.palmer,at citing regs.tit.ortiz alleges that for at least part of his confinement,he was kept in shu for hours a day,was not permitted an hour of daily exercise,and was prevented from showering for weeks at a time.first amended compl.based on these and ortiz other allegations relating to his treatment in shu,we think that,if proved,they could establish conditions in shu far inferior,palmer,at,to those prevailing in the prison in general.we thus conclude that ortiz has alleged that the shu sentence imposed on him was,under the circumstances,a hardship sufficiently atypical and significant to withstand a rule b motion as to the first part of the due process test.
in order for his due process claim to survive defendants rule b motion,however,ortiz must also have alleged that the prison imposed the shu sentence without providing due process.giano,at.for a prison disciplinary proceeding to provide due process there must be,among other things,some evidence to support the sanction imposed.gaston coughlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the case of a prison disciplinary sanction based solely on the evidence supplied by a confidential informant,we have said that this some evidence standard requires some examination of indicia relevant to the informant credibility.id.alteration in original citing giakoumelos coughlin,cir.see also sira morton,wl,cir.lexis,discussing due process requirement of some assessment of confidential informant credibility in the context of prison disciplinary proceedings.the complaint sufficiently alleges that the some evidence standard was not met to survive defendants rule b motion in this respect.
ortiz first amended complaint thus successfully states a fourteenth amendment due process claim.we must therefore decide whether the district court was nonetheless correct in dismissing ortiz action in its entirety because the eighth amendment claim had not been administratively exhausted.
iv.the dismissal of ortiz action 
section a and the prison litigation reform act 
ortiz first amended complaint,as we have discussed,contained two claims one alleging a violation of the fourteenth amendment with respect to which he had exhausted his prison administrative remedies,and the other alleging a violation of the eighth amendment with respect to which he had not a provides 
suits by prisoners.
a applicability of administrative remedies.no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
id.because ortiz brought this action in which he asserted a claim with respect to which such administrative remedies as are available had not been exhausted,the action was improperly brought under the language of section a.the question,then,is whether the district court was therefore required,under a total exhaustion rule to dismiss the action in its entirety despite the presence of an otherwise viable,fully exhausted claim.we think not.
we note at the outset that if section a deprived district courts of jurisdiction over actions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims,the district court,being without jurisdiction,would be required to dismiss ortiz action in its entirety.but we have expressly held to the contrary that section a does not divest district courts of jurisdiction over actions containing unexhausted claims.richardson goord,cir per curiam.whether a prisoner failure to exhaust administrative remedies is grounds for dismissal of an action or not,it is not jurisdictional grounds.
having jurisdiction,we proceed to examine the language of the statute to determine if it tells us whether mixed actions must be dismissed in their entirety.see,hughes aircraft jacobson,d w here the statutory language provides a clear answer,our analysis ends there ins,cir.per curiam when construing statutes,we look to the statutory language which,if clear on its face,ends our analysis.citing hughes aircraft,at,cert.denied.we do not think that the language of the statute answers that question 
section a clearly instructs that an action such as ortiz containing exhausted and unexhausted claims should not have been brought.but we do not think that it follows that the only possible response to the impermissibility of the bringing of the action is to dismiss it in its kill it rather than to cure it.the statute does not say so.and section c which addresses dismissals of some such suits by is therefore the place where we would expect to find guidance as to whether dismissal of mixed actions is silent on the issue 
we thus find ourselves in a position similar to the supreme court in rose lundy,d assessing the requirement of total exhaustion in the context of habeas corpus petitions.after reviewing the statute text,we conclude that section is too ambiguous to sustain the conclusion that congress intended to require district courts to dismiss any prisoner action containing one or more unexhausted claims rather than to dismiss only the offending claims.id.at.we therefore turn to the statute,its legislative history,and the policies underlying the exhaustion doctrine.id.at.
legislative history practical and policy considerations 
we follow rose guidance by looking first to section legislative history.but the parties have not identified,and we are not otherwise aware of,any legislative history suggesting that congress directly considered the question or had any particular intent with respect to whether mixed actions should be dismissed in their entirety.see alexander davis,d,t he legislative history of the statutory section demonstrates no concern with this issue.
looking at the statute legislative history in a more general sense,the purpose of the plra,originally enacted as,stat,which sets forth a broad set of rules governing litigation by prisoners in federal courts,was plainly to curtail what congress perceived to be inmate abuses of the judicial process.see generally michael mushlin,rights of prisoners ed margo schlanger,inmate litigation,harv.to effect this goal,congress erected an array of procedural barriers designed to make it more difficult for inmates to bring suit in federal court,including what is now codified as section a,requiring that only administratively exhausted actions be brought.see id.at.it is b eyond doubt that congress enacted a to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.porter nussle,d see also cong.rec.statement of hatch the plra will help bring relief to a civil justice system overburdened by frivolous prisoner lawsuits.
we do not think that a requirement that district courts dismiss mixed actions in their entirety would help achieve congress goal of improving the quality of,or judicial efficiency in disposing of,prisoners section suits.
first,there is the danger that such a regime would create an incentive for prisoners to file section claims,if they have more than one,in more than one lawsuit this obviously would not assist in lessening the burden on district courts.
second,as several district courts have pointed out when addressing this issue,it is doubtful that rather than will do more than require plaintiffs who bring mixed actions to refile their claims with the claims that were held by the district court to be unexhausted simply omitted.
given the short period of time allotted to prisoners to file grievances,see,woodrich greiner,wl,at,dist.lexis,at an inmate in a new york state prison must file his or her grievance within fourteen days of the alleged grievance,a prisoner may not be able to raise or resolve unexhausted claims within state and local institutions.jenkins toombs,d,see also cole miraflor,wl,at july,dist.lexis,at holding that by failing to file grievance within the appropriate time period,prisoner had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.as a result,
prisoners are likely to simply amend their complaints to eliminate the unexhausted claims and refile.in that case,courts would be faced with exactly the same claims they could have resolved at the outset.
scott gardner,d,accord blackmon crawford,d,hattley goord,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
third,prisoners actions may present questions as to whether one or more claims have been exhausted that are not only genuine,but challenging for the courts to decide.see,abney mcginnis,wl cir considering whether an inmate who obtains a favorable ruling that prison administrators subsequently do not implement has exhausted available remedies hemphill new york,wl whether alleged threats to plaintiff by prison guard rendered administrative remedies not available and johnson testman,wl cir whether successfully prosecuting a grievance contesting a disciplinary sanction was sufficient to exhaust remedies with respect to an eighth amendment claim against a prison guard arising from events related to the conduct for which discipline was imposed.in any such action,the district court must first familiarize itself with the case and hear the positions of the parties in order to decide the exhaustion issue as a preliminary matter.it hardly seems to aid efficiency to require that,if the court decides the issue against the prisoner,it must then dismiss any remaining exhausted claims only to allow the same case,absent the unexhausted claims,to be reinstituted,heard again on the exhausted issues,and then decided.this is all the more true when the exhausted and unexhausted claims are factually interrelated and the district court is therefore required to familiarize itself with the same factual background of the case twice 
we are not the first circuit to address the complete exhaustion issue based on considerations of policy and practicality.in ross county of bernalillo,supra,the tenth circuit concluded,contrary to our view,that section a requires dismissal of every action that contains unexhausted claims.the court relied largely on an analogy to the requirement of complete exhaustion in habeas corpus cases first established by the supreme court in rose lundy,supra according to ross,
emphasizing comity principles,the rose court reasoned that the total exhaustion doctrine would encourage prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts,thus giving states the first opportunity to review claims of error,create a more complete factual record that will aid federal courts in their review,and relieve district courts of the difficult task of deciding whether multiple claims are severable.
ross,at citing rose,at.also,u nder a total exhaustion rule both the courts and the prisoners should benefit,for as a result the district court will be more likely to review all of the prisoner claims in a single proceeding,thus providin
