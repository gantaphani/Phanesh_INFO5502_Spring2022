six students who attend school in the attica central school district brought an action against the school district primarily alleging that they have been denied the provision of a free appropriate public education.they included claims under the individuals with disabilities education act idea,section of the rehabilitation act of,section,and related new york state education laws.the students sought equitable relief,costs and attorney fees the school district filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court william skretny,judge denied the motion in its entirety but,upon the school district request,certified the issue of subject matter jurisdiction for interlocutory appeal.on february,we agreed to hear it.
the school district argues on appeal that the students should have been required to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing a federal court action.in its order denying the motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that the complaint alleged facts sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.the district court reasoned that the school district alleged systemic violations of the idea can not be remedied through administrative proceedings,and therefore exhaustion would be futile.the complaint was styled as a class action,and the district court described it as containing complain ts of wrongdoing that is inherent in the program itself and not directed at any individual child.the district court did not rule on the students motion to certify the class,however,and they later withdrew that motion without prejudice pending this appeal.
on appeal of the district court order on the motion to dismiss,we must accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint,but we are not to draw inferences from the complaint favorable to plaintiffs.shipping fin.servs.drakos,cir.we may consider affidavits and other materials beyond the pleadings to resolve the jurisdictional issue,but we may not rely on conclusory or hearsay statements contained in the affidavits.zappia middle const.emirate of abu dhabi,cir kamen am,cir.the district court declined to consider any of the materials outside of the pleadings that either party submitted.accordingly,we limit our review to the allegations in the complaint.

the attica central school district argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court determined that dismissal was unwarranted because the complaint falls within the systemic violation exemption from the exhaustion requirement.in a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,we review de novo the district court legal conclusions.apwu potter,cir.
it is well settled that the idea requires an aggrieved party to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a civil action in federal or state court and the parties do not dispute the requirement.the process includes review by an impartial due process hearing officer and an appeal from that hearing.f and g.parents may request a hearing to present complaints relating to the identification,evaluation,or educational placement of the child,or the provision of a free appropriate public education.b.in new york,upon notice of request to the school district,the local board of education appoints an impartial hearing officer under a rotational selection process.the hearing officer issues a written decision which can be appealed to a state review officer of the new york education department.the state review officer decision is final.i,j.
the exhaustion requirement also applies where plaintiffs seek relief under other federal statutes when relief is also available under the idea.l hope cortines,aff,cir.as the district court correctly noted,the students asserted a section rehabilitation act claim and a section claim that both seek to ensure a free appropriate public education,thus subjecting both to the idea exhaustion requirement.
the requirement is excused,however,when exhaustion would be futile because the administrative procedures do not provide an adequate remedy,taylor vermont de
