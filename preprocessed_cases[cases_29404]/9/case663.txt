brian dasey dasey was employed as a state trooper by the massachusetts department of state police msp or state police.before his probationary period expired,he was discharged for making a material misstatement in his employment application.dasey filed suit,asserting violations of the massachusetts law.laws ch,the federal civil rights act,and the massachusetts civil rights act.laws ch.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts,and dasey filed a timely appeal.we affirm.
the critical facts are not contested.after completing his training at the state police academy,dasey was enlisted as a uniformed member of the state police on august.during the initial application process to become a state trooper,dasey affirmatively represented that he did not use illegal drugs and,during the preceding period,had not used,possessed,supplied or manufactured any illegal drugs.on september,while dasey was still serving in a probationary status msp deputy superintendent glenn anderson was given a videotape that had been seized by state troopers while executing a search warrant in an unrelated homicide investigation.the videotape showed dasey and others apparently smoking marijuana.
after reviewing the videotape,anderson and appellees john difava,joseph mclaughlin,and paul regan,all senior state police officers,concluded that dasey had been caught on videotape using an illegal drug and,therefore,had necessarily made a false material statement when he denied prior drug use during the application process.anderson summoned dasey to msp headquarters,where he was met by an attorney provided by the troopers union,the state police association of massachusetts spam.dasey and the union attorney then met with anderson.
anderson told dasey that he had evidence or information that dasey had used an illegal drug and had falsely denied doing so during the employment application process.dasey was offered an opportunity to resign in lieu of discharge he refused and was thereupon dismissed.dasey was awarded a general discharge,executed by difava in his capacity as colonel and superintendent,which read,in its entirety,as follows in accordance with the rules and regulations governing the department of state police,the below named officer is hereby given a general discharge effective as of the close of business on tuesday,september.
dasey amended complaint contained six counts.counts i,ii,and iii asserted claims for invasion of privacy,brought under.laws ch,against various defendants.count iv described a claim under,based upon alleged violations of dasey federal constitutional rights to privacy and due process,as well as deprivation of a property right in continued employment allegedly established by.laws ch.the due process claim in count iv alleged deprivation of both a property interest in continued employment and a liberty interest.dasey contended that his property interest in continued employment entitled him to a hearing,while his liberty interest entitled him to a hearing.count v asserted a second claim,involving a due process violation related to deprivation of a property interest,and count vi asserted a violation of the massachusetts civil rights act.because dasey amended complaint dropped the msp as a defendant,and names the remaining defendants only in their individual capacities,neither the eleventh amendment nor principles of sovereign immunity present any obstacles to dasey claims.
the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to counts i,ii,iii,and the invasion of privacy claim in count iv.the court ruled that dasey failed to allege that defendants disclosed any facts that would qualify as private for purposes of.laws ch,an essential element of the cause of action,and,alternatively,that dasey failed to show that defendants acted unreasonably in reviewing the videotape,or in taking action against him based on its content.the district court also granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to counts v and vi,and the due process claim in count iv,on grounds that dasey,as a probationary trooper,had no reasonable expectation that his employment would continue and,as a consequence,had no constitutionally protected property interest in his job,or concomitant due process rights,at the time he was discharged.the district court did not directly address dasey claim that he was entitled to a hearing to protect a liberty interest.

this appeal presents three basic issues two are rather straightforward,and one is slightly more complicated.we begin with the less complicated privacy and end with his asserted right to a hearing.
privacy interest 
massachusetts recognizes an actionable right of privacy.the applicable statute provides that a person shall have a right against unreasonable,substantial or serious interference with his privacy.laws ch.section protects people from disclosure of facts that are of a highly personal or intimate nature when there exists no legitimate,countervailing interest.bratt int l bus.machs,citations omitted see also french united parcel,d,to constitute an invasion of privacy,the invasion must be both unreasonable and serious or substantial.citation omitted.massachusetts does not recognize a cause of action for false light invasion of privacy.canney city of chelsea,citing elm med,rko.rather.laws ch,is typically invoked to remedy the gathering and dissemination of information which the plaintiffs contended was private.schlesinger merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,citations omitted.
as the district court correctly decided,counts i,ii,and iii of the complaint fail,as a matter of law.neither the complaint nor dasey objection to summary judgment identified any facts at all,and certainly no highly personal or intimate facts,about dasey that were either gathered or disseminated by any defendant.
as for the personal or intimate nature of the allegedly private facts disclosed in the videotape,french plainly establishes that activity in the presence of others who owe no duty of category which includes the subject matter of the hardly private.see french,d at.likewise,the gathering and dissemination element has not been met.dasey neither alleged,nor produced any evidence that suggested,that any defendant made or distributed the tape he only alleged that defendants watched it 
even if dasey had been able to satisfy the gathering and dissemination and private facts elements of his claim under.laws ch,that still would not have been enough to survive summary judgment.to be actionable,the gathering and dissemination of private facts must also be unreasonable.when determining the reasonableness of an intrusion,an employer legitimate interest in determining the employees effectiveness in their jobs should be balanced against the seriousness of the intrusion on the employees privacy.police comm r of boston,quoting bratt,at holding that police department compelling interest in determining whether cadets were using drugs outweighed cadets privacy interest in avoiding unannounced urinalysis tests for which sample collection was monitored by police personnel.here,defendants modest intrusion into dasey privacy if reviewing the seized videotape evidence constituted an intrusion at all was entirely reasonable in light of their compelling interest in verifying the truthfulness of his prior assurances regarding illegal drug use 
in sum,dasey privacy claims fail in three ways.given the allegations in his complaint,the factual assertions in his objection to summary judgment,and his failure to identify pertinent information that might have been developed through discovery,this case involves no private facts of any sort no acts constituting gathering or dissemination by defendants and no unreasonable conduct on defendants part.accordingly,the district court entry of judgment in favor of defendants on dasey privacy claims counts i,ii,and iii is affirmed.
in count iv dasey asserted a claim based upon his federal constitutional right to privacy.however,we are aware of no constitutional principle that would bar defendants from,as dasey puts it,using information concerning his private life as the basis for terminating his employment.because that allegation is the sole basis upon which dasey rests his federal constitutional privacy claim,the district court entry of judgment as to that aspect of count iv is affirmed as well.
liberty interest 
dasey included a claim in count iv of the complaint,in which he asserted the deprivation of a liberty interest,occasioned by defendants refusal to grant him a hearing.in their motion for summary judgment,defendants specifically addressed dasey claim.dasey,however,did not respond,not even to the extent of arguing,as he does now on appeal,that summary judgment would be inappropriate due to the limitations placed on discovery.given his failure to press the issue in the district court,defendants say he has forfeited it.we need not dwell on whether dasey has or has not forfeited the issue,however,because we affirm the district court entry of judgment based upon dasey failure to plead a cognizable claim arising from the deprivation of a liberty interest.
a public employer action may deprive an employee of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his or her reputation under circumstances first identified in paul davis,d.this court 
interpreted paul requirements in beitzell jeffrey,cir,stating that the fourteenth amendment procedurally protects reputation only where government action threatens it,with unusually serious harm,as evidenced by the fact that employment or some other right or status is affected.id.at footnote and citations omitted.moreover,the municipality terminating the employee must also be responsible for the dissemination of defamatory charges,in a formal setting and not merely as the result of unauthorized leaks,and thereby significantly have interfered with the employee ability to find future employment.id.at.
silva worden,cir holding that under both the federal constitution and more favorable massachusetts state law,directed verdict for defendant employer was appropriate when plaintiff produced no evidence that defendant disseminated information about the reasons for plaintiff termination.
here,dasey has not alleged any communication by defendants of the charges against him,other than statements made directly to him at msp headquarters on september.his general discharge does not recite the grounds for dismissal,and nothing he presented to the district court suggests any other disclosures by defendants.absent means by which an employee reputation might be threatened with serious terminated public employee has no constitutional right to a hearing.because dasey did not allege,or present any evidence of,conduct by defendants that,if proven,would constitute a deprivation of any constitutionally protected liberty interest,the district court entry of judgment in favor of defendants on that aspect of count iv is affirmed.
property interest 
what remains,then,is dasey claim that he was denied due process when he was summarily discharged by colonel difava,the msp superintendent.the issue before us is whether the district court erred in deciding that dasey had no constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment,and,therefore,was afforded all the process due him as a probationary employee when the superintendent summarily discharged him after concluding he had made a material misstatement of fact related to prior drug use.
dasey contends that,notwithstanding his probationary status,he was entitled to a hearing because the statute granting the right to a hearing to troopers who have completed the probationary period.laws ch,does not expressly preclude extension of that right to probationary troopers.laws ch.requires the msp,as a public employer,to bargain with spam over working conditions,including employee discipline and the collective bargaining agreement cba negotiated by the msp and spam includes a extension of the right to a hearing to all troopers,probationary and veteran alike,a provision that overrides the msp rule subjecting troopers to summary discharge.he further argues that even if he was not entitled to a hearing under the cba,he still had a reasonable expectation of continued employment and thus a protected property interest and the right to a hearing based upon the customs and practices of the msp.finally he says that the district court resolution of that disputed issue,whether a custom or practice of granting hearings to probationary troopers existed was inappropriate on summary judgment.
to prevail on his claim dasey must establish that defendants deprived him of a constitutional right,in this case,his property interest in continued employment,without due process.

the terms of dasey employment are not set out in any single document,but are found in three places.laws ch.msp rules and the cba.laws ch,provides,in pertinent part 
any uniformed member of the state police who has served for one year or more and against whom charges have been preferred shall be tried by a board to be appointed by the colonel or,at the request of the officer,may be tried by a board consisting of the colonel.
the msp rules,promulgated by the,under the authority of.laws ch,contain two provisions relating to a trooper right to a hearing.rule mirrors.laws ch,in providing that a member who has served for one year or more and has been formally charged in accordance with department rules and regulations shall be tried by a state police trial board appointed by the.in contrast,rule,quoted above,explicitly provides that a uniformed member of the state police who has served for less than one year is on probationary status,and may be discharged by the superintendent without any hearing.
as noted,the third source describing terms of dasey employment is the cba,which provides,in part,as follows 
except as otherwise limited by an express provision of this agreement,the employer shall have the right to exercise complete control and discretion over its organization and technology,including but not limited to,the determination of the standards of services to be provided and standards of productivity and performance of its employees the establishment revision of personnel evaluation programs the determination of the methods,means and personnel by which its operations are to be conducted the determination of the content of job classifications the appointment,promotion,assignment,direction and transfer of personnel the suspension,demotion,discharge,or any other appropriate action against its employees with just cause the relief from duty of its employees because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons the establishment of reasonable work rules and the taking of all
