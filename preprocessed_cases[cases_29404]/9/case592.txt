john sullivan has had a history of problems with alcohol.in the mid,he enrolled in treatment at the long island shelter detox center in boston.he joined the alcoholics anonymous program in and has subsequently undergone other forms of treatment.still,his problems with alcohol have persisted.
sullivan also has a long and seemingly successful employment history in the retail sector.during the mid,at approximately the same time that he was dealing with his alcoholism,he was working in the department at jordan marsh in boston.after being laid off from that position when the economy slowed in the late,he took a series of retail jobs over the next five to seven years.those positions ranged from selling office supplies and jewelry to planning and stocking the opening of a new health and nutrition store.while he did not stay at any of these jobs for an extended period of time,he did not leave them for disciplinary reasons.around sullivan took a sales job with brooks brothers in boston,where he excelled and was eventually promoted to a management position.however,he resigned that position in july because he grew unhappy with the work environment and because he wanted to advance his sales career.
sullivan was hired by neiman marcus as a sales associate in its boston store in march.by june of that year he had been promoted to assistant manager of the store gift gallery,where he was responsible for supervising one employee,ramon lora.sullivan remained in this position until susan parker,neiman marcus human resources manager,sent him a letter on september,informing him that he had been terminated effective august.
neiman marcus claims that it made the actual decision to terminate sullivan on august,in response to his behavior on the previous day,when he left work to go to lunch with a number of his at a local mexican restaurant.laura lane,neiman marcus human resource coordinator in boston,was among the who attended that lunch,and she later wrote a memorandum to susan parker detailing sullivan behavior at the bar and after lunch.according to lane,sullivan ordered a vodka and cranberry juice with lunch.he did not consume that drink during lunch,but she claimed that he was acting kind of strange,was talking more boisterous than normal,did seem himself,and sounded intoxicated.sullivan remained in the bar area of the restaurant after his returned to the store.according to neiman marcus,lane reported these observations to parker later that afternoon,but by the time the two spoke,sullivan had called parker,told her that his father had medical problems,and requested to leave early.parker granted his request.
later that same afternoon,ramon lora supposedly informed parker that he was resigning his position because he did not respect sullivan and could no longer work for a person he did not respect.he said that sullivan frequently drank at work and was drunk during the day and that sullivan abused lora when he drank.lora also gave this information to neiman marcus loss prevention manager,paul karbowski,and said that sullivan had been drinking vodka out of a soda bottle in the gift gallery stock room.karbowski searched the desk that sullivan used and found an empty bottle of absolut vodka and a bottle of mountain dew in one of the drawers.based on this information,parker concluded that sullivan had been drinking during work hours.
sullivan did not report to work on august or and did not call the store.parker called neiman marcus corporate headquarters on august and supposedly decided to terminate him on that day.sullivan called parker on august and informed her that he had a problem with alcohol and was entering an alcohol rehabilitation program.according to sullivan,parker informed him that he could have the time off from work to attend the rehabilitation program,and that he should speak with her when the program ended.after being discharged from the rehabilitation program on august,sullivan contacted parker by telephone,and she informed him that she needed to talk with him concerning the termination of his employment.although they agreed to meet the next day,sullivan did not attend the meeting.neiman marcus sent sullivan a letter on september,informing him that his employment had been terminated on august,for violation of company policies concerning the use of alcohol on the job.
sullivan filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on april,and received a right to sue letter on may.he then filed suit against neiman marcus in the united states district court,alleging that neiman marcus failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability or,in the alternative,that it illegally discriminated against him in response to his disability.neiman marcus claimed that he had been fired because he had consumed alcohol during the work day in violation of company rules and not because he was an alcoholic.it also claimed that the decision to terminate him had been made before he notified the company that he was entering the rehabilitation program to address an alcohol problem.on this basis,with appropriate supporting documentation,neiman marcus sought summary judgment.
in response,submitting his own documentation,sullivan denied drinking on the job and denied the misconduct attributed to him by on august during and after the lunch at the mexican restaurant.for a variety of reasons set forth in the summary judgment record,he insisted that the neiman marcus investigation into his misconduct was inadequate.although he did not dispute that he put the vodka bottle in his desk found by neiman marcus loss prevention manager,paul karbowski,he said that his brother borrowed his suit jacket and put the bottle in the inside pocket of the jacket when he was done.sullivan then put the vodka bottle in the desk but insists that he did not drink the alcohol.more generally,sullivan claimed that neiman marcus did not decide to terminate him for misconduct on august.instead,they decided to terminate him after he informed the company on august that he had to undergo treatment for alcoholism.in his view,the company made that decision because of its concerns about his alcoholism rather than misconduct on the job.
after reviewing the summary judgment record,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of neiman marcus,concluding that t here is no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that plaintiff was fired for a disability,alcoholism rather than his employer rational belief,even if mistaken,that he engaged in possession of alcohol and intoxication in violation of company policy.this appeal followed.
although neiman marcus defends the ground for the district court decision on appeal,it focuses initially on a different ground for absence of evidence in the summary judgment record that sullivan was disabled within the meaning of the ada we may affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on any basis that is manifest in the record.john danielson,cir.further,it is well settled that t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence is insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.consequently,a party opposing summary judgment must present definite,competent evidence to rebut the motion.torres dupont de nemours,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.we choose to focus on the disability issue,which is largely unencumbered by the dispute
