opinion of the court 
marvin herr,a land developer,appeals the grant of summary judgment to pequea township township and its three supervisors,virginia brady,bruce groff,and martin hughes collectively,defendants,in this civil rights action.herr alleges that his right to substantive due process was violated by an eleven year campaign of the township and its officers to delay and obstruct his development of an industrial park.
the defendants adopted a land use plan and a sewer facilities plan based in part on their view that industrial development within the township should be restricted.over the next eleven years,herr,who wished to construct an industrial park and who had applied to the lancaster county planning commission lcpc for approval of a subdivision plan prior to the effective date of these plans,sought the necessary authorization for his development from the lcpc,the department of environmental review der,the environmental hearing board ehb,the zoning hearing board zhb,and the courts.the township participated in the proceedings before each of these bodies.while it acknowledged that herr project was grandfathered under the prior land use plan if he completed it within five years,the township insisted that he had no vested right to municipal sewer services under the prior sewer facilities plan and argued that the township new plan should be enforced.after herr secured an order from the der directing the township to amend its sewer facilities plan so as to provide municipal sewer service to his property and obtained a land use permit from the lcpc,the township took the position in further proceedings that not all conditions of the lcpc approval had been fulfilled and that the five year grandfathering had expired before completion of the project.ultimately,herr secured the necessary authority to go forward with his industrial park.
herr claims that the defendants conduct with respect to his proposed development was motivated throughout by a strong desire to preserve agricultural land and restrain development in the township.in support of this claim,he has tendered evidence tending to show that the individual defendants had run for office on platforms and that their adoption of a new zoning ordinance and sewer facilities plan was intended to make it more difficult for developers to secure approvals of their projects.herr stresses,for example,that the new zoning ordinance reduced the land zoned industrial by percent.
while herr points to the defendants adoption of the new zoning ordinance and sewer plan as evidence of their bias,we do not understand him to contend that the defendants actions with respect to those plans violated his right to substantive due process.decisions on whether to adopt or amend zoning ordinances and municipal services plans are legislative ones that must survive due process review unless the governmental body could have had no legitimate reason for its decisions.pace resources,shrewsbury township,cir.the desire to limit development is such a legitimate reason.id.
rather,herr claims that the defendants conspired to prevent him from securing the necessary approvals from other government agencies,or to delay the receipt of those approvals until his project would no longer be grandfathered under the prior ordinance.in support of this contention,he submitted what he regards as a smoking gun letter from alan peterson,the chairman of the pequea township environmental advisory council,to the township legal counsel dated february.that letter states in part 
only virginia brady and i in the township know the following do not state this back to the township in any manner.the owner must sell the lots,then all land development plans must be approved by or they become nonconforming lots in the ag.district.obviously the longer we can stall if we ca win this with the department of environmental review,the better.
according to herr,the defendants conspiracy consisted of resisting before the lcpc,the der,the board,and the courts herr efforts to secure the right to proceed instructing its own personnel to carefully scrutinize herr proposal in order to identify any possible problems and communicating with the lcpc,the der,the state fish commission,the state game commission,and other governmental agencies voicing various concerns about the proposed project.
herr relies on a line of our cases which hold that a township or other agency acting under color of state law denies a landowner substantive due process if it denies or delays action on his permit application for reasons unrelated to the merits of the application.see woodwind estates,gretkowski,cir holding that delay of permitting process because of community resistance to proposed low income housing project provided jury with a basis from which it could reasonably find that decision maker acted in bad faith or due to an improper motive violating developer substantive due process rights deblasio zoning bd.of adjustment,cir holding that denial of permit based on decision maker personal financial interest,if proven,establishes a violation of the right to be free from arbitrary and capricious government action blanche.bensalem township,cir holding that conspiracy to delay permits for industrial park for political reasons unrelated to the merits of an application is sufficient to establish a substantive due process violation parkway garage,city of philadelphia,cir holding that the jury could reasonably infer improper motive when lease was allegedly terminated based upon decision maker economic interest bello walker,cir holding that a municipal corporation denial of a building permit for partisan political or personal reasons unrelated to the merits of the case,if proven,establishes a substantive due process violation.herr correctly points out that,while the ultimate issue before the lcpc and the other governmental bodies was whether to permit a new industrial park,resolution of that issue properly turned on whether his development met the criteria established by law.the defendants opposition,according to herr,was motivated by a determination to stop his development without regard to whether it met those criteria.
unlike the defendants in the cases cited by herr,however,the township and its supervisors were not authorized to issue permits for herr industrial park.the lcpc alone had that authority.herr claim is thus not that the defendants subverted a decision making process by taking irrelevant considerations into account.it is rather that the defendants contested issues before the bodies authorized to resolve various permitting issues because they wished to defeat or delay the approval of herr project by those bodies.this claim is materially different from the claims asserted in bello and its progeny.
we conclude that there is evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the township challenged conduct was motivated by a desire to stop herr development.at the same time,we conclude that there is no evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the township took frivolous positions or otherwise unreasonably delayed the proceedings before the various state bodies.we hold that where a township participates in proceedings before other governmental agencies authorized to resolve issues like those here presented,the township and its supervisors are not subject to liability for delay occasioned by those proceedings solely because their participation was motivated by a desire to delay or prevent the project for which approval is sought 
herr sought to develop approximately acres of land that he owns in pequea township,lancaster county,pennsylvania.by october,he learned of a proposed land use plan under which the zoning of his land would be changed so as to permit only agricultural use.on december,herr submitted to the lcpc a subdivision plan to construct an industrial park on this property millwood industrial park or millwood.at the time he submitted this plan,his property was zoned industrial,and the existing sewage facilities plan the sewage facilities plan was a plan providing public sewers pursuant to the pennsylvania sewage facilities act act.the lcpc considered and rejected the industrial park plan twice,and herr resubmitted it twice.ultimately,the lcpc granted preliminary conditional approval on october,and preliminary unconditional approval on february.
after herr subdivision plan was filed but several months before the lcpc approvals,pequea township,on august,adopted a new township map to conform with lancaster county comprehensive plan.on the new map,the land where herr proposed industrial park was to be situated was rezoned from industrial to agricultural.under pennsylvania law,herr was allowed five years from the date of the preliminary approval to complete his development following adoption of the new zoning,the township began to revise its sewage facilities plan to comport with its new land planning scheme.on june,the township repealed prior sewage plans and adopted a new sewage plan.the new plan provided for the extension of public sewers into areas of the township designated for development but not into areas designated for agricultural use.accordingly,the permitted sewage disposal for the area in which millwood was situated was changed from public sewers to disposal systems.as required,the township submitted its sewage facilities plan to the der for approval under act.
on july,herr requested that the township amend its sewage facilities plan so as to provide for municipal sewer service to millwood.a little over a month later,on september,that request was denied herr then filed a private request with the der under.ann.seeking an order requiring the township to amend its sewage plan as it had been requested to do at the time of herr private request,the department was still reviewing the plan that the township had submitted.
on september,the lcpc gave conditional final approval to a final plan for millwood that had been submitted on august,the august plan.the approval was conditioned on herr satisfaction of over forty conditions including his securing approval for his proposed sewage disposal.on february,the der granted herr private request and issued an order directing the township to revise its sewage plan.
several years of litigation ensued.on march,the ehb reversed the decision of the der.in response to this decision,the der denied herr private request on april.then herr appealed,first to the ehb and next to the commonwealth court.on may,the commonwealth court reversed the ehb decision,found in favor of herr,and remanded the case for further proceedings.on remand,the ehb ultimately granted summary judgment on the sewage disposal issue.the township and the der both filed a petition for reconsideration with the board,which denied the petition,and then a petition for review with the commonwealth court,which,on july,affirmed the board decision.pequea township herr.
throughout the sewer litigation,the township maintained that the law specifying the sewer requirements applicable to the millwood site was the sewer plan.in support of this view,it took the position that the plan became effective without der approval on october,pursuant to c and the der accordingly lacked authority for its original order and the statute grandfathering for five years developments pending approval at the time of a zoning change did not apply to sewer plans and,accordingly,herr had no vested right to public sewer service.the board agreed with the township that the plan became effective on october.the commonwealth court did not reach the merits of that issue but did agree with the township that the grandfathering provision for zoning ordinances did not give herr a right to public sewer services under the plan.pequea township herr.the court nevertheless decided in herr favor on the ground that,even if a landowner proposal is inconsistent with the applicable municipal sewer plan,the der is authorized to require its adoption upon a showing that the provisions of the municipal plan are inadequate to meet the needs of the landowner.the commonwealth court wrote at some length on each of the six contentions raised by the der and the township.
on november,once all the sewage issues were settled,the lcpc determined that herr met all of the remaining conditions for approval and permitted recordation of the final land development plan.the township then appealed this decision to the court of common pleas,arguing that herr failed to meet three of the other conditions imposed by the lcpc when it conditionally approved the august plan and that herr vested rights to application of the zoning ordinance had expired because five years had elapsed since the approval of his preliminary development plan and no valid extension had been granted by the lcpc.
meanwhile,after recordation,herr began construction of his industrial park.during construction,herr erected a sign advertising the sale of lots and began excavation.a township zoning officer issued herr an enforcement notice because he believed that herr had violated the township zoning ordinance for excavation without a zoning permit and advertising the sale of the premises without a zoning permit.herr appealed the enforcement notice to the zoning hearing board zhb,arguing that the township zoning ordinance applied rather than the zoning ordinance.the zhb held that,even if herr substantive rights were determined by the earlier zoning ordinance,he must comply with the procedural requirements of the new ordinance,including its permit requirements.herr appealed to the court of common pleas.
the appeals to the court of common pleas were consolidated.on december,the court decided in favor of herr and against the township.with regard to the issues raised by the township,the court held that the lcpc did not abuse its discretion in granting herr an extension and allowing recordation of his plan.with regard to the issue raised by herr,the court found that the zoning ordinance requiring a permit for excavation and advertising was inapplicable because it was substantive rather than procedural in nature and thus adversely and improperly affected herr substantive rights.the township appealed the court of common pleas decision to the commonwealth court,which affirmed on january.
we agree with the district court that herr had a property interest in millwood which was entitled to protection under the substantive due process element of the fourteenth amendment.herr pequea township,at,wl filed july.see blanche road,at deblasio,at.we thus turn to the issue of whether herr was deprived of that property interest in violation of substantive due process.
with possible exceptions hereafter addressed in section iv,the injuries for which herr seeks redress arise from the delay occasioned by the proceedings before the lcpc,the der,the ehb,the zhb and the courts of pennsylvania.when recovery is sought against a participant in adjudicatory proceedings before state agencies and state courts based on its participation in those proceedings,fundamental interests are implicated that were not implicated in the situations before us in bello and its progeny.both the constitution and the common law provide protection for those who petition the government.
t he first amendment right to petition extends to all departments of government including administrative agencies and the courts.california motor transport trucking unlimited,d.it is made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment.hague committee for indus.the protection it affords thus applies both to petitioning state agencies and to petitioning state courts.moreover,this protection extends not only to petitioning for affirmative relief but also to petitioning in opposition to applications for relief by others.armstrong surgical center,armstrong county mem,cir holding that the first amendment right to petition provides protection for opposition to a competitor application to the state department of health for a certificate of necessity for a medical facility.
while the right to petition conferred by the first and fourteenth amendments does not provide an absolute immunity from liability for actions based on petitioning activity,see california motor transport,at,the supreme court has held that such liability can not be imposed in the absence of a finding that the position taken lacked any reasonable basis.in professional real estate investors,columbia pictures,d,columbia pictures sued professional real estate investors pre for copyright infringement.pre filed a counterclaim under the sherman act and various state laws charging that the copyright infringement suit was a part of a conspiracy to monopolize and restrain trade.when columbia pictures moved for summary judgment based on its constitutionally protected right to petition,pre argued that the copyright suit had been instituted in bad faith,it was brought to restrain trade and without an honest beli ef that the infringement claim was meritorious.id.at.the supreme court acknowledged that petitioning immunity did not extend to liability based on the institution or maintenance of sham litigation but held that litigation could be regarded as a sham only if it is objectively baseless.
we now outline a definition of sham litigation.first,the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.if an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome,the suit is immunized,and an antitrust claim premised on the sham exception must fail.only if challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant subjective motivation.under this second part of our definition of sham,the court should focus on whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor,through the use of the governmental opposed to the outcome of that an anti competitive weapon,omni,at.emphasis in original.

the petitioning immunity that the court upheld in pre was immunity from antitrust liability.the court pointed out,however,that the principles being relied upon were not limited to antitrust liability and noted that the same principles had been applied by it to liability under the national labor relations act.see bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d holding that for a civil suit to be enjoined,there must be both an improper motive on the part of the plaintiff and a lack of a reasonable basis for the suit.moreover,the supreme court in pre stressed that its holding was consistent with the protection traditionally afforded petitioning activity under the common law 
t he court of appeals correctly held that sham litigation must constitute the pursuit of claims so baseless that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect to secure favorable relief.
the existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation.the notion of probable cause,as understood and applied in the tort of wrongful civil proceedings,requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant lacked probable cause to institute an unsuccessful civil lawsuit and that the defendant pressed the action for an improper,malicious purpose.probable cause to institute civil proceedings requires no more than a reasonabl e belie f that there is a chance that a claim may be held valid upon adjudication.because the absence of probable cause is an essential element of the tort,the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense.just as evidence of anticompetitive intent can not affect the objective prong of the sham exception,a showing of malice alone will neither entitle the wrongful civil proceedings plaintiff to prevail nor permit the factfinder to infer the absence of probable cause.

we reached a similar conclusion in brownsville golden age nursing home,wells,cir.there,two private individuals and a public official were charged with having conspired to mount a campaign to get the commonwealth of pennsylvania to revoke the license of the plaintiff nursing home.this conspiracy was alleged to have violated state tort law.in support of its case,the plaintiff submitted a smoking gun letter written by a member of the official staff arguably reflecting an agreement to work together to secure termination of the license.we made the following observations that are instructive here 
in a somewhat analogous situation,it has been held that persons who were successful in persuading the forest service to reduce or abandon its timber sales program to protect the wilderness quality of an area could not be liable under state tort law for interference with an advantageous relationship.sierra club butz.judge zirpoli based the decision on the first amendment right to seek to influence government action.
two lines of cases support the sierra club decision and that which we uphold here the defamation cases,new york times sullivan,d,emphasizing the constitutional importance of communication on matters of public interest and the cases teaching that the collusive use by competitors of legislative,administrative or judicial process does not,without more,give rise to an violation,see,eastern conference noerr motor freight,d california motor transport trucking unlimited,d.
the rule that liability can not be imposed for damage caused by inducing legislative,administrative,or judicial action is applicable here.the conduct on which this suit is based is protected by the firmly rooted principle,endemic to a democratic government,that enactment of and adherence to law is the responsibility of all.
brownsville,at footnote omitted.
also helpful is our decision in mcardle tronetti,cir.there,a state employee,a prison counselor,allegedly prosecuted in bad faith a civil proceeding to have the plaintiff involuntarily committed to a mental health treatment facility.the plaintiff instituted his suit under the civil rights act,claiming a violation of his right to substantive due process.we held that this claim was analogous to a common law tort of malicious use of civil process by a state actor and that claims of malicious prosecution brought under section must include the elements of the common law tort as it has developed.id.at quoting rose bartle,cir.we cited to section of the restatement second of torts as evidencing those elements.that section provides 
one who takes an active part in the initiation,continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another is subject to liability to the other for wrongful civil proceedings if 
a he acts without probable cause,and primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper adjudication of the claim in which the proceedings are based,and 
b except when they are ex parte,the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person against whom they are brought.
in determining probable cause for initiation of civil proceedings,all that is necessary is that the claimant reasonably believe that there is a sound chance that his claim may be held legally valid upon adjudication.restatement second of torts,cmt.e 
herr claim against the defendants in this case is analogous to the common law tort of malicious use of civil process by a state actor.accordingly,liability can not be imposed under the teaching of mcardle unless all elements of the common law tort are satisfied.this includes the requirement that the defendants resisted herr efforts to secure approval without probable cause and primarily for a purpose other than securing the proper adjudication of herr claim.nor,of course,can liability be imposed in a manner inconsistent with the constitution.
as justice souter points out in his concurring opinion in pre,there may be a conceptual difference between the constitutional probable cause requirement as articulated in pre and the term probable cause as employed by the restatement and the common law.pre,at.souter,concurring.pre probable cause is wholly may be imposed only if no reasonable litigant could realistically expect to secure favorable relief.pre,at.the common law probable cause may have a subjective defendant must reasonably believe that there is a sound chance that his claim may be held legally valid.restatement second of torts,cmt.e.in most situations,this will be a distinction without a difference.if a person has undertaken to participate in civil proceedings and the circumstances are such that he could have a reasonable expectation that he may succeed,it will be the rare case indeed in which he does not actually have that expectation.in any event,we need not determine in this case whether there are cases in which the distinction would make a difference.it does not here.
the record in this case will not support a conclusion that the defendants resistance to herr application was frivolous in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect to prevail.nor will it support an inference that the defendants had no belief that they had a sound chance of prevailing.as the district court pointed out,they took no appeal from the lcpc original conditional approval in and thus did not contest that herr was entitled for five years to the benefits of the prior zoning ordinance.moreover,their basic position in the sewer litigation that herr had no vested rights to municipal sewer services under the sewage facilities plan was ultimately sustained by the commonwealth court.thus,what herr characterizes as a bad faith end run around the grandfathering provision of the zoning law was,in reality,a winning argument.even herr smoking gun letter,to the extent it can be taken as reflecting the defendants views,evidences that the township expected that it might well prevail before the der and that the possibility of the five year period expiring was regarded as only an additional,incidental benefit of the defendants resistance before the state agency and the courts.
while herr characterizes the defendants resistance in conclusory terms as frivolous,he has not identified any specific issue and articulated why it was not a litigable one.our search of the record has not identified such an issue,and we find no suggestion in the opinions of the agencies that any of them regarded the township positions as frivolous.both the opinion of the commonwealth court in the sewer litigation and the opinion of the court of common pleas in the ensuing litigation analyze the issues presented with care and some detail.if either court had viewed one or more of those issues as frivolous,we are confident that some evidence of that view would have found its way into the opinions 
to the extent the rule of decision here is grounded in the common law,it makes no difference whether we are analyzing the liability of the township or the liability of the supervisors in their individual capacities.the elements of herr claim would be the same in either event,and if herr has not come forward with evidence that satisfies each essential element of the analogous state tort,summary judgment is appropriate.to the extent the rule of decision here is an immunity rooted in the first amendment,the analysis of the township liability involves an additional issue.it is clear that public officials sued in their individual capacity are entitled to the immunity provided under the doctrine.see brownsville golden age nursing home,at.we have found no case addressing the issue of whether a municipal corporation is entitled to such immunity we predict,however,that the supreme court would hold that it is.
in situations of this kind,a township and its supervisors represent their constituents and facilitate their participation in the governmental process.indeed,if municipal governments are discouraged from utilizing municipal funds to finance participation in proceedings before other governmental agencies,their citizens are likely to be left without a voice in important matters pending before those agencies.moreover,municipal governments are among those most likely to be in possession of information relevant to the kinds of decisions that had to be made here and are among those most likely to be aware of the decision makers need for information.a rule which would discourage municipalities from expressing concerns and taking a position before other governmental agencies would deprive the government of a valuable source of information.noerr,at.granting petitioning immunity to townships would thus serve the purposes of the right to petition clause.while the supreme court has held that townships are not entitled to the,common law,qualified immunity enjoyed by public officials who exercise discretionary functions,owen city of independence,d,the rationale of that decision is inapposite here.petitioning immunity is a limited immunity based on a specific provision of the constitution itself and extending it to townships would not only be consistent with,but would further,the purposes of the right to petition clause.
we therefore hold that neither the township nor its supervisors may be held liable based on the delays occasioned by the proceedings before the lcpc and other public bodies in the absence of a showing,not made upon this record,that they lacked probable cause for the positions they took.
in addition to the claims predicated on the delays occasioned by the proceedings before the lcpc and other public bodies,herr brief makes the following allegations 
as in blanche road,there is substantial evidence that defendants tried to delay or stop herr development through extra scrutiny of herr improper reviews and searches for problems with or additional conditions for the plans.additional problems or conditions,the township supposed,might cause the lcpc to disapprove the project or herr to abandon it.for example,there is evidence that defendants caused the township zoning officer to give special attention to reviews of plans for millwood industrial park.similarly,there is evidence that the township conducted numerous,reviews to find every possible violation in herr plans blanche road,at and,thereafter,reported all such reviews to the lcpc in the hope that the lcpc would disapprove the plans.
finally,there is evidence of the township and the supervisors efforts to foster unfounded opposition to millwood industrial park from public agencies and private parties alike.the township repeatedly sent out letters attempting to engender any concerns or otherwise get herr on something else blanche road,at as a means to slow down and shut down id.at the project.
appellant br.at.
while these charges are cast in a somewhat different form and are obviously intended to bring these aspects of herr case within the teachings of blanche road,we conclude that they,too,are barred by the protection afforded for petitioning activity.to the extent these claims are based on communications to the lcpc and other responsible state agencies,a straightforward application of the principles already discussed leads to the conclusion that there can be no liability.calling concerns about a proposed development to the attention of the responsible state agencies lies at the core of privileged activity,and this is true without regard to the number of concerns expressed so long as there is some rational basis for those concerns.in making these charges,herr has identified no problem communicated to a state agency that has been shown to have no rational basis.
in blanche road,we held that the defendants might have exposed themselves to liability by ordering that blanche road applications be reviewed with greater scrutiny in order to slow down the development.at.we so held,however,in the context of a situation in which the defendants comprised the permitting authority and their alleged conduct improperly interfered with the process by which the township issued permits for reasons unrelated to the merits of the application for permits.blanche road,at.
here,the charge is that the defendants instructed township employees to apply extra scrutiny in their review of herr proposal in order to identify problems relevant to herr application before the lcpc and other state agencies.we conclude that this essential precursor to the township actual communications with the state agencies also comes within the law protection for petitioning activity and that this is true regardless of how thorough the employees were instructed to be in identifying problems with the jurisdiction of the petitioned agencies.
the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.
i must dissent from the majority opinion,because i would hold that there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether pequea township actions violated herr substantive due process rights and,therefore,i would remand for trial.i part company from the majority,which holds that the amendment right to petition permits the township to use litigation and the judicial process in order to prevent herr from developing his property.for the following reasons,in my opinion,the majority has erred 
many of the actions taken by pequea township,which deliberately delayed and obstructed herr in the development of his property,were actions which arose from other than court proceedings and the judicial process,and thus may not be considered within the rubric of the township right to petition under the amendment.in evidence in support of this substantive due process claim is not simply limited to the township litigious behavior.
pequea itself has rejected any claim or theory dependent upon the right to petition.in has declined to rely on any such theory even after it was encouraged to do so.
even if a right to petition were relevant in this case as the majority believes it to be,it can not defeat or overcome an individual substantive due process right where the township of pequea has engaged in arbitrary and capricious developmental conduct.in improper motives of the township can not be immunized by resorting to a right to petition theory and the majority has cited to no authority which would support such aberrant jurisprudence.
a.in an effort to bolster its conclusion that herr action is barred by pequea township right to theory to which not even pequea itself has majority claims that the noerr pennington doctrine supports its thesis but immunity applies to private,not governmental,entities,and as i have pointed out and will amplify later in this dissent,herr charges encompass more than just petitioning activity.in immunity may not be looked to in an effort to resolve this controversy.
of even greater significance,the majority has ignored,and has not even referred to,a third circuit opinion relevant here.grant pittsburgh,cir holds,albeit in a qualified immunity context,that claims of substantive due process violations of the kind alleged by herr require careful examination by the courts of the motive and intent of the relevant government entity involved.in majority opinion would ignore grant teachings,and would preclude herr evidence of improper motive and intent on the basis of a right to petition.that preclusion is not recognized in our jurisprudence.
it should be recalled that herr is a landowner with property in pequea township.he submitted a plan for an industrial park to the lancaster county planning commission lcpc,which granted preliminary and final approval to his plan.according to the relevant pequea township ordinances,herr industrial park was to be provided with public sewer service.it was only after herr received approval from the lcpc that the township modified its ordinances and engaged in multiple court and other actions which the record reveals were designed to prevent the development of herr property in accordance with the industrial nature of the zoning approval.it did so because the township desired the property to be used for agricultural purposes rather than the zoned industrial purposes.
herr,whose legal position to develop an industrial property was eventually upheld by the courts of pennsylvania faced roadblocks at every step of his attempts at industrial development for over eleven years.it was not just a case of litigating his rights which he was forced to do,but it was a case where the township,which had a very deliberate and intentional motive to prevent herr from developing his property,obstructed herr at every turn of the road.
both parties tried this case to summary judgment on the issue that herr substantive due process rights had been violated.counsel for both parties rejected the majority suggestion that mcardle tronetti,cir,had anything to do with herr predicament.mcardle is a classic malicious abuse of prosecution case,whose viability is in substantial doubt after the supreme court decision in albright oliver,d.moreover,neither counsel relied on any aspect of pequea township amendment right to petition or the doctrine.rather,both parties in this case approached the issue on appeal in a one asserting and the other denying a substantive due process violation.
the plaintiff,herr,contended that pequea township was motivated by a desire to retain his property as agricultural property.herr,who had purchased the property and was grandfathered into the zoning of the property as industrial so long as he developed the property within five years,claimed that pequea township acts were taken in bad faith and with an improper motive,thus preventing him from developing his property.pequea,on the other hand,argued that motive was not an issue,and that if it had been,their motives were proper.
i suggest that this is the issue that must be resolved,not the issues manufactured by the majority on which they have decided to resolve this controversy.
we have held that state action,which is the type of state action at issue here,may give rise to a substantive due process claim upon allegations that the government deliberately and arbitrarily abused its power.nicholas pennsylvania state university,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a substantive due process claim arising out of state action has two elements we must look,as a threshold matter,to whether the property interest being deprived is fundamental under the constitution,nicholas,at and the plaintiff also must demonstrate that he was the victim of a governmental action that was arbitrary,irrational,or tainted by improper motive.woodwind estates,gretkowski,cir.grant city of pittsburgh,cir adds that a court is to consider evidence of a defendant state of mind here,pequea when motivation is an essential element as it is here of the plaintiff herr civil rights claim.
there can be no doubt that the property interest at issue here is fundamental.indeed,as we held in deblasio zoning board of adjustment for the township of west amwell,one would be to find a property interest more worthy of substantive due process protection than ownership,cir.accordingly,i believe,and the majority agrees as well,see op at,that the district court properly held that herr interest in developing his property was an interest worthy of due process protection.
because herr has alleged a violation of a fundamental property interest,it must be determined whether herr has suffered from a governmental action that was arbitrary,irrational,or tainted by improper motive.bello walker,cir.we have made clear that,i n disputed factual situations,the determination of the existence of improper motive or bad faith is properly made by the jury as the finder of fact.woodwind estates,gretkowski,cir.we also observed in woodwind that we have not hesitated to vacate a grant of summary judgment or a judgment as a matter of law where the evidence at least plausibly showed that the government took actions against the developer for indefensible reasons unrelated to the merits of the zoning dispute.at.in this context,the intentional blocking or delaying of the issuance of permits for reasons unrelated to the merits of the permit application violates principles of substantive due process and is actionable under.woodwind,at.
looking at the facts in the light most favorable to herr,because it was pequea township,the defendant,which had moved for summary judgment,i believe that a rational jury could and would certainly find that the township intentionally blocked or delayed herr development of his property for reasons unrelated to the merits of his development plan.indeed,the evidence suggests that the township used every access to the hinder development of herr land.
there is extensive evidence from which a jury could find that the township acted arbitrarily,irrationally,or with improper motive.alan peterson peterson,chairman of the pequea township environmental advisory council,sent numerous letters in to such places as the nature conservancy,the pennsylvania historical and museum commission,the pennsylvania game commission,and the pennsylvania fish commission,asking them to review herr proposal for possible endangered species or other environmental rarities,for possible historical or archaeological significance,and for species of special concern.peterson also sent another round of letters in early to the lancaster water authority,the pennsylvania power light company,the suburban lancaster sewer authority,and department of transportation,among others,informing them about concerns related to herr proposal.additionally,virginia brady brady,a member of the township board of supervisors and a defendant in this action,sent similar letters in october to the department of transportation,the bureau of dams and waterways,the department of the army,and the lancaster city engineer in october.
peterson sent a letter to eugene dice,an attorney,stating 
only virginia brady and i in the township know the following do not state this back to the township in any manner.the owner must sell the lots,then all the land development plans must be approved by or they become nonconforming lots in the ag.district.obviously the longer we can stall if we ca win this with der,the better we want this defeated after our four year struggle

herr received a letter in april from robert sneath,whose company had been a potential buyer of space at herr proposed industrial park,in which sneath requested that herr release him from the agreement of sale,explaining 
my associate,glenn warfel,talked to the zoning officer about our plans.his name is wes brocknoe glenn was informed that your plans were under litigation and the land was still zoned agricultural by pequea township.the zoning officer was not at liberty to talk about it.with timing important to us,this was not encouraging.
app sneath also stated,quite frankly,everything i have heard about dealing with pequea township is negative.i have no desire to invest my money in a township with a negative attitude.it looks like this development could take forever to be approved by the township.app 
in light of this evidence,it is clear to me that the issue of whether the township had an improper motive must be sent to the jury.indeed,it is inconceivable to me how the district court could have held otherwise.the district court analyzed the evidence without regard to the fact that the issue of improper motive was before the court on a summary judgment motion,in which the court was required to draw all reasonable inferences in herr favor.instead,the district court several times drew inferences in pequea township favor in direct contravention of the summary judgment standard.
for instance,the district court drew the following conclusions from the evidence the reasonable inference to be drawn is that defendants wished to zone another land parcel which was permitted to remain industrial consistently with its current use,rather than carry out the pointless exercise of changing the zoning to agricultural but grandfathering the preexisting industrial use there is no evidence before us that defendants knew they could not stop development of millwood park,yet acted merely to delay and harass plaintiff the mere fact that peterson claims that virginia brady was aware of the time limit imposed by the grandfather clause under which herr land was zoned industrial does not imply an improper motive on her part there was no basis for an inference that defendants pursued the sewer litigation for any purpose other than a genuine desire not to have millwood park come about in the form proposed by plaintiff and t here is no basis to determine what the true motives of the township were.
additionally,i should note that a motive on the part of the township to prevent industrialization of land,not to have millwood park come about in the form proposed by plaintiff,app a,is not related to the merits of the zoning dispute between herr and the township.herr had already submitted his plan to a separate governmental entity the lcpc,which approved herr plan before the township could pass legislation which would prevent the proposed development.the fact that the township properly enacted new zoning and sewage ordinances with the goal of reducing development does not mean that its actions to attempt to defeat a development plan that had legitimately escaped its regulation were proper.indeed,in my view,the township motive in enacting new ordinances and plans relating to land use is irrelevant,and the district court erred in considering it.
the majority holds that the township actions are protected by the amendment right to petition and that,therefore,they can not form the basis of herr substantive due process claim.holding that herr could not prove any injury without these actions,the majority affirms the district court summary judgment dismissal of herr substantive due process claim.i can not agree with this holding because the right to petition does not bar substantive due process liability for litigation arbitrarily and irrationally initiated by a governmental entity.
pequea actions other and apart from litigation 
as an initial matter,herr evidence in support of his substantive due process claim is not simply limited to the township litigious behavior.herr presents evidence of a litany of conduct by the township above and beyond its litigation activity over a span of eleven of which was purportedly designed to delay and block the industrial development of herr land.
this evidence includes proof of the township campaign since to find problems with,or raise unfounded concerns about,millwood industrial park with the hope that the problems raised would lead to delays leading past the grandfather period proof of the township extra scruntiny of herr applications in an effort to delay the development past the period proof of the township denial of herr applications for public sewer service motivated by reasons unrelated to issue but rather by pequea desire to hold up herr development and proof that the township issuance of an enforcement notice was part of a campaign to delay development.this conduct has nothing to do with litigation or petitioning activity before the lcpc or state courts,and assuming the majority right to petition is would not be immunized by the amendment.
counsel rejection of pequea petitioning right 
next,pequea township itself has rejected any claim or theory dependent upon the right to petition,declining to rely on any such theory even after it was encouraged to do so.not only was this theory never raised,entertained or discussed by the very party to whose benefit it would redound,but when asked for supplemental memoranda pertaining to that issue,both herr and pequea declined to embrace or rely on such a theory.they did so because both parties recognized that this case was a garden variety substantive due process proceeding.
likewise,the majority reliance upon mcardle tronetti,cir which it urged upon the inapposite.there,we analyzed the plaintiff claim as a malicious use of civil process claim in violation of his amendment rights.referring to lee mihalich,cir,and its progeny,we reasoned that a claim of malicious use of process may state a claim if it includes the elements of that common law tort as it has developed.mcardle,at.accordingly,we required that such a claim requires proof that the defendant acted in a grossly negligent manner or without probable clause and primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper adjudication of the claim in which the proceedings are based and the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person against whom they are brought.id.
setting aside the issue of mcardle questionable viability after the supreme court decision in albright oliver,d the majority,by claiming that herr claim against the defendants in this case is analogous to the common law tort of malicious use of civil process by a state actor,see op.at,again directly contradicts the repeated and equivocal positions of both herr and the township counsel that herr claims were not malicious use of process claims.indeed,in a supplemental letter brief dated june,ordered by this court,the township specifically conceded that 
the mcardle principles do not apply to the instant appeal because the issues regarding abuse of process have not been raised by herr in the instant appeal and because herr has not produced evidence to allow a finding of abuse of process,the township argues that mcardle has no relevance to the instant appeal t he principles of mcardle have no determinative effect on this honorable court ability to decide that there is insufficient evidence of record to support a reasonable jury finding of a substantive due process violation.
similarly,herr agrees that his claims are not malicious use of process claims.while i acknowledge that we should recognize the correct jurisprudence even if counsel declines to do so,we should not,as the majority has done here,devise our own theory of liability or immunity after counsel has deliberately rejected that theory,particularly since it is flawed and lacks support in our jurisprudence.indeed,i think it is inappropriate and improvident to substitute a panel theory for counsel,particularly when it is obvious from our own jurisprudence that the issue of improper motive in a substantive due process case is one for the jury and not for the judge.see woodwind,at grant,at.
nevertheless,even if mcardle were applicable,herr claims as discussed previously encompass more than just abuse of process.rather,his claims are based upon specific evidence showing that the township blocked and delayed the industrial development of his land at every possible turn.the use of the court system is just one,albeit important,evidentiary example of the township tactics.accordingly,the holding in if too circumspect to be of value as to herr claims of substantive due process.
c.a right to petition can not trump illegal municipal actions and can not defeat a legitimate substantive due process claim 
even if a right to petition were relevant in this case,it can not defeat or overcome an individual substantive due process right where evidence has been presented that the township of pequea has engaged in arbitrary and capricious behavior.the improper motives of the township can not be immunized by resorting to a right to petition and the majority has cited to no authority which would support such aberrant jurisdiction.
though it is true that the first amendment encompasses a right to petition,this right is not absolute.san filippo bongiovanni,cir.additionally,the doctrine of substantive due process does not require that the actions taken by the government be illegal to constitute a due process violation.instead,substantive due process protects individual liberty against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.collins harker heights,at.quoting daniels williams,d emphasis added.indeed,courts have repeatedly explained that substantive due process protects against the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government.bello walker,cir internal quotation marks omitted.implicit in this statement is that the actions that form the basis of substantive due process claims are actions that are within the government power but nevertheless may be constitutional violations in a particular case because of the government motive in exercising that power.
accordingly,because of this clear indication in substantive due process jurisprudence that it is not the government legal authority to exercise its power but its motive that is relevant in analyzing a substantive due process claim,i can not agree with the majority holding that the township did not violate herr substantive due process rights simply because its actions were protected by the right to petition.
by immunizing motive and intent whenever there is petitioning activity on the part of the government,the majority effectively renders the amendment powerless,turning it into mere surplusage any time improper litigious activity by a municipality is asserted.this would essentially insulate government officials from liability for the very harm our substantive due process precedents have sought to redress using government authority to take actions that,because of the improper motives of public officials,have no rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.grant,at emphasis added.
in this way,the right to,by the majority reasoning,virtually always defeats any evidence of a substantive due process insulate the township from the very arbitrary and capricious governmental conduct that is meant to be protected by the amendment.by this reasoning,the right to petition would also immunize a municipality of liability under the equal protection a amendment evidence that a particular municipality had pursued delay litigation tactics because of an individual race or religious beliefs,just so long as it could articulate some justification to support its lawsuit.such a result is clearly contrary to our constitutional jurisprudence.
noerr pennington is not applicable and not relevant to government misconduct 
in an effort to bolster its conclusion that herr due process claim is barred by the township right to petition,the majority claims that the doctrine supports its thesis.in our most recent exposition of the doctrine,we have described immunity as follows 
under the doctrine,private parties may be immunized against liability stemming from antitrust injuries flowing from valid petitioning.this includes two distinct types of actions.a petitioner may be immune from the antitrust injuries which result from the petitioning itself.also parties are immune from liability arising from the antitrust injuries caused by government action which results from petitioning.
bedell wholesale company,philip morris,cir citations omitted.rooted in the first amendment and fears about the threat of liability chilling political speech,the doctrine generally insulates a private entity which petitions the government for redress from antitrust liability even if there is an improper purpose or motive behind the petitioning activity.id.at emphasis added.we have also noted that the immunity reaches not only to petitioning the legislative and executive branches of government,but the right to petition extends to all departments of the government,including the judiciary.id.quoting california motor transp.trucking unlimited,d.
the doctrine,and the rationale behind it,however,is not applicable here.first,in this case,it seeks to immunize too much.because herr charges include more than appropriate petitioning activity on pequea part see section,supra,the application of here can not insulate or immunize pequea from herr claims.
second,and more importantly,however,immunity applies to private governmental redress from the government.see video international production,cable communications,applying protection to private cable operator against antitrust,tort and liability,but noting as to municipal liability that protection does not apply to the government see also professional real estate investors,columbia pictures,d protecting private movie companies against antitrust liability bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d extending amendment protection to private employer who filed lawsuit against former employee allegedly in violation of the national labor relations act california motor transport trucking unlimited,d refusing to apply amendment protections to private trucking company because it fell within sham exception gorman towers,bogoslavsky,cir immunizing private defendants against liability on the basis of protection,but holding public officials immune on grounds other than immunity state of missouri national organization for women,cir protecting private women organization against antitrust liability stern united states gypsum,cir protecting corporation and its officers against liability.to the extent that the majority has cited one case that could arguably be seen as extending this immunity to a governmental entity,the protection immunized the party only against statutory liability,not against a constitutional deprivation.see armstrong surgical center,armstrong county memorial hospital,cir 
accordingly,the application of the doctrine can not resolve,and can not be analogous to,the following conflict whether a governmental entity pequea amendment right to petition always trumps an individual citizen herr amendment due process right to be free from arbitrary and capricious government activity the majority provides no authority extending to conduct by government entities which have been shown to have acted in violation of constitutional restrictions.nor do i know of any authority purporting to extend in such a way so as to per se defeat an individual constitutional rights under the amendment.
one of the cases cited by the majority,brownsville golden age nursing home,wells,cir,involved a nursing home operator that filed state tort claims against two private individuals and a public official.there,the nursing home alleged that the defendants improperly scrutinized its operations through a publicity and campaign which ultimately led to its loss of license.this court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment against the nursing home because it failed to raise a material issue of fact on its state law claims of tortious interference with business relations and civil conspiracy.id.at emphasis in original.specifically,we agreed with the district court that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendants actions were unlawful or improper as required by those torts since the pennsylvania courts had conclusively determined that the revocation of the home license was warranted because of its serious violations of nursing home standards.id.
invoking,by analogy,the principles underlying defamation cases,new york times sullivan,d,and cases,we held that the defendants actions in calling plaintiff violations to the attention of state and federal authorities and eliciting public interest can not serve as the basis of tort liability.brownsville,at.this ruling is a far cry from the situation in this case wherein herr has presented credible evidence showing that the township motivations behind its delay tactics and in litigating the sewer issue were prompted by a desire to thwart herr from his rightful claim to develop his property as well as a scheme to delay herr sufficiently such that his grandfather period would expire.in addition,unlike the allegations made in brownsville,herr claims sound in direct constitutional authority and not in state common law or statutory liability.
grant pittsburgh 
finally,by disregarding evidence of the township motive and intent,the majority has ignored our holding in grant pittsburgh,cir.there,grant a land developer brought suit against certain city officials under alleging,inter alia,violations of his substantive due process rights.in particular,grant claimed that the nomination by city officials of two buildings for historic preservation under the pittsburgh historic structures,district,sites and objects ordinance,pittsburg,title,effectively prevented the buildings from being demolished and thereby thwarted grant plans to develop the property on which the buildings were located.grant alleged that the nomination was not motivated by public interest,but rather by partisan and personal politics having no bearing on the historic preservation of the buildings.the defendants claimed qualified immunity.
the district court,failing to consider each defendant role individually in the alleged conduct,nonetheless denied the officials summary judgment motion based upon qualified immunity.this court remanded the qualified immunity issue for reevaluation as to the specific conduct of each defendant,but specifically noted that courts are not barred from examining evidence of a defendant state of mind in considering whether a plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity,where such state of mind is an essential element of the constitutional violation itself.id.at citations omitted.in particular,our court specifically recognized that,
t he substantive due process violation alleged in this case is precisely the sort of claim where clearly established law makes the conduct legal or illegal depending upon the intent with which it is performed.by their very nature,substantive due process claims of this kind involve the application of otherwise legitimate government machinery to achieve an illegitimate end w hen the same officials invoke administrative processes with an illicit purpose,they are violating substantive due process guarantees and,at the same time,clearly established law.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.although decided in the context of qualified immunity,grant expressly recognizes and acknowledges that substantive due process claims often involve the use of legitimate governmental processes by government officials for illegitimate ends,and that the proper inquiry focuses not upon the propriety of the processes utilized,but rather upon the motives of the officials involved.
here,the very essence of herr substantive due process allegations depend upon the motives behind the actions taken by the township and the individual defendants.as already discussed see section,supra,herr has presented particularized and specific evidence reasonably lead a jury to conclude that the actions by pequea township in this case were motivated by illicit purposes,and thereby violated herr substantive due process rights under the amendment.
the district court noted that we believe defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.app the supreme court stated in harlow fitzgerald government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,d.i would hold that the defendants here should have known that their actions may have violated herr substantive due process rights and,therefore,they are not entitled to qualified immunity.however,because i am satisfied that the issue of improper motive must be returned for jury determination,even though i believe that the township has violated herr constitutional right and that the right was clearly established at the time of the violation,i would hold that the qualified immunity issue should be addressed not by us but in the district court.
such a holding would be consistent with our holdings in blanche road bensalem township and woodwind,both of which involved substantive due process challenges to governmental interference with land development plans.in blanche road,we stated 
in the instant case,when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,it is clear that defendants could not have reasonably believed that their conduct did not violate plaintiffs rights.if defendants,for reasons unrelated to an appropriate governmental purpose,intentionally conspired to impede the development of the
