in this age discrimination in employment action,robert meléndez meléndez,a former bmw car salesman at the autogermana dealership in puerto rico,appeals the district court dismissal of his claim of discriminatory discharge in violation of the age discrimination in employment act,adea.meléndez also challenges the district court denial of his motions for reconsideration.in dismissing meléndez claim at the summary judgment stage,the district court found that meléndez successfully established a prima facie case of discrimination,but ultimately concluded that meléndez failed to show that autogermana proffered reasons for dismissing him were pretexts that masked age discrimination.after careful review of the record,we affirm the district court dismissal of meléndez age discrimination claim and find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of meléndez motions for reconsideration.
facts and procedural history 
meléndez worked as a bmw car salesman for defendant,autogermana,over the course of approximately years until autogermana discharged him on july.meléndez was years of age at the time of his dismissal.
throughout the course of his employment at autogermana,meléndez received several sales performance awards.for example,meléndez received the profiles in achievement award from bmw of north america in,and.from to,however,meléndez also received several performance memoranda regarding his failure to meet the required sales quotas for particular months.on june,meléndez received a performance warning which stated that meléndez had failed to meet the used car sales quota of two vehicles.a second memorandum dated august,informed meléndez that he had not sold the required thirteen new cars in the month of july,and that he had one of the poorest sales records of the sales department staff.in,meléndez received performance warnings because he failed to meet the monthly sales quota in the months of march and april.
in march,and prior to dismissing meléndez,autogermana adopted and implemented a new monthly sales quota.in a memorandum dated february,autogermana informed its sales staff that a new monthly sales quota and payment structure would be adopted on march,requiring all salespersons to sell twelve new cars and one used car each month.the memorandum also informed employees that they would be required to sell at least of their new car sales monthly quota,and that those who did not meet this threshold would be subject to immediate dismissal.autogermana was to perform quarterly evaluations beginning on july,
shortly after the new sales quota was adopted,autogermana discharged meléndez.the letter of dismissal stated that after evaluating meléndez sales performance in light of the new sales quota,autogermana had determined that meléndez had not met the quota and was thus subject to dismissal.the letter also explained that autogermana had evaluated meléndez sales performance during the prior eighteen months.on that same day,autogermana discharged carlos palmero,a fellow salesperson who was approximately years of age 
on november,meléndez filed the present suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,claiming that he was terminated because of his age in violation of the adea and puerto rico law.autogermana moved for summary judgment.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in autogermana favor on the age discrimination claim and dismissed meléndez supplemental state law claim under puerto rico law,laws ann.tit.the district court found that meléndez had established a prima facie case of discrimination,but ultimately concluded that meléndez failed to show that autogermana proffered reason for discharging meléndez was a pretext for age discrimination.
on march,meléndez filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment in which he also requested a stay of the judgment pending final resolution of a parallel state case,meléndez autogermana,civil no.kpe of first instance march,in which meléndez claimed he was entitled to severance pay under puerto rico law on april,meléndez submitted a second motion for reconsideration in which he explained that the commonwealth of puerto rico trial court had issued a judgment granting him relief under puerto rico law.arguing that once the judgment became final it would have preclusive effect on the present adea litigation,meléndez requested a stay of the district court proceedings judgment.meléndez also requested leave to file an english translation of the judgment.the district court denied the two motions for reconsideration on april.subsequent to the district court denial of meléndez first two motions for reconsideration,he filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court april order,and requested leave to file an english translation of the judgment granting him severance pay under puerto rico law.the district court denied this third motion.meléndez subsequently filed this timely appeal,challenging both the dismissal of his adea claim and the district court denial of his motions for reconsideration.

adea claim 
the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to take an adverse employment action against an employee who is forty years of age or older on the basis of his age.a,a.in an adea claim,the employee shoulder s the ultimate burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge,that is,that he would not have been fired but for his age,cir.

first stage the prima facie case 
the district court concluded that meléndez successfully mounted a prima facie case of age discrimination.on appeal,the parties agree that meléndez satisfies the first,third,and fourth prongs of the prima facie case.meléndez was years old at the time he parted company with his former employer,he was discharged,and autogermana admitted it had a continuing need for meléndez services autogermana claims,however,that meléndez has failed to satisfy the second prong of the prima facie case as he was not meeting the company legitimate expectations at the time of his dismissal.to support this claim,autogermana points to meléndez sales performance during the eighteen months prior to his dismissal,and to his failure to meet the new sales quota during the quarter.autogermana argument regarding the prima facie case is unavailing.
first,we can not consider the employer alleged nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment action when analyzing the prima facie case.wexler white fine furniture,cir see also vélez,at same.thus,because autogermana invoked meléndez failure to meet the sales quota in arguing that meléndez was dismissed for reasons,we can not rely on meléndez poor sales performance in assessing whether he satisfied the legitimate expectations prong of the prima facie case.if we were to consider autogermana stated reason for firing meléndez as evidence that he was not meeting the company expectations,we would bypass the analysis and deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity to show that the nondiscriminatory reason was in actuality a pretext designed to mask discrimination.wexler,at.
to show that he was meeting autogermana legitimate expectations at the time of his dismissal,meléndez points to his career at autogermana.he relies on the awards he received from to for his sales performance and on the fact that at the time of his dismissal,he earned roughly the same salary that he had received in prior years.meléndez also contends that his failure to meet the sales quota in was due to reasons other than his poor or inadequate sales performance.he argues that the economic downturn in puerto rico led to a reduction in overall company sales and that as a consequence,all or most salespersons were unable to meet the new sales quota.mindful that an employee burden at the prima facie stage is not particularly onerous,benoit technical,cir,we find that the evidence proffered by meléndez is minimally sufficient to show that there was a triable issue as to his ability to meet autogermana legitimate expectations see woodman,at proffer of substantial wage increases and ten years of positive performance reviews,blemished by but one negative performance evaluation found sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether employee was meeting his employer legitimate expectations vélez,at legitimate expectations prong met where plaintiff relied on his years of employment with defendant without being subject to discipline due to his performance.
second stage legitimate and reason for dismissal 
having held that meléndez successfully established a prima facie case of age discrimination,we must determine whether autogermana articulated a legitimate and reason for dismissing meléndez.we need not tarry.autogermana claims that it discharged meléndez because he failed to meet the sales quota that was implemented in march.autogermana also explains that it decided to discharge meléndez because his sales record during the eighteen months prior to his dismissal revealed that meléndez was among the poorest performers in the company.we find that this is enough to enable a rational factfinder to conclude that there existed a nondiscriminatory reason for meléndez dismissal.ruiz posadas de san juan,cir see also garcía squibb,cir employer met its burden of providing a legitimate,reason by stating that employee was discharged due to her deficient performance.
third and final stage pretext and discriminatory animus 
at the final stage of our inquiry,the burden shifts to meléndez,who,unaided by the presumption that was previously raised in the prima facie case,must put forth sufficient facts for a reasonable to conclude that autogermana proffered reason for discharging him is a pretext and that the true reason behind the firing was discriminatory animus.see feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.it is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer justification he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham,but a sham intended to cover up the employer real motive age discrimination.mesnick general,cir quoting reynolds tobacco,cir.
meléndez puts forth several arguments in support of his claim that autogermana stated reason for dismissing him was pretextual.first,it is meléndez theory that autogermana improperly evaluated his sales record for the quarter through the lens of the new sales quota and that this raises the inference that autogermana proffered reason for his dismissal was pretextual.secondly,meléndez invokes his good sales record in the company to argue that considerations other than his sales performance led to his dismissal.thirdly,meléndez claims that the fact that,due to the economic downturn,overall company sales dropped and other salespersons were likewise unable to meet the sales quota raises the inference that the real reason behind his dismissal was age discrimination.finally,meléndez claims that the new sales quota was unreal or unreasonable,and that autogermana reliance on the quota was but a pretext for illegal discrimination.
we begin by addressing meléndez claim that autogermana misapplied the february memorandum in an effort to cover the real reasons behind his dismissal.although the memorandum was far from a paragon of clarity,we can not conclude that autogermana,having issued a memorandum informing employees that a new sales quota would be put into effect in march,and having advised employees that the first quarterly evaluation was to be performed on july,was precluded from evaluating employee performance during the quarter through the lens of the new sales quota.moreover,even if we draw the inference that autogermana could not evaluate meléndez sales performance through the lens of the new sales quota,we would only be able to conclude that meléndez dismissal was unjust or wrongful.this,however,is insufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that autogermana evaluation of meléndez sales performance was a pretext masking its impermissible discriminatory animus.feliciano de la cruz,at finding that even if a rational trier of fact could infer from the evidence of pretext that employer decision to fire plaintiff was unfair because she continued to perform her job well,that proof was insufficient to state a claim under title vii for discrimination on the basis of race.this is particularly so in light of the evidence showing meléndez overall performance during the eighteen months prior to his dismissal.
while meléndez put forth some evidence to show that he had a successful record as a salesperson during his tenure at autogermana,the record supports the conclusion that,at the time of his dismissal,autogermana believed that meléndez was not meeting the company legitimate performance expectations.see id.at stating that the essence of the pretext question is not whether plaintiff was actually performing below expectations,but whether the employer believed that he was.the evidence presented by autogermana reveals that,even ignoring the new sales quota,meléndez had one of the poorest sales records in the company meléndez sales record from january until july reveals that he had the second poorest sales record,and sales statistics for the year also show that meléndez was among the poorest performers within the company.
meléndez simply asks us to disregard the evidence regarding his inadequate sales performance at the time of his dismissal and to abide by his own assessment of his sales performance.we find that this is insufficient for a reasonable to conclude that autogermana did not actually believe that meléndez was performing below expectations at the time of his dismissal.
regarding meléndez contention that the sales quota was unreal,we should clarify that autogermana decision to adopt a new sales quota is a business decision that we may not question in an employment discrimination case.mesnick,cir courts may not sit as super personnel departments,assessing the even the employers nondiscriminatory business decisions.that is,meléndez general averment that the sales quota was unreal,is insufficient to allow a reasonable to conclude that the quota was adopted and employed to mask autogermana discriminatory animus.after all,t he adea does not stop a company from discharging an employee for any reason fair or unfair or for no reason,so long as the decision to fire does not stem from the person age.id.citation omitted see also webber int l paper,cir p ursuant to the business judgment rule,an employer is free to terminate an employee for any nondiscriminatory reason even if its business judgment seems objectively unwise.citation omitted.
further,evidence showing that autogermana overall sales in were lower than its is insufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that autogermana discharged meléndez for reasons other than his sales performance.while new car sales had declined in,some of the salespersons were indeed able to sell the requisite number of cars required by the quota,or fell within the threshold.furthermore,the record supports the conclusion that autogermana decided to dismiss the two salespersons with the poorest sales records and that the company also considered discharging other employees.regardless of whether the economic downturn may have affected meléndez sales performance,the record shows that,when compared with his fellow,meléndez was not meeting autogermana expectations.we thus find that meléndez has failed to raise the inference that autogermana proffered reason for dismissing him was pretextual.
in his attempt to support a claim of discriminatory discharge,meléndez states that autogermana waged an insidious discrimination campaign against him,whereby members of autogermana staff regularly ostracized and mocked him because of his age.meléndez argues that referred to him as el abuelo grandpa,or el viejo the old man,since he was a single parent,and had his first child at the age of.meléndez also refers to other incidents in which his criticized the way he dressed,remarking that he wore outdated suits and shoes he also claims that intentionally excluded him from a staff picture and that,prior to his dismissal,his desk was moved away from the lobby,thereby preventing him from greeting potential customers.
we recognize that some of these remarks by were related to meléndez age.we have explained,however,that stray workplace remarks,as well as statements made either by or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process,normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.gonzález el día,cir.while evidence of comments may be sufficient to support an inference of pretext and discriminatory animus,suttle caribe,cir,meléndez has failed to adduce sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the remarks were both temporally and causally connected to autogermana decision to discharge him.restaurant metropol,cir the lack of a direct connection between the words and the employment action significantly weakens their probative value.citation omitted mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir e ven if stray remarks are relevant for the pretext inquiry,their probativeness is circumscribed if they were made in a situation temporally remote from the date of the employment decision.these remarks,even if ageist,are insufficient to overcome the compelling evidence proffered by autogermana showing that meléndez was dismissed due to poor work performance and they thus fail to raise the inference that the real reason for meléndez termination was age discrimination.
while meléndez steadfastly claims that he was dismissed because of his age,it is uncontested that years discharged alongside a fellow salesperson who at the time was years old.also,meléndez himself admitted both in his deposition and in his opposition to autogermana motion for summary judgment that autogermana also had to dismiss four other salespersons.there is thus insufficient evidence to draw the inference that impermissible age discrimination was the determinative factor in meléndez termination.see,at in an adea case,plaintiff shoulders the ultimate burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendant autogermana.
denial of meléndez motions 
as a general matter,a motion for reconsideration may only be granted if the original judgment evidenced a manifest error of law,if there is newly discovered evidence,or in certain other narrow situations.global naps,verizon new,cir.we review the district court denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion,and will not overturn the court determination unless a miscarriage of justice is in prospect or the record otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of discretion.rivera riley,cir.
following the district court dismissal of his claims at summary judgment,meléndez filed two motions for reconsideration seeking relief from the district court judgment.after the district court denied these motions,meléndez filed a third motion,seeking reconsideration of the district court denial of his first two rule e motions.we will address the arguments raised by meléndez in these motions and review the district court orders on them,in turn.
in his first motion for reconsideration,meléndez argued that the court misinterpreted the february memorandum adopting the new sales quota.he claimed that the district court overlooked and misinterpreted his argument that autogermana could not apply the new sales quota in evaluating his sales performance prior to july.he also contended that autogermana reliance on his sales performance during the prior eighteen months was simply a pretext,as he received awards for his sales performance during that same period.secondly,meléndez urged the court to stay the judgment pending final resolution of a parallel case in which he was seeking relief for an unjust dismissal under puerto rico law.
on april,meléndez filed a second motion for reconsideration which essentially renewed his request for a stay of the proceedings pending final resolution of his parallel unjust dismissal case in this second motion,however,meléndez explained that the commonwealth superior court had issued a judgment granting him relief under law.according to meléndez,although the judgment was subject to appeal and could not yet be considered a final judgment for collateral estoppel purposes under puerto rico law,once the judgment became final,it would have preclusive effect in the present adea litigation.meléndez also requested leave to file an english translation of the judgment entered by the commonwealth superior court in his law action.
in an opinion and order issued on april,the district court addressed the arguments raised by meléndez in his first and second motions for reconsideration.finding no manifest error of law in its prior conclusion that meléndez was dismissed for failure to meet autogermana legitimate expectations,the district court denied the requested relief from the judgment.the district court also denied meléndez request for a stay of the judgment pending final resolution of his action.
as we discussed in section iii,supra,the evidence on which meléndez relies to support his age discrimination claim fails to raise the inference that he was dismissed for reasons other than his work performance,and meléndez failed to point to any newly discovered evidence capable of altering this conclusion.on reconsideration,meléndez simply restated his argument that autogermana was precluded from evaluating his work performance in light of the new sales quota,claiming that the district court misconstrued this argument.the district court,however,explained that it had not overlooked this argument,but that it simply found it insufficient to support the conclusion that meléndez was dismissed due to his age.we find no error in this conclusion.because meléndez failed to point to any manifest error of law in the district court judgment dismissing his adea claim,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of meléndez motions for reconsideration.
we also fail to find any abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to stay the judgment in this case until the commonwealth courts issued a final and unappealable judgment in meléndez parallel action for unjust dismissal under puerto rico law.this argument is unavailing as meléndez himself admitted in his motion for reconsideration that collateral estoppel principles did not apply because the judgment issued by the commonwealth superior court was not yet final and unappealable as required
