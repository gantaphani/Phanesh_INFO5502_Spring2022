reginald trammell,a new york state prisoner,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york loretta preska,district judge,granting defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissing trammell complaint brought pursuant to.in his complaint,trammell claims various violations of his right to due process and his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.as we explain below,the only claim at issue in this appeal is trammell contention that a deprivation order issued by a prison official on december,the order or the december order,and orders issued over the subsequent weeks,violated the eighth amendment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order granting defendants motion for summary judgment.
background 
prison disciplinary actions 
during the relevant period of time,trammell was at new york sing sing correctional facility sing sing,serving an indeterminate sentence of five to ten years for robbery in the second degree.people trammell,appeal denied.by the time of the challenged incidents,trammell had already earned a lengthy prison disciplinary record and had been indicted for assault on two occasions,including a serious assault of a corrections officer.as a consequence,trammell was serving his sentence in the special housing unit shu when the events at issue in this case transpired.
starting in november,trammell became more and more uncontrollable.in the five weeks from november,to december,trammell was cited for no fewer than sixteen disciplinary violations.one of trammell preferred forms of misbehavior was to throw various as drinks,soup,spit,urine,and correctional officers or others near his cell.trammell does not dispute any of these facts.
in response to all of this misconduct,the corrections officers in the shu imposed increasingly severe disciplinary measures.these generally took the form of prolonging his time in the shu,taking away good time effectively increasing his period of imprisonment or issuing deprivation orders that curtailed privileges and amenities.as an example of the latter,for spitting on an officer on november,a hearing officer ordered that trammell lose phone,commissary,and package privileges for thirty days.again,after officers discovered contraband in trammell cell on december,and cited him for interference with an employee and refusing to obey a direct order,trammell lost phone,commissary,and package privileges for six months,as well as six months good time.despite these disciplinary measures and deprivation orders,trammell violent and unruly behavior continued.
matters came to a head on december.trammell spit or threw a liquid at correctional officer fernandez,a notary,who had gone to trammell cell to notarize legal papers for him.later that day,deputy superintendent kehn issued the first of several deprivation orders that are the primary subject of this appeal.the december order,issued pursuant to,deprived trammell of all state and personal property in his cell except one pair of shorts.no recreation,no shower,no hot water,no cell bucket because it is determined that a threat to the safety or security of staff,inmates,or state property exists.pursuant to the order,the corrections officers removed all of trammell clothing except for one pair of undershorts,all of his toiletries,soap,toothpaste,toothbrush,his mattress,blanket,and cell bucket.although the record is unclear,trammell toilet paper was either removed,or he was left with an inadequate supply in any event,he says he went about a week without toilet paper.the december order also extended the duration of a restricted diet of nutriloaf a food containing carrots and potatoes and raw cabbage for approximately days.trammell also alleges that a prior deprivation order was extended so that he was denied exercise from december,to january.
pursuant to section,all deprivation orders must be reviewed daily by the deputy superintendent and,if lasting more than seven days,must be reissued in writing every seven days.see c.the memorandum accompanying the december order stated that the terms of the deprivation would be reviewed daily,and told trammell that his property would be restored as your adjustment improves.initially you will receive a blanket and mattress after a period of hours without a misbehavior report.
on december,kehn and captain healy found that trammell was wearing clothing that had apparently been lent to him by a fellow inmate.kehn ordered the officers to remove trammell clothing from him,and authorized them to subdue trammell with tear gas in order to remove his clothing if he refused to voluntarily turn over the clothing.when trammell refused to cooperate,the kehn,starks,ercole,healy,bunato,gibson,fitzgerald,and tear gas into trammell cell,ordered him to lie down,restrained him using and leg restraints,and carried him outdoors where they cut the clothing from his body.they then took him in his underwear to a shower where they washed him off before returning him to his cell.
although there are minor disagreements regarding how long trammell was deprived of various items,there is very little daylight between the assertions of the parties.trammell maintains in his complaint that he was continuously deprived of clothing for three to four weeks,and was deprived of his mattress and blanket for slightly less time.defendants contentions are more detailed,but they largely corroborate trammell allegations and his testimony given in a state court hearing.on december,the officials returned trammell mattress and blanket.on december,they returned his clothing,but on december,superintendent keane issued a new deprivation order,directing that all of trammell property including,presumably,his mattress and blanket be removed.defendants concede that no separate misbehavior report documents why this second order was issued and it remains unclear whether the order was put into effect.however,because for purposes of this appeal all evidentiary ambiguities must be resolved in trammell favor,we will assume that all of trammell property was removed again on december.in any event,there is no dispute that,on december,the full deprivation order was put back into effect after trammell again threw liquid at a corrections officer.
prison records reflect that,after december,trammell property was returned in stages the mattress and blanket on december,limited clothing and toiletries on january,and shoes and sweatshirt on january.by january,all property had been returned and the deprivation order lifted,except for the restricted diet.to recap,according to prison records,trammell was deprived of a mattress and bedding for fourteen days,clothing and toiletries for seventeen days,the record is not clear on this left with an inadequate supply of toilet paper for approximately a week.
trammell contends that during this period he was given inadequate access to medical care which compounded the ill effects of the deprivations.trammell alleges that of the few complaints that were forwarded to the medical department,defendants kapoor,williams,phelt and prigitano responded by stating that per security,i could not be removed from such cell for examination.trammell also claims to have requested psychiatric treatment,but was told that his requests were denied because he was being punished.defendants agree that trammell made these medical complaints and requests,but counter that a nurse makes rounds on the shu every day and responds to any complaint an shu inmate may have.if the nurse had informed an appropriate official that plaintiff was not in good health,the deprivation order would not have been continued after each daily review.between december,and january,shu nurses observed trammell in his cell on twelve occasions.the nurses notes reveal that,on occasion,trammell complained of coldness,chest pains,sinus problems,sore throat,and bleeding from his rectum a condition that was apparently related to an medical condition for which he received treatment.in response to these complaints,trammell was given basic medication,such as sudafed.
b.the new york state article proceeding 
trammell,acting pro se,brought an article proceeding in new york state court in february of,asserting that the defendant corrections officers violated state law and federal constitutional law.specifically,he claimed that defendants violated state law and federal due process by denying him access to psychiatric treatment violated state law and federal due process by conducting over disciplinary hearings in his absence violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting him to tear gas for with the deprivation order and showed deliberate indifference to a medical condition by subjecting to him to the restricted diet while he complained of abdominal pain and a case of internal bleeding.
the new york supreme court assigned counsel for trammell,removed the restricted diet order,and held hearings concerning the deprivation orders.in an order dated september,the state court dismissed most of trammell claims,but found that the december order had gone too far by depriving trammell of all property,including basic necessities such as clothing,blankets,mattress,toiletries,and toilet paper.the state court determined that f authorizes denial of specific property i f possession of any item is determined to present a threat to the safety or security of others at the prison,but not as punishment.trammell coombe,wl,slip op.at,emphasis in original.the state court did not consider the issue before us,namely,whether the order also violated the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
trammell section action 
in january before the state court issued its ruling,trammell again acting pro se,brought the instant section action in federal court.trammell claimed that the prison officials conduct gave rise to four different constitutional violations the imposition and enforcement of the december order constituted cruel and unusual punishment enforcement of the deprivation order in the face of his failing physical health,and denial of psychiatric treatment,constituted deliberate indifference to his medical needs holding disciplinary hearings in his absence violated due process various prosecutors failure to investigate his allegations of mistreatment at the hands of the prison officials was an independent civil rights violation.
the state defendants various sing sing personnel moved to dismiss trammell complaint and the defendant prosecutors moved to dismiss the fourth claim the only claim that pertained to them.in an order dated october,judge preska dismissed the fourth claim,converted the motion to dismiss the third claim to a motion for summary judgment,invited submission of supporting affidavits and other materials,and directed the parties to address certain legal questions she thought particularly relevant.defendants filed papers in support of summary judgment on all three remaining claims,urging,inter alia,that trammell claims were barred by collateral estoppel.on august,the district court granted that motion in its entirety.on december,we vacated that order on the grounds that trammell had not been given notice that the court was converting defendants motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment of the entire complaint,that he needed to present evidence in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,and that the likely consequence of failing to respond was dismissal of the complaint.see trammell coombe,wl,at cir.on remand,after receiving a renewed motion from the defendants and submissions from trammell,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment in its entirety on the grounds stated in the august order.see trammell coombe,wl.
we affirmed the district court dismissal of the second,third,and fourth claims in an order dated june.in the same order,we appointed counsel and directed the parties to brief the remaining claim,whether the district court grant of summary judgment on appellant eighth amendment claim concerning the december,deprivation order issued by appellees was erroneous,to which we now turn.
ii.discussion 
the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment,const.amend.viii,and applies to states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see robinson california,d.to prove a violation of the eighth amendment,an inmate must show that the deprivation alleged is objectively sufficiently serious such that the plaintiff was denied the minimal civilized measure of life necessities,and that the defendant official possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind associated with the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.see farmer brennan,d quoted in gaston coughlin,cir.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.see sheppard beerman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.even where facts are disputed,in order to defeat summary judgment,the party must offer enough evidence to enable a reasonable jury to return a verdict in that party favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.when ruling on a motion for summary judgment,a court is required to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see id.at.maguire citicorp retail,cir 
as an initial matter,it is important to identify exactly what conduct is at issue in this case.trammell does not challenge the constitutionality of the use of tear gas on december,nor the constitutionality of the deprivation orders imposed prior to december.he attacks only the december order and the orders immediately following.the state court rejected trammell due process claims and his claim that he was deprived of adequate medical attention while subjected to the terms of the deprivation order.thus these claims,to the extent that they are raised here,are barred by res judicata.finally,as we have stated,the state court found that the december order was improper because it was issued for reasons contrary to state law.to remedy this infraction,the state court expunged the order from trammell prison records.we have no occasion to consider the propriety or impropriety of that ruling,as the legality of the december order under new york state law does not bear on whether the order was unconstitutional under the eighth amendment.accordingly,only one issue remains for determination whether the district court erred by granting defendants motion for summary judgment on trammell claim that the imposition and enforcement of the december order violated the eighth amendment.
trammell argues that he has satisfied both prongs of the farmer analysis that the imposition and enforcement of the december order was sufficiently serious in objective terms,and that the various defendants possessed the requisite mental state.see farmer,at.we find that,viewed in the light most favorable to trammell,there is no genuine dispute regarding any facts material to the prison officials mental state in imposing and enforcing the december order,and that therefore trammell has failed to satisfy farmer second prong.for that reason,we conclude with the district court that it is unnecessary to consider whether the conditions of confinement to which trammell was subjected were sufficiently serious to satisfy the first prong of the farmer analysis.
after incarceration,only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the eighth amendment.ingraham wright,d quotation marks and citations omitted.in cases involving prison uprisings or use of excessive force,a defendant must show that force was used maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm in order to demonstrate the requisite scienter.whitley albers,d quoting johnson glick,cir.by contrast,i n cases the state of mind requirement is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.farmer,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted inadequate protection from violence estelle gamble,d deliberate indifference standard applies to allegations of inadequate attention to prisoners serious medical needs.
in farmer,the court made clear that the use of the ma
