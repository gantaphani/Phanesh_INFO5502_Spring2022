john vannoy sued his former employer,the federal reserve bank of richmond frbr,for interference and retaliation in violation of the family and medical leave act fmla,et,and failure to accommodate and discriminatory discharge in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et.the district court granted summary judgment in frbr favor as to all of the claims.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court judgment as to the fmla retaliation claim and the ada claims.however,because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether frbr interfered with vannoy fmla rights by providing him defective notice that omitted his right to reinstatement at the conclusion of the medical leave term,we hold that summary judgment as to that claim was not warranted.accordingly,we vacate that part of the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings as to vannoy fmla interference claim.
factual and procedural background 
vannoy worked for frbr from until his termination on december,at which time he held the position of project construction manager technical services director within frbr facilities management department.by the summer of,vannoy supervisors,robert minteer and mattison harris,noticed vannoy was having problems with his work and attendance.in july,harris reported his concern that vannoy may be depressed to frbr medical director,victor brugh.
brugh,who had treated vannoy for depression previously,was aware of vannoy history of depression going way back,and that vannoy had taken antidepressant medications for a long time.as the medical director of the health services department,brugh was responsible for core aspects of frbr fmla and ada compliance,including evaluating and treating employees overseeing administration of short term disability and ada benefits working closely with human resources on health and disability related benefits overseeing and reviewing applications for fmla leave and working with frbr departments in connection with employee performance issues potentially related to health problems.the record does not reflect that brugh ever spoke with vannoy about his rights and responsibilities under the fmla.
on september,vannoy saw mimi kline,a licensed professional counselor,who diagnosed him with major depression and noted his need for an program.
beginning on october and lasting through november,vannoy had several unscheduled absences from work,which he cleared informally with his supervisors by text message or email.the record does not indicate whether these absences were to seek medical treatment.however,the record does show that vannoy was admitted to mary hospital on november for psychiatric treatment.his family informed harris and brugh that vannoy was in the hospital,and brugh spoke directly with vannoy during his hospital stay.vannoy physicians recommended that he enter a rehabilitation program for treatment of depression and alcohol dependency,but vannoy refused,expressing concern that taking additional time off from work would result in termination.vannoy was discharged from the hospital on november.
around that time,vannoy submitted his application for short term disability,which also functioned as a request for fmla leave.to that application,vannoy attached a physician statement from his primary care doctor taking him out of work from november to december.based on these documents,frbr determined and notified vannoy that he was eligible for leave under the fmla through december.
the parties accounts diverge as to whether vannoy received sufficient individualized notice of his fmla rights and responsibilities as required by the act.frbr represents that it sent vannoy the applicable notice document on november,but vannoy asserts that he did not receive it.in any event,the notice frbr claims to have sent omitted reference to job protection rights,the precise information vannoy contends he needed to answer his concerns that continued absences for treatment of his depression and alcoholism would result in termination.
fearful of losing his job,vannoy reported to work on november without a doctor note and well before the end of his approved fmla leave period.frbr sent vannoy home with instructions that he could not return to work until he obtained a release from his physician.shortly thereafter vannoy provided frbr a doctor note,allowing him to return to full work duty as of november.vannoy returned to work on november.
on november,vannoy arranged a meeting with minteer and harris to follow up about his recent hospitalization and ongoing medical issues.apparently,the fmla was not discussed during this meeting,though vannoy states he was reassured that his job was not in jeopardy.vannoy contends he reiterated to his supervisors that he wanted to work with them and to work with the bank to keep his job.id.
on november,frbr sent vannoy on a work assignment in baltimore.vannoy drove a company vehicle and stayed in a hotel for that period at frbr expense,but he did not report to work on the project.the record provides only a hazy account of vannoy purported reason for the absence.nonetheless,when vannoy returned to frbr richmond office,he was placed on administrative leave pending a decision about his failure to communicate the unscheduled absence from work while in baltimore.on december,vannoy was placed on a performance improvement plan,which contained an employee portion that vannoy was to complete by december.
on december,vannoy informed his supervisors that he would not be able to report to work that day.upon his return to work the following day,vannoy received an email from harris instructing him to complete and submit the employee portion of the performance improvement plan that day.contending that he was unable to complete the performance improvement plan,vannoy left work without authorization and went home.frbr terminated vannoy employment effective that day in a letter citing the failure to properly communicate unscheduled time off from work and insubordinate behavior in leaving work despite instructions to complete the performance improvement plan.
after his termination and following exhaustion of his administrative remedies,vannoy filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia alleging frbr violated his rights under the fmla and the ada.frbr moved for summary judgment under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted frbr summary judgment motion as to all claims,concluding that vannoy failed to give sufficient notice of his need for a medical leave of absence and he was terminated for misconduct related to the baltimore trip.
vannoy timely appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment to frbr.we have jurisdiction to review the district court final order under.

fmla interference 
vannoy argues that frbr failed to provide him individualized notice of his job protection rights as required by the fmla.this omission,vannoy posits,caused prejudice to him as it affected his ability to take the medical leave he claims to have needed.vannoy also states,without elaboration,that he did not receive the notice from frbr that frbr says it sent him.frbr represents that it sent vannoy individualized notice by email on november,and,in any event,it granted vannoy medical leave request and provided notice that he had hours of fmla leave available.
the fmla entitles eligible employees to take twelve weeks of leave during any period for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his job.a d.following this leave period,an employee has the right to reinstatement to his or her original position or an equivalent post.id.a.it is unlawful under the fmla for an employer to interfere with an employee exercise of or the attempt to exercise any right under the statute.id.a.
the fmla requires that employers provide an individual,written notice to affected employees that an absence qualifies under the fmla.see there are two types of individualized notice that the employer must give an employee who may be entitled to fmla leave a rights and responsibilities notice,id.c and a designation notice,id.d.at issue in this case is whether the rights and responsibilities notice from frbr was legally sufficient.and if a notice violation occurred,the fmla comprehensive remedial mechanism grants no relief absent a showing that the violation prejudiced vannoy.ragsdale wolverine world wide.thus,if frbr violated the fmla notice requirements,and vannoy can show prejudice deriving from that violation,he has stated a claim for interference.
in the fmla rights and responsibilities notice,e mployers shall provide written notice detailing the specific obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences of failing to meet these obligations.c.if the leave has already begun,the notice shall be mailed to the employee address of record.id.such notice must include,among other things,the employee right to restoration to the same or an equivalent job upon return from fmla leave.id.c vi.the department of labor provides a prototype notice of rights and responsibilities for employers to use to ensure compliance.id.c.
the purpose of the employer notice requirements is to ensure that employers allow their employees to make informed decisions about leave.conoshenti pub.serv.and gas,cir.that purpose is thwarted when the employee has not received the statutory benefit of taking necessary leave with the reassurance that h is employment,under proscribed conditions,will be waiting for h im when he is able to return to work.id.thus,a ny violations of the act or of these regulations constitute interfering with the exercise of an employee rights.b.an fmla notice violation can be an actionable interference claim for which an employee may recover,so long as he makes a showing of prejudice flowing from the violation.ragsdale,at holding employee must ha ve been prejudiced by the violation to obtain relief.
in the instant case,the notice frbr purportedly sent failed to inform vannoy of his right to job restoration at the conclusion of his medical leave term under the fmla regulations,a statement of the employee right to job reinstatement must be included in the rights and responsibilities notice.see c vi.
frbr points to no evidence in the record that vannoy received the required job reinstatement information.it does not contest that the only notice document in the record fails to show notice of vannoy job restoration rights.therefore,we conclude that vannoy established as fact,for purposes of frbr summary judgment motion,that frbr notice did not comply with the regulatory requirement of c vi.
our inquiry,however,does not end with the determination that a violation of the fmla notice provisions occurred.the fmla provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation.ragsdale,at.vannoy accordingly must establish that he was prejudiced by frbr failure to provide notice of his right to job restoration.
prejudice may be gleaned from evidence that had the plaintiff received the required but omitted information regarding his fmla rights,he would have structured his leave differently.lupyan,at downey strain,cir.finding prejudice where evidence showed employee would have postponed her knee surgery to a time when it would not have caused her to exceed her fmla allowance dorsey jacobson holman,pllc,app x,cir.concluding plaintiff could not show prejudice where she never returned to work and provides no record evidence whatsoever that she could have structured her leave differently.
the record in this case contains sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment to frbr that vannoy who returned to work prior to the expiration of the medical leave he initially requested would have structured his leave differently had he known that his job was protected.vannoy initially requested medical leave from november to december,in accordance with the physician note he provided frbr.that leave was approved.however,vannoy did not take the leave term that he requested.instead,he returned to work early and frbr told him he would be permitted to work only after he provided a physician note verifying he could resume work.vannoy contends that had he known of his right to reinstatement at the conclusion of leave,he would have taken the full leave of absence set out in his initial fmla application to obtain the inpatient treatment he claims to have needed.frbr contests this evidence and offered its own evidence.
however,vannoy testimony on this point is unequivocal 
i think a notice of job protection rights would have made a huge difference because i would have been so fearful of losing my job and i would have known i could have gotten help and that i had the support of the bank and that they wanted me to get well.and i could have gone to treatment,i could have gotten help.and i could have come back and i could have continued to be an excellent employee.
when asked again whether knowing that his job would be there when he returned for medical leave mattered,vannoy reiterated that it would have made a huge difference.absolutely,i believe i would have gone to treatment.the supporting testimony from vannoy family is consistent with his testimony that he would have taken the full amount of his requested medical leave had he known his job was protected.indeed,after his termination,vannoy completed a comprehensive inpatient treatment program.
assessment of the credibility of these statements,and any countervailing evidence,rests squarely within the purview of the trier of fact.see anderson liberty lobby,noting credibility determinations should not be made by the district court at summary judgment.if,for example,a jury accepts vannoy evidence,it could conclude that vannoy demonstrated he was prejudiced by frbr failure to provide him with the requisite notice and,thus,frbr interfered with his rights under the fmla.see lupyan,at holding plaintiff could demonstrate prejudice even though she had received all of the leave she was entitled to under the fmla.
for these reasons,we hold that summary judgment was foreclosed because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether frbr failure to comply with the fmla notice requirements prejudiced vannoy.the district court thus erred in granting summary judgment to frbr on vannoy fmla interference claim 
fmla retaliation 
in addition to claiming frbr interfered with his notice rights under the fmla,vannoy contends that frbr terminated him in retaliation for taking absences.he argues that once frbr became aware of the extent of his illness and his ongoing need for intermittent fmla leave,it fired him.vannoy posits that the timeframe between his initial request for medical leave and subsequent termination supports his view.frbr responds that vannoy failed to demonstrate any causal link between his protected activity and later termination.in addition,frbr argues the timeline does not evince a causal nexus,but actually negates it.moreover,frbr contends it had no notice that vannoy continued to suffer from depression and alcoholism because he gave vague and conflicting reasons for his absences.and finally,frbr argues it has offered a legitimate,reason for any adverse employment action against vannoy,and there is no evidence of pretext.
the fmla provides proscriptive rights that protect employees from discrimination or retaliation for exercising their substantive rights under the fmla.dotson pfizer,cir.fmla retaliation claims may rest on circumstantial evidence evaluated under the framework set out in mcdonnell douglas green.an fmla plaintiff claiming retaliation must
