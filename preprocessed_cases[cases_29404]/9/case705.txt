peter held the position of personnel and general services officer in the ombudsman office of puerto rico from december to august.following the termination of his employment,he sued carlos,the newly appointed director of the ombudsman office,in personal and official capacities.made two claims.first,he argued that his firing was in violation of his first amendment rights in that,a member of the new progressive party npp,terminated his employment because was a popular democratic party pdp member and that his position was not a position for which political affiliation was an appropriate consideration.rutan republican party,d branti finkel,d.second,he says that he was in a tenured position under puerto rico law and his firing violated his procedural due process rights.sought damages and reinstatement.
the defendant moved for summary judgment on the question of qualified immunity as to both claims.the district court denied the motion on all grounds,d.defendant appeals we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a denial of summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity where the denial turns on an issue of law.behrens pelletier,d mitchell forsyth,d.our jurisdiction over the issue of the defendants qualified immunity from monetary damages is not contested.
the ombudsman office was created by statute,as an adjunct to the legislature of puerto rico.ombudsman act,laws codified as amended at laws ann.thus,unlike most political termination claims,the executive branch is not at issue here.the ombudsman is appointed for a fixed term of office,laws ann,and so is outside the electoral cycle.he is appointed by the governor,with the advice and consent of the puerto rico legislature,and is statutorily limited to no more than two terms of office.id.
the duties of the ombudsman office are to investigate the administrative acts of the agencies and conduct investigations of citizens claims.laws ann.the ombudsman is authorized to adopt and promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to carry out the duties of his office and to establish regulations for the filing and handling of complaints,procedures for investigations,the manner of informing his findings,and the personnel administration of his office.id.after completing an investigation,the ombudsman may recommend a remedy,including,for example,that an administrative act should be altered or set aside,that the law or regulations on which the administrative act is based should be modified,or that the agency should perform another action.laws ann.
puerto rico does have a civil service system,called the puerto rico service personnel act,laws ann.the personnel act,however,does not apply to the legislative branch,id.a,and so does not apply to the ombudsman office.the original ombudsman act stated that all employees in the office were to be considered as trust employees,as used in the personnel act,which in turn specifies that such employees are subject to free removal.laws,laws ann.the ombudsman act also authorizes the ombudsman to adopt regulations to administer the personnel of that office.laws ann.
the pertinent regulation here is regulation.that regulation contains two seemingly inconsistent sections.section v,entitled office composition,states that the office is excluded from the personnel act and that all the employees of the ombudsman office are of free selection and removal.the defendant relies heavily on this section.
however,in section xviii of the regulation,entitled retention in service,subsection a,entitled employment security,states that t he employees of the office of the ombudsman will have tenure in their positions,if they satisfy the criteria of productivity,efficiency,order and discipline that should prevail in the public service.plaintiff relies heavily on this section.
section vi,entitled recruitment,selection and removal of employees,is also pertinent,as it appears to carve out an exception to section xviii tenure provision for employees designated as trust employees.section vi provides 
in the case of employees of trust and confidence whose duties have to do with the formulation of public policy and those who offer personal service directly to the ombudsman,the provisions of this regulation will not be mandatory in reference to the recruitment,selection and removal.
the trust and confidence employees,whether it be that they participate in the formulation of public policy or provide personal or direct services to the ombudsman,will be of free removal.
a amendment to the ombudsman act eliminated the act statement that all employees would be in the trust service,clarified that employees were excluded from the personnel act,and provided that the ombudsman personnel regulation shall apply to employees of the office.laws ann.the ombudsman personnel regulations cited above remained unchanged says this was a scrivener error,that the regulation stating that the ombudsman employees are of free selection and removal should have been eliminated when the statute was amended.nonetheless,the regulation remains.
was hired in the office starting in,when it was then under the directorship of a pdp member,and was promoted to various positions until he became head of personnel and general services in.the forms filed with the central office of personnel administration,a different agency,describe him as a trust and confidence employee.his various employment contracts stated that each of his positions was a trust position this is a term of art in the government of puerto rico,defined within the civil service law as those who intervene or collaborate substantially in the formulation of the public policy,who advise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency.laws ann.the original statute creating the ombudsman office referenced this definition,and section vi of the ombudsman regulations,quoted above,mirrors the personnel act definition as well,suggesting that this term was meant to have the same meaning within the ombudsman office.
carlos,a npp member,was appointed ombudsman on july.in august,sent a termination letter to which did not state any grounds for his termination,but said his position was one of trust.contests whether his position was one of trust,arguing that the regulations cited above gave him tenure in his position,thereby changing his position from one of trust into one of right.he further argues that his actual duties lacked the hallmarks of such a position,namely,substantial involvement in policymaking and direct advising or services to the agency head.
as to the debate over whether position was one of trust,this court has previously indicated that designating a position as one of trust indicates that it is considered a policymaking position under puerto rican law,which is not dispositive of the federal question under rutan,d,and branti,d,but is entitled to some deference by this court,cir,cir.we have consistently held that the job description is the best,and sometimes dispositive,source for determining the inherent functions of the position,at 
during plaintiff employment as personnel officer,the job description for the position provided
