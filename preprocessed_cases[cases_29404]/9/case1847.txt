appellees lanna chandrasuwan chandrasuwan and brian holbrook holbrook,both north carolina probation officers,sought appellant stanley jones jones arrest for allegedly violating conditions of his probation.this case raises questions regarding the application of the fourth amendment to the seizure of probationers.the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment on jones fourth amendment claim,finding that they were entitled to qualified immunity.while we disagree with the district court discussion at step one of the qualified immunity analysis,we affirm because the right at issue was not clearly established at the time jones was arrested.
in october,jones at the time a teacher and north carolina resident was arrested and charged with two counts based on an inappropriate relationship with a student.while the charges were pending,jones resigned and began working as a salesman for prime communications prime in greensboro,north carolina.jones was promoted twice and,in april,transferred to a position with prime in augusta,georgia.
on july,jones returned to north carolina and pleaded guilty in state court to two counts of taking indecent liberties with a student and was sentenced to a minimum of months and maximum of months in prison.the sentence was suspended,and jones was placed on supervised probation for months.as one of the conditions of his probation,the state court required that jones pay in court costs and fines pursuant to a schedule to be determined by his probation officer.the state court also allowed jones to transfer supervision of his probation to georgia if accepted by the interstate compact for adult offender supervision the compact,an agreement between all states allowing for the transfer of probation supervision of adult offenders between member states.
under the compact,the sending state in this case,north carolina retains jurisdiction over the offender for purposes of probation revocation,and the receiving state in this case,georgia supervises probation.additionally,the sending state is responsible for collecting any financial obligations imposed,and,upon notification from the sending state that the offender is not complying with payments,the receiving state must inform the offender that he is in violation of the conditions of supervision.
the same day he entered his plea,jones reported to a probation office in greensboro and met with judicial services coordinator latonia williams williams.jones completed an application for transfer of supervision pursuant to the compact.in the application,jones agreed to reside at the residence listed until allowed by supervising authorities to change it,to comply with the terms and conditions of supervision placed on him by both north carolina and georgia,and that if he did not comply with those terms and conditions,such a failure would be considered a violation of probation and he could be returned to north carolina.williams and jones disagreed about whether he would have to register as a sex offender,which could impact whether georgia accepted his transfer application.jones left to see his lawyer and williams later determined that jones would not be required to register as a sex offender.
the next day,jones again met with williams.jones and williams signed a dcc form,which the north carolina department of community corrections dcc uses to set a schedule for payment of financial obligations however,the dcc form the parties signed was incomplete it omitted information regarding the payment rate,due date,and the total amount of jones financial obligation.this information was apparently omitted because dcc had not yet received the criminal judgment,which is required to establish the parameters of supervision.the dcc form was never completed.
jones application for transfer of his probation supervision was approved and jones arrived in georgia on july.the next day,north carolina probation officers forwarded the terms of jones sentence to georgia authorities through the interstate compact offender tracking system icots,a system facilitating communications between compact member states compact offices.on july,jones reported to the augusta,georgia probation office.throughout jones residency in georgia,there were no reported violations of his probation by georgia authorities.in december,prime offered jones a promotion to a position located in savannah,georgia.at jones request,georgia probation officers transferred his supervision to a probation office in savannah.
dcc policy requires that when a probationer is supervised in another state under the compact,a review is undertaken days before his discharge.in january,dcc employee jay lynn lynn conducted this day review and determined that jones had not paid any of the costs and fines required by the judgment.lynn informed north carolina interstate compact district coordinator karl waller waller of this and instructed him to confirm it with holbrook,the chief probation and parole officer in greensboro.after confirming with holbrook that jones had not paid his costs and fines,waller sent a compact action request on january,to the georgia compact office through icots,requesting that jones be instructed to pay the costs and fines by february.on february,the costs and fines remained unpaid and waller completed a violation report,which lynn approved,stating that jones was in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation.
on february,jones met with his probation officer in savannah,who introduced him to the savannah office compact representative.the compact representative explained that she had received a notice from north carolina that jones had failed to pay his costs and fines.jones indicated that he knew he still owed money,that the sum was due before his probation was terminated in july,and that he would check with his lawyer about arranging for payment.the same day,waller received two responses to his compact action request.the first stated that jones had been instructed by his supervision officer to make payment and that jones was going to contact his lawyer about the amount owed.the second response stated that jones had been instructed to make his payment and that he stated that he would pay the balance by the end of the month.
on february,waller returned jones probation file to holbrook for case management and collection of fines and court costs.holbrook forwarded the file to chandrasuwan a probation officer under his supervision in the greensboro office and instructed her to follow up with jones.on march,chandrasuwan attempted to contact jones at two telephone numbers on file,but was unable to reach him.on march,chandrasuwan prepared a violation report recounting that jones had violated the conditions of his probation by failing to timely pay court costs and fines.the same day,chandrasuwan attempted to notify jones by mail of the need to contact her or return to the greensboro probation office within two weeks to pay the outstanding fine.on march,when chandrasuwan had not heard from jones,she filed the march violation report with the clerk of court.
on march,chandrasuwan correspondence which was sent to jones address in augusta was returned.the same day,chandrasuwan prepared an addendum violation report stating that jones had absconded and was avoiding supervision.chandrasuwan and holbrook reached this conclusion without contacting compact officials or the georgia probation office.also the same day,chandrasuwan appeared before a magistrate judge in north carolina state court to secure an order for jones arrest based on his multiple probation violations at the hearing,chandrasuwan presented the violation report and addendum and the magistrate judge issued an order for jones arrest.jones file was then transferred to another probation officer to execute the arrest order.
on may,the united states marshals service arrested jones at his home in savannah and he was held in a georgia county jail.the next day,jones wife paid the in full.on may,holbrook secured an order dismissing the probation violations and recalling the arrest order and transmitted the order to authorities in georgia.jones was released from custody on may.in in interim,prime terminated jones employment because he could not work due to his arrest and incarceration.after a period of unemployment,jones and his family moved back to north carolina.
in march,jones filed this action in north carolina state court,bringing claims for violation of his fourth amendment rights under and for malicious prosecution under state law.appellees removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees,finding that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied supplemental jurisdiction over jones malicious prosecution claim and dismissed the claim without prejudice.jones timely appealed.

jones contends that appellees violated his fourth amendment rights by seeking his arrest for alleged probation violations.we first determine what level of suspicion appellees must have had in order to arrest jones for allegedly violating the terms of his probation.then we determine whether appellees had that level of suspicion here.
jones contends that appellees violated his fourth amendment rights by seeking his arrest for alleged probation violations without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.the fourth amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,const.amend.iv,and this usually requires the police to have probable cause or a warrant before making an arrest.herring united states,d.probationers such as jones,however,do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled,but only conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special probation restrictions.griffin wisconsin,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.the supreme court has repeatedly acknowledged that a state interests in reducing recidivism and thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the fourth amendment.samson california,d.
ultimately,t he touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness and the reasonableness of a search or seizure is determined by assessing,on the one hand,the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual privacy and,on the other,the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.united states knights,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a person status as a probationer informs both sides of this reasonableness balance the intrusion upon an individual privacy and necessity to promote legitimate governmental interests.see id.at.
neither the supreme court nor this court has announced the level of suspicion required under the fourth amendment to arrest a probationer for a suspected probation violation.the supreme court faced an analogous issue in knights the level of suspicion required for searches of probationers which provides guidance in the arrest context.in knights,the supreme court determined that,where a probationer was subject to a probation condition that his person or property could be searched at any time without a warrant,reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaged in criminal activity is enough to make a search reasonable.at.
after knights,it remains an open question whether a suspicionless search of a probationer can be constitutional.united states midgette,cir knights,at.additionally,the supreme court has upheld suspicionless searches of parolees pursuant to a state statute allowing for such searches.samson,at noting that parolees have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers,because parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is to imprisonment.however,the privacy interests and governmental interests implicated in arrests and searches are sufficiently different to foreclose the possibility of a constitutional suspicionless arrest of a probationer.segura united states,d different interests are implicated by a seizure than by a search.collecting cases.suspicionless arrests implicate obvious privacy concerns while doing little to advance the government two primary goals of probation rehabilitation and protecting society from future criminal violations.knights,at.
on the other hand,these goals are advanced when probation officers seek his probation.the government has strong interests both in ensuring that probationers adhere to the conditions of their probation and in effectively redressing probation violations if they do not.these interests are strengthened by the fact that probation is often imposed in lieu of incarceration and that conditions of probation are often intended to prevent future criminal conduct.while the privacy concerns implicated by an arrest are certainly substantial,balancing the governmental and private interests supports a degree of suspicion lower than probable cause for arresting a probationer for an alleged probation violation.knights,at although the fourth amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term probable cause,a lesser degree satisfies the constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable.therefore,we hold that probation officers must have reasonable suspicion before seeking the arrest of a probationer for allegedly violating conditions of his probation.
the concept of reasonable suspicion,like probable cause,is not readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.united s
