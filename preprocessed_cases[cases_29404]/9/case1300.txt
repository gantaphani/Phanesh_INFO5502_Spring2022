background 
the district court has written three opinions in this matter that carefully and clearly recite the facts of this case.see tsombanidis city of haven,d tsombanidis i tsombanidis city of haven,d tsombanidis ii tsombanidis city of haven,d tsombanidis iii.we presume familiarity with judge goettel writings and only summarize those facts necessary to resolve the issues now before us.
beverly tsombanidis,owner of a residence located at platt avenue,in west haven,connecticut,also known as oxford hill eight john does,current or future residents of and oxford house,ohi brought this action against the first fire district for the city of west haven fire district and the city of west haven city under the fair housing act of,as amended by the fair housing amendments act of,et fhaa and title ii of the americans with disabilities act,ada ohi oversees more than independent oxford houses operating both in the united states and abroad that provide homes for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.oxford houses operate on the premise that people recovering from drug and alcohol addictions will remain sober if they live in a supportive environment.as noted by the district court,s tatistics indicate that the average length of stay in an oxford house is thirteen months and a founder of oxford house claims that eighty percent of those who live in an oxford house maintain sobriety.tsombanidis ii,d at.neither the city nor the fire district question these assertions.
the affairs of oxford houses are governed democratically by the residents of each house without the presence of a medical or therapeutic professional.ohi has found that residents are more likely to succeed if houses are located in residential neighborhoods away from readily available drugs and alcohol close to sites for regular alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous meetings near commercial areas substantial enough to provide easy access to basic necessities near a range of employment opportunities accessible by public transportation and large enough for a minimum of six people to live,yet small enough that bedrooms are shared by residents.tsombanidis ii,d at.
in,tsombanidis purchased a house in a residential area of detached houses in west haven,connecticut.she bought the property to start and,in july,entered into a lease with four persons recovering from alcohol and drug addictions within days after the original residents moved into,neighbors began to question tsombanidis about the house.after learning of its purpose,neighbors expressed their concerns and it became apparent throughout the fall of that there was significant community opposition to locating in the neighborhood.an anonymous caller to the city complained that was operating as an illegal boarding house.soon thereafter a group of local residents visited mayor richard borer complaining about the recovery facility,and a petition signed by people was presented to the city council protesting the use of the property located at platt avenue in a residential neighborhood as a rooming house for people in rehabilitation in violation of numerous planning and zoning codes.tsombanidis ii,d at.
west haven enforces its zoning regulations,property maintenance code and state building code primarily by responding to complaints.after the city received the first complaint,was inspected city officials concluded that tsombanidis was operating an illegal boarding house in a residential zone in violation of the city zoning regulations.the city also informed tsombanidis that she was in violation of the city property maintenance code,regarding dwellings,as well as nine other sections of the maintenance code.she was ordered to make alterations to the property and to reduce the number of tenants to three within fourteen days in order to avoid penalties for operating an illegal boarding house.tsombanidis made the repairs but refused to evict the tenants.on september,a city official issued a citation ordering tsombanidis to pay a fine of for every day she was in violation of the zoning and property regulations.
in response to these actions,ohi wrote to city officials explaining the concept behind oxford houses.ohi also informed the city that it believed the city enforcement efforts to evict the residents were in violation of the fhaa and ada.despite continuing its enforcement actions,the city never responded to ohi.later that fall,the city turned file over to its counsel and enforcement proceedings were put in abeyance until further notice.
in december,richard spreyer,inspector for the fire district,inspected.since six unrelated individuals were living together in the house,spreyer informed tsombanidis that,as the landlord,she was required to install additional safety measures to ensure compliance with chapter,the lodging and rooming portion of the connecticut fire safety code fire code in march,spreyer notified tsombanidis she had days to comply with the lodging and rooming requirements or face possible civil proceedings and criminal penalties including a fine and incarceration.ohi responded that application of the fire code to violated the fhaa and the ada.
upon receipt of ohi letter,spreyer forwarded the file to douglas peabody,deputy state fire marshal,requesting a determination of the occupancy classification.peabody stated that should be designated as a lodging and rooming house because six unrelated individuals rented the house.he advised spreyer to consult with counsel for the city to determine whether the fhaa and ada applied.city counsel referred spreyer to assistant state attorney mary galvin who advised him that the statutes would have no application in this instance because the fire code was at issue rather than a zoning code.on june,spreyer,and one day later sent tsombanidis a final notice of fire safety hazards,stating that imprisonment of up to six months criminal fines from to would be imposed in the event she did not comply.he later suspended any enforcement of the abatement during the pendency of this action.
plaintiffs brought the present case against the fire district and the city alleging that both governmental entities violated the fhaa and ada by intentionally discriminating against plaintiffs,implementing policies that disparately impacted plaintiffs,and failing to make reasonable accommodations.both defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court held that there was sufficient evidence to go forward on plaintiffs claim of intentional discrimination against the city but not against the fire district.see tsombanidis i,d at.the court held that both disparate impact claims could proceed to trial but held that the reasonable accommodation claims were not ripe because plaintiffs had not yet utilized the appropriate administrative proceedings to obtain an accommodation.see id.at.
in response to the court ruling that the reasonable accommodation claims were not ripe,tsombanidis applied to the city of west haven zoning board of appeals for a exception to continue to use the property as.the zoning board held a public hearing and subsequently denied the application.only two months before trial,tsombanidis requested that the state fire marshal exempt her from the fire code.at the subsequent bench trial,john blaschik,a new deputy state fire marshal,testified that one of the then seven residents of could be considered a member of a single family,and the other six could be considered outsiders,making a dwelling under the fire code.spreyer promptly informed tsombanidis that he would follow this interpretation and that she should disregard the previous notices.
after an eight day bench trial,the district court held that the fire code had a disparate impact on the john doe plaintiffs.see tsombanidis ii,d at.the court also found that plaintiffs failed to prove a reasonable accommodation claim against the fire district because the plaintiffs received the accommodation they requested.see id.at.the court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees but no compensatory damages because plaintiffs had not proven intentional discrimination.see id.at.the fire district appeals the district court disparate impact holding and a mootness issue included in that claim.plaintiffs the court reasonable accommodation ruling and its failure to award compensatory damages upon a finding of disparate impact.plaintiffs have abandoned their intentional discrimination claim against the fire district.
with respect to the city,the court held that the city intentionally discriminated against the zoning and maintenance regulations disparately impacted the residents and the city failed to reasonably accommodate the residents handicap after plaintiffs had sought a variance through proper governmental procedures.see id.at.the court awarded plaintiffs compensatory damages and attorney fees.see id.at.the city appeals the intentional discrimination claim,the reasonable accommodation claim and the damages award.it does not contest the disparate impact claim.
ii.discussion 
statutory framework 
both the fhaa and the ada prohibit governmental entities from implementing or enforcing housing policies in a discriminatory manner against persons with disabilities.the fhaa makes it unlawful t o discriminate in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap.f.similarly,the ada states no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subject to discrimination by any such entity.both statutes require that covered entities make reasonable accommodations in order to provide qualified individuals with an equal opportunity to receive benefits from or to participate in programs run by such entities.reg l econ.cmty.action program,city of middletown,cir,cert.denied,d.to establish discrimination under either the fhaa or the ada,plaintiffs have three available theories intentional discrimination disparate treatment disparate impact and failure to make a reasonable accommodation.see id.at 
both statutes apply to municipal zoning decisions.see id.at citing forest city daly,town of north hempstead,cir innovative health,city of white plains,cir.furthermore,the fire district has not specifically contested the application of either statute to the fire code.marbrunak,city of stow,cir applying fhaa to a zoning ordinance imposing special safety requirements on residences housing individuals with developmental disabilities in addition,defendants have not contested that the john doe plaintiffs,as recovering alcoholics and drug addicts,are considered handicapped or persons with disabilities and therefore protected by both the fhaa and the ada.finally,defendants concede plaintiffs tsombanidis and ohi have standing in this case 
claims against the fire district 
the fire district argues that the case against it became moot when blaschik testified he had changed the interpretation of the fire code,and spreyer informed tsombanidis he would follow that interpretation.thus,which has capacity only for seven recovering individuals,will not be required to implement the fire safety measures necessary for residences treated as lodging and rooming houses.one day after the testimony,inspector spreyer informed tsombanidis and the other plaintiffs that all enforcement efforts would cease as long as did not exceed seven members.
f ederal courts may not adjudicate matters that no longer present an actual dispute between parties.catanzano wing,cir.the voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal activities will usually render a case moot if the defendant can demonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.granite state outdoor,town of orange,cir quoting campbell greisberger,cir.the defendant burden is a heavy one to ensure the allegedly illegal activities do not temporarily cease only to resume after the claims have been dismissed.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the fire district has not met its heavy burden because the interpretation of the code might change example,upon a change in the state fire marshal administration.thus,the claims are not moot.
disparate impact analysis 
the district court found the fire district in violation of the fhaa and ada holding the fire code disparately impacted the john doe plaintiffs.disparate impact analysis focuses on facially neutral policies or practices that may have a discriminatory effect.to establish a prima facie case under this theory,the plaintiff must show the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices,and a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant facially neutral acts or practices.city of middletown,at quoting gamble city of escondido,cir emphasis added.a plaintiff need not show the defendant action was based on any discriminatory intent.huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir.when establishing that a challenged practice has a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on a protected group,a plaintiff must prove the practice actually or predictably results in discrimination.hack president fellows of yale,cir quoting town of huntington,at.a plaintiff has not met its burden if it merely raises an inference of discriminatory impact.see gamble,at.furthermore,the plaintiff must show a causal connection between the facially neutral policy and the alleged discriminatory effect.see hack,at.if a plaintiff makes a prima facie showing,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that its actions furthered,in theory and in practice,a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.town of huntington,at.
in this case,plaintiffs challenge the facially neutral provisions of connecticut fire safety code relating to lodging and rooming houses.if the residence is a lodging or rooming house,plaintiffs would be required to make a number of structural changes to the building.the district court found these requirements to be prohibitively expensive for and that the continued enforcement of these provisions would result in the constructive eviction of the john doe plaintiffs from this dwelling and would limit the housing opportunities available to oxford house residents.tsombanidis ii,d at.the court further held that plaintiffs had presented substantial evidence of their need to live in a group home setting in a residential neighborhood,in order to facilitate their continued recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction,and that this need for group living is not shared by persons to the same degree.id.after finding that the fire code had an adverse impact on plaintiffs,it held that although the fire district could point to a legitimate fire district presented no evidence that the regulations were the least restrictive means to serve its legitimate interest.id.
we disagree with the district court legal analysis and find as a matter of law that plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie claim of disparate impact.the basis for a successful disparate impact claim involves a comparison between two affected and those unaffected by the facially neutral policy.this comparison must reveal that although neutral,the policy in question imposes a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on a protected group of individuals.when examining disparate impact claims under the fhaa and ada,we use title vii as a starting point.see hack,at see also town of huntington,at.to establish a prima facie case for employment discrimination,plaintiffs are ordinarily required to include statistical evidence to show disparity in outcome between groups.see,smith xerox,cir.
statistical evidence is also normally used in cases involving fair housing disparate impact claims.for example,in town of huntington,the district court found a shortage of affordable rental housing for low and households and that the impact of this shortage was three times greater on blacks than on the overall population.town of huntington,at.furthermore,the town had restricted new housing to an area consisting of minority residents while the entire town was white.id.at.thus,the court concluded the town refusal to amend the ordinance restricting multifamily housing projects to largely minority urban renewal areas disparately impacted minorities.id.at.similarly,in resident advisory board rizzo,cir,the court held that plaintiffs had proven discriminatory effect by showing that the defendants urban renewal efforts had left the area in question an community whereas the area had previously been integrated to the extent of having black families.id.at.the court concluded that there was no doubt that the impact of the governmental defendants termination of the project was felt primarily by blacks,who make up a substantial proportion of those who would be eligible to reside there.id.
by contrast,in hack,this court dismissed plaintiffs disparate impact claims against a university housing policy that required students to live in residence halls,which were objectionable to orthodox jews on religious grounds.the court noted that t he students do not allege that the university policy has resulted in or predictably will result in of orthodox jews in university housing.therefore,their claim fails.hack,at.
here,plaintiffs did not present any statistical information nor did they show the fire code actually or predictably created a shortage of housing for recovering alcoholics in the community.although there may be cases where statistics are not necessary,there must be some analytical mechanism to determine disproportionate impact.the district court merely required plaintiffs to show they could not live in the house they desired because of the code and that plaintiffs needed this type of housing due to their handicap.the court analysis would appear to apply to any facially neutral housing policy that prevents a handicapped person from living in a particular house.such a standard is not sufficient for disparate impact purposes.if a handicapped person requested and was denied a reasonable accommodation to the neutral policy,there would be a strong argument that the denial violated the fhaa and ada,but this would only be true under a reasonable accommodation theory as opposed to a disparate impact theory.see henrietta bloomberg,cir holding that the ada permits both theories of disparate impact and reasonable accommodation and that each is a separate and distinct claim.to prevail on a theory of disparate impact,however,there must be some evidence that a significant number of people suffering the handicap need group living and that the fire code restricts a substantial portion of similarly handicapped individuals from doing so.the only evidence the court had in this regard cuts against plaintiffs theory.there are oxford houses in connecticut and six,not including,in the greater new haven area it does not appear that the fire code has adversely affected these homes.see tsombanidis ii,d at.
whether using statistics or some other analytical method,plaintiffs must also utilize the appropriate comparison groups.they must first identify members of a protected group that are affected by the neutral policy and then identify similarly situated persons who are unaffected by the policy.it is unclear from its decision what groups the district court compared.to the extent that the district court compared the handicapped plaintiffs to a similarly sized family where the individuals were related by blood,marriage or adoption,see tsombanidis i,d at,that comparison was improper.it fails to include groups that are not related by college students wanting to live together,for are still affected by the policy.see gamble,at.the district court also erred by merely comparing handicapped and persons.rather,in this case,the proper comparison is between recovering alcoholics and recovering drug abusers recoverings and people who are neither recovering alcoholics nor recovering drug abusers.such a comparison identifies the handicap and allows for a causal analysis between the claim of discrimination based on the handicap in question and the facially neutral policy.
in this case,plaintiffs might have been able to meet their burden by providing statistical evidence that x of all of the recoverings in west haven need or have good reason to live in the group settings prohibited by the facially neutral fire regulations at issue,that y of all of the in west haven need or have good reason to live in such group settings prohibited by the fire regulations,and,crucially,that x is significantly greater than y.there is nothing in the district court decision nor do plaintiffs point to any evidence in the record alluding to such a statistical comparison.
a more qualitative comparison might also have supported the disparate impact theory.in such a comparison,plaintiffs would have to show that the average recovering in west haven has a greater group living than does the average resident of west haven.this would likely require some quantification of what each group needs from a living arrangement standpoint.a court could then conclude that,despite whether the quantitative test is met,there is a qualitatively disproportionate impact on recoverings in west haven.if a significant correlation exists between being disabled and living in group houses,a disparate impact on group housing could conceivably establish a prima facie disparate impact claim.gamble,at.no evidence was presented in this case that establishes a significant correlation between being disabled and living in group housing.
plaintiffs seem to have taken the qualitative track,but again,they have not shown any proof that there are other recoverings in west haven who need group living of seven or more or any proof about needs.the district court found that plaintiffs had established that the oxford house program was a highly successful rehabilitation method,especially when recoverings were attending alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous meetings.tsombanidis ii,d at.the court also found that one of the criteria that made this program much more likely to succeed was its desire to use houses large enough for a minimum of six people to live,yet small enough that bedrooms are shared by residents.id.at.this was insufficient to establish a comparison class of similarly situated individuals given preferential treatment.henrietta,at quoting olmstead ex rel.zimring,d plurality opinion.oxford house own experts noted that not all recoverings need group living and that other factors,including attending alcoholics anonymous meetings and abstinence,also play a substantial factor in recovering.since no quantitative or qualitative comparison was proven,plaintiffs did not establish a disparate impact claim.
reasonable accommodation analysis 
plaintiffs also assert that the fire district refusal to treat as a dwelling qualifies as a failure to reasonably accommodate the john doe plaintiffs handicap as required by the fhaa and the ada.plaintiffs contest both the district court original ripeness decision as well as the holding that the reasonable accommodation provisions were not violated.we affirm both rulings.
under the fhaa and the ada a governmental entity engages in a discriminatory practice if it refuses to make a reasonable accommodation to rules,policies,practices or services when such accommodation may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b see also the term qualified individual with a disability means an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable modifications to rules,policies or practices meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.thus,these statutes require that changes be made to such traditional rules or practices if necessary to permit a person with handicaps an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.shapiro cadman towers,cir quoting,reprinted in,footnotes omitted.plaintiffs must show that,but for the accommodation,they likely will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing of their choice.smith lee,city of taylor,cir.a defendant must incur reasonable costs and take modest,affirmative steps to accommodate the handi
