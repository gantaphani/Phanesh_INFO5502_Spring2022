colonel frederick aikens appellant challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on his claim in favor of two former members of the north carolina army national guard,adjutant general william ingram ingram and lieutenant colonel peter von jess von jess collectively,appellees.appellant alleges that appellees,motivated by revenge,directed other service members to monitor appellant email messages,which he sent while serving on active duty in kuwait,and to forward incriminating messages to von jess.appellant claims this alleged conduct violated his fourth amendment rights.
the district court granted summary judgment based on the justiciability doctrine set forth in mindes seaman,cir providing a test for reviewability of claims based on internal military affairs.for the reasons that acknowledging that appellant now renounces any claim for equitable affirm the district court on the basis of the military abstention doctrine set forth in feres united states.
the district court opinion sets forth the extensive procedural history of this case,so we do not relay it here.see aikens ingram,d.we recount the following relevant factual background in the light most favorable to appellant,the party.see butler drive auto.indus.of,cir.
in,appellant,then a member of the north carolina national guard ncng,was promoted from executive officer to full colonel and commanding officer of the rear operations center roc.after appellant promotion,adjutant general ingram named his longtime friend,von jess,as executive officer in appellant place.this assignment meant that appellant was in a supervisory position over von jess.
in december,appellant was instructed to complete an officer evaluation report oer of von jess.appellant gave von jess a negative oer,which explained that von jess ha d not demonstrated the ability to treat everyone with dignity and respect and should not be promoted.von jess appealed the oer to ingram,stating that appellant was purposefully vindictive,angry,irrational,and possessed professional jealousy.
in early,appellant was called to active duty and deployed to camp doha,kuwait.ingram and von jess remained in north carolina,but the animosity between appellant and von jess did not subside.in november,appellant received notice that specialist paul jones and staff sergeant brian mccarthy,information technology personnel supporting the roc,had used illegal means to obtain his personal emails for the better part of.appellant learned that jones and mccarthy forwarded around of those emails to von jess,who was not deployed at the time von jess referenced those emails in a memorandum to the north carolina governor chief of staff.in that memorandum,von jess accused appellant of unethical and unprofessional behavior that shows criminal intent to overthrow the adjutant general,and he claimed information in the emails parallel led treason or mutiny.von jess also forwarded the emails to the department of the army inspector general daig.
in may,the daig informed appellant that he was being investigated for contributing to a hostile command climate and having inappropriate relations with women.the daig concluded that jones and mccarthy improperly browsed appellant email,but it nonetheless used the information in the emails to find six instances of active duty misconduct on appellant part.the daig provided its findings to the governor of north carolina and ingram.ingram then forwarded the findings to the commander of the first united states army,lieutenant general russel honoré.in july,honoré withdrew federal recognition from appellant,and he was constructively terminated from the ncng.appellant waived the withdrawal hearing and elected to transfer to the retired reserve.
on april,appellant sued appellees pursuant to claiming that they facilitated unconstitutional searches and seizures of his personal emails while he was deployed in kuwait.in support of his claim,appellant emphasized his turbulent history with von jess,and a special camaraderie between von jess and ingram.specifically,appellant maintains that von jess and ingram authorized and directed mccarthy and jones to monitor appellant emails and send incriminating emails to von jess.
appellees moved for summary judgment,asserting appellant claims failed for several reasons.they argued appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his emails because army regulation,in effect at the time of appellant deployment to camp doha,made clear that emails sent and received over the department of defense dod computer system could be monitored.see dep t of army,reg,information systems security l,providing that the dod computer system was to be used only for authorized government use use of the system,authorized or unauthorized,constituted consent to monitoring and all communications over the dod system could be monitored see also.appellees also maintained appellant claims were nonjusticiable under feres united states.
the district court ultimately agreed that appellant claims were nonjusticiable,albeit under the framework set forth in mindes seaman,cir providing a test for reviewability of claims based on internal military affairs,and granted appellees motion for summary judgment.appellant timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.butler drive auto.indus.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
we consider de novo the threshold legal question of whether the district court properly abstained from ruling on appellant claims.see cioca rumsfeld,cir describing the applicability of feres united states,as a threshold question see also vonrosenberg lawrence,cir applying de novo review to abstention questions.
we first recognize that,at this juncture,appellant is seeking only damages against appellees in their individual capacities.appellant br.although in his opening brief appellant claims to seek a declaration that appellees actions be declared unlawful under the fourth amendment,he abandons any claim for equitable relief in his reply brief,see appellant reply br.aikens claims for damages are the only claims he appeals.see also oral argument at,aikens ingram,available at 
the district court granted summary judgment on appellant claim for equitable relief by relying on the fifth circuit decision in mindes seaman,cir,which provides a test for reviewability of claims based on internal military affairs.see also williams wilson,cir adopting the mindes test where a servicemember challenged the national guard empaneling of a selective retention board.
the parties agree that mindes has traditionally applied to actions seeking equitable relief,not damages.see appellees br.observing that this court has adopted the use of the mindes test in reviewing matters requesting equitable relief in military actions emphasis supplied appellant reply br.mindes applies only to equitable relief.thus,since appellant has abandoned his claim for equitable relief,the logical conclusion is that mindes has no place in our analysis.
however,some courts,including our own,have sent mixed signals regarding whether mindes applies to claims seeking damages.see,wilt gilmore,app x,cir per curiam relying on mindes,affirming dismissal of racial discrimination claims for million in compensatory damages against virginia national guard officers because appellant did not exhaust administrative remedies holdiness stroud,cir applying mindes test to action seeking million in damages.
without passing on the continued viability of the mindes test in this circuit we only observe that in this particular case,the test is an ill fit.our published decisions applying the mindes test dealt with internal personnel matters such as challenges to convening of retention boards and military discharge.see williams,at guerra scruggs,cir.the case at hand is markedly different.appellant alleges unconstitutional,ultra vires actions by national guard officers against appellant while he was serving in a federal capacity.as such,the mindes test has no place.
nonetheless,we must address whether feres bars appellant from seeking damages under.
originally,feres stood for the proposition that the government is not liable under the federal tort claims act ftca for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.at the feres incident to service test or the feres test see also united states johnson,d reaffirming the holding in feres because suits brought by service members against the government for injuries incurred incident to service are the type s of claims that,if generally permitted,would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.alteration in original emphasis,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.
subsequently,the supreme court extended the feres incident to service test to causes of action outside the ftca realm,including claims against federal officials pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d.see,chappell wallace,d relying on feres,holding that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a bivens remedy against their superior officers,explaining,c ivilian courts must,at the very least,hesitate long before entertaining a suit which asks the court to tamper with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers united states stanley,d where servicemember sued military officers for giving him lsd as part of an army experiment,holding,no bivens remedy is available for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service quoting feres,at.
although stanley clarified that the feres incident to service test is applicable to constitutional claims under bivens,the supreme court has not extended the reasoning of chappell and stanley and applied the test to constitutional claims brought against state officers under.nor have we.almost all of our sister circuits,however,have done so.see,newton lee,cir matreale dep t of military veterans affairs,cir speigner alexander,cir jones state div.of military naval affairs,cir bowen oistead,cir wright park,cir knutson.air guard,cir watson.guard,cir crawford.army guard,cir see also bois marsh,applying feres to an intramilitary damages action under.
we join our sister circuits in extending the feres incident to service test to actions.this result is supported by supreme court jurisprudence and respects the delicate separation of powers necessary for smooth and effective military governance.
first,because suits under both and bivens address constitutional infringements by government officials,the supreme court holding in stanley is logically applicable to claims against state officials.indeed,the court has declared,i n the absence of congressional direction to the contrary,there is no basis for according to federal officials a higher degree of immunity from liability when sued for a constitutional infringement as authorized by bivens than is accorded state officials when sued for the identical violation under.butz economou,d.
this precept is especially important in a case involving national guard service members,as actions would create the same degree of disruption to guard affairs as bivens actions would to military discipline and decisionmaking in a federalized military regime.stanley,at.the second circuit explained,
absent some reasoned distinction,justiciability of constitutional tort actions incident to federal and state military service should be.this is particularly true in light of the central role the national guard plays in the national defense and the close working relationship between the national guard and the united states army.the policy concerns are the same in both contexts.allowing actions based on injuries arising incident to service in the guard would disrupt military service and undermine military discipline to the same extent as allowing bivens actions based on injuries arising incident to service in the united states army.
jones,at.we find this reasoning sensible and persuasive.
second,we generally decline to expand liability for injuries arising from military service so as not to tread on the delicate balance of power among the branches of government.the supreme court has cautioned against inference with military disputes in the absence of explicit congressional approval.see dep t of navy egan,d u nless congress specifically has provided otherwise,courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the executive in military affairs.feres,at declining to draw out a cause of action against military personnel under the ftca absen t express congressional command.
likewise,this circuit has been wary of endorsing actions for damages in military contexts.in lebron rumsfeld,for example,a designated enemy combatant and al qaeda member,jose padilla,alleged numerous constitutional violations at the hands of military officers,including torture and unlawful designation and detention of enemy combatants.see,cir.padilla urged this court to imply a new bivens cause of action for money damages against dod officials based on a range of policy judgments pertaining to the designation and treatment of enemy combatants.id.at.declining to do so,we noted the explicit constitutional delegation of control over military affairs to the political branches of government.id.at.we also observed,whenever the supreme court has considered a bivens case involving the military,it has concluded that the insistence with which the constitution confers authority over the army,navy,and militia upon the political branches counsels hesitation in our creation of damages remedies in this field.id.at quoting stanley,at alterations in original see also cioca rumsfeld,cir where current and former service members alleged they were victims of rape and sexual harassment during military service,holding that no bivens remedy was available,explaining,it is clear that expansion of a cause of action for monetary damages in a military context is the exception,not the rule.
we see no reason,then,to allow damages actions pursuant to against state officials for injuries suffered incident to service that the supreme court has expressly foreclosed against federal officials when congress has not expressly authorized them.crawford,at section claims,like those predicated on bivens,invite judicial of military actions and tend to overlap the remedial structure created within each service emphasis supplied.we thus join our sister circuits in applying the feres test to suits for damages based on injuries sustained incident to service.
we now address whether the feres incident to service test bars relief in the case at hand.to do so,we ask whether the injuries of which appellant complains search and seizure of his emails in violation of the fourth amendment ar o se out of or we re in the course of activity incident to service.feres,at cioca,at.
in the nearly years since the decision,feres and its progeny have failed to produce a specific or rule regarding what type of conduct is incident to service.see united states shearer,d the feres doctrine can not be reduced to a few rules.indeed,the supreme court explicitly rejected a special factors analysis which would consider how military discipline would actually be affected in a particular case.ricks nickels,cir discussing stanley,at.rather,we look to whether particular suits would call into question military discipline and decisionmaking and would require judicial inquiry into,and hence intrusion upon,military matters.cioca,at quoting stanley,at alteration in original.in other words,where a complaint asserts injuries that stem from the relationship between the plaintiff and the plaintiff service in the military,the incident to service test is implicated.id.
if this explanation sounds broad and amorphous,it is.feres has grown so broad that this court once noted,the supreme court has embarked on a course dedicated to broadening the feres doctrine to encompass,at a minimum,al
