plaintiff bryan sousa plaintiff or sousa,a former employee of the connecticut department of environmental protection dep,appeals an april,judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet hall,judge.that judgment granted a motion by arthur roque,commissioner of the dep robert kaliszewski,sousa supervisor at the dep joanne driver,a personnel officer at the dep william evans,a bureau chief of the dep of financial and support services and jane stahl,deputy commissioner of the dep collectively defendants or dep officials,for summary judgment on plaintiff claims that they had retaliated against him in violation of the first amendment for complaints he made regarding primarily workplace violence.specifically,plaintiff argues that although the district court correctly concluded that he was speaking as a citizen and not as an employee for the purposes of the first amendment,the district court erred in concluding that his speech was unprotected because it was not on a matter of public concern.
we acknowledge that our precedents on what constitutes a matter of public concern,and particularly,the extent to which a court may take into account the speaker motives when making that determination,are less than clear.we reaffirm our earlier holding in reuland hynes,that the speaker motive is not dispositive in determining whether speech is on a matter of public concern,cir.because our holding is at odds with the district court conclusion that sousa speech did not address a matter of public concern solely because he was motivated by employment grievances,we vacate the district court order granting summary judgment to defendants on sousa first amendment claim.
background 
sousa began working as an engineer at the dep in july.by,he had become a supervising sanitary engineer in the water bureau,a division within the dep.in october,sousa had a verbal and physical altercation with jonathan dep employee.sousa roque,jch,wl,at.as a result of the incident,both sousa and goldman were suspended for three days without pay.
following his altercation with goldman,sousa began making numerous complaints to dep officials,focusing on the discipline he received as a result of the incident and,more generally,workplace violence within the dep around this time,sousa also reported his concerns about a hostile work environment in the dep.sousa complained about incidents of group harassment against him called mobbing,which is a process of abusive behaviors inflicted over time.specifically,he reported that he had been harassed by various employees,and that two employees had also suffered sousa took to be evidence,in part,of reverse discrimination within the dep.sousa then wrote to marcia bonito,the dep affirmative action administrator,again focusing on his claims of a hostile work environment,workplace violence,and reverse discrimination.he made similar complaints to richard blumenthal,the attorney general of the state of connecticut.finally,sousa articulated several of these concerns in an april,memorandum to his union.
one of sousa complaints in particular troubled dep officials.on july,sousa sent an to two dep employees,karen calieno and lisa piccarello,about providing a book on mobbing to members of the dep workplace violence threat assessment team,id.at.in the,sousa wrote 
when you read the book you will recognize that mobbing can often result in the death of the victim,either due to illness,accident or suicide.another reference suggested that,in light of such ramifications,workplace mobbing should be viewed as the last remaining legal means of committing homicide.i personally see it as a form of group vigilantism.
id.at.following this,the human resources office of the dep hr sent sousa a letter on august,requiring him to undergo a evaluation.
although the events that followed are in dispute,both parties agree that sousa was on leave for a substantial amount of time following hr request that he undergo a evaluation.the district court found that sousa was put on paid leave on september,and then on unpaid leave on october,while sousa doctor was gathering information for his fitness test.sousa was eventually found fit for duty in november,and he was instructed that he should report back to work on december.sousa informed evans,a bureau chief of the dep of financial and support services,that he did not want to return to work out of fear for his safety.sousa remained out of the office for the month of december,using a combination of vacation time and sick leave.
sousa returned to work in january,and then requested that he be allowed to work from home or telecommute.sousa supervisors denied the request.during the months that followed,sousa continued to take various forms of leave while sousa was on paid sick leave in the fall of,he was informed that he would have to return to work on october,or he would be classified as being on unauthorized leave without pay.id.at.sousa did not go to work on that date,and after five days,a hearing pursuant to cleveland board of education loudermill,d loudermill hearing was set for november.there remained some concern about whether sousa was still fit for duty however,an independent medical examiner reported that sousa would be fit for work as of december.sousa did not return to work on that day either and a second loudermill hearing was held on january.following that hearing,sousa employment with the dep was terminated for,inter alia,two instances of unauthorized absences.
ii.procedural history 
on may,sousa filed the instant action in the district court,pursuant to,alleging that defendants violated his first amendment rights by retaliating against him for engaging in what he claimed was protected speech.specifically,sousa claimed that the defendants alia,requiring him to undergo a evaluation,placing him on paid leave in september,placing him on unpaid leave in october,denying him continued medical leave in october,denying his january request to telecommute,subjecting him to a hostile work environment from to his termination in,and terminating his all acts of retaliation against him for exercising his first amendment right to complain about,inter alia,workplace violence and a hostile work environment within the dep.sousa also claimed that two of defendants him to undergo a evaluation and denying his request to his right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.finally,sousa action included state law claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress and for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
in july,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the state law claims.see docket jch,entry.july.the district court granted this motion in a december order with respect to sousa claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and denied it with respect to his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.see docket jch,entry.following discovery,in december defendants moved for summary judgment,see docket jch,entry,and on april,the district court entered a ruling granting defendants motion on all of sousa federal claims,and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over sousa remaining state law claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.see sousa,wl,at.
with respect to sousa first amendment claim,the district court stated that t he first question the court must ask in deciding a first amendment retaliation claim is whether the public employee spoke as a citizen upon matters of public concern or as an employee upon matters of personal interest.id.at quoting connick myers,d.in considering whether sousa was speaking as a citizen or as an employee,the district court noted that the supreme court in garcetti ceballos,d,had held that the controlling factor in determining whether someone is speaking as an employee was whether the speaker expressions were made pursuant to his duties.sousa,wl,at quoting garcetti,at.without further explanation,the court concluded that,h ere,there is no evidence that sousa official duties included complaining about workplace violence or harassment.sousa,wl,at.turning to whether sousa speech addressed a matter of public concern,the court found that sousa complaints were the essence of an employee grievance.id.at.the court then concluded that t here is no first amendment protection for speech calculated to redress personal grievances in the employment context and granted summary judgment for defendants on sousa retaliation claim.id.
on april,final judgment in favor of the defendants was entered.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the only portion of the district court ruling that sousa challenges on appeal is the court legal conclusion that his speech was not on matters of public concern and,accordingly,is not protected by the first amendment.appellant br.specifically,sousa renews the argument,made before the district court,that he was the victim of retaliation for speaking on matters of public concern,including hostile work environment,reverse discrimination,and workplace violence 
we acknowledge that our precedents on what constitutes a matter of public concern,and particularly,the extent to which a court may take into account the speaker motives when making that determination,are less than clear.based upon our reading of supreme court precedent,our own cases,and the cases of our sister circuits,we conclude,as we did in reuland,that the speaker motive is not dispositive in determining whether speech is on a matter of public concern.at.
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c see also,wright goord,cir.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party.paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir.
ii.matter s of public concern 
for sousa retaliation claim to be viable,we must find that his speech was protected by the first amendment.it is established law in this circuit that,r egardless of the factual context,we have required a plaintiff alleging retaliation to establish speech protected by the first amendment.williams town of greenburgh,cir.to determine whether or not a plaintiff speech is protected,a court must begin by asking whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.garcetti,at.if the court determines that the plaintiff either did not speak as a citizen or did not speak on a matter of public concern,the employee has no first amendment cause of action based on his or her employer reaction to the speech.id.
the supreme court has defined a matter of public concern as one that relat es to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick,at.whether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.id.at.
connick concerned the speech of sheila myers,an assistant district attorney in new orleans.after myers learned that she would be transferred to prosecute cases in a different section of the criminal move she strongly distributed a questionnaire,soliciting the views of the other staff members concerning the office transfer policy,office morale,the need for a grievance committee,the level of confidence in supervisors,and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.id.at.after distributing the survey,myers was told by her supervisor that her employment was terminated because of her refusal to accept the transfer.id.she filed suit under,alleging that her employment was wrongfully terminated because she had exercised her constitutionally protected right to free speech.id.
in assessing myers statements,the supreme court concluded that,with one exception,the issues she raised in her questionnaire did not involve matters of public concern.the court noted that myers did not seek to inform the public that the district attorney office was not discharging its governmental responsibilities.id.at.instead,the court observed,the focus of myers s questions is to gather ammunition for another round of controversy with her superiors.these questions reflect one employee dissatisfaction with a transfer and an attempt to turn that displeasure into a cause célèbre.id.the court went on to state that w hile as a matter of good judgment,public officials should be receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees,the first amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.id.at.
despite the court description of myers motive,it went on to conclude that one question in her questionnaire did address a matter of public concern namely,whether any of the assistant district attorneys ever fe lt pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office supported candidates.id.the court noted that there is a demonstrated interest in this country that government service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service,and concluded that g iven this history,we believe it apparent that the issue of whether assistant district attorneys are pressured to work in political campaigns is a matter of interest to the community upon which it is essential that public employees be able to speak out freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.id.accordingly,the connick decision supported,among other things,the proposition that a speaker motive was not dispositive in determining whether his or her speech addressed a matter of public concern.
our court directly addressed the significance of a speaker motive in lewis cowen,cir,a case involving the speech of the chief of a state lottery unit,who alleged that he was fired in retaliation for refusing to publicly support a change in the lottery.id.at.the lewis court began its inquiry into whether the unit chief speech addressed a matter of public concern by noting that w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court to decide,taking into account the content,form,and context of a given statement as revealed by the whole record.id.at citing connick,at and.the lewis court stated that i n reaching this decision,the court should focus on the motive of the speaker and attempt to determine whether the speech was calculated to redress personal grievances or whether it had a broader public purpose.lewis,at citing curtis oklahoma city pub.sch.bd.of,cir.
despite the fact that the lewis court suggested that the speaker motive was critical in considering whether his or her speech addressed a matter of public concern,in cioffi averill park central school district board of education,cir,we held that motive is not dispositive in making this determination.as our court stated 
d efendants contention that a speaker primary motivation for speaking is dispositive in determining whether speech is personal or public conflicts directly with the supreme court holding in connick.there,a public employee distributed a questionnaire to fellow in order to marshal support for her personal grievance with superiors.connick,at.although personal interest primarily motivated the speech,the supreme court concluded that one of the questions on the questionnaire touched upon a matter of public concern and was thus protected by the first amendment.id.at.in other words,although the speaker overall motivation was personal,that fact was not dispositive.if it were,then the supreme court direction that we examine the content,form,and context of a given statement to determine whether it addresses a matter of public concern would be stripped of its meaning and purpose.
cioffi,at emphasis added and footnote omitted.
the decision in cioffi was echoed and expanded by our decision in reuland.reuland concerned a senior assistant district attorney from the brooklyn district attorney office,who had given an interview to new york magazine about a book he had written,which was a fictionalized account of a brooklyn district attorney.id.at.in the interview,the senior assistant district attorney stated that brooklyn is the best place to be a homicide prosecutor because w e got more dead bodies per square inch than anyplace else.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether or not the speech in question addressed a matter of public concern,a divided panel of our court reviewed the supreme court decision in connick,and held that the speaker motive,while one factor that may be considered,is not dispositive as to whether his speech addressed a matter of public concern.id.at.relying on this general proposition,the panel majority held that,despite the fact that the jury at trial found that reuland was not motivated by a desire to address a matter of public concern,the statement nevertheless addressed what the court believed was inherently a matter of public concern the crime rate in brooklyn.id.at.the panel majority continued w e therefore have little difficulty concluding that reuland statement to new york magazine addressed a matter of public concern.id.
in reaching its conclusion,the panel majority in reuland noted that its view was the majority view among circuits that had considered the relevance of a speaker motive 
other circuits that have considered the role of motive on the question of public concern have almost uniformly agreed with our reading of connick and found that motive is not dispositive.see tripp cole,cir where a public employee speaks out on a topic which is clearly a legitimate matter of inherent concern to the electorate,the court may eschew further inquiry into the employee motives internal quotation marks and citation omitted markos city of atlanta,cir noting that although motivation is often relevant,it is not the new litmus test for the matter of public concern analysis,displacing the connick factors anderer jones,cir we acknowledge that motive is relevant to the matter of public concern inquiry,though it is not dispositive.internal quotations and alterations omitted alpha energy savers,hansen,cir w e have held that motive should not be used as a litmus test for public concern rather,content is the greatest single factor in the connick inquiry.internal quotations omitted azzaro county of allegheny,cir connick indicates that the speaker motive,while often a relevant part of the context of the speech,is not dispositive in determining whether a particular statement relates to a matter of public concern.chappel montgomery county fire prot.dist,cir t he motive which underlies an employee statements is a relevant,but not necessarily dispositive factor in considering whether an employee statements may be fairly characterized as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.citation and internal quotation marks omitted morris crow,cir a n employee motive for speech,while not dispositive,is a factor that must be considered in determining whether speech is a matter of public concern.barnard jackson county,cir insofar as is found to have motivated speech,the employee expression is entitled to less weight in the pickering bd.of,d balance than speech on matter of public concern intended to serve the public interest.internal quotations and alterations omitted.
reuland,at.the panel majority went on to note that only one circuit arguably had expressed a different view 
only the tenth circuit has potentially treated motive as dispositive,although it has not explicitly so held.see,schalk gallemore,cir in drawing the thin line between a public employee speech which touches on matters of public concern,and speech from the same employee which only deals with personal employment matters,we have looked to the subjective intent of the speaker.
finally,the panel majority in reuland addressed the statements in lewis suggesting the centrality of a speaker motive in determining whether the speech constituted a matter of public concern,and attempted to reconcile its holding with lewis 
in lewis cowen,we noted that,in determining whether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern,the court should focus on the motive of the speaker and attempt to determine whether the speech was calculated to redress personal grievances or whether it had a broader public purpose,cir.nevertheless,consistent with our previous cases,we focused on private motives related to employment,stating that speech on a purely private matter,such as an employee dissatisfaction with the conditions of his employment,does not pertain to a matter of public concern.id.at.none of these cases suggest that the speaker motive alone is dispositive of the public concern issue,and this is especially true where this motive is not to address an employment grievance.
reuland,at.
despite our holding in reuland that a speaker motive is not dispositive when a court considers whether the speech at issue addresses a matter of public concern,our recent holding in ruotolo city of new york,cir suggested otherwise.in ruotolo,a retired police sergeant sued the city of new york and various officials and members of the new york city police department,alleging retaliation in violation of the first amendment for a lawsuit he had filed.in assessing whether ruotolo lawsuit addressed a matter of public concern,the ruotolo panel reached back to our earlier decision in lewis 
whether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court to decide,taking into account the content,form,and context of a given statement as revealed by the whole record.lewis cowen,cir citing connick myers,and,d.the heart of the matter is whether the employee speech was calculated to redress personal grievances or whether it had a broader public purpose.lewis,at.
ruotolo,at emphasis added.the court then concluded that because ruotolo lawsuit sought to redress his personal grievances,i t did not seek to advance a public purpose.id 
to the extent that our precedents have been less than clear,we reaffirm today our holding in reuland a speaker motive is not dispositive in determining whether his or her speech addresses a matter of public concern.see reuland,at.as both the reuland and cioffi decisions make clear,our conclusion here is also compelled by the holding of the supreme court in connick.see id.at the facts of the supreme court decision in connick indicate that motive is not dispositive as to whether an employee speech is a matter of public concern.cioffi,at citing connick,at.in connick,the supreme court concluded that part of the questionnaire addressed a matter of public concern despite the fact that the assistant district attorney decision to circulate her questionnaire was motivated by her own employment grievances.see connick,at.as noted by our court in reuland,this reading of connick has led almost every other court of appeals to conclude that a speaker motive is not dispositive in assessing whether his or her speech addressed a matter of public concern.see reuland,at other circuits that have considered the role of motive on the question of public concern have almost uniformly agreed with our reading of connick and found that motive is not dispositive.collecting cases.
we note that this holding does not negate the fact that,as we stated in lewis,speech on a purely private matter,such as an employee dissatisfaction with the conditions of his employment,does not pertain to a matter of public concern.lewis,at.an employee who complains solely about his own dissatisfaction with the conditions of his own employment is speaking upon matters only of personal interest.connick,at.we make clear today,however,that it does not follow that a person motivated by a personal grievance can not be speaking on a matter of public concern.
in the case at hand,we conclude that the district court erred in concluding that sousa speech did not address a matter of public concern because he was motivated by employment grievances.the district court read our court precedents to stand for the proposition that where the employee private motives are expressed in the context of an employee grievance the speech at issue does not address a matter of public concern,sousa,wl,at,and cited our court opinion in reuland for support.if anything,however,reuland made plain that our court has not consistently taken this view 
our previous cases suggesti
