gil rodríguez ramos,a former trust employee of the metropolitan bus authority of puerto rico mba,sued various public officials under,alleging that a decision not to install him in a career attorney position in the mba was politically motivated and was effected without due process of law,in violation of his first and fourteenth amendment rights.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss all claims.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.we affirm the dismissal of the due process claim as to all defendants,and as well,dismissal of the first amendment claim as to all defendants,save for defendant delgado.as to the first amendment claim against delgado,we vacate the dismissal and remand with instructions to grant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint.
factual background 
on review of this motion to dismiss,we recount the relevant facts based upon the allegations in the complaint.see tambone,cir en banc.we supplement that account with reference to puerto rico statutes and facts susceptible to judicial notice,as necessary to place the allegations in context.see haley boston,cir.
in asserting an entitlement to a position as an attorney i within the mba,the complaint alleges that rodríguez is a and active member of the popular democratic party pdp.he began his public employment with the commonwealth of puerto rico in and for the next decade he held career positions in various government agencies he maintained his career status while attending law school,and he was admitted to practice law in early.
that spring,after taking the pertinent competitive exam,rodríguez was appointed to the career position of attorney i in the administration of corrections aoc,where he had previously worked in capacities.approximately nine months later,in january,he was appointed to the trust position of director of the office of legal affairs of the aoc.according to the plaintiff translation,his appointment letter stated 
this designation to the director of the office of legal affairs does not excuse you from complying with all the duties and responsibilities of the position you presently occupy as attorney i in the office of legal affairs,position in the career service to which you were promoted last march.your probationary period shall not be interrupted while you prevail in this designation.
on may,the aoc secretary favorably evaluated rodríguez and approved his completion of the probationary period for the attorney i position,effective april 
two months later rodríguez was appointed to the trust position of deputy administrator of management and administration in the aoc.he was subsequently appointed to a number of other trust positions in various agencies,including assistant secretary of investigations of the department of corrections and rehabilitation,sub administrator of the aoc,deputy chief of administration and later chief of the medical emergency corps,and administrator of the general services administration gsa.with the exception of a brief interlude in september during which he was reassigned to a career position as attorney i,rodríguez held trust positions continuously from july until december.
this period of the plaintiff employment in trust positions coincided with pdp control of the governorship.in november,however,the candidate of the new progressive party npp was elected governor.with the resulting transfer of power impending,the outgoing administration moved rodríguez on december,from his trust position as chief of the medical emergency corps to a career attorney position within the gsa two days later,on december,rodríguez was appointed to the trust position of special assistant to the president in the metropolitan bus authority,an agency of roughly employees in which he had never previously worked.this was the position that rodríguez held when the npp government was installed two weeks later.
the political shift in the executive branch brought with it changes in trust position personnel throughout the government.the president of the npp and new governor of puerto rico,luis fortuño burset,appointed ruben hernández gregorat as secretary of transportation and public works.hernández,in turn,named santos delgado marrero as president and general manager of the mba.
upon delgado appointment,and allegedly at delgado request,rodríguez submitted a letter of resignation from his trust position as special assistant on january.in his letter,citing a provision of the puerto rico civil service law that entitles a departing trust employee to reclaim a career position equivalent to the last career position that the employee had held,rodríguez also requested that he be reinstated to an attorney i career position.see laws ann.tit.contemporaneously with submitting this letter,rodríguez requested a meeting with delgado to discuss the matter.not having received a reply,three weeks later rodríguez submitted a second written reinstatement request to delgado.this request also went unanswered.
over the next few months,although remaining in his trust position,rodríguez was gradually relieved of the duties and functions that he had performed as special assistant.the complaint alleges that delgado ordered rodríguez internet access removed,excluded him from meetings,and severed his workload.the complaint lists numerous days between january and the end of june on which rodríguez neither performed nor was assigned any job function whatsoever.although he occasionally was given assignments to do legal work,in may when a union attorney referred to the plaintiff a sexual harassment dispute that had arisen in the mba,delgado issued orders preventing rodríguez from handling the matter.instead,it is alleged,throughout this period delgado engaged outside counsel to handle this and most other legal matters at a cost of approximately per month.
rodríguez request to be placed in a career position remained pending for most of the first half of,although the complaint alleges that in april delgado did attempt to have rodríguez transferred to another agency.in early march,delgado executive secretary had told rodríguez not to worry because his request had been approved,but he remained in the special assistant position into june.on june,rodríguez inquired about his status with gladys fuentes cruz,the mba vice president of management and human capital,in the presence of judith morales morales,special aide to delgado in personnel matters.fuentes explained that she was not working on the matter,which was being handled directly by delgado with no involvement of human resources personnel.
on june,rodríguez received a letter from delgado appointing him to a career position as a bus terminal administrator within the mba,effective the first day of july.rodríguez describes this appointment as a demotion to an inferior working position to that which he is entitled to with a salary of monthly below to that which he should have been entitled.prior to the effective date of this assignment,neither the president of the mba nor any member of the human resources staff met with rodríguez to discuss the assignment.additionally,when on june rodríguez used the standard form to request a review of his personnel file,he was told,allegedly contrary to standard procedures,that he must write a letter making the request.the complaint states that rodríguez complied and made such a written request on june.
the next day,july,when his new duties were set to begin,rodríguez filed this action in federal court.invoking,he alleged that he was denied placement in an attorney i position in the mba as a result of his political affiliation and without due process of law,in violation of his first and fourteenth amendment rights.the complaint named as defendants hernández,delgado,morales and fuentes,each in his or her individual and official capacities.
the district court dismissed the federal claims pursuant to the defendants motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,and this timely appeal followed

we review de novo an order of dismissal for failure to state a claim.tambone,at.in conducting this review,we disregard statements in the complaint that merely offer legal conclusion s couched as fact or threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir quoting ashcroft iqbal,d.the remaining,allegations are entitled to a presumption of truth,and we draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader favor.see id.the standard is that the combined allegations,taken as true,must state a plausible,not a merely conceivable,case for relief.sepúlveda villarini dep t of educ.of,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must,in other words,allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal.at.
political discrimination 
it is well established that g overnment officials are forbidden by the first amendment from taking adverse action against public employees on the basis of political affiliation,unless political loyalty is an appropriate requirement of the employment.ocasio hernández,at citing,inter alia,rutan republican party of,d.the parties do not dispute that the plaintiff position as special assistant to the president of the mba was a policymaking trust position for which party affiliation was an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the office.branti finkel,d.consequently,to the extent that the plaintiff attempts to challenge the diminution of his functions and eventual transfer from that position,his claim necessarily fails.see valdizán rivera hernandez,cir ruiz casillas camacho morales,cir.
the main thrust of the political discrimination claim,however,is that the plaintiff suffered political discrimination when he was reinstated to a particular career position,when he wanted another.specifically,he challenges his assignment to the purportedly inferior position of bus terminal administrator rather than to an attorney i position in the mba to which he claims entitlement under puerto rico law.with respect to this employment action,the first amendment prohibition on political discrimination potentially does apply.gaztambide barbosa torres gaztambide,cir finding first amendment prohibition on political discrimination applicable to defendants failure to reinstate trust employee entitled to career position under puerto rico civil service law.
to state an actionable claim of political discrimination,the plaintiff complaint must plausibly allege that he is not of the defendants political affiliation and that the defendants were aware of his affiliation.the complaint must also allege an adverse employment action and that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse action.see lamboy ortiz ortiz vélez,cir.moreover,each defendant role in the adverse action must be sufficiently alleged to make him or her a plausible defendant.after all,we must determine whether,as to each defendant,a plaintiff pleadings are sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.ocasio hernández,at quoting sanchez pereira castillo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court correctly concluded that the plaintiff allegations of participation are speculative and thus inadequate with respect to all of the defendants except delgado.liability under section can not rest solely on a defendant position of authority,ocasio hernández,at,yet that is all that the plaintiff offers as to the roles of defendants hernández,morales,and fuentes in his reinstatement.the only factual allegations made with respect to hernández are that he was appointed secretary of transportation and public works and that he in turn appointed delgado to the position of president and general manager of the mba.as to morales,the complaint states only that she was a special aide to delgado and was present when the plaintiff asked fuentes about the status of his reassignment.the plaintiff did argue in response to the motion to dismiss that hernández and morales have ultimate statutory authority over personnel decisions,see metropolitan bus authority act,laws ann.tit,et,but given that the complaint contains no allegations that these individuals actually participated in or condoned the personnel decision at issue here,it fails to render them plausible defendants.compare peñalbert rosa fortuno burset,cir holding insufficient bald assertions that defendants,by virtue of their positions,participated in or approve d of adverse employment action,with ocasio hernández,at reaching opposite result where complaint detailed defendants personal involvement.
the alleged participation of defendant fuentes is no less speculative.the complaint indicates that fuentes was the mba vice president of management and human capital,a position that might more plausibly involve her in personnel decisions relating to the reinstatement of removed trust employees.but the complaint fails to include allegations to that effect,much less allegations suggesting that fuentes played any role specifically in the plaintiff reinstatement.see ayala rodríguez rullán,cir.in fact,the complaint alleges just the opposite that fuentes was kept out of employment decisions involving the plaintiff.as such,there is no basis from which to infer that fuentes engaged in or set in motion a series of acts that led to the alleged adverse employment action.sanchez,at quoting gutierrez rodriguez cartagena,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we turn,then,to whether the political discrimination claim survives the motion to dismiss with respect to defendant delgado.there can be no disputing that the complaint satisfies the first two political discrimination claim elements,which incorporate an awareness by the defendant s that the plaintiff is of a different political persuasion.the complaint contains straightforward allegations that the plaintiff and delgado are of competing political parties,stating that rodríguez is a member of the pdp and each of the defendants is a member of the npp.it also contains detailed descriptions of the plaintiff history of trust positions held under pdp administrations and his active and visible role in party politics,from which it is plausible to infer that the defendants knew of his political affiliation see grajales ports,cir plausible to infer defendants knowledge from facts that plaintiff was placed in a prestigious trust position by pdp hierarch under a pdp administration see also montfort rodríguez rey hernández,cir finding that defendant knowledge that plaintiffs were trust employees under prior party administration was circumstantial evidence that defendant was aware of political affiliation.
taken as whole,the complaint also adequately alleges delgado involvement in the decision to assign the plaintiff as a bus terminal administrator.we have noted that fuentes was not involved in the plaintiff reinstatement to a career position because,according to the complaint,delgado took the matter into his own hands.the plaintiff alleges that he was told that delgado was directly handling his reinstatement request,and his inquiries into the status of that request were repeatedly directed back to delgado personally.accepting these facts as true,they give rise to the inference that delgado was involved in,if not directly responsible for,the reinstatement decision.
the requirement of plausibility on a motion to dismiss under rule b simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the illegal conduct.ocasio hernández,at quoting bell atl.twombly,d.under puerto rico law,trust employees who were previously in the career service are eligible to be reinstated as career employees.an employee with regular status in the career service who move s to the confidential service,shall have the absolute right to be reinstated in a position equal or similar to the last job he held within the career service,and is entitled to all benefits in terms of classification and salary that have been extended to the career job they held during the term in which they served in the confidential service.laws ann.tit,see also colón santiago rosario,cir.this entitlement is at the heart of rodríguez claim.
