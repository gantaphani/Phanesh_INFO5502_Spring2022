appeal from the portions of a final order and judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lawrence mckenna,judge entered on june and,respectively,that dismissed plaintiffs claims for relief under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,the fifteenth amendment of the united states constitution,and section of the voting rights act of,codified at,et vra.our court,sitting en banc,previously resolved plaintiffs appeal under the vra,see hayden pataki,cir en banc hayden i,by affirming the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings to as to that claim.when we decided hayden i,we noted that plaintiffs constitutional claims were not before the en banc court and that a decision on those claims would be made by a panel in the normal course.id.at.it is these remaining constitutional claims that we now address.
on appeal,plaintiffs raise two arguments.first,they argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that,based on the discriminatory intent of prior constitutional convention delegates,new york current felon disenfranchisement laws violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the fifteenth amendment.more specifically,plaintiffs contend that racial animus motivated the adoption of new york several constitutional felon disenfranchisement provisions in the and that this animus remains legally operative today.plaintiffs second argument is that the district court erred in dismissing their claim that new york election law violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it disenfranchises,without justification,only those persons with felony convictions who are incarcerated or on parole,but not persons receiving other sentences for felony convictions.
with respect to plaintiffs first claim,we conclude that plaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim of intentional discrimination.with respect to plaintiffs second claim,we conclude that new york disenfranchisement statute does not distinguish among felons in an unconstitutional manner.we therefore affirm the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings to defendants.we do,however,remand to the district court to allow plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their deficient complaint as to their intentional discrimination claim.
background 
procedural background 
this case was originally filed pro se by plaintiff joseph hayden on november,in the southern district of new york.on january,hayden moved through counsel for leave to file an amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.on march,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint challenging the validity of new york state constitutional provision that requires the legislature to enact felon disenfranchisement laws and new york election law,which disenfranchises convicted felons who are incarcerated or on parole.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that these enactments violate their rights under the vra the united states constitution,specifically the first,fourteenth,and fifteenth amendments the civil rights acts of and and customary international law.defendants filed an answer to plaintiffs complaint on april.
a discovery schedule was established on may,with initial disclosures due on july.before discovery commenced,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.plaintiffs filed their opposition on september.on june,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,and dismissing all of plaintiffs claims.hayden pataki,wl june.the district court entered judgment on behalf of defendants on june.
in its decision,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim under section of the vra in light of our decision in muntaqim coombe,cir.hayden,wl,at.soon thereafter,our court,nostra sponte,ordered an en banc consideration of plaintiffs vra claim and affirmed the district court decision by holding that the vra does not apply to prisoner disenfranchisement laws.hayden i,at.thus,this issue has been resolved,and is no longer before us.
the district court memorandum and order of june,also decided the remaining issues in favor of defendants.in granting defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,the district court held that plaintiffs had not alleged facts sufficient to state claims against defendants under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.specifically,the district court found that plaintiffs factual allegations were not sufficient to support a finding that new york constitutional provision requiring the legislature to disenfranchise felons was passed with discriminatory intent.hayden,wl,at.the district court also found that new york legislative practice of disenfranchising only those felons sentenced to incarceration or serving parole is entirely rational.id.accordingly,the district court held that neither new york constitutional provision nor its felon disenfranchisement statute violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment or the fifteenth amendment.id.at.
plaintiffs now appeal the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the district court erred in finding that they failed to allege sufficient facts to support their intentional discrimination and equal protection claims.plaintiffs have abandoned the claims they brought before the district court under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,the first amendment,federal civil rights statutes,and customary international law.
ii.new york felon disenfranchisement laws 
the new york state constitution requires the legislature to enact laws excluding from the right of suffrage all persons convicted of bribery or of any infamous crime.const.art.ii.new york statutory law prohibits convicted felons from voting while they are serving a prison sentence or while they are on parole following a prison sentence.law.new york law,however,does allow felons to vote if they have completed their sentences,received suspended sentences,or never been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.id.thus,a felon in new york is disenfranchised only until his maximum sentence of imprisonment has expired or he has been discharged from parole.id.
new york state constitutional requirement of felon disenfranchisement dates back to the early nineteenth century.the constitution of provided that l aws may be passed excluding from the right of suffrage persons who have been,or may be,convicted of infamous crimes.const.of,art.ii,emphasis added,reprinted in charles lincoln,the constitutional history of new york the lawyers coop.publ g hereinafter constitutional history of.similar language was included in the constitution of,except that the crimes of bribery and larceny were specified,along with convictions for any infamous crime.see constitutional history of,supra,at.an amendment adopted in required the legislature to disenfranchise felons at the next session,but stated that thereafter the provision would revert to being permissive rather than mandatory.see id.at the constitution of,however,adopted the mandatory language,making it permanent.see id.at.this same language,stating that t he legislature shall enact laws excluding from the right of suffrage all persons convicted of bribery or of any infamous crime,was moved to a different section in the constitution of and continues to be in force to the present.see const.art.ii,emphasis added,credits and historical notes.thus,through article ii,of the new york state constitution,the state legislature is required to enact laws disenfranchising felons.
the current prisoner disenfranchisement statute is new york election law.the statute provides in relevant part 
no person who has been convicted of a felony pursuant to the laws of this state,shall have the right to register for or vote at any election unless he shall have been pardoned or restored to the rights of citizenship by the governor,or his maximum sentence of imprisonment has expired,or he has been discharged from parole.the governor,however,may attach as a condition to any such pardon that any such person shall not have the right of suffrage until it shall have been separately restored to him.
law like the constitutional requirement that felons be disenfranchised,the felon disenfranchisement statute also has roots in the nineteenth century.see ch.vi,tit.i,stat.of,vol.at act of april,ch,laws.the felon disenfranchisement statute was briefly repealed in,see act of may,ch,laws,but then reenacted five years later,see act of may,ch,laws.the law has continued to be in force,albeit subject to various amendments,since.the most significant statutory change came in the early.until that time the statute had disenfranchised all persons convicted of a felony,even those who had served their sentence or were not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.in and,however,the legislature enacted laws amending the statute to its present scheme.since then,felons have their voting rights restored if they i are not sentenced to prison ii have their prison sentence suspended iii have completed their maximum prison sentence or iv have been discharged from parole.see act of may,ch,laws,act of june,ch,laws.
iii.plaintiffs allegations of discrimination as stated in their amended complaint 
alleged history of racial discrimination in new york disenfranchisement laws 
plaintiffs amended complaint asserts that there is a history of race discrimination in new york state disenfranchisement laws,that there is disparate application of new york state election law,and that racial disparities exist in the disenfranchisement rates of blacks and latinos.based on these allegations,plaintiffs contend that new york constitutional provision mandating felon disenfranchisement was enacted with the intent to discriminate against persons on account of their race in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the fifteenth amendment.plaintiffs further argue that new york felon disenfranchisement scheme violates equal protection guarantees because it distinguishes among felons in an unconstitutional manner by denying the right to vote only to those felons sentenced to incarceration or serving parole and not to those who have their prison sentence suspended or who are sentenced to probation.
specifically,plaintiffs amended complaint makes the following relevant allegations new york has historically used a wide variety of mechanisms to discriminate against minority voters.throughout the new york constitutional conventions addressing the right of suffrage,the framers made explicit statements of intent to discriminate against minority voters.delegates created certain voting requirements that expressly applied only to racial minorities and crafted other provisions with seemingly neutral language that they knew would have a discriminatory effect on racial minorities.the disenfranchisement of felons was one aspect of this effort to deprive minorities of the right to vote.for example,plaintiffs complaint alleges that in,the framers initially excluded minorities by limiting suffrage to property holders and free men,but then as more blacks became property holders and freemen,the legislature removed all property restrictions and instead expressly excluded blacks from participating in the election of constitutional delegates.
furthermore,a t the second new york constitutional convention in,the delegates met to address the issue of suffrage generally and black suffrage in particular the conversation sparked heated discussions,during which many delegates expressed the view that racial minorities were essentially unequipped to participate in civil society,and s ome delegates made explicit statements regarding blacks natural inferiority and unfitness for suffrage,see also nathaniel carter,william stone marcus gould,reports of the proceedings and debates of the convention of,albany,hosford hereinafter debates of for example,one delegate to the convention instructed his colleagues to l ook to your jails and penitentiaries.by whom are they filled by the very race,whom it is now proposed to cloth sic with the power of deciding upon your political rights.debates of,supra,at.another delegate urged his fellow delegates to s urvey your bridewells and your penitentiaries,and what a darkening host meets your eye more than of the convicts and felons which those walls enclose,are of your sable population.id.at.another argued that the right of suffrage should be extended to white men only.id.at.
based on their belief in blacks unfitness for democratic participation,the delegates designed new voting requirements aimed at stripping black citizens of their previously held right to vote.article ii of the constitution of incorporated the new discriminatory restrictions and contained new and unusually high property requirements that expressly applied only to men of color.const.art.ii,repealed.only a tiny percentage of the total black population met these requirements.article ii also provided new citizenship requirements that applied only to men of color.id.as one delegate to the constitutional convention explained,while the new property qualification did not directly restrict the right to vote to the white male,as some had desired,nevertheless,the same result was accomplished by inserting property qualifications that were not required for the white man.state constitutional convention,problems relating to home rule and local government,lyon.article ii further restricted the suffrage of minorities by permitting the state legislature to disenfranchise persons who have been,or may be,convicted of infamous crimes.const.art.ii.through common law and legislative interpretation,infamous crimes came to mean traditional felonies.in,an amendment to the new york constitution abolished all property qualifications for white male suffrage,but left intact the unduly onerous property requirements for black males.
in,at the third constitutional convention of new york,heated debates over suffrage again focused on blacks.advocating for the denial of equal suffrage,delegates continued to make explicit statements regarding blacks unfitness for suffrage,including a declaration that the proportion of infamous crime in the minority population was more than thirteen times that in the white population,see also william bishop william attree,report of the debates and proceedings of the convention for the revision of the constitution of the state of new york,evening atlas hereinafter debates of substantiating claim that delegates understood that blacks were thirteen times more likely to commit infamous crimes than whites.felon disenfranchisement was further solidified in the convention of.as amended,the relevant constitutional provision stated laws may be passed excluding from the right of suffrage all persons who have been or may be convicted of bribery,of larceny,or of any infamous crime const.art.ii,amended emphasis added.when the felon disenfranchisement provision and specifically including any infamous crime in the category of convictions that would disqualify voters,the delegates were acutely aware that these restrictions would have a discriminatory impact on blacks.at the fourth constitutional convention of new york,after engaging in heated debates,legislators rejected various proposals to expand suffrage and instead chose to maintain racially discriminatory property qualifications.
new york explicit racially discriminatory suffrage requirements were in place until voided by the adoption of the fifteenth amendment to the united states constitution in.under of the fifteenth amendment,the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race,color,or previous condition of servitude.const.amend.xv.t wo years after the passage of the fifteenth amendment,an unprecedented committee convened and amended the disenfranchisement provision of the new york constitution to require the state legislature,at its following session,to enact laws excluding persons convicted of infamous crimes from the right to vote.const.art.ii,amended.theretofore,the enactment of such laws was permissive.
unlike the allegations just described,plaintiffs complaint includes no specific factual allegations of discriminatory intent that.for example,with regard to the present constitutional provision that remains in force today and that was enacted in,plaintiffs simply state that i n,at the constitutional convention following the new york constitutional amendment,the delegates permanently abandoned the permissive language and adopted a constitutional requirement that the legislature enact disenfranchisement laws.plaintiffs further allege that this is the constitutional provision pursuant to which of the new york state election law was enacted and under which persons incarcerated and on parole for felony convictions are presently disenfranchised in new york state.as is apparent from this quoted language,plaintiffs amended complaint does not allege any facts as to discriminatory intent behind the delegates adoption of the constitutional provision,which is still in effect today.nor do plaintiffs make any factual allegations of discriminatory intent with respect to the enactment of,and subsequent amendments to,new york felon disenfranchisement statute.
alleged racial disparities in disenfranchisement rates of blacks and latinos 
in addition to claiming that new york laws were enacted with discriminatory intent,plaintiffs allege that new york laws are unconstitutional in that they currently have a disparate impact on blacks and latinos.according to plaintiffs,blacks and latinos in new york are prosecuted,convicted,and sentenced to incarceration at rates substantially disproportionate to whites.to support this assertion,plaintiffs cite to the census in their amended complaint although blacks constitute of the state population,they comprise of the current prison population and of the current parolee population in new york although latinos constitute of the state population,they comprise of the current prison population and of the current parolee population in new york and although whites constitute of the state population,they comprise only of current prisoners and parolees.thus,collectively,blacks and latinos constitute of the total current prison population and of the total current parolee population,despite being only of the overall state population.
furthermore,blacks and latinos are sentenced to incarceration at substantially higher rates than whites,and whites are sentenced to probation at substantially higher rates than blacks and latinos.for example,in whites made up approximately of total felony convictions,yet comprised of those who received probation and only of those incarcerated for felony convictions.by contrast,blacks made up of those convicted of a felony,yet approximately only of those sentenced to probation and over of those sentenced to incarceration.latinos comprised of those convicted of a felony,yet only of those sentenced to probation and over of those sentenced to incarceration.in addition,although whites make up of the total population of persons currently sentenced to probation in new york,blacks make up and latinos.and finally,n early of those currently denied the right to vote pursuant to new york state election law,are black and nearly are latino.collectively,blacks and latinos comprise nearly of those currently denied the right to vote pursuant to new york state election law.
alleged disparate application of new york state election law 
new york law prohibits convicted felons from voting while they are serving a prison sentence or while they are on parole following a prison sentence.see law.new york does,however,allow felons to vote if they have completed their maximum sentence of imprisonment including parole,received suspended or commuted sentences,or been sentenced to probation or conditional or unconditional discharge.see law.plaintiffs claim that,because this law is in its distinctions between felons who are and are not disenfranchised,it violates the requirements of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c johnson rowley,cir per curiam.in deciding a rule c motion,we employ the same standard applicable to dismissals pursuant to.b.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we will accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.to survive a rule c motion,plaintiffs complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted quoting ashcroft iqbal.
although this appeal was briefed and argued prior to the supreme court decision in iqbal,the standard enunciated by the court in that decision,which clarified the rationale of bell atlantic twombly,controls our analysis of plaintiffs amended complaint in iqbal,the supreme court suggested a approach to evaluate the sufficiency of a complaint.at.a court can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.at see also harris mills,cir first,although a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint,that tenet is inapplicable to legal conclusions,and threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.at the second step,a court should determine whether the factual allegations,assumed to be true,plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.iqbal.at see also harris,at second,only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss,and determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement,but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.iqbal.at internal quotation marks omitted 
ii.intentional discrimination 
the first question presented by this case is whether the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claim of intentional discrimination at the pleadings stage for providing insufficient factual allegations.although,as discussed in greater detail infra,we find plaintiffs allegations sufficient with regard to the,and constitutional provisions,we find that plaintiffs fail to allege any facts to support a finding of discriminatory intent as to the provision or subsequent statutory enactments.accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs fail to state a claim that is plausible on its face or,stated differently,that nudge their claims of invidious discrimination across the line from conceivable to plausible.iqbal.at internal quotation marks omitted.we will remand to the district court,however,to allow plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their deficient complaint.
first iqbal pleadings 
we begin our analysis by reviewing plaintiffs amended complaint for allegations that are conclusory and thus are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.at.plaintiffs allege,for example,that t he disenfranchisement of felons was one aspect of constitutional delegates adopting certain voting requirements to deprive minorities of the right to vote,which is a bare assertion amount ing to nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a constitutional discrimination claim,iqbal.at internal quotation marks omitted finding the following similar allegations conclusory that particular defendants knew of,condoned,and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject plaintiff to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy,solely on account of his religion,race,national origin and for no legitimate penological interest and that defendant ashcroft was the principal architect of this invidious policy and defendant mueller was instrumental in adopting and executing it internal citations omitted.similarly,plaintiffs allegation that the constitution further restricted the suffrage of minorities by permitting the state legislature to disenfranchise persons who have been,or may be,convicted of infamous crimes is conclusory,for whether the facially neutral disenfranchisement provision restricted the suffrage of minorities in effect and intent is the very assertion that plaintiffs must prove.finally,plaintiffs allege that new york election law was enacted pursuant to the new york state constitution with the intent to disenfranchise blacks,which is not only a bare assertion,but is the only allegation in plaintiffs amended complaint that new york felon disenfranchisement statutory provisions were enacted with discriminatory intent.
after setting aside these and other conclusory allegations we nonetheless find,for the reasons discussed below,that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show that the,and constitutional provisions were enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose.but,fatal to plaintiffs intentional discrimination claim,they have failed to allege that this invidious purpose motivated the enactment of either the constitutional provision or any of the statutory provisions.moreover,plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that the or amendments to new york election law were enacted because of the constitution mandate that the legislature enact felon disenfranchisement laws.
second iqbal of intentional discrimination claim 
the central purpose of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.washington davis.to violate the fourteenth amendment a statute need not be facially discriminatory,for even a statute,otherwise neutral on its face,violates the fourteenth amendment if it is applied so as invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race.id.at.however,p roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the equal protection clause.vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev.although d isproportionate impact is not irrelevant,washington,at,to violate the fourteenth amendment the disproportionate impact must be traced to a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race,pers.adm r of feeney,emphasis added citing washington,at 
discriminatory purpose implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.it implies that the decisionmaker s,in this case constitutional delegates and a state legislature,selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.feeney,at citation and footnote omitted.however,while a plaintiff must prove that there was a discriminatory purpose behind the course of action,a plaintiff need not prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes.arlington heights,at see also hunter underwood,stating that an additional purpose would not render nugatory the purpose to discriminate against all blacks feeney,at discriminatory intent is simply not amenable to calibration.it either is a factor that has influenced the legislative choice or it is not.
because discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof,litigants may make a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.the impact of the official it bears more heavily on one race than provide an important starting point.arlington heights,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but unless a clear pattern,unexplainable on grounds other than race,emerges,impact alone is not determinative,and the court must look to other evidence,id.footnote omitted.in arlington heights,the supreme court identified a list of some subjects of proper inquiry for determining whether a racially discriminatory intent existed,including t he historical background of the decision particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes,id.at,d epartures from the normal procedural sequence,s ubstantive departures,and t he legislative or administrative history especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body,minutes of its meetings,or reports,id.at.the court has noted,however,that p roving the motivation behind official action is often a problematic undertaking.hunter,at.
here,plaintiffs undoubtedly have alleged sufficient facts to establish the disproportionate impact of new york felon disenfranchisement laws on blacks and latinos,as compared with whites.see supra background,part.the question remains,however,as to whether plaintiffs have sufficiently traced that impact to a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race,feeney,at emphasis added,thereby stating a plausible claim of intentional race discrimination.
the supreme court has specifically addressed the constitutionality of felon disenfranchisement laws on two occasions.first,in richardson ramirez,the court held that a state may constitutionally exclude convicted felons from the franchise because of the fourteenth amendment provides an affirmative sanction for such exclusion,even though provides that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,const.amend.xiv.then,in hunter,the supreme court held that even though richardson said that felon disenfranchisement laws were generally constitutional under of the fourteenth amendment,alabama felon disenfranchisement provision nonetheless violated the equal protection clause because it was enacted with discriminatory intent.hunter,at.the court stated that it was confident that was not designed to permit the purposeful racial discrimination attending the enactment and operation of a state constitutional provision which otherwise violates of the fourteenth amendment.see also hayden i,at the fourteenth amendment,as interpreted by the supreme court,does not completely insulate felon disenfranchisement provisions from constitutional scrutiny.it is clear,for example,that if a state disenfranchises felons with the intent of disenfranchising blacks,that state has run afoul of of the fourteenth amendment.thus,while felon disenfranchisement laws are generally constitutional under of the fourteenth amendment,such laws will be held unconstitutional under if the laws are enacted with discriminatory intent.
as an initial matter,we find that plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that the,and felon disenfranchisement constitutional provisions were passed at least in part because of their adverse effects on blacks.first,plaintiffs allege that during the new york constitutional convention in,there were heated discussions during which delegates expressed the view that blacks were natural ly inferior and unfit for suffrage,see also debates of,supra,at,reflecting delegates view that prisons were largely populated by blacks.plaintiffs further allege that specific property and citizenship requirements tied to voting,which expressly applied only to blacks,were incorporated in the constitution of.second,plaintiffs assert that at the constitutional convention in,heated debates continued regarding blacks unfitness for suffrage,including a declaration that the proportion of felonies committed in the minority population was more than thirteen times that in the white population.finally,plaintiffs state that new york explicit discriminatory suffrage requirements were in place until voided by the adoption of the fifteenth amendment in,but that two years after the passage of the fifteenth amendment,an unprecedented committee convened and amended the disenfranchisement provision of the new york constitution to require the state legislature,at its following session,to enact laws excluding persons convicted of infamous crimes from the right to vote.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs based on these factual allegations,we find that plaintiffs satisfy the iqbal plausibility standard as to the alleged discriminatory intent behind the constitutional provisions.
the issue we are confronted with here,though,is whether the enactment of the constitutional provision,albeit preceded by earlier provisions that plausibly admit of racist origins,can support an equal protection claim.more specifically,the issue here is whether plaintiffs adequately allege intentional discrimination where they have pleaded sufficient factual matter to plausibly show that the,and enactments were motivated by a discriminatory purpose,but where they have not made any adequately supported factual allegations of impermissible motive affecting the delegates to the convention.see mccleskey kemp,recognizing that historical background of a decision is one source of evidence for proof of intentional discrimination under arlington heights,but that unless historical evidence is reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged decision,it has little probative value see also city of mobile bolden,plurality opinion by stewart,p ast discrimination can not,in the manner of original sin,condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.the ultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case.more distant instances of official discrimination in other cases are of limited help in resolving that question,superseded by statute on other grounds as explained in hayden i,at,arlington heights,at stating that legislative history may be highly relevant,especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body emphasis added.we hold that,under these circumstances,plaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim of intentional discrimination as to the enactment of the constitutional provision,which continues in effect today.
the supreme court decision in hunter does not alter our conclusion.in hunter,the court held that alabama constitutional disenfranchisement provision violated the equal protection clause because its original enactment was motivated by a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of race and the section continues to this day to have that effect.at.the hunter court did not decide,however,whether the provision would be valid if enacted today without any impermissible motivation.see also city of cleburne cleburne living,marshall,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part recently we held that extant laws originally motivated by a discriminatory purpose continue to violate the equal protection clause,even if they would be permissible were they reenacted without a discriminatory motive.citing hunter.the court did reject the argument that intervening events,such as the judicial invalidation of s ome of the more blatantly discriminatory selections,such as assault and battery on the wife and miscegenation,had cured the violation.hunter,at.it was clear in hunter,however,that a fter the enactment,the alabama legislature neither altered the provision nor reenacted it in a political atmosphere free of racial bias.rather,all of the amendments to the provision were the result of judicial action.johnson governor of,cir.en banc emphasis added,cert.denied.accordingly,i n hunter,the supreme court left open the precise question we confront here whether a subsequent legislative can eliminate the taint from a law that was originally enacted with discriminatory intent.id.at see also id.at cotton fordice,cir.
however,the en banc eleventh circuit in johnson faced a very similar issue to the one we now confront.in johnson,the eleventh circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,rejecting plaintiffs argument that florida felon disenfranchisement law violated the equal protection clause.the plaintiffs contended that racial animus motivated the adoption of florida criminal disenfranchisement provision in and this animus remains legally operative today,notwithstanding the fact that florida altered and reenacted the provision in.johnson,at.after assuming,without deciding,that racial animus motivated the law,id.at,the court held that florida felon disenfranchisement provision is constitutional because it was substantively altered and reenacted in in the absence of any evidence of racial bias,id.at see also cotton,at because mississippi deliberative procedure resulted both in and in in a of the state felon disenfranchisement constitutional provision originally enacted in,each amendment superseded the previous provision and removed the discriminatory taint associated with the original version.united states johnson,cert.denied,rejecting plaintiffs equal protection challenge to a federal statute based in part on the court finding that the undeniable racism that animated legislative debate leading to the passage of a statute criminalizing cocaine trafficking generally,long before the distinction was contemplated,is of no relevance to our inquiry into the motives of the congress that passed the act citing mccleskey,at.
here,the amendment to new york constitutional provision was not inconsequential.the provision that existed until that time,as amended in,provided that the legislature was required to pass a felon disenfranchisement law at its next session,but thereafter the passage of such laws was left to the legislature discretion,as it had always been.see supra.in,however,the constitutional delegates made permanent the mandatory aspect of the provision,and felon disenfranchisement laws have been required in new york ever since.this amendment served to substantively change how legislatures were permitted to consider,or no longer consider,whether felon disenfranchisement laws should be laws were mandated.given this substantive amendment to new york constitutional provision and the lack of any allegations by plaintiffs of discriminatory intent reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged decision,mccleskey,at,we can not hold that plaintiffs state a plausible claim of intentional discrimination as to the constitutional provision,which is the bridge necessary for plaintiffs to sufficiently trace any disparate impact of new york election law to a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race,feeney,at.
we do not take lightly the possibility that a legislative body might seek to insulate from challenge a law known to have been originally enacted with a discriminatory purpose by quietly reenacting it without significant change.see johnson,at barkett,dissenting expressing concern that legislatures could continue to utilize statutes that were originally motivated by racial animus,and that continue to produce discriminatory effects,so long as they the statutes deliberately and without explicit evidence of an illicit motivation.but that concern is ameliorated here because i plaintiffs have not alleged any such bad faith on the part of the delegates ii the amendment was not only deliberative,but was also substantive in scope and iii there are simply no allegations of any kind as to discriminatory intent of the delegates even though the supreme court in arlington heights provides a list of evidence that might establish discriminatory intent other than explicit evidence of an illicit motivation.see at stating that it is proper to consider d epartures from the normal procedural sequence or s ubstantive departures.
moreover,not only is a discriminatory purpose not alleged with respect to the enactment,but an obvious alternative explanation exists to support the propriety of the enactment.see iqbal.at quoting twombly,at.as defendants contend,prisoner disenfranchisement is more likely the product of legitimate motives than invidious discrimination,as demonstrated by its adoption in virtually every state,its affirmative sanction in of the fourteenth amendment,and its widespread support among new york politicians.see,richardson ramirez,hayden i,at describing ancient origin of disenfranchising those convicted of crimes dating back to ancient athens and the roman republic,and noting that t oday every state except maine and vermont disenfranchises felons law,historical and statutory notes supra background,part ii in some cases,notwithstanding discriminatory impact,the legitimate noninvidious purposes of a law can not be missed.feeney,u.at explaining that the distinction made by the massachusetts veterans preference law is,as it seems to be,quite simply between veterans and nonveterans,not between men and women see also heckler,cir affirming dismissal of equal protection challenge to secretary of health and human services failure to provide forms in spanish because plaintiffs failed to suggest any evidence of discriminatory intent and legitimate noninvidious purpose was obvious,cert.denied.absent any adequately supported factual allegations as to discriminatory intent behind the enactment of the constitutional provision,we are compelled to find that the new york constitution requirement that the legislature pass felon disenfranchisement laws is based on the obvious,noninvidious purpose of disenfranchising felons,not blacks or latinos.
finally,there is another independent basis for our holding that plaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim of intentional discrimination.the constitutional provision,and all earlier constitutional provisions,simply authorize the new york legislature to enact felon disenfranchisement laws.that is,the constitutional provision does not operate to deny plaintiffs the right to vote,rather the statutory enactment pursuant to the constitutional provision does.therefore,plaintiffs either must allege that the statutory enactments were motivated at least in part by discriminatory they have completely failed to do in their amended or they must state a plausible claim that new york election law and all of its prior amendments were in fact passed because of the constitutional provision mandate.it is possible that the legislature has acted since to enact felon disenfranchisement laws because it was required to under the constitutional provision.but given the more likely explanations discussed above and the laws obvious,noninvidious distinction between felons and,it is not plausible,at least as plaintiffs allegations presently read,that the new york legislature would have rejected a felon disenfranchisement statute if the statute had not been constitutionally required.
accordingly,plaintiffs amended complaint fails to state a plausible claim that new york felon disenfranchisement laws were enacted with discriminatory intent.although they have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim that the,and constitutional provisions were motivated at least in part by discriminatory intent,they fail to allege any facts to support a claim that the constitutional provision or any of the new york legislature statutory enactments were passed because of racial animus.however,in light of federal rule of civil procedure suggestion that a court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a,and our preference to allow a district court to evaluate such a motion by plaintiffs in the first instance,see iqbal ashcroft,cir per curiam,we will remand to the district court to allow plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their deficient complaint as to this claim.

in addition to the claim of intentional race discrimination,plaintiffs also argue that violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it distinguishes among felons,denying the right to vote only to those felons sentenced to incarceration or serving parole,and not to those sentenced to probation.the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment commands that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend xiv.this language has been interpreted to mean that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.but so too,the constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.plyler doe,internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted.furthermore,we must grant substantial latitude to the legislatures to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived,that accommodate competing concerns both public and private,and that account for limitations on the practical ability of the state to remedy every ill.id.thus,the supreme court has held the legislature utilizes a classification that is inherently invidious because it disadvantages a suspect class,or because it infringes upon the exercise of a fundamental exercise only a limited review power over the acts of legislatures.see id.at see also schweiker wilson.under this limited review power,we will uphold forms of state action under the equal protection clause so long as the classification at issue bears some rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.plyler,at.on the other hand,where a suspect class or a fundamental right is at issue in the classification,we apply a more searching form of scrutiny.see kadrmas dickinson pub,see also zahra town of southold,cir.
thus,the threshold question for any analysis under the equal protection clause is whether the highly deferential rational basis review applies,or instead whether the legislation involves a suspect class or a fundamental right resulting in the application of a stricter form of scrutiny.baker cuomo,cir,vacated in part,on other grounds,sub nom.baker pataki,en banc per curiam.plaintiffs are correct in claiming that the supreme court has stated that voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure,burdick takushi,internal quotation marks omitted,and that the right to vote is the fundamental political right,harper.state bd.of elections,internal quotation marks omitted.we have clearly stated,however,that a lthough the right to vote is generally considered fundamental,in the absence of any allegation that a challenged classification was intended to discriminate on the basis of race or other suspect criteria,statutes that deny felons the right to vote are not subject to strict judicial scrutiny.baker cuomo,at citing supreme court and other court of appeals cases in support of proposition.here,although plaintiffs argue that new york felon disenfranchisement laws,in their constitutional origin,were intended to discriminate against blacks,they do not claim that the statutory amendments in the,which made the application of the felon disenfranchisement laws,were enacted with the intent to discriminate.thus,in accord with our precedent,it is clear that we should review the legislation utilizing rational basis review,not strict scrutiny 
when legislation is reviewed for a rational basis,courts are quite reluctant to overturn governmental action on the ground that it denies equal protection of the laws.gregory ashcroft,internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has stated that courts should not overturn such a law unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature actions were irrational.vance bradley.furthermore,the supreme court has emphasized that under rational basis review,legislatures are allowed to act incrementally the equal protection clause does not compel l egislatures to prohibit all like evils,or none.a legislature may hit at an abuse which it has found,even though it has failed to strike at another.united states carolene prods,see also gregory,at williamson lee optical of.
here,two amendments to the felon disenfranchisement statute are at issue.first,the bill amended the election law by providing a person convicted of a felony with the right to vote upon the expiration of his maximum sentence or when he is discharged from parole.when passing this amendment,the legislature made the state interest clear.explaining that the primary purpose of the penal system was the rehabilitation of the offender,the state justifications for the amendment were as follows once the offender has served his sentence or been discharged from parole,he is presumed to be capable of rejoining society it is inconsistent with the general philosophy of corrections to continue punishment,in the form of not being able to vote,after a person has accounted for his actions and providing an offender with the right to vote would help effectuate his transfer back into society in a favorable way.under our highly deferential standard,the amendment clearly bears a rational relationship to the government stated legitimate interest.
second,the amendment to the bill further expanded the right
