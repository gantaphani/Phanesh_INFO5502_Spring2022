the united states district court for the western district of new york curtin,awarded summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.the district court ruled that plaintiffs evidence which consisted principally of their affidavits in opposition to defendants motions for summary judgment was conclusory and that it did not amount to a meaningful change in the terms and conditions of employment.plaintiffs appeal.

baines has been employed by the new york state office of children and family services ocfs since.ocfs is dedicated to improving the integration of services for new york children,youth,families and vulnerable populations to promoting their development and to protecting them from violence,neglect,abuse and abandonment.about the new york state office of children and family services ocfs.these objectives are achieved by provid ing a system of family support,juvenile justice,child care and child welfare services that promote the safety and of children and adults.id.
baines worked his way up at ocfs over years,from counselor trainee to director of two secure residential facilities in buffalo,new york the community residential home and the evening reporting center erc.among those he supervised are mark pasternak the victim of baines prior campaign of racial discrimination and the three plaintiffs,all of whom worked at the buffalo facilities as youth division aides yda.their responsibilities included supervising and counseling the residents,helping to integrate them back into society.baines,smith,and hicks are melendez now deceased was hispanic pasternak is white.
in,soon after becoming director,baines started a campaign of racial discrimination against pasternak.according to complaints filed by pasternak and corroborated by plaintiffs,baines referred to pasternak in conversations,voicemails,and official memoranda as white boy,that white motherf,that white boy,white cracker motherf,pollok,and pasterat.baines encouraged plaintiffs to discredit pasternak to other ocfs supervisors and to band together against the white boy.baines told plaintiffs that pasternak complaints against him could result in the closing of facilities and loss of their jobs.
in early,pasternak filed a formal misconduct complaint against baines,and ocfs launched an official investigation.in november,plaintiffs participated in the investigation by making written and oral statements about baines treatment of pasternak.they did so despite their expressed fear that baines would retaliate.
plaintiffs fears were not unfounded.after baines learned that other cooperating with the investigation,he told staff members that pasternak was a rat and that he would find out who else ratted on him and take care of those people.in june,the ocfs investigators found baines guilty of misconduct.he was fined and received a formal letter of reprimand,but he remains as director,and supervisor of pasternak and plaintiffs.
pasternak afterward brought a worker compensation claim based on the stress and anxiety he suffered as a result of baines conduct.plaintiffs testified against baines at the hearing,and baines knew it.in august,pasternak prevailed before the new york workers compensation board 
following plaintiffs participation in the ocfs investigation and the workers compensation hearing,baines allegedly engaged in multifarious acts of retaliation to punish plaintiffs for their cooperation in those proceedings.on may,plaintiffs filed this lawsuit alleging unlawful retaliation under,and the new york state human rights law.plaintiffs assert seven categories of such retaliatory conduct,which are analyzed below.
at the close of discovery,the district court granted baines motion for summary judgment on all claims.hicks baines,wl july.the court reasoned that plaintiffs affidavits contain only conclusory allegations that did not result in any meaningful change in the terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment.id.at.in so holding,however,the district court failed to apply the,but unquestionably controlling,supreme court decision in burlington northern santa fe railway white,which broadened the scope of title vii protection 
this appeal followed.we now vacate and remand in part and affirm in part.
all of plaintiffs retaliation claims are analyzed pursuant to title vii principles.see patterson county of oneida,cir most of the core substantive standards that apply to claims of discriminatory conduct in violation of title vii are also applicable to claims of discrimination in employment in violation of or the equal protection clause.reed lawrence,cir we consider plaintiff state law claims in tandem with her title vii claims because new york courts rely on federal law when determining claims under the new york state human rights law.title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.title vii also includes an provision which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee or applicant because that individual opposed any practice made unlawful by title vii or made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in a title vii investigation or proceeding.a.this provision is intended to further the goals of the provision by preventing an employer from interfering through retaliation with an employee efforts to secure or advance enforcement of title vii basic guarantees.white,at.
retaliation claims under title vii are evaluated under a analysis.jute hamilton sundstrand,cir see also mcdonnell douglas green.first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing participation in a protected activity that the defendant knew of the protected activity an adverse employment action and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.jute,at quoting mcmenemy city of rochester,cir.the plaintiff burden in this regard is de minimis,and the court role in evaluating a summary judgment request is to determine only whether proffered admissible evidence would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a retaliatory motive.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
if the plaintiff sustains this initial burden,a presumption of retaliation arises.id.the defendant must then articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.id.if so,the presumption of retaliation dissipates and the employee must show that retaliation was a substantial reason for the adverse employment action.id.a plaintiff can sustain this burden by proving that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment actions even if it was not the sole cause if the employer was motivated by retaliatory animus,title vii is violated even if there were objectively valid grounds for the adverse employment action.sumner postal,cir.
principally though not solely at issue in this appeal is the meaning of adverse employment action in the context of the plaintiff prima facie case of retaliation.white held that title vii provision applies broadly to employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant.at.actions are materially adverse if they are harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.
several principles follow.first,it is now clear that title vii and provisions are not coterminous protection is broader and extends beyond or retaliatory acts and harm.id.at.prior decisions of this circuit that limit unlawful retaliation to actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment,williams donnelley,cir galabya city bd.of,f d,cir,no longer represent the state of the law.accord kessler westchester county dep t of social,cir noting that white announced a different standard.
second,by requiring a showing of material adversity,white preserves the principle that title vii does not set forth a general civility code for the american workplace.white,at quoting oncale sundowner offshore.p etty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience do not constitute actionable retaliation.id.thus,t he antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation,but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.id.at.
third,by considering the perspective of a reasonable employee,white bespeaks an objective standard.id.at.the standard may be objective,but c ontext matters.id.at.the real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.id.at quoting oncale,at.therefore,an act that would be immaterial in some situations is material in others.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.for example,a schedule change in an employee work schedule may make little difference to many workers,but may matter enormously to a young mother with children.id.and of course context can diminish as well as enlarge material effect.
fourth,in determining whether conduct amounts to an adverse employment action,the alleged acts of retaliation need to be considered both separately and in the aggregate,as even minor acts of retaliation can be sufficiently substantial in gross as to be actionable.see zelnik fashion inst.of,cir t his ridicule was considered a part of a larger campaign of harassment which though trivial in detail may have been substantial in gross,and therefore was actionable.internal quotation marks omitted.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the district court decision.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.miller wolpoff abramson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.c.a party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment m ere conclusory allegations or denials can not by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where none would otherwise exist.fletcher atex,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
as set forth above,our analysis begins with plaintiffs de minimis burden to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation participation in a protected activity that baines knew of their participation in that protected activity that they suffered an adverse employment action and that there exists a causal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.jute,at.
for purposes of summary judgment only,baines does not contest that plaintiffs satisfy the first element,and plaintiffs affidavits are sufficient to establish the second,see hicks aff.smith aff.the third element is the main subject of this appeal.
as to the third element of plaintiffs prima facie case,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims after concluding that their affidavits contain only conclusory allegations of job sabotage,schedule changes,misplacing of documents,idle threats,and unwarranted counseling memoranda,none of which resulted in any meaningful change in the terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment.hicks baines,wl at.this reasoning suggests two independent justifications for dismissal a the insufficiency of conclusory statements in opposing a motion for summary judgment,and b title vii principles of.plaintiffs also raise on appeal two allegations of retaliation outlined in their affidavits filed in opposition to baines motion for summary judgment but not directly addressed by the district court baines called hicks hick in memos and in the erc log book and baines intentionally failed to pay the food and utility bills,thereby forcing plaintiffs to pay out of their own pockets,or deal with hungry residents,and dunning calls and letters 
as to many of these claims,we affirm on the ground that plaintiffs evidence is too conclusory to withstand summary judgment.but as to one claim of workplace sabotage and the several punitive scheduling claims,plaintiffs evidence is sufficient both to survive summary judgment and to satisfy the third element of their prima facie burden of showing an adverse employment action under white.accordingly,as to these claims we vacate and remand.
the following claims were properly dismissed as too conclusory to survive summary judgment 
workplace sabotage.in their affidavits opposing summary judgment,plaintiffs make the following claims of workplace sabotage 
defendant baines,on numerous occasions,entered the after hicks and his fellow plaintiffs had secured the facility for the night to purposefully disturb the facility and compromise the security of the site in an effort to not only cause a poor reflection on hicks and his fellow plaintiffs job performances in securing the building,but also to further torment,harass and retaliate against them.hicks aff.see also smith aff.same,but substitute smith for hicks in the alterations.
on or about may,hicks discovered that the facility security had been compromised during the night by someone having the security codes and keys to the building upon information and belief,defendant baines was in fact entering the facility during hours.hicks aff.see also smith aff.same.
o n or about may,hicks discovered dirty dishes in the sink and a knife missing from the locked knife drawer.upon information and belief,defendant baines removed the knife from the drawer to torment,retaliate and add stress to hicks work shifts as the youths in his charge could and at times did become violent.hicks aff.see also smith aff.
as to the general claim of sabotage plaintiffs affidavits on this point lack specifics and are conclusory a party can not create a triable issue of fact merely by stating in an affidavit the very proposition they are trying to prove.see fletcher,at c onclusory allegations can not by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where none would otherwise exist.internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the compromised security system claim plaintiffs do not assert that it was baines who had compromised the facility security instead,they suggest only that someone having the security codes and keys to the building was responsible.plaintiffs then fail to offer evidence as to which employees had the codes and keys,leaving purely to speculation whether baines was responsible.fletcher,at.
