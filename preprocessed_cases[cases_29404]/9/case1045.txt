michele okin appeals from a decision and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge,entered october,granting defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court dismissed,as to all moving defendants,okin claims that her fourteenth amendment rights to due process and equal protection had been violated.
we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to defendants town of cornwall rusty,and edward manion.as to thomas douglas iv,michael lug,paul weber,and charles williams,we affirm the grant of summary judgment on okin equal protection claims.but,with regard to her due process claims,we hold that the conduct of douglas,lug,weber,and williams raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they implicitly but affirmatively sanctioned abuse of okin by roy sears,and that those defendants,if found liable,would not be entitled to qualified immunity.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment on the due process claims.moreover,we reverse the district court dismissal of okin municipal liability claims against the village of,as okin raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the village failure to train its police officers adequately,or the policies and customs that it has sanctioned,caused the individual defendants to violate okin due process rights.
background 
michele okin began a relationship with roy charles sears in okin and sears moved in together,living in a house owned by sears at taft place,in the village of,new york.they are the parents of twin children,born in may.in the same year,according to okin,sears began to abuse her physically.okin alleges that sears was well known to local police officers with whom he socialized at a tavern of which he was part owner,the leprechaun inn,and she claims that sears often bragged that he could get away with what he wanted in cornwall.
according to okin,sears injured both her hands in october,fracturing bones in her left hand and right index finger.she did not report this incident to the police and,according to her affidavit in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment,she begged her primary care physician not to tell anyone or record this on her records because she was in fear of her life and felt sears was beyond the law.
thereafter,however,okin repeatedly called for police assistance.nevertheless,neither the village of police department nor the town of cornwall police department arrested sears or interviewed him at any length regarding okin allegations of abuse.only one domestic incident report was filed.
the first reported violence occurred on december.okin called following an incident in which,according to okin,sears grabbed her neck and started to choke her.okin testified at a deposition that she placed three calls to the dispatcher before village of police arrived at taft place.okin said to defendant thomas douglas iv,a village of police officer,can you please tell roy to stop beating me.that is all i want.in her bedroom,okin showed douglas bruises on her legs,which,according to douglas incident report,looked very old and in the process of healing.at her deposition,okin could not recall exactly when she sustained the leg injuries,but testified that sears was at that time hitting her every single day.
according to douglas incident report,okin said that sears had told her that he had had a conversation with defendant charles williams,the village of police chief,in which sears told williams that he could not help it sometimes when he smacks michele okin around and that okin was a terrible mother and should have an order of protection against her own kids.according to douglas,okin said that she then tried to call the police,but that sears stopped her by grabbing her neck.douglas added that he did not observe any redness nor markings around her neck.he also added that okin could keep still and her mental status was very awkward,and that she told him she was a manic depressant sic and also has panic attacks,and sees a psychiatrist.according to douglas,okin repeatedly said she did not want to press charges and left the bedroom despite his request that she stay in the bedroom while he spoke separately with sears.
defendant edward manion,a town of cornwall police officer,arrived in a backup capacity.okin also showed him the bruises on her legs.according to manion,sears denied inflicting the bruises.at his deposition,manion testified that he too believed they were old bruises,and that this was the reason he did not arrest sears,suggesting that he believed that immediate arrest was mandatory only if the injury was very recent.he and douglas did not discuss the bruises or the possibility of arresting sears.
holding one of the infants,okin said i better stop the kid from crying or i am going to get beat.according to douglas,he and manion told okin that if she is being assaulted she needs to call the police then,not days or weeks later.okin,however,recalls that she retorted that sears had that very day thrown a baby bottle at her and one of their children and had tried to choke her.
douglas further reported that,when okin heard sears getting ready to leave the house with the children,she said,roy is going to take the kids and never come home and that she wanted to press charges.according to douglas,manion told okin what she needed to do in order to press charges,but in the middle of describing the procedure to michele,she just walked away and joined sears outside,before coming back inside and saying she did not want to press charges.okin was given a domestic incident report,and advised about a telephone help number to call for counseling.meanwhile,sears announced that okin was on medication that made her sleep and that she therefore could not take care of the children.douglas concluded that no offense had been committed.
douglas prepared a domestic incident report,which okin signed.the domestic incident report indicates by that the c ircumstances of t his c ase included f orcible r estraint,g rabbing and t hrowing i tems.the report states,among other things,that okin alleged that she had been beaten by sears and was afraid that her children would be too,that okin was on medication,and that she refused to sign charges.okin claims that,at the time she signed the report,it did not indicate that she did not want to press charges.douglas wrote b ruises next to the box for i njuries on the domestic incident report,but he did not interview sears about the bruises.indeed,okin,disturbingly,alleges that,to the extent that the officers talked with sears,it was about football.moreover,according to okin,the officers were very derogatory toward her when she said she wanted to press charges,and this was why she walked away from them sears was not arrested.
according to okin,on january,she called the police to report that sears was beating her.defendant paul weber,a village of police department sergeant,responded to taft place,but made no written report and according to okin,laughed at her for making the complaint.around this time,sears moved out of taft place and took up residence at a days inn motel,in nearby new windsor.
on february,okin again called the police for assistance.nonparty police officer john pena responded,and found an angry sears at taft place.sears told pena that okin had removed from his personal checking account without his consent.sears said he had come to the house to retrieve his check books.police chief williams and nonparty police officer jill nye arrived,and williams asked sears to follow him to headquarters in order to provide further information.sears spent about an hour in police chief williams office,as the police chief tried to assess t he validity and substance of sears complaint.
meanwhile,at taft place,according to police officer nye report,okin appeared to be distraught and confused about the reason the police officers were there.several attempts were made to convey the facts.okin repeatedly brought up prior incidents related to domestic violence.during their conversation,okin admitted taking the,but insisted sears had given her permission to remove the money for their children.nye reported that okin made several attempts to show signs of abuse,but that she,nye,did not observe any markings on her person.nye also noted that police chief williams advised sears to stay away from taft place.
on march,sergeant weber responded to taft place after a call from okin reporting a stabbing.okin told the dispatcher that sears had pushed her around and that she was afraid that he would hurt her when he returned to the house.according to weber incident report,okin did not answer the door until he got the dispatcher to call okin back,and did not seem upset when she appeared at the door.okin denies this.
weber incident report appears internally inconsistent on its face.the report states both that weber learned that no assault had occurred and no stabbing had occurred and that okin told him that sears had assaulted her the previous night at the days inn in new windsor.at his deposition,weber explained the inconsistency by saying that okin was complaining that she had been stabbed in her feet but,when he asked to see the wounds,she took her shoes off and there were no visible injuries.okin march,affidavit in opposition to defendants motions for summary judgment states that she showed weber stab wounds on her feet,but her reply to village defendants local rule statement,also dated march,denies that she showed weber her feet or that she claimed to be stabbed that evening in conversation with him.
weber,after noting that he had told okin that the new windsor matter was outside his jurisdiction,added the following comments about okin to his incident report 
as she was ranting about the police refusing to help her even though she is an attorney and should understand jurisdiction more than anybody,she began complaining about officer weber and that he blatantly refused to entertain her complaint on one of the previous occassions sic that she called and the police responded to her house.this is the first that i have been to her residence to handle any such complaint.she is obviously confused.
he then added,it should also be noted that the interior of the house appears to be in disorder.it is unknown if she is able to maintain the residence.
at her deposition,okin testified that she had asked weber to arrest sears on this occasion,and that he had refused.although weber filed a general incident report,he did not file a domestic incident report.nor did he notify okin that she could initiate a civilian arrest.
on march,okin called and requested to speak with an officer.nonparty police officer arthur terwilliger called okin back,and okin told terwilliger that sears had threatened to damage taft place and to kill her,and that he was at the days inn in new windsor.terwilliger asked okin if she wanted to sign a complaint,but she refused,saying no,that is going to make the situation worse.terwilliger asked okin for descriptions of sears cars and promised to patrol the taft place area frequently that evening.no domestic incident report was filed.at his deposition,terwilliger testified that he had had no specific training on handling a situation in which a threat victim says that filing a complaint will just make things worse.
on the same day,pam cobey,an employee of okin,reported to the village of police department that someone had left a note in okin office mailbox that read michelle okin sleep with one eye open at night.cobey brought the note to the police.
late that night,march,okin called,reporting a prowler outside taft place.she told the dispatcher about the death threat from sears and about the note,which she identified as being in sears handwriting.again,sergeant weber was dispatched to the house but,on learning which officer had been sent,okin told the dispatcher she did not want weber to respond.
weber writes that he responded anyway and checked the exterior of the residence.no problems.weber adds,
after returning back to police hq,the phone rang.it was okin.the first thing she was advised of was that whatever problem she had with me,she was obviously confusing me with another officer.she apologized.she then went on complaining that the police never do anything when she calls.after a lengthy conversation,she was advised that if she wanted to pursue charges on any complaint that she has that she would have to respond to police hq just like anyone else.she continued to complain about roy sears and i advised her again that if he is so violent towards her,it would obviously be in her best interest to stay away from him.she was also advised that if she felt threatened just knowing that roy is around,she could pursue the matter in family court and try to seek an order of protection.she refused to try and pursue it.
no domestic incident report was completed.
okin called the police again,on april,very distraught,and complained that sears was stalking her,outside taft place.nonparty police officer charles hofmann responded and checked the area around the house,finding no suspicious activity.again,the police did not interview sears.
on may,okin went to see sears at the days inn,where he was residing,and the two quarreled.they then returned together albeit in separate cars to taft place.there,they quarreled again,and,according to okin,sears kicked okin in the leg.at some point,sears turned off the power in the house.a neighbor,barbara corwin,heard the commotion and saw sears and okin burst out of the door from the house into the garage yelling at each other.the shouting match in the garage lasted for several minutes.however,corwin did not see sears strike okin.feeling that the situation was nonetheless,corwin called and defendant michael lug,a village of police officer,was dispatched to taft place.by the time he arrived,sears had left.
lug found okin outside the house.okin told him she had fallen and was in pain.she also said that sears had cut the power and the phone lines.lug discovered that the house master circuit breaker had been switched off,but restored the electricity and found the phones in working order.okin told lug that sears had kicked her leg,punched her,and slapped her,and that she would go to her doctor the next day to find out if her leg was broken.she said that sears had asked her,are you going to the police,bitch lug told okin he was going to complete a report,and he notes that she said,i not going to sign it.but okin insists that she did not say this.lug filed no domestic incident report,did not arrest or interview sears,and did not advise okin that she could initiate a civilian arrest.the incident report gives as the number of victims and as the number of suspects.lug also did not interview corwin,the neighbor.
okin claims that,on may,sears pinched her on the back while the two were at his attorney office,in cornwall,and raised his hand to her in the lawyer presence.she called the police,and nonparty police officer jill nye went to taft place.nye informed okin that she would have to contact the town of cornwall police,since the incident at the lawyer office had occurred in the town of cornwall,not the village.nevertheless,officer nye did look at okin back.she reports that she did not see any marks resembling bruising or injury.nye asked okin if she would like medical attention,and notes that okin declined.
on may,okin called the police regarding an incident that had occurred the previous day.sergeant weber responded to taft place,and okin told him that sears had come to the house,threatened to shoot her,and threatened to report her to child protective services.according to weber,he asked okin if she wanted to pursue the shooting threat and she said no,she was more concerned with the cps child protective services threat.okin strongly denies saying she did not want to pursue the shooting threat or have sears arrested.
weber report states that okin then started going off on tangents about subjects like sears leaving the garage door open and her broken hands.i advised her that those are issues that the police can handle.weber report notes that i t is unknown why okin did call the police when the incident occurred but instead elected to wait until the next day to report it.the incident report gives as the number of victims and as the number of suspects.weber again did not file a domestic incident report.sears was not interviewed about the threat.
on june,okin called the police,saying that she wanted a report taken.when nonparty john pena,a village of police department police officer,arrived at taft place,okin reported that appliances in her,water heater,garage breaking and light bulbs needed replacing,and that sears was responsible.okin also told pena that sears had told her that he had thrown rocks at taft place.finally,she reported that she had found two boxes of her jewelry in sears car.pena filed an incident report 
on november,okin again contacted the police.nonparty police officer arthur terwilliger and another officer responded.okin complained to terwilliger that,two days previously,she had returned home to find the door slightly open and its lock malfunctioning.terwilliger asked her if anything was missing,and she responded that she had not had time to check yet.terwilliger advised okin to call the village police department if she noticed anything missing and also next time to call the police department as soon as an incident happens.
on november,okin called the police and spoke with nonparty christopher park,a village of police department police officer.okin was afraid that sears was going to evict her from taft place.park informed okin that she should pursue the matter in civil court.she said she was going to get an order of protection.a few minutes later,officer park received a call from sears himself,and park told sears as well that eviction was a matter for the civil authorities.on november,a similar conversation played out between park and sears in person.
on november,okin,on her way to get an order of protection against sears,spoke with defendant rusty,the town of cornwall police chief,telling him that the village of police had failed to protect her or follow up on her domestic violence complaints.promised that this would not happen on his watch,and discussed with okin the possibility of her getting an order of protection.okin then successfully brought a petition in orange county family court seeking an order of protection.
on january,okin called the police with a report that a rental car had been stolen from her driveway.sergeant weber responded,finding okin at taft place along with a friend,patrick coviello.weber reports that he tried to get information concerning the missing vehicle,but that okin continued to go off on tangents.weber says he told okin that he was not there in reference to all of the other information and that she should focus on the missing car matter,to which coviello retorted,she is trying to explain it to you weber recalls that coviello then said to okin that they should call the state police as if this officer was capable of handling the complaint.weber adds that in trying to avoid a confrontation,he put his pen away and stated,then call the state police.weber then left the residence and noted that the state police handled the matter.
on january,okin employee rhonda fall thought she saw sears parked in a vehicle across the road from okin office,and then saw him drive off fast.after talking with fall,okin called the police again.police officer terwilliger responded.terwilliger took a statement from fall,and advised okin that the village police department would bring this information before the judge to see if we have enough to pursue the matter.
okin also called the state police,who then spoke with sergeant weber.weber wrote 
it appears that okin is engaging in a sort of forum shopping wherein she calls agency after agency until she finds one that will pursue her complaints usually against mr.sears it is unknown at this time what motive she has for claiming mr.sears as the suspect in every negative event both reported and unreported that occurs in her life.as for this latest complaint,the witness in this case fall does not know roy sears and,after being interviewed by officer terwilliger,she stated only that it appeared to be him from a photo later shown to her by okin.the witnesses sic only other evidence is that there was a fat man sitting in a white suv.that is not enough probable cause to arrest sears.
on march,sears and okin appeared in town of cornwall justice court in regard to an eviction action brought by sears against okin with respect to taft place.according to okin,sears threatened both her and her attorney on this occasion,saying that he was going to get her outside.at his deposition,okin attorney testified that sears threatened him,telling him that he was going to get him.
that evening,okin and her friend patrick coviello called the police to report sears threats.the village of police department told them the matter was not within its jurisdiction.okin and coviello then went to the town of cornwall police department and showed defendant police officer manion the order of protection and told him about sears threats.the town police department refused to arrest sears or,as manion recalled,refused to arrest him that night.manion wrote up an incident report.
the following day,okin called town of cornwall police chief to discuss the courtroom incident.followed up by calling the clerk of the town of cornwall justice court,lynn tucci,who told him that she had not seen any harassment of okin by sears,although sears was disorderly with the town justice in court.reported that he left three messages for coviello but that coviello did not return his calls.a month later,asked the town justice about the incident,and the latter could recall nothing.
okin filed a action,on may,in the southern district of new york,alleging violations of her federal due process and equal protection rights by individual officers of the town of cornwall and village of police departments,and by the police departments themselves.by failing to arrest or even interview sears,okin alleges that defendants endangered her by emboldening sears.okin also alleges that defendants acted in concert with sears,that they failed to respond effectively to her repeated complaints about sears because he had significant personal relationships with ranking members of the village and town police departments and made financial contributions to or at the behest of the town police department,and that defendants dismissive and inappropriate behavior which was witnessed by sears affirmatively increased the danger she faced.the defendants filed a summary judgment motion,the individual officers moving for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.
the district court first considered okin claim based on the danger theory that defendants violated her rights under the due process clause.the district court summarized the danger theory as requiring that a plaintiff show some contact between the defendant police officers and the private wrongdoer through which explicit or implicit sanction of violence was communicated.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.the district court remarked 
t he court can not help but observe that,even if i were to view the officers version of events as true which i can not,for purposes of this motion,their conduct in the face of okin complaints ranges from insensitive to incomprehensible,and evidences either a lack of training or a lack of comprehension about the realities of domestic violence.
viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the evidence shows that she complained repeatedly about domestic violence over a period,and that moving defendants repeatedly treated her with indifference or disdain,failed to advise her of her rights as a domestic violence victim or even to characterize the incidents as domestic violence.
okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.
the district court nonetheless granted summary judgment to defendants on okin due process claims.the district court ruled that a reasonable jury could not find an explicit facilitation violation on the most view of the facts of this case.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.as to implicitly sanctioned violence,the district court found that the individual defendants here would be entitled to qualified immunity,even if they implicitly facilitated sears abuse by not arresting him or closing out okin numerous complaints almost as soon as they were opened.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.the district court also granted summary judgment to defendants as to okin claims for violations of the equal protection clause and for municipal liability.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.okin timely appealed.
standard of review 
a district court grant of a summary judgment motion is subject to de novo review.all evidence submitted on the motion is to be construed in the manner most favorable to the nonmoving party.horvath,at citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
discussion 
okin due process claims 
okin alleges that defendants acted in concert with defendant sears and permitted him to impose his reign of terror and abuse upon her,in violation of her right to due process,by failing to acknowledge and to investigate her complaints against sears even where he had admitted to police chief williams that he smacked okin around and could not stop himself from behaving in this manner,failing to report her complaints accurately,failing to provide her reasonable police protections,and otherwise failing to discharge their duties as law enforcement agents.more specifically,okin asserts that,by expressing contempt toward her and by condoning sears conduct,in particular by such actions as discussing sports with him following okin december,emergency call,defendants gave official sanction to sears abuse and affirmatively contributed to her vulnerability.
a.the danger doctrine 
although a s a general matter a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause,deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d,state actors may be liable under section if they affirmatively created or enhanced the danger of private violence.dwares city of new york,cir,overruled on other grounds by leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d.t hough an allegation simply that police officers had failed to act upon reports of past violence would not implicate the victim rights under the due process clause,an allegation that the officers in some way had assisted in creating or increasing the danger to the victim would indeed implicate those rights.dwares,at.
in dwares,we vacated a district court federal rule of civil procedure b dismissal of the section claims of a demonstrator who alleged he had been beaten by skinheads.the plaintiff alleged that defendant police officers had assured the skinheads that unless they got completely out of control the police would neither interfere with their assaults nor arrest them,thus indicating that they could assault the demonstrators.id.at.as judge kearse put it,i t requires no stretch to infer that such prior assurances would have increased the likelihood that the skinheads would assault demonstrators.id.at.the plaintiff also alleged that the officers had in effect aided and abetted the deprivation of his civil rights by allowing him to be subjected to the prolonged assault in their presence without interfering with the attack.id.based on the allegations that police officers communicated to private actors that they had the freedom to harm others without risk of a law enforcement response,we found that s uch a prearranged official sanction of privately inflicted injury would surely have violated the victim rights under the due process clause.id.
in later cases,we read dwares to establish that the due process clause may be violated when police officers affirmative opposed to passive failures to or increases the risk of private violence,and thereby enhances the danger to the victim.in hemphill schott,cir,for example,we found a material issue of fact as to whether police officers encouraged a private actor violence against the plaintiff,where the officers,who were called to the scene of a drugstore robbery,allowed the store manager to join them in pursuit of the plaintiff after returning the manager gun,which the manager then used to shoot the plaintiff.id.at.as we summarized our holding in dwares,where the state actors actually contributed to the vulnerability of the plaintiff,or where the state actors aided and abetted a private party in the deprivation of a plaintiff civil rights,a violation of the due process clause does occur.id.at.
since dwares,we found that repeated,sustained inaction by government officials,in the face of potential acts of violence,might constitute prior assurances,dwares,at,rising to the level of an affirmative condoning of private violence,even if there is no explicit approval or encouragement.pena deprisco,cir.in a b held that 
when,as the plaintiffs allege,state officials communicate to a private person that he or she will not be arrested,punished,or otherwise interfered with while engaging in misconduct that is likely to endanger the life,liberty or property of others,those officials can be held liable under section for injury caused by the misconduct under dwares.this is so even though none of the defendants is alleged to have communicated the approval explicitly.
pena,at.we held that the due process clause could be violated by police officers implicit message that they condoned an officer act of,where his drunken driving resulted in multiple deaths.id.at t o the extent that fellow police officers and some supervisors participated in or condoned the police officer behavior,and even invited the officer to drive after drinking heavily,it could be inferred by a reasonable juror that those defendants,by their actions,implicitly but affirmatively condoned the officer behavior and indicated to the officer that he would not be disciplined for his conduct.
here,we agree with the district court that okin has failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants affirmatively enhanced the risk of violence by making explicit assurances to sears that he could act with impunity.as the district court noted,even the most irresponsible and insulting behavior alleged by okin,such as the officers discussing sports with sears on december,does not amount to explicit assurances to an aggressor that he will not be impeded or arrested.yet,as is clear from dwares,hemphill,and pena,explicit approval of violence is but a subset of the affirmative conduct by state actors that can enhance the danger to a victim.the affirmative conduct of a government official may give rise to an actionable due process violation if it communicates,explicitly or implicitly,official sanction of private violence.pena,at hemphill,at dwares,at.
the district court did not consider whether a reasonable trier of fact could find that defendants behavior enhanced the danger to okin by implicitly but affirmatively encouraging or condoning sears domestic violence.as will be discussed further below,the pena court held that a state actor implicit encouragement of drunk driving,while actionable misconduct under the danger theory,was not a clearly established violation of the due process clause at the time of the defendants actions,so that under principles of qualified immunity,they could not be held individually liable.pena,at.the district court,following pena,found that the individual defendants like the individual defendants in be entitled to qualified immunity,even if they implicitly facilitated sears abuse by not arresting him or closing out okin numerous complaints almost as soon as they were opened.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.
although the district court did not address the question of whether defendants violated the due process clause by implicit encouragement of sears domestic violence,the record is sufficient for us to rule on the issue viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to okin,we find a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants implicitly but affirmatively encouraged sears domestic violence.a reasonable factfinder,as okin argues,could infer that defendants actions,such as discussing football with sears during their response to okin complaint that he had beaten and tried to choke her,plainly transmitted the message that what he did was permissible and would not cause him problems with authorities.moreover,the evidence suggests that the defendants repeatedly communicated to sears that his violence would go unpunished,as when sears told williams that he could not help it sometimes when he smacks michele okin around and williams made no arrest,and also,on the numerous occasions that defendants responded to okin complaints without filing a domestic incident report,interviewing sears,or making an arrest.a reasonable view of the evidence supports the inference that defendants actions rise to the level of affirmative conduct that created or increased the risk of violence to the victim.pena,at dwares,at.
the record demonstrates an escalating series of incidents that followed the officers response to okin first complaint of domestic violence,where the officers and sears had discussed sports,and the officers openly expressed camaraderie with sears and contempt for okin.the officers conduct,both in response to that first complaint and thereafter,could be viewed as ratcheting up the threat of danger to okin.see hemphill,at finding that a due process violation may occur if the defendants actually contributed to the vulnerability of the plaintiff see also koulta merciez,cir explaining that the increased risk of violence turns on whether the victim was safer before the state action than he was after it quotation marks omitted munger city of glasgow police dep,cir stating that officers affirmative conduct endangers a victim if it left the person in a situation that was more dangerous than the one in which they found him.okin would be more vulnerable once sears was aware of the officers dismissive and indifferent attitude toward okin complaints,as such awareness nullifies the deterrent capacity of police response.the implied message of the officers conduct may have galvanized sears to persist in violent encounters with okin.a reasonable factfinder undoubtedly could conclude that defendants,by their affirmative conduct,enhanced the danger to okin because they conveyed to sears that he could continue to engage in domestic violence with impunity,and that defendants thus violated okin due process rights.
state action that shock s the contemporary conscience 
to establish a violation of substantive due process rights,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state action was so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.county of sacramento lewis,d see also matican city of new york,cir.lewis declared that intentionally inflicted injuries are the most likely to rise to the level,at,that negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process,id.at,and that recklessly inflicted harms are closer calls.id.in discussing the latter,the court in lewis noted that d eliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another.id.at.the court specifically distinguished the circumstances of a chase that tends to show the absence of conduct from situations,as in the care of prison inmates,when the opportunity for deliberation is typically available.id.at.see also matican,at pena,at.
in pena,we found 
that the alleged behavior of the defendants over an extended period of time and in the face of action that presented obvious risk of severe consequences and extreme danger,falls within the realm of behavior that can properly be characterized as conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense i f the plaintiffs allegations are accurate,it was not only feasible,it was obligatory,for the defendants to avoid tacitly encouraging drunk driving.
at quotation marks and citations omitted third ellipses in original.in matican,on the other hand,we determined that the officers use of force against a drug dealer during a sting operation,which may have revealed the identity of an informant who was later assaulted by the drug dealer,did not shock the conscience because the officers were faced with the competing obligations of protecting their safety and that of the informant.at.matican thus found that the officers judgment was entitled to deference.see also lewis,at.
we find the record in this case to support the conclusion that okin raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants affirmative creation or enhancement of the risk of violence to okin shocks the conscience.the serious and unique risks and concerns of a domestic violence situation are well known and well documented the officers awareness of the serious consequences of domestic violence is further supported by their training and their knowledge of new york law on domestic violence.to the extent that the police officers were not aware of the seriousness of domestic violence,this reflects a deficiency in the officers training,an issue we discuss infra.given that domestic violence is a known danger that the officers were prepared to address upon the expected occurrence of incidents,the officers who responded to okin complaints had ample time for reflection and for deciding what course of action to take in response to domestic violence.lombardi whitman,cir.this is a case where deliberate indifference is the requisite state of mind for showing that defendants conduct shocks the conscience.see lewis,at.
it requires no inferential leap,in light of what the officers must have known,for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the officers actions demonstrate a willful disregard of the obvious risks of a domestic violence situation,the serious implications of okin complaints over a period,and the likelihood that their misconduct would enhance the danger to okin.see pena,at indicating that proof of deliberate indifference requires showing that the defendant deliberately assumed or acquiesced in the risk of unconstitutional conduct quotation marks omitted see also farmer brennan,d explaining,in the eighth amendment context,that a government official acts with deliberate indifference when he or she knows of and disregards an excessive risk.for the reasons already discussed,the officers conduct is not necessarily attributable to a failure to appreciate the gravity of the situation,and thus can not definitively be characterized as mere negligence.neither can the officers conduct in this case be explained away by the pull of competing obligations,lewis,at,as there is no indication that equally important governmental responsibilities,id.at.quotation marks omitted,could justify an investigation that instead of mitigating the violence,actually may have contributed to increasing the risk.a reasonable factfinder,therefore,could find that the officers affirmative creation or enhancement of the danger to okin was the product of deliberate indifference.
qualified immunity 
having determined that okin raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants violated her rights under the due process clause,we now turn to whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.government actors are entitled to qualified immunity insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the principle of qualified immunity ensures that before they are subjected to suit,officers are on notice their conduct is unlawful.saucier,at.if the law did not put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful,summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate.id.at.
a police officer who has an objectively reasonable belief that his actions are lawful is entitled to qualified immunity.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.
the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.
anderson creighton,d citation omitted see also hope pelzer,d t he salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the incidents in question gave respondents fair warning that their alleged treatment of the victim was unconstitutional.the objective reasonableness test is met,and police officers will enjoy qualified immunity,if the question whether the officers would be violating rights is one on which officers of reasonable competence could disagree.malley briggs,d.if,on the other hand,no officer of reasonable competence would conclude that the conduct in question is lawful,there is no immunity see lennon miller,cir.
we look to supreme court and second circuit precedent existing at the time of the alleged violation to determine whether the conduct violated a clearly established right.moore vega,cir.and,while it is clear that o fficials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision,see davis scherer,d,we may examine statutory or administrative provisions in conjunction with prevailing circuit or supreme court law to determine whether an individual had fair warning that his or her behavior would violate the victim constitutional rights,see hope,at.finding that in light of binding circuit precedent,applicable state regulations,a department of justice report informing the state department of corrections of the constitutional infirmity of handcuffing an inmate to a hitching post,and the obvious cruelty inherent in the practice,respondents had fair and clear warning that use of the hitching post in that case violated the victim constitutional rights.
the issue in this case is whether defendants were on notice that their affirmative interactions with an individual accused of domestic violence,their failure to arrest the accused individual,and their disregard of established procedures for responding to domestic violence incidents,which were reasonably likely to encourage the accused individual to believe that he would not be arrested,punished,or otherwise interfered with while engaging in domestic violence,would contribute to the vulnerability of the complainant by emboldening her abuser,thereby giving rise to a substantive due process violation.dwares gave notice of the rule that a police officer can violate a person due process rights by affirmatively creating or increasing the risk of private violence against that person.at.viewing the evidence in favor of okin,defendants engaged in a pattern of behavior that unmistakably communicated to sears that should he intend to commit acts of violence against okin,they would do nothing to stop him.this behavior is similar to that which gave rise to actionable due process claims in dwares,the only difference being that the officers in dwares explicitly told the skinheads that their violence would not be stopped,whereas the officers here implicitly communicated to sears that domestic violence against okin would go unpunished.we do not see this difference to undermine the critical fact,again viewing the evidence favorably to okin,that the officers were fully aware that private actors intended to commit intentional violence.sears told williams that he could not help it sometimes when he smacks michele okin around,and the officers gave official sanction to that violence.
in hemphill,the officers handed a gun to a store manager who had just been robbed and invited the manager to accompany them in pursuit of the suspect,who was then shot by the store manager during the pursuit.at.the officers never told the store manager to shoot the suspect,but in handing over the gun,they implicitly communicated that the manager subsequent use of the gun would be officially sanctioned.id.at.this was the actionable substantive due process violation in hemphill.okin similarly alleges that the officers implicitly but affirmatively communicated to sears that he could persist in intentional violence against her without threat of punishment.the officers did not give sears a weapon,but that is of no moment.their behavior,as in hemphill,created the conditions for sears to visit intentional violence upon okin,unimpeded.
we therefore find that the danger theory,at the time of defendants actions here,clearly established that police officers are prohibited from affirmatively contributing to the vulnerability of a known victim by engaging in conduct,whether explicit or implicit,that encourages intentional violence against the victim,and as that is the substantive due process violation alleged here,qualified immunity does not apply.together,dwares and hemphill stand for the proposition that police officers may not engage in conduct that encourages or condones a private actor infliction of intentional violence.dwares,hemphill,and okin case may show that affirmative police conduct runs along of spectrum of explicit and implicit actions,but the critical fact cases all involve affirmative police conduct that encourages,condones,or facilitates the infliction of intentional violence.see hope,at.o fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.the prohibition on official sanction of intentional violence applies equally in each case,and provided the officers here with notice that their conduct would be unlawful.
at first glance,this case also appears similar to pena,where as noted above,we found that the application of dwares in the context of that case was not clearly established at the time of defendants actions,so that under principles of qualified immunity the defendants could not be held individually liable.pena,at.pena read dwares to provide that officials may be liable under section for approving the misconduct of private actors even though none of the defendants is alleged to have communicated the approval explicitly.pena,at.the issue in pena was whether it would have been clear to reasonable officers,after dwares,but before pena itself was decided,that they would violate a victim constitutional rights by participating in,or generally condoning,an officer reckless drunk driving,with the result that the officer drunk driving caused fatalities.in finding that the principle of qualified immunity precluded liability,the court wrote 
although it is a close question,we think that the substantive due process violation that the plaintiffs allege here was not clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity.dwares did not address,let alone decide,whether repeated inaction on the part of government officials over a long period of time without an explicit statement of approval,might effectively constitute such an implicit prior assurance that it rises to the level of an affirmative act.dwares also did not indicate whether government officials may implicitly send a message of official sanction by engaging in related misconduct themselves or by participating in or tolerating such a practice.
the district court,while persuaded that pena was controlling in okin case on the question of qualified immunity,read pena too broadly in pena,the officers sent the message to their colleague that he could be reckless in driving while intoxicated,and engag e in misconduct that is likely to endanger the life,liberty or property of others.pena,at.here,by contrast,okin seeks to show that the the course of their official duties while responding to her domestic violence the message that sears was free to engage in intentional violence.the official sanction of intentional violence was the precise message conveyed by the officers acting pursuant to their official duties in dwares,at,and in hemphill,at.
while pena contains several broad statements regarding what dwares did or did not decide,we are obligated to read those statements in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.saucier,at.pena correctly observed that dwares did not provide an implicit sanction theory where police officers encouraged reckless violence.at.but the statements in pena regarding dwares do not extend to okin case where police officers encouraged intentional violence.we draw support for this conclusion from our discussion above of cases that involved official sanction of intentional violence,and from the pena court explicit acknowledgment that the question of qualified immunity,where that case involved official sanction of reckless violence,was a close one,at.as the officers in pena encouraged reckless drunk driving,pena is distinguishable from dwares,hemphill,and this case.the officers here,as in dwares and hemphill,affirmatively conveyed to sears that he had carte blanche to perpetrate intentional violence against okin.the officers had notice not only of the general prohibition on dangers created by state actors affirmative conduct,but also,that their conduct,to the extent it implicitly encouraged intentional violence,specifically,could fall within the realm of that prohibition.see hope,at.explaining that general statements of the law,while they may not indicate the universe of unlawful conduct,are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning because a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question quoting united states lanier,d.
we can not accept that an officer of reasonable competence,lennon,at,would fail to understand,following dwares and hemphill,that discussing football scores with sears after okin complaints that he had beaten and tried to choke her,repeatedly failing to interview or arrest sears,or to file domestic incident reports,despite okin numerous complaints of abuse and statements of fear for her life,and sears informing chief williams that he could not help it sometimes when he smacks michele okin around,would affirmatively communicate to sears that he could continue to beat and threaten okin without fear of police intervention,and would contribute to the vulnerability of the complainant by emboldening her abuser.unlike the officers in pena that encouraged reckless behavior,the officers in okin case,as in dwares and hemphill,were,in the course of their official duties,encouraging intentional violence by a private actor.the investigation of domestic violence complaints are,and were at the time of the events alleged by okin,to defendant police officers through extensive professional training in that area,including state law governing those investigations see hope,at.we may infer the existence of this subjective state of mind from the fact that the risk of harm is obvious.
the officers failure to comply with their training and the relevant state law,provides strong support for the conclusion that the officers should have been aware of the wrongful character of their conduct see id.at.explaining that the defendants course of conduct,which tended to prove that the defendants ignored a regulation that restricted the use of hitching posts,provided strong support for the conclusion that defendants were fully aware of the wrongful character of their conduct.
in sum,the rule drawn from dwares,although its application was not clearly established under the circumstances in pena,applied with obvious clarity to okin case.id.at.quotation marks omitted.hence,we find that the actions taken by the officers in response to okin complaints clearly implicated the exception to deshaney that we have repeatedly the officer in some way had assisted in creating or increasing the danger to the victim,the officer actions implicated the victim rights under the due process clause.dwares,at see also hemphill,at we conclude that the state of the law in to gave defendants fair warning that police conduct that encourages a private citizen to engage in domestic violence,by fostering the belief that his intentionally violent behavior will not be confronted by arrest,punishment,or police interference,gives rise to a substantive due process violation,and that defendants,if found liable,would not be entitled to qualified immunity.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of okin due process claims as to douglas,lug,weber and williams.on extensive review of the record,we find that okin does not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to repeated failures,of a kind that would have emboldened sears,on the part of defendants rusty and edward manion,and we affirm the grant of summary judgment to them.
ii.okin equal protection claims 
okin alleges that,by their failure to apply the law equally on the basis of gender and their failure to discharge their duties in a manner,defendants violated her equal protection rights.her claim is that,although the defendant police departments stated policy was that domestic violence incidents were to receive the same police attention as other criminal incidents,their unspoken policy and practice was to treat complaints of domestic violence towards women differently.
proof that discriminatory intent was a motivating factor is required to show a violation of the equal protection clause.see arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.in eagleston guido,cir,a directed verdict case,we announced a standard for equal protection claims in the domestic violence context,writing that a directed verdict is appropriate unless the plaintiff adduces evidence sufficient to sustain the inference that there is a policy or a practice of affording less protection to victims of domestic violence than to other victims of violence in comparable circumstances,that discrimination against one sex was a motivating factor,and that the policy or practice was the proximate cause of plaintiff injury.id.at.
in eagleston,a woman contacted the police ten times to report harassment and threats by her sporadically estranged husband the two had orders of protection against each other.id.at.on only one occasion was he arrested.eventually,the woman was stabbed by the husband or more times with a carving knife,following an argument.id.her complaint charged that defendant,county of suffolk,acting through its police department,condoned a pattern or practice of affording inadequate protection,or no protection at all,to women who have complained of having been abused by their husbands or others with whom they have a close relationship.id.at alteration in original.as judge jacobs wrote 
accepting eagleston account as true,her testimony showed at most that a few police officers failed to perform their jobs well.her testimony does not evidence a practice of disparate treatment for domestic disputes.even on the level of anecdote,eagleston account is fully consistent with a responsive police department dealing on an basis with an ambiguous series of events.
eagleston,at.
as the district court noted here,under eagleston,domestic violence plaintiffs must adduce some evidence that officers responded differently to types of complaints in order to prevail on an equal protection claim.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.to prevail,okin would have to demonstrate that her complaints of domestic violence were treated differently than other,similar complaints of violence,because of her gender.although,pursuant to eagleston,at,okin must sustain the inference that victims of comparable violence were afforded more protection,she does not attempt to show that police officers responded with more competence,say,or a higher rate of arrest,to complaints of violence that were not domestic in nature.as the district court put it,s he relies exclusively on her own,while heartrending,does not get her where eagleston says she must go.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.
okin asks us to repudiate eagleston,arguing that repeated deviations from the mandatory arrest statute and from corresponding police department policy,even with respect to only one female domestic violence victim,could be grounds for an inference of gender bias,that is,that a woman who is a victim of domestic violence should not need to prove that a police department afforded her less protection than it did victims of violence in comparable circumstances.we decline,however,to revisit eagleston.
any equal protection claim is grounded on a comparison between the treatment the state gives similarly situated individuals.okin could have attempted to show that she and other women were discriminated against by defendant police departments but,although defendants produced in discovery police reports concerning domestic violence response in cornwall,okin has not attempted to demonstrate discrimination by a comparison based upon these.failing that,at the very least she has to show that it was her gender,and not some other characteristic,that motivated the treatment she received.she might be able to do this if she had compared evidence of the manner in which defendant police departments responded to comparable violence incidents,with the manner in which they responded to domestic violence at her house,but again she does not attempt such a comparison.
we therefore hold that the district court correctly concluded that okin failed to raise a genuine and material dispute of fact concerning whether defendants denied her equal protection of the law,and we affirm that part of the district court order which granted,as to all moving defendants,summary judgment on okin claim for violation of her right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.
iii.municipal liability 
in her complaint,okin alleges that not only the individual defendants,but also the police departments by which they were employed,violated her due process and equal protection rights.section imposes liability on a government that,under color of some official policy,causes an employee to violate another constitutional rights.monell dep of soc,d quoting.monell does not provide a separate cause of action for the failure by the government to train its employees it extends liability to a municipal organization where that organization failure to train,or the policies or customs that it has sanctioned,led to an independent constitutional violation.segal city of new york,cir.having found that okin raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the individual defendants of the village of violated her due process rights,we now consider the question whether she raises a genuine issue of fact as to the municipal liability of the village.
a municipality may be found to have a custom that causes a constitutional violation when faced with a pattern of misconduct,it does nothing,compelling the conclusion that it has acquiesced in or tacitly authorized its subordinates unlawful actions.reynolds giuliani,cir see also sorlucco new york city police dep,cir municipal liability can be established by demonstrating that the actions of subordinate officers are sufficiently widespread to constitute the constructive acquiescence of senior policymakers brown city of fort lauderdale,cir finding that a longstanding and widespread practice is deemed authorized by the policymaking officials because they must have known about it but failed to stop it.
okin claim of municipal liability,although focused on the village alleged,is fairly construed to articulate a claim that the village had a custom whereby it acquiesced in unconstitutional conduct by its officers.the record shows more than a dozen contacts between okin and the village,that involved a number of officers,including officials like sergeant weber and captain williams,and that recurrently concerned complaints of domestic violence.these incidents suggest a consistent pattern of failing to adequately respond to okin complaints,to implement the new york mandatory arrest statute,to interview the alleged abuser,or to file domestic incident reports,a pattern which may have encouraged further violence.we therefore find sufficient evidence in the record to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the officers conduct indicates a practice,tacitly endorsed by the village,that was so persistent or widespread as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.patterson county of oneida,cir quoting sorlucco,at.
municipal liability may also be premised on a failure to train employees when inadequate training reflects deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.city of canton harris,d.to prove deliberate indifference,we have required the plaintiff to show that a policymaker knows to a moral certainty that her employees will confront a given situation that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult choice of the sort that training or supervision will make less difficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situation and that the wrong choice by the employee will frequently cause the deprivation of a citizen constitutional rights.walker city of new york,cir.
we have no trouble in finding that policymakers would know that officers will confront domestic violence situations,that training assists officers to employ criminal justice strategies attuned to the complexities of domestic violence,and that in okin case,the record indicates a history of mishandling her complaints.there is also a strong likelihood that the officers repeated failures to meaningfully respond to okin,potentially enhancing the risk of violence,qualifies as a pattern of misconduct that would frequently cause violations of a citizen constitutional rights and that suggests training so inadequate as to give rise to an inference of deliberate indifference.see vann city of new york,cir d eliberate indifference may be inferred if the complaints are followed by no meaningful attempt on the part of the municipality to investigate or to forestall further incidents.okin thus meets the walker requirements at this stage.
a closer question is whether okin,in order to proceed beyond summary judgment on the theory,has identif ied a specific deficiency in the city training program and establish ed that that deficiency is closely related to the ultimate injury,such that it actually caused the constitutional deprivation.green city of new york,cir quoting amnesty am.town of hartford,cir.a pattern of misconduct,while perhaps suggestive of inadequate training,is not enough to create a triable issue of fact on a theory.see amnesty,at.the plaintiff must offer evidence to support the conclusion that the training program was inadequate,not t hat a particular officer may be unsatisfactorily trained or that an otherwise sound program has occasionally been negligently administered,and that a hypothetically officer would have avoided the constitutional violation.city of canton,at.see also amnesty,at.
the district court noted that,but for finding no triable issue of fact on okin constitutional claims,it would have found the individual officers sketchy recollection and understanding of domestic violence laws and policies,together with their pattern of not taking okin repeated complaints seriously,at the very least to raise an issue of fact concerning the adequacy of the training provided by the two departments to their officers.okin,dist.lexis,at,wl,at.we agree with the district court observation that the record shows more than a pattern of misconduct.because some of the officers were unable during their depositions to remember basic details regarding their training on domestic violence,a reasonable factfinder could plausibly infer that the training program failed to impart with the necessary frequency or specificity how to appropriately respond to domestic violence complaints,including the circumstances that call for interviewing suspects and witnesses,filing domestic incident reports,and making an arrest.it is questionable whether evidence of the officers inability to recall the substance of their training could alone create a triable issue of fact on the adequacy of a training program.see city of canton,at.the record in this case is not so limited,however.
here,captain williams testified that,along with sergeant weber,he was involved,at least in part,in administering the village training program on domestic violence,having led a refresher course on domestic violence in.we have seen that the evidence,viewed favorably to okin,shows that sears told williams he abused okin and that weber was continually dismissive in response to okin complaints.the repeated failure of officers to properly respond to domestic violence complaints,when those same officers were responsible for teaching subordinates how to respond domestic violence,suggests a fundamental flaw in the training training responsibility in the hands of those
