background 
we recite the facts from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,thompson.see franceschi dep t of veterans affairs,cir.
thompson,an of jamaican origin,started working for in as one of four production supervisors in the quality assurance department at northampton plant gerald goodsell,who thompson alleges made discriminatory comments,oversaw the production supervisors and served as an interim production manager from august until december,when dennis williams transferred from another plant to take over duties as production manager at the northampton plant.
throughout most of thompson tenure at,he performed well.on a few occasions,however,he was reprimanded for being late to work.production managers also gave thompson frequent informal coaching sessions aimed at helping him improve his performance.
according to thompson,in late or early,goodsell expressed irritation at an disc jockey selection of reggae music at the annual christmas party.thompson alleges that goodsell said,i hate jamaican music and jamaicans.thompson asserts he did not report the comment because he feared retaliation and termination.thompson also alleges that on another occasion,in or about august or september,goodsell said to him,i deal with you,you fucking jamaican.thompson claims that goodsell told him more than once that he was going to deal with him and that goodsell made other threatening and harassing comments.thompson does not provide any specifics,nor does he allege that any of these other comments were racial or discriminatory in nature.
in april,donna harris,a white female quality assurance supervisor who was not in thompson chain of command,said to ronald mckeithen thompson who is also of jamaican origin,i not one of thompson jamaican bimbos.thompson and mckeithen reported the incident to john newton,the quality assurance manager.newton informed celine lasonde,the human resources manager,and lasonde instructed newton to sit down with harris and discuss her inappropriate comments.harris was instructed to apologize to mckeithen which she did,and she was also required to undergo sensitivity training.thompson claims that after this incident and harris reprimand,she retaliated against him by using her position to negatively impact his work 
on august,in response to coverage problems caused by,the plant manager,james lane,sent an to all of the production supervisors outlining procedures for vacation time.supervisors were instructed that they should obtain coverage from another production supervisor request personal vacation time from the direct manager in writing notify the other production supervisors and enter the requested vacation time into a computerized spreadsheet.though it was protocol to give advance notice,acknowledges that there was no requirement and no formal policy implemented with respect to vacation time.
in the fall of,thompson realized that he needed dental surgery,and he decided to have the surgery performed in jamaica because the procedure would cost less.by december,he needed urgent dental attention,and he claims that he informed the management that he needed to travel to jamaica to have dental work done immediately.thompson asserts that he spoke to héctor lepage,his leader about the dental surgery in early december and then told one of the other supervisors,duval,about his proposed time off.thompson claims that duval agreed to cover his shifts.thompson also claims that he told duval that he might need extra time off,but he could not be sure until he was in jamaica and had an opportunity to see his dentist.thompson says that duval approved and asked him to send him an confirming the details.thompson sent duval the confirmatory at on december.duval did not read the from thompson until the next time he reported to work,which was on december.duval claims he did not know the exact dates thompson would be away,including the possibility of the extra week off,until he read the.
thompson asserts that after he arranged coverage with duval,he spoke to dennis williams,who gave him approval,so long as goodsell was informed as well.thompson called goodsell at his home on december,at around,the evening before his flight to jamaica.goodsell did not tell thompson that he could not take time off goodsell only concern was coverage for thompson shifts.thompson entered his time off on the spreadsheet through the end of december.he did not request time off in writing.as a result of thompson leave,goodsell had to fill in as production supervisor at some point,and duval had to work over forty consecutive days.
once he was in jamaica,thompson realized that he would not be back until january,because his surgery would take longer than he initially expected.thompson called to inform management that he would need extra time he left a message on goodsell.goodsell did not respond to thompson message.thompson assumed that his extension had been approved by goodsell.goodsell,however,reported to lasonde and lane that thompson failed to comply with vacation protocol.lasonde interviewed rutherford,garcía,duval,and goodsell to discuss thompson leave.after thompson returned from jamaica,he was given an opportunity to discuss the situation in a meeting with goodsell,lane,lasonde,and williams.
at the meeting,thompson contested version of the events surrounding his vacation.he did not make any claims at the time that goodsell had been racially biased against him.shortly after that meeting,lasonde,williams,and lane sent a separation proposal to the separation review committee in atlanta,georgia.the separation review committee agreed with the separation proposal and terminated thompson.thompson claims that it is clear that goodsell was an integral part of his termination and that he was retaliated against because of his race and national origin.according to,thompson was terminated solely for taking unauthorized vacation time without giving prior proper notice.
thompson filed a claim with the massachusetts commission against discrimination on april,arguing that he had been discriminated against,harassed,and retaliated against based upon his race,ethnicity,color,national origin,and ancestry under chapter of the general laws of massachusetts.thompson withdrew his complaint with the commission on august,and filed suit in hampshire county superior court on may.removed the case to federal court on july.then filed a motion for summary judgment on august.the district court granted the motion on july.thompson appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions on file,and any affidavits.see.c cox hainey,cir.when considering arguments for summary judgment,we must disregard improbable or overly attenuated inferences,unsupported conclusions,and rank speculation.abbott bragdon,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the evidence offered by the adverse party can not be merely colorable or speculative.pagano frank,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d internal quotation marks omitted.the evidence must be significantly probative of specific facts.pérez volvo car,cir citing anderson,at.a dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the party.sánchez alvarado,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.maymí ports,cir.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see hegarty somerset county,cir.we will reverse only if,after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the party here,thompson,the evidence on record is sufficiently to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.maymí,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
first,thompson argues that he has provided sufficient evidence that he was terminated based on his race and national origin.even if goodsell was not officially responsible for the decision to terminate,thompson argues that goodsell had enormous influence in the process.thompson argues that the causal connection between the decision to terminate him and goodsell discriminatory comments is not broken since the separation review committee acted on biased information without conducting its own independent investigation.see cariglia hertz equipment rental,cir.
second,thompson asserts that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through goodsell comments,harris comments,and goodsell failure to follow policies and procedures.he contends that the district court erred when it characterized goodsell alleged comments as stray,and,therefore,insufficient to prove claims of a hostile work environment or discriminatory termination.thompson maintains that he suffered retaliation because he engaged in protected conduct and was given poor performance evaluations upon which his termination was ostensibly based.
we do not find support for thompson arguments and reject them in turn.
race and national origin discrimination 
to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under.laws ch,thompson must prove that he is a member of a protected class,that he suffered harm as a result of adverse employment action,and that harbored discriminatory animus,which was the determinative cause of the adverse action.weber cmty.teamwork,lewis city of boston,cir construing massachusetts law.thompson bears the burden of proving discrimination.see blare husky injection molding.boston.
under the mcdonnell douglas analysis,we employ a familiar framework in evaluating claims for discrimination.see wheelock coll.comm against discrimination.thompson bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas green,d.the burden then shifts to to present a legitimate,reason,sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it discriminated against thompson,for the employment decision.quiñones houser buick,cir.obligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion,as the burden of persuasion remains with thompson.lewis,at.if meets its burden and provides a justification for thompson termination,the presumption of discrimination disappears,and the burden shifts back to thompson,who must demonstrate that decision was merely a pretext to hide such discrimination.id.
we must first determine whether thompson makes out a prima facie claim for race discrimination.it is undisputed that thompson is a member of a protected class because he is an.his termination was an adverse employment action.taking the facts in the light most favorable to thompson,he makes a claim that he was terminated for discriminatory reasons because he is of jamaican origin and goodsell made numerous discriminatory comments about jamaicans and threatened to deal with him.he has met his burden for the first prong of the test.the burden now shifts to to present a reason for terminating him.
the record reflects that decision to terminate thompson was based on thompson failure to follow office procedure with regard to vacation leave.thompson did not put his vacation request in writing,and he did not secure the appropriate coverage for the days that he would be away.the record reflects that duval told lasonde that thompson had not secured coverage for his shifts in advance.duval maintains that he did not have confirmation of the dates thompson was going to be away until december,he received an the night before thompson departed for jamaica.thompson acknowledges that his first contact with his direct supervisor,goodsell,about his leave was only hours before he departed for jamaica.he admits that he failed to follow any of the required steps of the protocol for his extension of the vacation because he merely relied on a unilateral to goodsell.he also did not enter the vacation period into the company computerized vacation spreadsheet.these facts are supported by evidence,including thompson own admissions.furthermore,thompson acknowledged that violation of procedures would constitute a legitimate,reason for his termination.thus met its burden of producing a legitimate,reason for terminating thompson.
since has shown a legitimate,reason for terminating thompson,the burden shifts back to thompson.thompson can no longer rest on the initial inference of discrimination but,rather,must show that articulated reason is pretextual.bennett,cir.to meet this burden,thompson must prove not only that the reason articulated by the employer was a sham,but also that its true reason was plaintiff race or national origin.stores,cir.
under settled discrimination law,to demonstrate that its stated reasons for terminating thompson were not pretextual,explanation need not be perfect.see mesnick,cir courts may not sit as super personnel departments,assessing the even employers nondiscriminatory business decisions.reasons for terminating thompson must simply be legitimate and not a for discrimination.see loeb textron,cir while an employer judgment or course of action may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders,the relevant question is simply whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination the focus is to be on the employer motivation,not on its business judgment.t s serv,crenson,cir.if there is no proof of discriminatory animus on the part of a decisionmaker,a plaintiff must show more than that the decisionmaker perception was incorrect he must show that the decisionmaker did not believe in the accuracy of the information that he was given.bennett,at.put another way,t he question is not whether thompson or his fellow employees version is the true one,but whether the decisionmakers believed what they had been told by those who were interviewed by management.ronda pérez banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria puerto rico,cir.
posits that the only real issue for the court to decide is whether the separation review committee acted with discriminatory animus.we agree.
thompson makes no allegation that the separation review committee had any bias of its own against thompson.actionable discrimination can not exist in a vacuum.rather the discriminatory intent of which a plaintiff complains must be traceable to the person or persons who made the decision to fire him.bennett,at.thompson can not meet this burden.his allegations of stray remarks made by harris and goodsell are insufficient to prove that the separation review committee was somehow biased against him.
harris was a,and a comment such as hers can not support an inference of pretext because it was one stray remark,and was made by a maker.nce foods,cir citing gonzález el día,cir.harris had no role in thompson termination,and her comment is immaterial.first,the comment was not made to thompson.second,management at the plant responded immediately,reprimanded her,and required her to apologize.third,harris did not supervise thompson and was not in a position to affect his work.see douglas penney,cir plaintiff identifies at most one possibly comment by a who was not plaintiff supervisor and as such is irrelevant.remarks by are not probative of context.see reynolds tobacco,cir the biases of one who neither makes nor influences the challenged personnel decision are not probative in an employment discrimination case.
goodsell alleged comments,two of three of which preceded thompson termination by over a year and none of which involved the termination process,can be characterized as nothing other than stray.this circuit has held that stray workplace remarks normally are insufficient,standing alone,to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.el día,at see also straughn delta air lines,cir.goodsell input was minimal and consistent with thompson own account of the events.despite a retaliatory or discriminatory motive on the part of a supervisor who recommends that some adverse action be taken against an employee,a third person independent decision to take adverse action breaks the causal connection between the supervisor retaliatory or discriminatory animus and the adverse action.mole of.the record reflects that goodsell input was limited and that the separation review committee made its own independent decision to terminate thompson based on the facts of the situation.in mole,the massachusetts supreme judicial court said that w hen assessing the independence of the ultimate decision maker,courts place considerable emphasis on the decision makers giving the employee the opportunity to address the allegations in question.id.at.gave thompson such an opportunity,and he failed to adequately explain his actions or even give a substantially different account of events.instead,he acknowledged that he did not follow proper procedures.
contrary to arguments made by thompson,cariglia is inapposite.among other reasons,in cariglia,the defendant decision to terminate the plaintiff was based upon a report drafted by a discriminatory supervisor,and the defendant did not conduct any further investigation or ask the employee for his version of events.cariglia,at.in examining those facts we noted that the critical legal issue is whether corporate liability can attach when neutral decisionmakers rely on information that is manipulated by another employee who harbors illegitimate animus.id.at.we remanded the case to the district court to address whether information was withheld from the neutral decisionmakers,but we noted that our decision may have been different if cariglia had been given a meaningful opportunity to address the reasons for his termination.see id.at.
thompson argues that there was no meaningful investigation into what happened,and that the separation review committee based its decision on a biased account by goodsell.the record demonstrates that this is patently false.lasonde convened a meeting with everyone involved while thompson was still in jamaica to gather information about what transpired.she also met with thompson,goodsell,lane,and williams immediately after thompson returned from his trip and gave him an opportunity to explain himself.he did not contradict goodsell version of events,except to say that he had coverage,that he was not really required to submit his request in writing even though he admitted to receiving a previous from management outlining that leave requests must be submitted in writing,and that he asked duval to cover his shifts.but the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson,at.thompson did not make any allegations against goodsell at the time.thompson presents no evidence that goodsell made the decision to terminate him,nor can he point to any information in lasonde separation proposal memorandum provided by goodsell without corroboration by thompson himself or other employees.this is not a situation where goodsell conceal ed relevant information from the decisionmak ers or fed false information to them,and was able to influence the decision.cariglia,at quoting wallace smc pneumatics,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
lasonde recommendation to the separation review committee was based on record evidence,an investigation of the situation,and reflected her belief that thompson should be terminated for taking unauthorized vacation.thompson has not shown that his termination was in any way a result of racial or national origin discrimination.his claims fail.
harassment and retaliation 
in looking at a claim for hostile work environment,we assess whether a plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment that materially altered the conditions of his employment.noviello city of boston,cir citing faragher city of boca ratón,d.to sustain a claim of hostile work environment,thompson must demonstrate that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive work environment and that the racially objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and that thompson in fact did perceive it to be so.douglas,at citation omitted.
thompson argues that he was exposed to a hostile work environment through goodsell comments,harris comments,and goodsell failure to follow policies and procedures.thompson contends that failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct the harassment promptly,and failed to show that thompson unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.noviello,at quoting burlington,ellerth,d.we do not agree.
under massachusetts law,a hostile work environment is one that is pervaded by harassment or abuse,with the resulting intimidation,humiliation,and stigmatization,and that poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.cuddyer stop shop supermarket,quoting,div.of interco.comm against discrimination.the environment must be sufficiently hostile or abusive in light of all of the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.faragher,at.quoting harris forklift,d.
thompson points to only three instances that could possibly constitute harassment that could create a hostile work environment in the span of four years,and they were spread out over that time.harris comment can not be considered pervasive on its face because she made the comment only on one occasion.moreover,disciplined her and required her to take part in sensitivity training.the comment was not directed at thompson,and by his own admission,he did not find it severely derogatory towards him.harris was not in thompson department and she had no management responsibility towards him.see janssen ortho llc,cir.
taking as true that goodsell made derogatory comments to thompson,the first alleged comment was made once during a social event,not in connection with any work situation or any other objectionable statements or conduct.more is needed to constitute a hostile work environment.see kosereis rhode island,cir a hostile work environment generally is not created by a mere offensive utterance,nor does it arise from simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents.internal citations omitted.goodsell alleged comments did not rise to the level of severely hostile or abusive actions.
the second alleged comment by goodsell occurred months after the first alleged comment and months before thompson vacation and subsequent termination in.even so,under speen crown clothing,cir,ambiguous remarks,tending to suggest animus are insufficient,standing alone,to prove an employer discriminatory intent.id.at quoting blare,at.thompson never reported any of the alleged comments that goodsell made to anybody.as noted by the district court,has a comprehensive and workplace dispute resolution system,which provides employees with several avenues for reporting incidents.these avenues include a phone number to report issues of concern,as well as the opportunity for a confidential consultation with an ombudsman.thompson coca cola.thompson concedes that he never made or attempted to report any alleged incidents until after he was terminated.see,at t he undisputed facts establish that defendant had well established antiharassment and antidiscrimination policies that included procedures for employees to follow in airing grievances and that plaintiff failed to take advantage of these procedures.thompson,who are of various races,acknowledge that goodsell yelled at them at times,but they categorically deny that he ever made racially charged or racially insensitive statements.there is no ev
