marie and her husband,osvaldo,filed this suit against marcano former employer,pueblo international,on september.the complaint alleges that pueblo discriminated against marcano because of her physical disability in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,as well as its puerto rico counterpart,law of july,as amended,et.the complaint also contains a claim for damages pursuant to article of the puerto rico civil code,which provides a cause of action to relatives of a tort victim.the case went to trial,where a jury determined that pueblo had violated both the ada and law by discriminating against marcano in her employment.as a result of this finding,the jury awarded plaintiffs in compensatory damages.the district court subsequently doubled the damages awarded to marcano pursuant to the remedies provision of law,see a,and entered judgment accordingly.both parties filed timely appeals.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiff marie was born on june,with a congenital bone defect in her legs.as a result of this condition,both of her legs were amputated early in her life.since then,she has used a wheelchair.marcano is married to osvaldo,and both plaintiffs reside together in san juan,puerto rico.defendant,pueblo international,is a delaware corporation that is in the business of owning and operating retail supermarkets.
in april of,marcano began working for pueblo as a cashier.initially,she worked at the altamira supermarket,which is located in san juan,puerto rico.marcano remained a employee until february,at which time her status changed to cashier.
in july of,marcano requested and received a transfer to las américas supermarket,which is also located in san juan.there,marcano continued to work as a cashier until november,when she was moved to the produce department to work as a weight station clerk.as a weight station clerk,marcano weighed fruits and vegetables.she continued,however,to work as a cashier during periods of intense business activity,such as public holidays.in october of,the position of weight station clerk was eliminated because the job of weighing produce was relocated to the cash register.at that time,all employees classified as weight station clerks were automatically reclassified as produce clerks regardless of their personal circumstances.marcano was then moved to the floral department where she remained until january,when she was dismissed as part of a reduction in work force that resulted in the dismissal of management employees and regular employees.
on february,marcano filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the unit of the puerto rico department of labor and human resources.she received a letter from the eeoc on june,and thereafter filed this action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on september.
on the eve of trial,pueblo filed several motions in limine.relevant to this appeal is motion in limine.in that motion,pueblo argued that the court should exclude all evidence of alleged failures to accommodate that occurred prior to july.pueblo reasoned that prior to that date neither the ada nor law provided a private cause of action for failure to accommodate.prior to opening statements on february,the district court denied the motion.as a result of that ruling,marcano was allowed to testify regarding events that allegedly occurred prior to july.these included marcano inability to properly access the women restroom with her wheelchair pueblo failure to modify the cashier station so that marcano could comfortably work there pueblo failure to make marcano a employee despite the fact that she worked over forty hours a week for over two and a half years and pueblo failure to consider marcano for an office position at the altamira store,allegedly because her wheelchair would not fit well into the office space.
marcano testimony also included several events that occurred after july,that she believed were indicative of pueblo alleged failure to accommodate her disability.first,marcano stated that at one point in time she was informed by pueblo that she could no longer use the handicapped parking space that was reserved for customers.this lasted approximately one month,after which marcano once again began parking in the handicapped parking space.second,she testified that while assigned to the position of assistant florist she was not able to use her wheelchair because the area where the florists worked was not handicap accessible.as a result,marcano was forced to access the florists area by walking on her amputated limbs,which she indicated led to the development of cellulitis.third,marcano testified that immediately prior to her termination her manager,ceferino torres,told her,maría,from the bottom of my heart,i do know what they going to do with you because pedro díaz does know where to place you because of your physical disability.finally,marcano stated that it was not until she was terminated that she learned that the company had classified her as a produce clerk until that time,she believed that she was,and always had been,a cashier.
at the end of the first day of trial,and following the direct examination of marcano,the district court reexamined its ruling regarding the applicability of law to events that occurred before july.the court stated 
now,in going further into the matter after it was brought up today,because the court was not given an opportunity to look into that because you have brought it up,finds that the initial law did apply to discrimination in public agencies or private agencies receiving public funding and that obviously did not create a private cause of action up until july of,when it was amended and then did create a private cause of action along with the federal ada.
so i going to amend my ruling and state for the record that what i going to do is to give the jury a limiting or cautionary instruction at the time that i give the instructions stating in effect that the testimony that had been given from the time she started with pueblo and is being allowed and was allowed to establish an animus pattern,attitude motive of the defendant as evidence of a pretext,but that any acts post july,may be considered by the jury as violations of the ada and law that is,failure to accommodate for purposes of any damages.
now,that is the limiting instruction that i going to give to the jury.
pueblo then argued that a curative instruction would not be sufficient unless it clearly stated that pueblo had no legal obligations to accommodate prior to.the court indicated that it would consider broadening its instruction accordingly.
after the presentation of plaintiffs evidence,pueblo moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court instructed counsel not to continue with his arguments regarding reasonable accommodation because those issues would be sent to the jury.pueblo was,however,allowed to proceed with its motion with regard to the alleged discriminatory termination.nevertheless,the district court denied the motion.
at the close of evidence,pueblo renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law.this time,the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing plaintiffs claim for discriminatory discharge on the ground that there was no evidence to support this allegation.however,the court ruled that it would allow the remaining claims to go to the jury.
the case was submitted to the jury on february.as part of its lengthy instructions to the jury,the court gave the following limiting instruction regarding the applicability of the ada and law to events which occurred prior to july,
now,the purpose of the americans with disabilities act and law,is to eliminate employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities.these statutes make it unlawful for an employer to intentionally discriminate against an employee because of that person disability.these statutes went into effect on july.accordingly,the defendant may only be liable under these provisions if you find them so liable for conduct incurred after july.
therefore,i hereby instruct you that you should not consider in your deliberations in this case any discriminatory events prior to july,the date when the americans with disabilities act and law went into effect.nor should you consider the validity of plaintiff termination as a result of defendant reduction in force plan.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs,awarding compensatory damages in the amount of to marcano and to román.on march,the district court entered judgment accordingly.thereafter,pueblo filed another motion for judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,a motion for new trial.in turn,plaintiffs marcano and román filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.on march,the district court issued a ruling denying pueblo motions and granting in part plaintiffs motion to double the damages awarded to marcano from to,pursuant to the provisions of law.the court then entered an amended judgment.this appeal and followed.
pueblo is the and appeals the jury verdict and the amended judgment.pueblo argues that the district court erred by allowing evidence to be presented to the jury regarding alleged acts of failure to accommodate prior to july,and that the damages awarded by the jury are not supported by the evidence presented at trial.marcano and román are.they appeal the dismissal of marcano discriminatory discharge claim,the district court rulings regarding damages,and the district court ruling regarding pueblo liability for alleged discriminatory acts occurring prior to july.for the sake of clarity,we refer to the parties by name or by their trial designations as plaintiffs and defendant.
discussion 
i.the plaintiffs claims 
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in four instances the dismissal for insufficient evidence of marcano claim of unlawful termination the court decision not to award damages under the ada separate from,or in addition to,the award of double damages granted pursuant to local law the court decision not to give the jury an instruction regarding punitive damages for a violation of the ada and the court jury instruction that alleged acts of discrimination or that occurred prior to july,should not be considered.we see no merit in any of these arguments.
unlawful termination 
we begin with marcano claim for unlawful termination,which the district court dismissed at the close of evidence following pueblo motion for judgment as a matter of law.see.a.we review the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,examining the facts and the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.see andrade jamestown hous,cir.accordingly,we do not consider the credibility of witnesses,resolve conflicts in testimony,or evaluate the weight of the evidence.see richmond steel,puerto rican am.ins,cir.to affirm the withdrawal of any claim from the jury,we must find that,as a matter of law,the record would permit a reasonable jury to reach only one conclusion as to that issue.katz city metal,cir see also gibson city of cranston,cir.however,a mere scintilla of evidence will not rise to a triable issue of fact necessary to avoid dismissal under rule.irvine murad skin research,cir.
plaintiffs unlawful termination claim is governed by the analysis originally set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see,higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir in order to facilitate inquiries into whether an employer adverse employment decision was motivated by an employee disability,courts generally use the mcdonnell douglas scheme.the basic framework of the mcdonnell douglas analysis is well known 
a plaintiff who suffers from a disability makes out a prima facie case of employment discrimination by demonstrating that she is a member of a protected group who has been denied an employment opportunity for which she was otherwise qualified.such a showing gives rise to an inference that the employer discriminated due to the plaintiff disability and places upon the employer the burden of articulating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.this entails only a burden of production,not a burden of persuasion the task of proving discrimination remains the plaintiff at all times.once such a reason emerges,the inference raised by the prima facie case dissolves and the plaintiff is required to show that the employer proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination.
dichner liberty travel,cir citations and footnote omitted.this analytical framework was recently reaffirmed by the supreme court in reeves sanderson plumbing,in which the court clarified that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case and the employer has offered a nondiscriminatory justification,although the presumption of discrimination drops out of the picture once the defendant meets its burden of production,the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing plaintiff prima facie case and inferences properly drawn therefrom on the issue of whether the defendant explanation is pretextual,d citations omitted.
we first address whether marcano made out a prima facie case of discrimination.pueblo argues that plaintiff can not establish a prima facie case because she can not show that other similarly situated persons,not in the protected class,were treated more favorably.see ruiz posadas de san juan,cir.in this regard,defendant stresses that the reduction in force was implemented blindly,solely according to seniority within each job classification and geographic area,and that within that body of employees no individual with less seniority than plaintiff was retained.plaintiff only response is that she was improperly classified as a produce clerk in the first place,and her suggestion that such classification was discriminatory.however,plaintiff offers no evidence that other similarly situated employees without physical disabilities were treated differently with regard to their classification.to the contrary,the record shows that all weight station clerks plaintiff prior position were reclassified as produce clerks in.defendant also notes that plaintiff position was not subsequently filled by a person without a disability and argues that this is further indication that her termination was made on a legitimate and nondiscriminatory basis.
even viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff,we conclude that plaintiff failed to make a prima facie showing that discrimination was a motivating factor in her termination.all evidence in the record supports the contrary her termination was the result of a legitimate reduction in force by pueblo.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiff unlawful termination claim on this ground alone.
however,even if marcano had succeeded in making a prima facie showing of discrimination,her claim would founder on the remaining steps of the mcdonnell douglas inquiry for essentially the same reasons that her prima facie case is deficient.pueblo stated a nondiscriminatory justification for terminating marcano and she failed to offer sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that such justification was pretextual.at trial,pueblo presented a plethora of evidence that marcano was terminated on january,due to a implemented by the corporation for economic reasons.this evidence included the following in,pueblo retained the services of deloitte touche to evaluate pueblo operations.deloitte touche recommended that pueblo reduce its managerial and salaried personnel.pueblo made the decision to implement that recommendation and reduce its workforce.the company informed the unión de empleados de los supermercados pueblo,and a stipulation and release was negotiated and executed with the union on january.pursuant to the terms of this stipulation,the rif was implemented in strict adherence to employee seniority within each job classification and geographic area.the determination of which employees to dismiss as part of the layoff was a mathematical and blind determination which did not take into consideration any criteria other than seniority.the individual stores had no input in the determination,and the entire process was kept confidential.including marcano,the rif affected regular employees and management employees.within marcano job classification and geographical area,no employee with less seniority than her remained employed by pueblo after the rif 
given this evidence,there is no question that pueblo met its burden of articulating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating marcano.the burden shifts,therefore,back to marcano to show that pueblo reduction in a pretext for discrimination.in this regard,marcano relies primarily on her allegation that she was never properly transferred from the cashier position and that,on january,her classification should have been.from the record,it appears that if marcano had been classified as a on january,she would not have been terminated as part of the rif.nevertheless,we believe that this allegation of a classification error,without more,is insufficient to show pretext.there is no dispute that when the position of weight station clerk was eliminated in,all employees classified as weight station clerks were automatically reclassified as produce clerks regardless of their personal circumstances.therefore,even if we accept that marcano was not properly classified as a produce clerk pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,marcano has still not shown that the erroneous alone the company reduction in a pretext for discrimination.because there is no evidence to indicate that marcano classification as a produce clerk on january was discriminatory or that it was intended to result in her dismissal,marcano unlawful termination claim must fail as a matter of law 
damages under the ada 
we turn next to plaintiff contention that the district court decision erred in not awarding damages under the ada separate from,and in addition to,the award of double damages pursuant to local law this contention is meritless.the verdict form prepared by the district court allowed the jury to determine defendant liability separately under the ada and law,but required that damages be awarded jointly without any allocation between the two laws.plaintiffs did not object to this aspect of the jury form against this background,the district court concluded 
the verdict seeks to redress all damages sustained by marcano rivera related to defendant discriminatory conduct regardless of the legal source.therefore,even though plaintiff marie marcano rivera is entitled to a duplication of the jury damages award pursuant to the scheme established by law,the mental anguish and suffering resulting from her discrimination in employment is one and the same for both law and ada.
in our opinion,the jury verdict is not susceptible to any other interpretation.since the plaintiffs have provided us with no authority that convinces us otherwise,we decline to examine this argument further 
punitive damages instruction 
next,we consider whether the district court correctly declined to instruct the jury on punitive damages.punitive damages are available if a plaintiff demonstrates that her employer engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.b.in this case,the district court ruled that an instruction on punitive damages was not warranted given the absence of evidence in the record that defendant engaged in discriminatory practice or practices with malice or reckless indifference to the rights of plaintiffs to be free from intentional discrimination.whether sufficient evidence exists to support punitive damages is a question of law which we review de novo.see eeoc stores,cir.
in,in kolstad american dental association,d,the supreme court held that punitive damages are only available for a subset of cases of intentional discrimination.the supreme court reasoned that congress intended to impose two standards of liability one for establishing a right to compensatory damages and another,higher standard that a plaintiff must satisfy to qualify for a punitive award.id.the court directly addressed the meaning of the terms malice and reckless indifference as they relate to the standard for punitive damages under title vii and the ada.in doing so,the court declined to limit punitive damages to cases involving intentional discrimination of an egregious nature,clarifying that the terms malice or reckless indifference pertain to the employer knowledge that it may be acting in violation of federal law,not its awareness that it is engaging in discrimination.id.this means that an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.id.at.at.the court went on to hold that an employer may not be held liable in punitive damages for the acts of its employees or agents when those acts are contrary to the employer good faith efforts to comply with the law.see id.at.at.
here,the plaintiffs have not identified any facts that would support an award of punitive damages under the principles announced in kolstad.the record is replete,on the other hand,with evidence that pueblo instituted policies prohibiting any type of discrimination,trained its personnel to ensure equal treatment of employees with disabilities,and took good faith efforts to comply with the ada.accordingly,the district court correctly declined to instruct the jury on punitive damages in this case.
evidence of conduct 
finally,we turn to the district court jury instruction that alleged acts of discrimination or occurring prior to july,should not be considered.the district court correctly determined that neither the ada nor law provided a private cause of action prior to july.see,morrison carleton woolen mills,ever since the ada became effective on july,the courts have consistently held that the act is not retroactive.puerto rico telephone,cir indicating that law did not make handicap discrimination an injury redressable in a private action for damages prior to.plaintiffs nevertheless contend that they have a viable cause of action pursuant to article.see.this argument is not well developed and rather disingenuous given the fact that article of the puerto rico civil code,see,establishes that tort claims under article are subject to a statute of limitations.consequently,we need not determine whether plaintiffs are correct that article provides an independent cause of action here because any such claim is clearly under the circumstances presented by this case.
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the district court did not err as claimed by plaintiffs,and we affirm the judgment accordingly.
ii.the defendant claims 
on appeal,pueblo argues that the presentation of evidence of conduct occurring before july,had a prejudicial effect on the jury that the damages awarded to marcano were not supported by the evidence because some of the alleged incidents of failure to accommodate presented at trial were barred by the statute of limitations that the damages awarded to marcano were not supported by the evidence because her claim for damages during the course of trial arose from her allegedly discriminatory claim that was dismissed by the district court that the damages awarded to marcano were otherwise not supported by the evidence because defendant conduct was not demonstrated to be discriminatory and that the damages awarded to marcano husband were not supported by the evidence because his claim for damages arose from marcano termination and the termination claim was dismissed by the district court.we find only the last of these arguments persuasive,and we affirm the district court disposition except to vacate the award of damages to marcano husband,román.
evidence of conduct 
pueblo first alleges that the district court erred in allowing evidence of acts that occurred prior to july,to be presented to the jury when neither the ada nor law provided a private right of action until that date.specifically,pueblo believes that marcano testimony regarding events had a prejudicial effect which no curative instruction could erase.we disagree.
as indicated,prior to opening statements,the district court denied pueblo motion in limine to exclude any acts of alleged failure to accommodate that occurred prior to july.the court,however,subsequently reexamined this ruling and reversed itself.as a result,the court offered a curative instruction as part of the jury charge.we repeat it here for the sake of clarity 
now,the purpose of the americans with disabilities act and law,is to eliminate employment discrimination against individuals with disabilities.these statutes make it unlawful for an employer to intentionally discriminate against an employee because of that person disability.these statutes went into effect on july.accordingly,the defendant may only be liable under these provisions if you find them so liable for conduct incurred after july.
therefore,i hereby instruct you that you should not consider in your deliberations in this case any discriminatory events prior to july,the date when the americans with disabilities act and law went into effect.nor should you consider the validity of plaintiff termination as a result of defendant reduction in force plan.
this instruction was clear and emphatic,and we think that it was sufficient to counteract the possibility of prejudice to pueblo from the presentation of conduct.despite its general assertion of prejudice from marcano testimony,the defendant has not suggested any sufficient basis for its conjecture that the jury failed to follow the specific curative instructions repeatedly given by the district court.see united states sepúlveda,cir a ppellate courts inquiring into the effectiveness of a trial judge curative instructions should start with a presumption that jurors will follow a direct instruction to disregard matters improvidently brought before them.consequently,we decline to reverse on this issue.
limitations period and sufficiency of the evidence 
defendant first challenge is another incarnation of its prior argument that the jury was prejudiced by the presentation of evidence of conduct for which pueblo can not,as a matter of law,be held liable.pueblo claims that many of the discriminatory acts alleged by plaintiff occurred more than days before plaintiff first filed her complaint with the unit of the puerto rico department of labor and was thus.without this evidence,defendant argues,the jury verdict is unsupported by the record.we disagree.
although defendant recognizes that the alleged acts might avoid the time limitation for filing a discrimination charge under the continuing violation theory,it argues that that theory is not applicable in this case.in particular,defendant points us to our decision in lawton state mutual life assurance,cir,for the proposition that a plaintiff must show a series of violations,at least one of which falls within the limitations period defendant argues that marcano failed to make such a showing here.however,lawton held that the failures to promote alleged by plaintiff in that case were not similar enough to her alleged termination to constitute serial violations,and also that the termination in that case had not been shown to be discriminatory.see id.at.here,by contrast,the various incidents in the alleged series of discrimination are all similar in nature.each episode alleged to have occurred outside the limitations period was a failure to accommodate comparable in nature to the discriminatory accommodation failures occurring within the limitations period,up to plaintiff termination.contrary to defendant arguments,these failures to accommodate are plainly similar enough to constitute serial violations.furthermore,unlike in lawton,the conduct falling within the limitations in period in this case was indeed established to be discriminatory.we therefore conclude that the continuing violation theory is applicable in this case,and we reject this aspect of defendant challenge to the jury verdict.
termination claim and sufficiency of the evidence 
defendant next claims that the jury verdict was not supported by the evidence because plaintiff action was predicated on her termination claim,which was dismissed by the district court.pueblo made this argument repeatedly before the district court,which properly rejected it.as much as defendant would prefer that this case be solely a termination case,plaintiff was absolutely explicit before the district court and on appeal that her claims include numerous alleged failures to accommodate as well as her termination.we therefore reject defendant contention without further discussion.
remaining sufficiency of the evidence arguments 
defendant goes still further in encouraging us to overturn the jury verdict in this case,arguing that none of the alleged conduct was shown at trial to be discriminatory.this argument also misses the mark.
as we have recognized before,under the ada,the term discriminate includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the employer.higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir quoting b a some quotation marks omitted.
unlike other enumerated constructions of discriminate,this construction does not require that an employer action be motivated by a discriminatory animus directed at the disability.rather,any failure to provide reasonable accommodations for a disability is necessarily because of a disability the accommodations are only deemed reasonable and,thus,required if they are needed because of the no proof of a particularized discriminatory animus is exigible.see bultemeyer fort wayne community,cir.hence,an employer who knows of a disability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations violates the statute,no matter what its intent,unless it can show that the proposed accommodations would create undue hardship for its business.see b a.
id.such failure to accommodate,of course,is precisely what the jury determined occurred in this case,and just a few examples illustrate why that conclusion is well founded in the evidence.
for instance,defendant contends that requiring plaintiff to cover the cash register during busy times was not shown to be discriminatory,particularly because other employees were also asked to cover the register during busy times.defendant,of course,misses the point entirely.for plaintiff to cover the cash register entailed a laborious and,according to her,humiliating process in which she would have to install a specially designed stool and move herself from her wheelchair to the in a situation which,by defendant own characterization,must be presumed to have included numerous observers,many of whom were likely to be impatient.under these circumstances,of which defendant was plainly aware,it was not enough to treat plaintiff like other employees.in fact,to do so was an unlawful failure to accommodate her disability in violation of the ada.
even more egregious is the defendant argument that it did not act unlawfully when it ordered plaintiff not to park in the store handicapped parking spaces.in defense of its actions,pueblo states in its brief that a t that time,as marcano states,she was asked to park in the same area as all other employees,away from the store.in essence,she was treated as all other employees.of course,here again,it is not sufficient to treat plaintiff as all other employees.plaintiff,due to her disability,must use parking spaces specially set aside for handicapped individuals,because those parking spaces are not only closer to the store but are also designed to accommodate her transfer from vehicle to wheelchair.her use of such spaces is not a matter of preference or convenience,but a matter of simply can not function in a crowded parking space.for defendant to posit that treating her like everyone other words,like she had no practically a concession of its failure to accommodate her.
based on the foregoing,we have no trouble in rejecting this aspect of defendant sufficiency of the evidence argument.
damages awarded to plaintiff husband 
defendant last challenge to the jury verdict is its most forceful one.pueblo contends that the damages awarded to plai
