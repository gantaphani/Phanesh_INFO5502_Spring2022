background 
plaintiff began working in as an executive secretary in fordham university classics department.one of her supervisors was defendant john richard clark,a professor in the classics department who was also,at various times during plaintiff tenure,the department chair.plaintiff alleges that,from the beginning,clark engaged in inappropriate conduct in their workplace.
for instance,plaintiff alleges that,in,clark engaged in the harassment of a female classics professor,sarah peirce.then,starting in,clark spent one to two hours every day viewing hard core pornographic videotapes on a in his office.plaintiff claims she was aware of clark habit because the flickering from his tv screen was visible through the glass partition of his office and because she once saw numerous pornographic videotapes scattered on the floor of his office when she knocked on his door to announce a visitor.
plaintiff also alleges that some of clark behavior was specifically directed at her.once,she discovered hard core pornographic websites on her computer.she alleges that clark used her computer to view these sites during his weekend trips to the office.after discovering the sites,she obtained a password to protect her computer and had all of the offensive material deleted.moreover,plaintiff alleges that clark regularly had videotapes concerning masochism and sadism shipped to the office,which,as his secretary,she was responsible for opening and delivering to his mailbox.
sometime before,plaintiff showed one of the videotapes delivered to clark office to defendant georgina arendacs,the director of the equity and equal opportunity eeo department at fordham bronx campus,who was charged with handling discrimination claims.arendacs took no remedial action beyond reporting plaintiff complaint to defendant david stuhr,the associate of academic affairs at fordham bronx campus.plaintiff continued to report clark behavior to arendacs and stuhr throughout showing them the collection of pornographic videotapes that clark kept in his office.
plaintiff alleges that,by,clark was clearly aware that she had reported his behavior and began to retaliate against her.he removed virtually all of her secretarial functions,kept her entirely out of the departmental information loop,refused to speak to her,and communicated with her only by.indeed,plaintiff alleges that defendant harry evans,another professor in the classics department and clark friend,advised clark not to give plaintiff any more work in order to make her leave.
in the fall of,evans became the chair of the classics department and,plaintiff alleges,he continued clark campaign of retaliation.plaintiff contends that evans sought to take disciplinary action against her on the pretext that she inaccurately prepared a time sheet he constantly monitored her whereabouts and picked up her telephone and he issued a negative performance evaluation,which plaintiff alleges was materially false.
on november,plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc issued plaintiff a notice of right to sue,which she received on september.on december,plaintiff filed the complaint which is the subject of the instant appeal.shortly thereafter,the defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to frcp b and b and,in the alternative,to strike certain allegations from the complaint pursuant to frcp f.on june,the district court conner,granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,declined to reach defendants b motion,and found their f motion to be moot.patane clark,d.this appeal followed.
