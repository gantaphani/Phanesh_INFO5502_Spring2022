harlen associates harlen,brought this action pursuant to against,the incorporated village of mineola village and its board of trustees board,alleging that the board denial of a special use permit to operate a convenience store was unconstitutional.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,mishler,granted motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action.harlen contends that the board denial of the special use permit was unconstitutional under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution because it violated its right to equal protection under the law by denying its permit application based on community opposition while granting permits to similarly situated stores in the village,and its right to due process by denying its application after it had been properly filed with the village building inspector.we find no merit in harlen contentions and we affirm.
background 
harlen is a partnership that owns real property located on jericho turnpike in mineola,new york.jericho turnpike is the main thoroughfare through the village of mineola and has traffic volume of approximately cars per day.before harlen acquired ownership of the property at issue,the parcel had been used as a gasoline service repair shop.three schools are located in the immediate vicinity of harlen property.
harlen planned to operate a convenience store on the property.that use was not permitted by the zoning code absent a special use permit from the village.the village zoning law vests discretion in the board to deny applications for special use permits for a number of reasons,including traffic,safety and aesthetic concerns.the board has permitted more than five other convenience stores to operate on jericho turnpike in mineola,although none of them is as close to the area schools as is harlen property.
in,harlen properly filed an application for a special use permit to build a convenience store on its property.the board subsequently held a public hearing concerning harlen application.at the hearing,harlen presented evidence in support of its application,including expert testimony,a letter indicating the permit history of the property,photographs,prior board decisions granting special use permits to allegedly similar establishments on jericho turnpike and a partial copy of a nassau county department of engineering traffic flow map for the property and the surrounding area.no comparable documentary evidence was presented in opposition to the application.
at the hearing,the board the village mayor who lived on the block where harlen property was concern about child safety and trepidation about the site proximity to three schools and its location alongside one of the most dangerous crosswalks in the village of mineola.the board members also noted that a convenience store could attract children from the surrounding schools who would congregate there,thereby increasing the risk of an accident.
the hearing was then opened to public comment and a number of community residents voiced their disapproval of the proposed use of the property for a variety of reasons,most prominently traffic density and child safety.some residents also expressed a desire to limit further development,concern regarding the hours of operation and potential clientele,and a fear that convenience stores might attract drug activity and other crimes.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the board voted to deny harlen application.on may,the board filed a formal written decision.the decision cited nine reasons for the denial,including the proximity of the property to a number of local schools,increased traffic,the potential threat to child safety,intrusion on the surrounding residential area and an increased danger to pedestrians generally.after the formal decision was entered,harlen brought this action in district court under alleging that the board had violated its rights to equal protection and substantive due process granted by the united states constitution.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,claiming that there was no material issue of fact in dispute and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.after considering harlen response,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,holding,with respect to harlen equal protection claim,that harlen had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to either whether it was similarly situated to others who had been granted permits or whether the board actions were motivated by animus.it also dismissed harlen substantive due process claim,holding as a matter of law that harlen had no constitutionally protected property interest in the permit sought.harlen timely appealed.we affirm the judgment of the district court.

i.the equal protection claim 
the equal protection clause requires that the government treat all similarly situated people alike.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.although the prototypical equal protection claim involves discrimination against people based on their membership in a vulnerable class,we have long recognized that the equal protection guarantee also extends to individuals who allege no specific class membership but are nonetheless subjected to invidious discrimination at the hands of government officials,leclair saunders,cir.the supreme court recently affirmed the validity of such class of one claims where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam.
harlen does not assert membership in a protected class,rather it claims that the board denial of its application for a special use permit was unconstitutional selective enforcement.we disagree.to prevail on a claim of selective enforcement,plaintiffs in this circuit traditionally have been required to show both that they were treated differently from other similarly situated individuals,and that such differential treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.latrieste rest.cabaret village of port chester,cir quoting leclair,at.because we conclude that harlen claim does not satisfy the second part of this inquiry,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants 
harlen contends that the supreme court decision in olech modified the second part of the leclair analysis by removing the requirement that malice or bad faith be shown in order to state a valid class of one equal protection claim.see olech,at.holding that allegations of irrational and wholly arbitrary government action are sufficient to state an equal protection claim without inquiry into the defendants subjective motivation.indeed,we recently indicated in dicta that this reading of olech is the correct one.jackson burke,cir per curiam noting that proof of subjective ill will is not an essential element of a class of one equal protection claim see also gelb board of elections of new york,cir noting,where plaintiff made no allegation of animus,that claim could survive summary judgment because it may well be that the board engaged in arbitrary,purposeful and intentional discrimination.however,the district court and a number of our sister circuits have read olech differently,holding that it did not remove the requirement that a plaintiff alleging an equal protection violation based on selective enforcement show that the governmental action at issue was motivated by personal animus,hilton city of wheeling,cir,cert.denied,d shipp mcmahon,cir.we need not decide which reading is the correct one in order to resolve this case,as harlen claim fails even if no showing of animus is required.
if we assume arguendo that harlen assessment of olech impact is correct,a class of one plaintiff could survive a summary judgment motion by making one of two showings.he would be required to show either that there was no rational basis for the unequal treatment received,see olech,at,or that the denial of the application was motivated by animus.harlen has done neither.
a zoning board decision can be considered irrational only when the board acts with no legitimate reason for its decision.crowley courville,cir quoting southview,bongartz,cir.the evidence presented by harlen did not meet the requirements for such a showing.both at the public hearing and in its written decision,the board advanced a number of legitimate reasons for denying harlen permit application.
a review of the hearing transcript makes clear that foremost among the board reasons for denial of the permit was the close proximity of harlen property both to area schools and an extremely dangerous crosswalk.protecting the safety of area schoolchildren is a legitimate goal.further,it was not irrational for the board to conclude that a convenience store would attract children from the schools closest to it,thereby increasing the risk of accidents as the children crossed heavily trafficked jericho turnpike.it bears repeating that harlen property was closer to the schools than were any of the convenience stores in the village.that fact alone provided a rational basis for the board different treatment of harlen convenience store permit application.therefore,harlen can not successfully maintain a class of one claim under the standard promulgated in olech.
harlen attacks the rationality of the board decision on primarily two grounds,both of which lack merit.harlen first argument is that the board conclusion had no basis in fact because the findings underlying it were not supported by written studies.from this,harlen extrapolates that the board decision was based solely on what harlen refers to as nimby not in my back yard community opposition to the proposed development and was,therefore,arbitrary and unconstitutional.the record does not support this conclusion.
the board failure to commission a written study prior to denying harlen special use permit does not by itself render its action arbitrary.to hold otherwise would impose severe and unnecessary financial and logistical burdens on local governments,as they would be required to commission written studies to provide cumulative support for facts that are evident to those with knowledge of the local community.the proximity of the three schools to the property was never questioned.basing a decision on personal experience and observations of the surrounding community is not arbitrary as a matter of law.a decision can only be considered arbitrary for federal constitutional purposes where,unlike the one made here,it has no basis in fact 
the members of the board,before opening the meeting to public comment,set forth objections to the proposed development that had a foundation based on concrete and verifiable facts.members of the board noted that harlen property was literally feet away from three schools in the community and that the area was used extensively by children on their way to and from school.again,the record conclusively establishes that harlen property was closer to all three schools than were any of the other convenience stores in the village.in addition,a member characterized the crosswalk adjoining harlen property as the number one worst crossing for children in all of mineola and others expressed their belief that placing a convenience store there would be dangerous.harlen provided no evidence to rebut these assertions,nor did it show that any other convenience stores in the village shared these characteristics.thus,the board had a reasonable basis for its belief that placing a convenience store on harlen property posed unique problems and hazards to the community not posed by other similar stores in the area.
despite the factual support for the board reasoning,harlen contends that the board in fact arbitrarily denied its permit based solely on community opposition.harlen argument is severely weakened by the board setting forth ample support for its decision before entertaining any public comment.its position remained unchanged after the public spoke against granting the application.even if the board action were based solely on community opposition,such action would not be unconstitutionally arbitrary if the opposition is based on legitimate state interests such as,inter alia,traffic,safety,crime,community pride,or noise.midnight sessions,city of philadelphia,cir.the board here apparently denied harlen application primarily for safety and traffic issues.
harlen second argument,which lies at the heart of its equal protection claim,is that the board acted arbitrarily in denying its application because placing a convenience store on the premises would have no greater impact on traffic and child safety than would other uses which are permitted as of right.specifically,harlen contends that the board decision was irrational because there is no evidence that the proposed convenience store would impact child safety and traffic more than a dry cleaner,which is permitted as of right,or a gas shop,which was the prior use of the premises.
we do not believe that it was arbitrary for the board to conclude that children from nearby schools were more likely to walk to a convenience store than to a dry cleaner or a gas station.the conclusion appears reasonable.nor was it irrational for the board to conclude that a convenience store would result in a greater increase in traffic given the nature of the business.in so holding,we are mindful of the general proscription that federal courts should not become zoning boards of appeal to review nonconstitutional land use determinations by the c ircuit many local legislative and administrative agencies.zahra town of southold,cir quoting sullivan town of salem,cir alterations in zahra.harlen argument really addresses the merits of the board decision rather than its constitutionality and is better raised in a state court challenge.local zoning boards,subject to direct oversight by state courts,are in a far better position than are the federal courts to balance the needs of their communities with those of individuals seeking development.see sullivan,at.
even if the district court was correct in holding that olech had no significant effect on the standard for selective enforcement cases,harlen claim could still survive a summary judgment motion if it could show that the board decision was motivated by an intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.latrieste,at quoting leclair,at.harlen does not argue that the denial of the special use permit was intended to inhibit or punish the exercise of its constitutional rights.therefore,to prevail,it must show that the board was motivated by a malicious intent to injure it.
harlen advances three bases to support its claim of malicious intent community opposition to the proposed use,mayor colbert participation in the board consideration of the application while residing on the same street as harlen property,and reasons given by the board in its formal decision not mentioned in the board informal decision.although the issue of whether an action was motivated by malice generally is a question of fact properly left to the jury,we will uphold a grant of summary judgment where the nonmoving party adduces nothing more than speculation to support its cla
