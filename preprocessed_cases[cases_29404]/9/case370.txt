we must decide whether the district court erred in issuing a preliminary injunction against proceedings pending before the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad on the ground that federal law preempted state law claims because the district court was required to abstain from deciding the preemption issue under the doctrine of younger harris,d.we conclude that where,as here,the preemption determination would require the district court to resolve a novel question of law,preemption is not facially conclusive,and,under such circumstances,the district court was required to abstain from deciding the preemption issue.we therefore reverse the preliminary injunction and remand to the district court with directions to dismiss or stay the action so that mcad may decide the preemption question in the first instance 
background 
appellant carolyn calderon was previously employed by appellee umass memorial health care,umass.as an employee,she received printed materials from umass describing various disability benefits for which she was eligible.one such benefit was an optional disability std insurance program available to employees expected to work at least twenty hours per week.under the program,the employee paid the premium and could choose between policies offered by two companies,one of which was appellee colonial life accident insurance company colonial.neither umass description of benefits nor colonial policy contained any reference to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,although the description included a section describing an employee right to appeal a denial of benefits,which umass and colonial now characterize as the employee rights under erisa.
calderon selected and purchased the std coverage from colonial.colonial std policy contained a provision excluding coverage for psychiatric or psychological condition s including but not limited to affective conditions,neuroses,anxiety,stress and adjustment reactions.when calderon later submitted a claim for std benefits due to major depressive disorder,panic disorder,and grief reaction,colonial denied benefits pursuant to this exclusion.
calderon then filed a charge of discrimination with mcad.the charge alleged that,by providing std benefits to persons with physical,but not mental,disabilities,umass and colonial violated state law,specifically,massachusetts general laws ch.and,and,as well as the americans with disabilities act ada,et.mcad notified umass and colonial of the charge and requested that each submit a written position statement.
in response,umass and colonial filed this action,seeking a declaratory judgment that calderon state law claims were preempted by erisa and injunctive relief barring further investigation by mcad umass and colonial also moved for a preliminary injunction.
mcad and calderon filed to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under the younger abstention doctrine.they argued that preemption could not be facially conclusive here,for two reasons.first,they argued that calderon state law claims were not subject to erisa preemption because they also constituted federal discrimination claims under the ada.because the first circuit has never addressed whether the ada prohibits discrimination between mental disabilities and physical disabilities in the provision of std benefits,calderon and mcad argued that this constituted a question of first impression thus,that preemption could not be facially conclusive.second,they argued that a factual dispute existed as to whether the std plan at issue actually qualified as an employee benefits plan under erisa,and that the existence of such a dispute required abstention under younger,or,at a minimum,a factual determination by the district court.
the district court rejected both arguments and declined to abstain.it reasoned that,although the younger criteria for abstention were met,it was facially conclusive that erisa preempted the mcad investigation with regard to calderon state claims.in order to reach this conclusion,the district court first conducted its own analysis of whether calderon discrimination claims could succeed under the ada,and thus survive preemption.it concluded that the ada would not apply to calderon claims and,thus,they were preempted by erisa.
the district court further concluded that no factual determination regarding the plan erisa status was necessary,reasoning that factual inquiry into the erisa status of plaintiff plan is collateral to the issue presented here,and need not be conducted in federal court.the district court explained 
at this stage of the proceedings,in deciding a motion for preliminary injunction,the court finds only that the portion of the mcad investigation applying state law to a plan covered by erisa is preempted.if further factual investigation before the mcad,or future discovery in this action,reveals that the plan at issue here is in fact not covered by erisa,the preliminary injunction will be modified accordingly.
accordingly,the district court denied mcad and calderon motions to dismiss and enjoined mcad investigation of calderon charge pendente lite.this timely appeal followed.

as a matter of comity,federal courts are required to abstain from enjoining ongoing state court proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.younger,at.addressing state criminal prosecutions new orleans pub,city of new orleans nopsi,d extending younger to civil proceedings.ordinarily,the younger question of abstention must be decided before decision on the merits of the underlying claim.local union,usw massachusetts,cir citing hicks miranda,d.
under younger,a federal court must abstain if there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding involving the federal plaintiff that implicates important state interests and provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to assert his federal claims.id.at.citing middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.
the district court found that the three criteria for abstention under younger were met here,and we agree.the parties do not dispute two of the criteria,namely,that a state judicial proceeding was pending before mcad,and that those proceedings provided an adequate opportunity to raise the federal questions at issue.under the remaining criterion,colonial and umass argue that the state proceedings do not implicate important state interests.we unlawful employment discrimination is a sufficiently important state interest to warrant abstention.see ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d.
because the three criteria of younger are satisfied,abstention would be required unless an exception applies.see local union,at.the district court concluded it did not need to abstain because preemption was facially conclusive,and we now turn to consideration of whether that exception was in fact applicable here.
